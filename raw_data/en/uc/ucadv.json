Autumn 2019 saw us refresh our Trust Strategy which will guide our activity until 2023. Our strategy can be summarised under four key priority areas (see also page 4 below). We will embrace our role as a District General Hospital, delivering the best quality, safest care to our local population - focussing on the key clinical priorities of emergency medicine, elective care, cancer and mortality. We will do this strongly and quickly to improve our patients' experience. Secondly, we will take a leading role in the development of Place -based services, adopting a system -wide view in developing and delivering new models of care. Thirdly, we will listen to and engage with our staff to create a culture of true partnership. And finally, Transform our services and enable our progress by focussing on our key enablers - ICT, our estate and workforce. Our staff made a major contribution to the development of the strategy through our 'Shaping our Future' engagement sessions and we are committed to continue these listening exercises as we deliver our plans for the future. Our teams were clear on what the areas of focus should be, and we listened. Whilst developments in service provision and further increases in activity are clearly most notable, our stewardship of public funding is also an important focus. So I am very pleased to re port that we achieved our Financial Control Total which ensured that we were able to access ce ntral funding through the Financ ial Recovery Fund to end the year in a break -even position overall for the first time in a decade. This is an excellent achievemen t, given our position in recent years and one which was also testimony to the very close working relationships we have developed within the local healthcare system. The 201 9/20 year also saw us develop and strengthen our Foundation Group with South Warwick shire NHS Foundation Trust and Wye Valley NHS Trust. This has started to produce tangible benefits including a group -wide, agreed approach to improvement. The Quality Service Improvement and Redesign process provides a 'toolkit' of methods that helps creat e a consistent approach to empower staff to make changes to support care delivery, efficiencies or productivity. We have also developed a joint approach to developing our leaders' skills. We want to develop a leadership culture that encourages people to in novate, try new ideas and learn from mistakes. Wherever possible we want to encourage our leaders to take an inclusive approach, allowing staff to develop solutions. These initiatives, coupled with developments in shared IT strategy and procurement collab oration, shows that the Foundation Group arrangement is delivering results for each individual organisation. The Covid -19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic had a huge impact on the Trust in spring 2020. We want to thank our staff for their amazing work over this peri od in planning and delivering great care to our local population. It was also humbling to see the affection and respect that our community showed towards George Eliot Hospital and its staff during this challenging time. The donations we received made a big difference to our staff and patients and the memory of the weekly tributes paid to the NHS will stay with us all for the rest of our lives. 4 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 As we move to restore our services, it's important that we realise that there will be a 'new normal' for our organ isation and services. Many of the innovations we made in reaction to the pandemic will stay with us - helping us plan positively for the future and working more closely with our health and care partners. The sadness we feel for the families and friends who lost a loved one is overwhelming. But the learning and changes that came from the pandemic offer a source of light for the future as we emerge from the darkness of the outbreak. Our thanks again go to our dedicated staff and the supportive communities of Nuneaton, Bedworth and South W est Leicestershire. Russell Hardy Glen Burley Chairman Chief Executive 5 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Coventry & Warwickshire Health & Care Partnership Former Chief Executive of The King's Fund Professor Sir Chris Ham continues his role as Independent Chair of the Partnership. Chris brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to Coventry and Warwickshire and will continue to play an important role as we look to integrate services more closely across our health and care system. The new NHS Long Term Plan, launched in January 2019, gives us an opportunity to review our local plan to consider the additional funding the NHS will receive over the next five years. We expect a revised version of our local plan to be published later this year. To ensure our plan meets the needs of local people we have engaged with those who know health and care services the best - patients, staff and the public. We sought their view s on how to improve health and care and how we can best use our combined resources. This includes working closely with our local authorities, and with local voluntary and community groups.

We also believe that exceptional care can be delivered by striving to reach a number of strategy objectives : Our core value pledges are: Effective open communication EXcellence and safety in everything we do Challenge but support Expect respect and dignity Local health that inspires confidence. Our strategic objectives are to: Constantly deliver safe , high quality care Enhance patient experience by providing local care tailored to the individual needs of the patient Develo p partnership arrangements to promote and deliver a comprehensive range of value for money integrated services , to protect and improve the health of the local community Empower, develop and support our staff to encourage positive leadership at every level Maintain financial stability, hit all agreed targets and satisfy our regulators. Going concern statement In accordance with international accounting standards, management is required to assess whether it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. There are no plans for the dissolution of the Trust and it is anticipated that services will continue to be provided in the future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis. In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors has considered the Trust's overall financial position and expectations of future financial support. The Trust received deficit support loan funding of \u00a33.7m during 2019/20, all of which was repaid in year in line with the plan. In addition, loan funding amounting to \u00a313.3m was drawn down in advance of P ublic Sustainability Fund (PSF) /Financial Recovery Fund (FRF) . The Trust has delivered the control total for the year and has receive d the remaining PSF/FRF in May 2020 The usual planning process has been suspended by NHS Improvement due to the pandemic and is expected to be re visited later in the year. The impact of this is that the Trust is not required to agree contracts in advance of the financial year and is not expected to commence delivery of savings plans. NHS Improvement has introduced temporary arrangements for the f irst four months of 2020/21 to reduce the burden on the NHS whilst managing the impact of the pandemic. This will include fixed monthly payments and additional funding to address both on -going expenditure and the exceptional costs of the pandemic. The te mporary arrangements will provide cash in advance in order to facilitate prompt payment of suppliers, with retrospective claims to be made for exceptional costs incurred. The arrangement will be in place at least until July and the Trust Board has approv ed an annual budget based on the temporary funding arrangements to ensure that appropriate financial governance continues. Whilst on -going arrangements have not yet been definitively announced, NHS England and NHS Improvement have made a statement availab le which confirms that a Government mandate has been provided to NHS England for the continued provision of health services in England. Clinical Commissioning Groups have been given funding allocations which include sufficient funding for the remainder of 2020/21. Trusts are therefore advised to continue to expect funding to flow at similar levels to that previously provided where services are reasonably still expected to be commissioned. 10 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Emergency preparedness , resilience and r esponse The Trust has a vital role in responding to major and business continuity incidents. As a Category 1 responder under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 the Trust has a duty to be prepared and ensure planning arrangements are in place to enable the effective and efficient prevention, reduction, control, mitigation of, and response to emergencies. These emergencies can range from major incidents, such a serious road traffic accident s involving multiple casualties, to business continuity following a cyber -attack. The Trust's major and business continuity incident planning arrangements are regularly reviewed and tested to ensure they are in - line with legislation and best practice. As such, in partnership with other local health resilience groups, the Trust can ensure there is a robust multi -agency response to any future incident. As part of NHS England annual core standard s assurance process the Trust has been rated as 'substantial' for 2019 NHSI has also announced a funding restructure, with the intention that outstanding revenue and capital loans will be converted to Public Dividend Capital in September 2020. Any Department of Health and Social Care loan principal or interest payments due after 31 March 2020 will not need to be made and the loan balance at that date of \u00a391.4m will be converted. This will have a significant cash benefit to the Trust. In addition, future cash requirements will be met in the form of Public Dividend Capital rather than through loan funding. The Trust will be required to pa y a dividend on this capital funding, with the current rate of 3.5% being subject to further review during 2020/21. The Trust will work closely with NHSI to ensure that forecast cash requirements are reviewed in a timely manner and that any issues are hig hlighted so these can be resolved. The Trust is also working with the other organisations in the Coventry and Warwickshire Sustainability and Transformation Partnership to address the issues of financial sustainability across the wider local health econom y in the medium to long -term. Due to the impacts of covid -19 and the revised financial framework currently only covering the period to the end of July 2020 there is an increased level of uncertainty. However, during the last six years, NHSI has supported the Trust's with cash support and the Government has confirmed that financial support will continue to be provided to fund services and maintain financial stability in the health sector including payments to suppliers. The Trust Board therefore anticipates that NHSI will continue to support the Trust's requirement for cash support. Given the on -going level of support received from NHSI, the directors expect that the Trust will have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the going concern basis has been adopted for preparing the accounts. 11 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Highlights of the Year Hospital receives award for outstanding work experience provision In April the Trust applied for Silver Work Experience Standard accreditation, and was pleased to be told that they had exceeded expectations to achieve Gold, demonstrating the Trust recognises the value of high -quality work experience and employability pro vision, and strives to ra ise achievement among learners. Theatre practitioner recognised at prestigious healthcare awards Theatre Operating Departme nt Practitioner , Fiona Deeley was given the accolade of Rising Star at the 2019 Advancing Healthcare Awards ceremony. She was nominated by Theatre Manager, Paula Quinn for always ensuring, and enhancing, patient safety within the theatres department by introducing a new way of recording patients' temperatures before, during and after operations, as well as i ntroducing new equipment within the hospital. Respiratory care team scoops national award Our respiratory care team were named Respiratory Team of the Year as part of the annual 2019 Association of Respiratory Nurse Specialists conference .

HSDU (Hospital Sterilisation and Decontamination) Going for Good The Trust's decontamination unit passed an internationally recognised standard with near -perfect marks. HSDU, provides deconta mination services and reusable instrument cleansing in the hospital, as well as to dental and medical centres across Warwickshire, was successful in attaining BS EN ISO 13485 with only one minor non -conformance. It followed 12 months of work by the HSDU team, who continued to provide their high levels of service during the process, and a rigorous, two-day inspection by auditors who highlighted how impressed they were with the staff's knowledge, how efficient the team are and how swiftly they dealt with requests. Serenity Garden project When taking up her role as Mayor of Nuneaton and Bedworth in May, June Tandy announced that the Serenity Garden would be her sole charity as part of her role as civic Mayor for 2019/20 . When complete the garden will be a rehabilitation space for stroke and dementia patients, and a sanctuary for patients to spend time with their carers' and families. The Trust is immensely grateful for this generous boost to the fundraising campaign. Breas t care nurse Annette celebrates 45 years at the Trust Nurse Annette Tracey celebrated 45 years at the Hospital in May, including 33 years within its busy breast care unit. Annette is the longest serving member of the breast care team providing breast care support to people before, during and aft er their treatment , or operation . Her role provides general advice and specialist support and is an invaluable part of the team of consultants, nurses, breast care assistants and radiologists. Excellence rating in education following successful quality review A sense of family, positive teaching culture and investment in people and facilities made provisions at the hospital for undergraduate medical students stand out in an educational quality assurance visit in July . 12 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 The Medical Education Department at the Trust hosted an educational quality assurance visit from Warwick Medical School in May, with the visiting team highly commending the culture of education and enthusiasm they saw. The visit was a great success and highlighted the open, supportive and friendly culture across all disciplines, a willingness to address issues, put robust systems and processes in place and the integration of education. Nursing staff shortlisted for two prestigious awards The Infection Prevention team and End of Life Facilitator, Audrey Coakley were shortlisted for a Nursing Times award. The Infection Prevention and Control team were nominated for their work on improving patient hand hygiene before meals and how this could stop the spread of infections. End of Life Care Facilitator, Audrey Coakley, was shortlisted for the Nurse of the Year award for her work within Palliative Care always ensuring patients, staff and their loved ones are supported during their end of life ca re. Highly c ommended at patient safety awards Work to reduce and prevent hypothermia in new-born babies led the Trust to receive a Highly Commended award at the 2019 national HSJ patient safety awards. The Keeping Babies Warm campaign launched in spring 2018 has since seen a significan t drop in babies being admitted to the neonatal unit at the Hospital because they weren't warm enough, during the first few hours after birth. Local team win s national excellence award A partnership of hospitals, hospices and volunteers across Coventry and Warwickshire that supports people a ffected by Parkinson's disease w as recognised with a national award. Coventry and Warwickshire's Parkinson's Multi -Disciplinary Team were honoured with the UK Parkinson's Excellence Network Trophy in recognition of the outstanding partnership working that has been developed between local health services. This local partnership initiative increased the number of people and carers affected by Parkinson's attending local hospices for respite care. They were recognised for providing a gold standard quality service for their multi -disciplinary team approach to comprehensive patient care. New strategy sets the future direction for the Trust A new strategy emphasizing the importance of working with other health and care partners in the North Warwickshire area while maintaining focus on key hospital services that serve local people was launched during September . The new strategy agreed by th e hospita l's Trust Board followed a listening exercise with staff who had the opportunity to attend a series of events , run by our Chief Executive Glen Burley and Managing Director David Eltringham , to give their views. Our Wellbeing reading group involved in 2019 Booker Prize competition The staff reading group set up in the spring of 2019 were one of 12 across the country to be involved in the 2019 Booker Prize. The group, set up as part of the NHS Trust's support for the 2019 Coventry and Warwickshire Year of Wellbeing, were asked to read and discuss prize contender Girl, Woman, Other1 by Bernardine Evaristo. Members of the fledging group had to share an overview of their discussion with the organisers through the Reading Agency. 1 Girl, Women Other became joint first winner of the Booker Prize 2019 alongside Margaret Attwood's Secret to a Handmaid's Tale 13 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Celebrations for birthday of author who inspired the hospital's name The hospital , named George Eliot after the pen name of Mary Ann Evans who grew up nearby, hosted a range of events to celebrate the Victorian novelist's bicentenary. Nuneaton -born Eliot wrote eight novels, which are mostly set in provincial England and known for their realism and psychological insight. She used a male pen name because she believed it would ensure that her works would be taken seriously. After the birth of the h ospital, several wards were named after characters from Eliot's books - including Bob Jakin, Felix Holt, Dorothea, Romola, Mary Garth, Adam Bede and Solomon Macey. George Eliot's partner, George Henr y Lewes, was also recognised through the naming of the organ isation's Lewes House building. The Cheverel Wing is named after George Eliot's name for nearby Arbury Hall. Traineeship success The Trust supported four trainees who successfully undertook a brand new education and training programme at the hospital. Traineeships offer valuable work experience for those looking to get an apprenticeship or full time work. The Traineeships were 8 weeks long a nd involved a combination of work placements in the hospital as well as classroom based support with broadening skills such as budget managing, CV writing, interview skills and IT training. Following the traineeships w ork placements were offered within th e Stores, Estates and Post Room teams giving each trainee a valuable insight into working within a busy hospital. Right first time The Trust got a special mention in the NHS Getting it Right First Time good practice handbook for its specialist nurse phone service for post -op support, which helps avoid unnecessary re - admissions and A & E attendance. New homebirth bags for community midwives Communi ty midwives received new homebirth bags to support mums -to-be that choose to give birth to their baby at home rather than in a hospital environment. The bags, supplied by Baby Lifeline, were kindly purchased by the hospital's League of Friends Charity and will replace the current homebirth bags with standardised equipment following a project from Baby Lifeline. The new bags and their contents were put together following a survey with midwives and with the support from an expert panel of multi -disciplinary professionals they develop ed a standardised equipment bag to deliver safe and effective care. The bag includes everything from scissors to cut the cord, to a hat and towels to dry and warm the new born baby, as well as equipment for emergencies that, although rare, can occur. Healt h Care Assistant, T racey Tyler, scoops national \"GE M\" award One of our HCAs from Alexandra Ward earned national recognition with a prestigious award from a leading NHS temporary staff provider, NHS Professionals (NHSP). Tracey Tyler, who works night shifts on the ward, was selected from 500 nominees across England to receive their \"Going the Extra Mile\" (GE M) Award. Nominated by nurses who work with her, Tracey took the initiative to improve nutrition on the ward by doing nightly tea and snack rounds to enc ourage wound healing, all helping to greatly improve patient care and experience. Celebrating her award, our Nursing Director, Daljit Athwal, said: \"Tracey has excellent communication skills and is an exceptionally caring and friendly member of the ward te am. She 14 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 upholds our Trust values and her colleagues praise her as a fantastic person to work alongside. Well done to Tracey and thank you to our partners at NHS Professionals for recognising her contribution.\" Maternity unit rated one of the best national ly for patient satisfaction Patient satisfaction at the hospital's maternity unit was ranked the second highest of the 63 surveyed by the Picker Institute. The 2019 National Maternity Patient Satisfaction Survey, which was carried out by Picker on behalf of the Care Quality Commission in 63 acute trusts between April and August, reported the findings. Areas of celebration are: 97% of those surveyed said they were treated with respect and dignity 99% had confidence and trust in staff (during labour and birth) 96% involved enough in decisions about their care (during labour and birth). The feedback concluded that a core strength of the Trust's maternity service is that mums can receive support or advice about feeding their baby during evenings, nights or weekends. The results also highlighted significant improvements in some areas for the Trust's maternity services both in comparison to other organisations surveyed by Picker Institute and in comparison to the Trust's results last year. Key areas of improve ments include mums feel they are not left alone when worried and partners felt they were able to stay as long as they wanted. Daljit Athwal, George Eliot Hospital's Director of Nursing, said: \"I am thrilled and very proud to see these incredible results. T hey reflect the dedication of our maternity staff to drive forward changes and improvements to provide the best care to local families and mums -to-be. I am especially pleased to see the areas we have improved on since the last survey. Well done to the Mate rnity Team.\" QSIR Success supports service improvement in the hospital Clinical Audit & Effectiveness Nurse, Libby Holland is the first Quality, Service improvement and Redesign (QSIR) Teaching Faculty Associate at the h ospital - meaning she is now qualifi ed to teach the QSIR Practitioner Programme and use her improvement knowledge to train her colleagues. QSIR is an accredited, nationally recognised programme which is being used to increase improvement capability and capacity within the NHS by teaching val uable service improvement skills to both clinical and non -clinical staff. Twenty Five staff from across the Trust are also being trained as practitioners through local delivery with another twelve staff receiving training from the national team. QSIR provi des a framework to hang a project from and focuses on using data to inform improvement, based on small tests of change. The training provides a consistent and sustainable approach, and an opportunity to develop skills and gain accreditation in improvement methodology. This is already giving staff within our Foundation Group the skills to make quality / service improvements and enhance the care and safety of patients in the hospital and local community. 15 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Operational Performance Overview For 2019/20, following a series of workshops with senior colleagues in the organisation the Trust's operational structure changed, the divisional level was removed as the staff felt there were too many management layers in the organisation and teams found it difficult to access the Executive team. Our aim remains to instil accountability from 'Ward to Board' level offering assurance that we are delivering against key performance indicators, monitoring at grass roots level and where necessary, we are able t o develop credible plans where targets were not being met. Our operational performance was reported through the directorate structure. The Executive team held a monthly Integrated Quality and Performance Meeting with the directorates with the aim of holdin g teams to account for delivery of quality, performance, workforce and financial standards. Where necessary, the directorates would produce actions to improve performance and these would feed into the performance meetings that the executive team regularly hold. These operational governance arrangements also fed into the production of the monthly Integrated Performance Report, which was presented by exception to the Finance and Performance Committee and then through to Board level. Throughout the year we al so monitor our performance against a core set of national and local performance indicators, where we endeavour to meet the standard set. It should be noted that many performance indicators were met or many were higher than the expected range set, however there are some that have not been achieved. The following table (Figure 1.0 ) shows our results for the 2019/20 period and where the standard has not be en met a brief explanation i s given at the end of the table. Figure 1.0 : Outcome against of set performan ce standards Performance indicator Standard 2019/20 Safety: C Difficile infections 2 13 23 MRSA bacteraemia infections 0 0 Quality: Cancer - two weeks suspected 93% 95.40% Cancer - two weeks symptomatic breast 93% 95.15 % Cancer - 31 days 96% 100% Cancer - 31 days - drug 98% 100% Cancer - 31 days - surgery 94% 100% 2 C-difficile infections: The implication of this reporting change on the Trust has resulted in an increase in the number of C -Diff cases reported to the PHE. Of the 23 mandatory reportable cases against the threshold 13: 11 cases have been reviewed by the CCG of which 8 confirmed cases were defined as avoidable. (NB I have added this bit for use) --- Since the on -set of the pandemic and the pressures all health care organisations find themselves in, there remains 12 cases still requiring review with our CCG partners. All cases that are classed as u navoidable are discussed through Trust Infection Prevention Assurance Committee where lessons learnt and actions to improved are shared with the senior nursing teams for dissemination across the Trust. 16 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Performance indicator Standard 2019/20 Cancer - 62 days3 85% 79.68 % Cancer - 62 days from screening service4 90% 91.89 % Patients seen in A&E <4 hours5 95% 75.90 % Patients who leave A&E without being seen 5% 1.87% Time to initial assessment in A&E in minutes (95th percentile) <15 2 Time to treatment in A&E in minutes (median time) <60 39 mins Readmission within 28 days following time on ward7 90% 77.64 Patient experience: Referral to -emergency pathway (92nd percentile)8 92% 72.30% Patients offered an appointment to Genito -Urinary Medicine (GUM) Clinic within 48 hours 95% 95.68 % Patients seen in GUM Clinic - access within 48 hours 95% 95.42 % 3 Cancer - 62 days: There was an o ngoing capacity sho rtfall Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy s (RARPs ) at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire causing delays to treatment for these patients. The Trust also experienced delays in diagnostic testing both internally and externally. A variety of actions were put in place, and will remain in place, to tackle these delays that include urology patients going 'straight to test'; pathway tracker put in post with pathway co -ordinators reviewing all cancer pathways; a pathway review of gynaecology referr als was instigated and underway during March. Any tertiary centre and / or pathology delays are now escalated to the Director of Operation on a weekly basis. 4 Cancer - 62 days from screening service: see 3 above as reflective of the impact on the 62 -days from screening service rates timeline. 5 Patients seen in A&E <4hours: Underperformance is as a result of both capacity and flow constraints in the Trust, particularly where discha rges occur late in the day . Ongoing actions to improve the standard took place and included: The introduction of a new unit specifically aimed at same day emergency care (SDEC). The unit receives patients from the emergency department (ED) then administers treat and discharge takes place on the same day Greater focus from directorate managers on length of stay and actions to be completed to increase pace of discharges Further work continues to focus on processes within ED 6 Readmission within 28 days following discharge: see 8 below, as reflective of the impact on the Trust's readmission rates within the 28 -day timeline. 7 Stroke - time on ward: This was mainly due to poor flow of activity throughout the T rust and an increase in length of stay with non-stroke patients on the dedicated stroke ward . Action to improve th e use of the dedicated assessment room for strokes only and work to support the transfer of non -strokes to other wards in a timely manner was also being undertaken. 8 Referral to Treatment (RTT) incomplete non -emergency pathway (92nd percentile): Over the year this was due to the pressure of b eds not being available due to emergency pressures in the organization. A rise in backlog peaked during March which was mainly due to patients cancelling their routine treatment and the trust cancelling routine activi ty whilst preparing for the COVID 19 impact and ensuring capacity was available. An action plan has been developed with key work taking place prioritising the following: Those patients with the longest waits to date for Trauma and Orthopaedics and Gynaecol ogy were outsourced to BMI and South Warwick Hospital Foundation Trust for their operations. A project team has been set up, and work on site has commenced to deliver a 30 bedded modular ward to target and improve waiting lists going forward. 17 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Performance indicator Standard 2019/20 Percentage of patients whose operations were cancelled for non - clinical reasons on the day of admission 0.80% 1.43% Mixed sex accommodation 0 0 Patient safety Never Events9 0 2 Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment where all inpatient service users undergo a risk assessment for VTE10 95% 92.11 % Performance management framework Throughout the year using a balanced scorecard approach, set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are reflective of the Care Quality Commission's five key themes to assess care services[1] and the NHS Oversight Framework are used to support the performance management framework. Detailed performance reports are reviewed at the Trust's Quality Assurance Committee and the Finance and Performance Committee each month, with the Integ rated Performance Report then being presented at Board level. Any identified risks that may impact on the achievement of key standards, are evaluated using our corporate risk assessment process, then, where appropriate, included in the Trust risk register and managed closely thereafter through established risk management processes. Local contract targets and standards, including progress against the 2019/20 Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) schemes are determined by our commissioners and moni tored throughout the year at regular meetings with our CCG partners. 9 Never Event s: One was a side f emoral block that had been given to the wrong side and two was where a patient was connected to medical air rather than Oxygen . Full investigations took place that identified no harm came to either patient. Action plans were developed to prevent the reoccurrence of such incident s and compliance of the action plan is being monitored at local directorate governance meetings. 10 Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment where all inpatient service users undergo a risk assessment for VTE: A vast amount of work was undertaken over the year to improve the process for assessing VTE in inpatients attending the Trust . An action plan was developed by the VTE a ssessment steering group and improve ments include: a review and re launch of the Trust's VTE policy the introduction of an e -version of the updated VTE assessment form training of all clinical staff on using the above on a dedicated portal the actual time the Trust record s VTE assessments is incorporated into the e -version scrutiny of clinicians at each step of the process; with alerts and triggers when a VTE assessment is due completion of each part of the process takes place before being able to move on to the next stage compliance rates of the VTE assessments is shared with all ward areas During the latter part of the year compliance rates were slightly improved with the aim that o nce the above actions are fully embedded within the organisation they will improve further t owards meeting this target [1] Safe : you are protected from abuse and avoidable harm. Effective : your care, treatment and support achieves good outcomes, helps you to maintain quality of life.

Key financial performance information The following summary of financial performance during 2019/20 is drawn from the Annual Accounts which can be found on page 58 below. The Department of Health and Social Care assesses the Trust's performan ce against the following four targets, all of which have been achieved. 1. Income and Expenditure : As a minimum the Trust is required to b reak even each year. In 2019/20 the Trust achieved the breakeven target. 2. Capital Cost Absorption Rate : Within its overall expenditure, the Trust is required to pay the Department of Health and Social Care a sum equivalent to 3.5per cent of average net relevant assets. This payment is known as the Public Dividend Capital (PDC) dividend payment. We were not require d to pay any dividend in 2019/20 due to the Trust's negative average net relevant assets position. 3. External Financing Limit : This refers to the agreed amount of cash that the Trust is allowed by the Department of Health and Social Care to consume over and above the amount it generates through its normal activities in year. This may be through a reduction in its own cash balance s or receiving cash from external sources. The Trust is expected to stay below its External Financing Limit (EFL) and in 2019/20 it achieved this, spending \u00a316.2m (2018/19 \u00a313.4m) against a target of \u00a316.2m (2018/19 \u00a313.7m). 4. Capital Resource Limit : This i s a limit which is imposed by the Department of Health and Social Care on the level of capital expenditure that we can incur in the year. The Trust should maintain its' spend at or below this level. We spent \u00a37.6 m (2018/19 \u00a34.9m) against a limit of \u00a37.7m (2018/19 \u00a34.9m, see note 50 to the accounts). Valuation of Trust Land and Buildings : The value of the Trust's land and buildings has been assessed by an in dependent professional valuer. It is based on an alternative site Modern Equivalent Asset (MEA) valuation, undertaken specifically in accordance with the HM Treasury guidance which states that such valuations are an option if the Trust's service requirements can be met from the alternative site, or smaller area on the same site. The last valuation w as undertaken on this basis on 1 April 2016. The value of the Trust's land and buildings each year is then subject to revaluation through a desk top exercise including a review of expenditure on buildings during the year. Other key financial information includes the following: 33,382 invoices were paid during the year, of which 20,605 were paid within 30 days of receipt of goods or a valid invoice (whichever is the later). The Trust is required to pay 95% of invoices within 30 days, but did not achieve this due to the on -going deficit position during the year. Against a turnover of \u00a3181.3m, the Trust delivered a break -even position in year with the cumulative position ther efore remaining at loss of \u00a371.7 m. 19 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 The accounts for the Trust were produced in line with the 2019/20 Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM).

Scope of responsibility As Accountabl e Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Trust Accountable Officer Memorandum. 2. The Purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an on -going process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal cont rol has been in place in the Trust for the year ended 31 March 2020 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. 3. Capacity to handle risk The Board has established the following governance arrangements for risk management: Chief Executive : As Accountable Officer, takes Board -level responsibility for governance, including risk management, and has overall responsibility for maintaining an effective risk management system and for meeting all statutory requirements. Executive director s and clinical directors have delegated responsibility for governance and risk management arrangements within their areas of control. Board of Directors : The Trust Board and Chief Executive ensure that the risk management arrangements are implemented, moni tored and reviewed, and meet all legal and regulatory requirements. The Board receives reports from the Audit Committee, the Finance and Performance Committee and the Quality Assurance Committee on the Trust's risk control measures. Audit Committee : monito rs the effectiveness of the risk management arrangements (operational, non -clinical and financial) on the Board's behalf. Finance and Performance Committee : a subcommittee of the Board of Directors and meets on a monthly basis. The committee had responsib ility for monitoring both financial and operational performance. This includes the management of financial and workforce risks to ensure targets are met. Quality Assurance Committee : a subcommittee of the Board of Directors. It has responsibility for manag ing, mitigating and monitoring risks in relation to quality and safety. Workforce Development Committee : The Workforce Development Committee was a sub - committee of the Trust Board until 7 May 2019 when the Board agreed to stand down the Committee with imme diate effect. Until the Committee was disbanded, it provided leadership, oversight and assurance on strategic aspects of the Trust's workforce, including aspects of planning, development and education related needs, as well as organisational development, capacity and culture. It also monitored plans to mitigate risks in relation to the Trust's workforce. The Committee's business was transferred into the Quality Assurance Committee and Finance and Performance Committee. Information Governance Group : The Tru st has an established Information Governance Group, with responsibility for overseeing day -to-day information governance issues, developing and maintaining policies, standards, procedures and guidance, and reviewing 30 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 related issues and risks, reporting to t he Trust Management Board. The Medical Director, the Trust's Caldicott Guardian, supported by the Information Governance Manager, is responsible for the establishment of policies for the control and appropriate sharing of patient information with other age ncies. The Finance Director is the appointed Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) and chairs the group. Executive risk committee : This Committee was established in May 2019 and is responsible for ensuring that the Risk Management Strategy is implemented ef fectively and that there are core processes in place to manage risks across the organisation. 4. The risk and control framework The Trust has adopted an integrated framework for risk management supported by policies and procedures. This framework maps the key risks to the Trust's principal and strategic objectives, and to Care Quality Commission (CQC) outcomes, where applicable. These are referenced to the risk register to ensure the potential risks that threaten the achievement of the Trust's objectives ar e identified. The framework also highlights the existing control measures and assurances in place. The Risk Management Strategy is approved by the Board and reviewed annually. The strategy identifies the flow of risks from Board to ward and vice versa. It is published widely and includes: the aims and objectives for risk management in the Trust; the relationship between the relevant committees and their responsibilities; the role of key individuals with responsibility for advising on and co -ordinating ri sk management activities; risk appetite; a description of the processes that the organisation employs in reviewing risk management arrangements and in gaining assurance on risk management; and guidance on what is acceptable risk to the organisation. The strategy defines the risk management process including risk identification, analysis, and evaluation and requires that all hazards are assessed, and risks recorded in a standard format risk register and prioritised using a consistent scoring methodology. Risk appetite is determined by the amount of risk exposure, or potential adverse impact from an event, that the organisation is willing to accept, tolerate, or be exposed to at any point in time. In order to achieve the strategic objectives of the Trust, th e Trust Board considered tolerance levels and thresholds that define acceptable and unacceptable levels of risk. The Risk Management Strategy was reviewed and approved by the Board in July 2019. The strategy clearly states that it is the responsibility of all staff to identify and communicate risk through the line management structure and, ultimately, to the appropriate committee. This responsibility is reinforced through annual statutory update training. Directorates are required to maintain systems and p rocesses that enable them to operate within the Risk Management Strategy. The risk management system is continually reviewed to ensure that robust systems are in place at all levels within the Trust. The risk register is an integral part of the system. Arrangements for validating and managing the treatment of risk are managed at Directorate level. Risks which cannot be managed within Directorate resources are escalated and discussed at the Executive Risk Committee. The Executive Risk Committee (ERC) is an e xecutive board, with responsibility for promoting local responsibility and accountability. It monitors the risk management process across the Trust, and the risk assessment and assurance arrangements within the directorates. To ensure robust risk managemen t processes are adopted across the Trust ERC receives on a rotational basis a report from the Chair of the Directorate Governance Groups highlighting all extreme (20 -25) and high (12 -16) risks on the directorate risk register. 31 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 In addition the ERC reviews a ll risks detailed within the Corporate Risk Register and, on a quarterly basis, reviews the Board Assurance Framework. This enables the Trust to ensure an effective level of internal control, safety and quality. Communication and consultation is undertaken with internal and external stakeholders when appropriate. The Trust has continued to develop communication channels with its partners, and within the Trust. Regular reports are prepared for directorates and divisions, the Quality Assurance Committee and t he Trust Board on the incidents reported, both clinical and non -clinical. All identified risks which involve public stakeholders, including the CQC, clinical commissioning groups and NHSI, have been dealt with in an open and transparent way, using the appr opriate recording mechanisms and communication with the public. The Trust involves stakeholders by informing and consulting on the management of any significant risks. Stakeholder involvement is sought through: monthly public Board meetings and information provided on the Trust's website (www.geh.nhs.uk ); a wide range of communication and consultation mechanisms which already exist with relevant stakeholders, both internal and external; consultation on appropriate policy documents - stakeholders have the opportunity to comment on the risk elements; and the Community Engagement Group's role has changed during this year to ensure that members are responsive to current stakeholder engagement needs, have the right conta cts, commitment and capacity to fulfil their roles and are able to actively respond to an increased level of stakeholder engagement. The panel members have no statutory o r legal powers, but act as an important link to the hospital membership and the wider community. There is a fully established Internal Audit programme approved by the Audit Committee in the Internal Audit Work Plan, and the Audit Committee receives report s which provide assurance of the Trust's key internal control objectives. The Internal Auditor presents an Annual Audit Opinion to inform those charged with governance on the overall level of assurance for the system of internal control. Internal Audit rec ommendations are tracked in a system to record action taken and completed. The Trust ha s an established counter fraud service, provided by a Local Counter Fraud Specialist (LCFS). In addition to investigation work, the LCFS also carries out an agreed amount of proactive work at the Trust, which includes fraud awareness presentations and work shops, review of Trust policies and procedures to identify the key areas of fraud risk, and production of newsletters and articles to inform staff of local and national counter fraud work and investigations. The LCFS regularly attends the Audit Committee m eetings and reports back to both the Director of Finance and Performance and the Audit Committee on any proactive or reactive work undertaken at the Trust. Please refer to page 38 below for information on work completed in 2019/20. Control measures are in place to ensure that all of the Trust's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Trust has an Equality and Diversity Forum, sponsored by a non -executive director and chaired by the Director of Human Resource s. Its purpose is to promote equality of opportunity, treatment, dignity and respect for all patients, staff and members of the communities that the Trust serves. The group advises and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, committees and other groups on equality and diversity matters, compliance with statutory and other requirements and areas for improvement. The Trust policy on the development of policies ensures that all Trust policies must be equality impact assessed before seeking approval f rom the Board. The Workforce Development Committee was a Board sub -committee, chaired by a non -executive director, until 7 May 2019 at which point it was determined that the work of the committee could be more appropriately be transacted through the Qualit y Assurance Committee (QAC) and Finance and Performance Committee (F&P). The Workforce Development Committee and latterly the reports into QAC and F&P provide a method for leadership, oversight and assurance of the Trust's 32 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 strategic workforce approaches. This reporting enabled Trust Board to take assurance on the effectiveness of the human resources activity being undertaken to provide high quality, safe and effective patient care, which included staff experience, workforce planning, resourcing, employee relations education, learning and organisational development. Trust Boards are required to oversee workforce issues and understand the detail of any risk to safe high quality care. Through the QAC and F&P committees the Trust has received assurance on nurse staffing level reporting, which is well developed following National Quality Board (NQB) 2016 guidance. Nurse reporting includes monthly reports on safe staffing, which includes recruitment and retention as well as 6 monthly reporting on acuity revie ws. Assurance on medical staff deployment has been achieved through bi -annual reporting on medical workforce numbers, monthly reporting on temporary staffing usage, Guardian of Safe Working quarterly reports, Job planning updates quarterly and Appraisal a nd Revalidation reports. The Trust continues to support work across the Foundation Group to assess any gaps against the 2018 \"Developing workforce safeguards\" and take appropriate action to respond to and address the gaps. As an employer with staff entit led to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the scheme's regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and paym ents in to the scheme are in accordance with the scheme's rules, and that the scheme's member records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. The Trust has undertaken risk assessments and has a sustainable deve lopment management plan in place which takes account of UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18). The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with. Following previous investment to install a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, the Trust has continued to reduce consumption of electricity year on year. In addition to the CHP project, the Trust has also invested replacing the existing lighting with more energy efficient LED lighting. Development of the building management system is on -going and the software upgrade will further improve the Trust's plant and equipment emissions and energy efficiencies. The Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. Following the latest CQC inspection in December 2019, the CQC issued the Trust with three regulatory actions. Whilst a number of improvements had been noted, the CQC's overall rating of the Trust remained the same as the previous inspection: Requires Improvement . Actions have been implemented to both address the areas highlighted by the CQC and ensure continuous improvement where the CQC identified good practice. The Trust has an overall improvement plan which is formally monitored on a monthly basis by Directorate Teams and the Trust Board. The Trust has an on -going internal CQC self -assessment process, which con tinues to undertake unannounced inspection visits to areas, wards and departments. This provides the Trust Board with on -going assurance on compliance or highlights areas of non -compliance and ensures action plans are completed to address any concerns or i ssues raised. This is monitored through the Quality Assurance Committee. The Trust operates a Serious Incident Requiring Investigation (SIRI) system where incidents are recorded and investigated, and action is taken to prevent similar incidents in the fut ure. Serious incidents and Never Events (should they occur) are investigated and reported to the Quality Assurance Committee and discussed and signed off by the Medical Director at a monthly Serious Incident Group. They are also reported to the Board of Di rectors private session on a monthly basis and to the public session on a quarterly basis. Risk assessment The Trust has adopted an approach to risk management with the structures and processes in place to successfully deliver the risk management objective s. Leadership arrangements are defined within the Trust and are supported by job descriptions and objectives. 33 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Leadership has been further embedded at Directorate level, where managers have responsibility for risk identification, assessment and analysis. A ll staff are required to complete mandatory and essential update training, which covers risk management, risk assessments and health and safety training. All new members of staff are required to attend a mandatory induction (supplemented by local induction ), which covers all key elements of risk management, including Freedom to Speak Up. The Trust has a Board Assurance Framework (BAF) that is part of the regular performance reporting and management arrangements, both to the Board and its sub -committees. The BAF provides a comprehensive framework for the management of the principal risks to delivering the Trust's strategic objectives, as identified in the 10 -point plan. The framework examines the system of internal control and records the actions to be taken to address gaps in control and/or assurance. During 2018/19 the Board undertook a complete refresh of the BAF, to ensure it was much more aligned to the Trust's Strategy, the 10 -point plan. This refresh involved an externally facilitated Board workshop, f ollowed by one -to-one sessions with each of the Executive Directors to define the controls and assurances to each of the risk areas. During 2019/20 the process and format of the BAF was revised. The new quarterly review process ensures the Executive Dire ctors undertake a review of their risks prior to submission to the appropriate Board Sub -Committee for scrutiny of their respective elements. Comments are then captured in the BAF before submission to the Executive Risk Committee for challenge and overall review of the BAF. Once the comments from the Executive Risk Committee have been captured, the BAF is locked down and submitted to Trust Board on a quarterly basis. The Audit Committee considers the assurance on the process being in place and live. Dur ing 2019/20 an audit of the BAF and Risk Management processes was undertaken and the findings and actions will be taken forward during 2020/21. The framework identified areas where the control framework needed improvement and two 'red' risks were identifie d. Action plans were put in place to mitigate the risks and to make improvements to controls. These were routinely reported to the Quality Assurance Committee, and Finance and Performance Committee which included: delivery of long and short terms financial plans; and patient flow within urgent care not being managed effectively which impacts on patient care and experience. Delivery of the 2019 -20 financial target was prioritised with a number of recovery actions being identified and progressed. The plan fo r 2020 -21 is dependent upon the delivery of a savings programme, which will be delivered using a transformational approach to changing processes. In addition, the Trust is working with the STP to agree joint plans which will improve the financial sustaina bility across the local healthcare region. The arrangements to improve patient flow within urgent care has been closely monitored throughout the year by the local delivery board and included in relevant improvement plans. The Trust has invested in opening an Ambulatory Care Unit to address some of the flow issues. Delivery of the long term financial sustainability continues to be a significant risk for the Trust. There has been enhanced controls around expenditure including temporary staffing and discreti onary spend. Also restructuring and strengthening of the financial function. The risk has been implemented as a joint Project Management Office (PMO) and a mid -year aligned incentive contract to be agreed with Warwickshire North Clinical Commissioning Gr oup (WNCCG) that builds on the 2019/20 contract. Each action plan is owned by an executive director and they are held to account for progress at the respective Board sub -committee and Audit Committee. The Trust has also undertaken work in the year in order to prepare for the exit from the EU. DHSC has produced EU Exit Operational Guidance which outlines the actions that providers and commissioners of health and social care services should take to prepare for, and manage the risks. In addition, regional te ams coordinate and provide guidance, followed by auditing, to ensure compliance. The Trust has carried out impact assessments on the risks of access to skilled staff 34 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 and identified a low risk. A review of consumables has been undertaken and identified a small number of products where the Trust should hold additional supplies to manage this risk. National arrangements are in place to ensure the continuation of drugs supplies. Although this event did not occur in year, the risk continues to be monitored t hrough the corporate risk management process and action will be taken as necessary. The Trust identified the risk of Covid -19 as the potential impact became more apparent in the latter stages of the year. The detailed risk register is currently being revi ewed to ensure that all key risks are recorded together with the actions that have been put into place to manage these risks. Early in March the Trust actioned the established major incident procedure and business continuity plans to manage the initial ou tbreak followed by the introduction of a command structure which operates at three levels. The Gold command level is a daily meeting of directors with responsibility for oversight, decisions required at executive level and interacting with the wider regio nal healthcare system to ensure a co -ordinated response. Silver and bronze meetings take place at a tactical and operational level throughout each day, providing a forum for issues to be escalated quickly and for decisions to be made appropriately. Key is sues considered include staff cover, the availability of personal protective equipment and the requirement for additional items, as well as the capacity management of patients in the hospital and the level of oxygen supplies. Whilst being introduced at pa ce, this structure has worked effectively. The Board is satisfied that the Trust has plans in place which aim to comply with existing targets where ever possible and where performance does not meet the target the Trust has plans to recover this position as quickly as possible without compromising patient safety. The Board also has a commitment to comply with all known targets going forward. The Board will ensure that the Trust operates effectively at all times. This includes maintaining its register of int erests, ensuring that there are no material conflicts of interest in the Trust Board, and that all Board positions are filled, or plans are in place to fill any vacancies. The Board is satisfied that all Board members have the appropriate qualifications, e xperience and skills to discharge their functions effectively, including setting strategy, monitoring and managing performance and risks, and ensuring management capacity and capability. All Board members complete a 'Fit and Proper persons' declaration ann ually. In addition to the Board Members Register of Interests, the Trust has also sought updated declarations of interests (including nil returns) from all decision -making staff, as per its Managing Conflicts of Interests Policy. The Trust has published on its website an up -to-date register of interests, including gifts and hospitality, for decision -making staff within the past twelve months, as required by the 'Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS' guidance. 5. Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources The Trust has a number of processes in place to ensure that resources are used economically, efficiently and effectively. The Trust has an established process for budget setting, monit oring and reporting. A new finance and procurement system has also been implemented, which went live in February 2020. Internal Audit has reviewed the financial systems during the year with a focus on receivables, payables and payroll. Recommendations were made to update procedures and to improve processes relating to changes in supplier details, debt write -offs, starters, leavers and salary overpayments. A number of improvements have been made and will be embedded over the coming months. In addition, the Board reviews the scheme of delegation annually to ensure it is appropriate for the on -going management of resources. NHSI undertook a 'Use of Resources' assessment at the Trust on 12 February 2020 and the report with the final conclusion has not yet been received. In 2019/20, the Tr ust planned to breakeven, which was in -line with the control total agreed with NHSI. This included receiving \u00a315.7m from the Provider Sustainability Fund (PSF), and the Financial Recovery Fund (FRF) conditional upon the Trust achieving financial targets. T he original plan excluding PSF and FRF income has been achieved in year. The Trust has therefore achieved 35 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 the financial performance target required to earn the PSF/ FRF income. However, the Trust remains in cumulative deficit and does not yet have a fina ncial recovery plan in place. The Trust did not meet the efficiency savings target o f \u00a38.3m in year, delivering \u00a35.1 m of savings. A draft financial plan for 2020/21 was prepared and submitted to NHSI in March. However, the NHSI planning process has been suspended in order to focus on management of the pandemic. The Trust has prepared an interim budget based on the funding guidance during this period, which has been approved by the Trust Board. This plan assumes that funding will be provided to cover expenditure during the period, including the exceptional costs of the pandemic, in line with NHSI guidance. The annual plan will be revisited later in the year when it is anticipated that the recovery phase will commence and further guidance will become avai lable. In recent years, External Auditors have been required to issue an annual Section 30 letter to the Secretary of State for Health because the Trust has not met its statutory duty to break even over a five year period. Although the Trust has achieved b reakeven for 2020/21, the cumulative deficit over this period means that a letter will be required to inform the Secretary of State that the Trust is in breach of its statutory break -even duty for the five years ended 31 March 2020. The External Auditors a re required to carry out audit work to establish whether proper arrangements are in place for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of its resources. External Audit will then report on any significant risks to achieving this and areas w here proper arrangements cannot be evidenced. 6. Information Governance George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust achieved compliance with the Data Security and Protection Toolkit for 2018/19. This was achieved by submitting evidence for all mandatory assertions in September 2019. Due to the current COVID -19 crisis the deadline for submission of the 2019/20 has been extended to September 2020. The Trusts current status is \"Standards Met\". The Trust reported two incidents to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) dur ing the year. For the first incident the ICO found that the Trust had taken appropriate steps to prevent harm to the data subject and prevent further incidents. The ICO required no further action from the Trust. The second incident remains under investigat ion by the ICO and at the time that this report was completed, the Trust was cooperating with their investigation. The Trust has not had any enforcement notices or undertakings from the ICO within the financial year. 7. Data quality and governance The Trust h as an established process for managing the elective waiting list including a weekly Patient Tracking List meeting with directorates. In support of this, operational validation and management of active pathways is undertaken by the Trust's Pathway Tracker team. Additionally, the Data Quality team have a comprehensive suite of reports available to enable them to identify themes and patterns of poor operational processes for correction and also to provide validation of admitted care stop -clocks each month. The Data Quality team undertake regular audit on all elements of the elective waiting list pathways, any discrepancies are investigated and highlighted to the relevant directorate for action. Training needs are identified and supported by the Data Quality t eam. 8. Review of the effectiveness As Accountable Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the Internal Audi tors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the information provided in this Annual Report and other perf ormance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the External Auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of 36 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the Board, the Audit Committee and Quality Assurance Committee, and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Trust Board r eviews its governance arrangements every year. This included review of the Trust's Standing Orders and Standing Financial Instructions, which contain the scheme of delegation (reporting to Board in April 2020). The use of the Trust's seal and Register of Interests is also reviewed as well as updates of relevant Bo ard sub -committee Terms of Reference. In 2018, the Trust commissioned a developmental review from NHS Improvement on the function and structure of its Board Sub -Committees, which included a desk -top review of three months past papers and related documents and the observation of one Committee meeting. The output reports from this review were used to improve and develop the Board Sub -Committees throughout 2018/19 and 2019/20. Board reporting The Board meets monthly throughout the year in public and private. A performance report is received each month with performance overviews provided by the director responsible for performance in each area and the risks reviewed. During 2019, the Board changed the delegated responsibility for approving any changes to Trust policies from the Trust Management Board to the Policy Review Group. The Policy Review Group will be chaired by the Managing Director and the first monthly meeting was scheduled to be held in April 2020. However, this has been deferred due to current ope rational challenges and will commence as soon as possible. The Group will review, amend and approve changes to Trust policies with a summary report to the next Board meeting. It receives updates from the chair of each Board sub -committee following individu al committee meetings highlighting the key points discussed and any issues which require escalation. This includes a report from the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Board reviews and approves the terms of reference for each committee on a regular basis a nd receives a formal Annual Report and effectiveness review from the Audit Committee. As part of the national NHS response to the Covid -19 outbreak, the Chief Operating Officer at NHS England and NHS Improvement sent a letter to all NHS Providers and Commissioners on 28 March 2020. This provided guidance to support organisations to free -up management capacity and resources as much as possible, to prioritise what is necessary to manage the response to the Covid -19 pandemic. The Trust's Chairman and Ch ief Executive Officer also produced a protocol for the continuation of Board and Board Committee business to be used across the Foundation Group. In accordance with the guidance, the Trust Board and Board Committee's agendas and reports were streamlined fo r the meetings in April and May 2020 to ensure they focussed on key business and the meetings were held virtually. Consideration will be given nearer the time as to whether this would also be appropriate for the meetings in June 2020 depending on the Covi d-19 position. To help demonstrate good governance, a report is being submitted to Trust Board on 5 May 2020 with a list of Trust Board reports that have not met the scheduled submission, in accordance with the Schedule of Business due to the impact of Co vid-19, with the revised date of submission for the Board's information. Board effectiveness The Board has a process in place to regularly review the effectiveness with which it operates. Governance arrangements are also subject to review by Internal Audit annually. In the past 12 months, Internal Audit reviews have included the data security and protection toolkit which is an advisory audit reviewing the robustness of the evidence to support self -assessment against assertions and information governance sta ndards.; Statutory and mandatory training (substantial assurance) and a review of arrangements for reporting and acting on serious incidents (substantial assurance). An audit of the Board Assurance Framework (BAF) was undertaken in March 2020 and the find ings and actions are being worked through for implementation during 2020/21. 37 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 The Board has been assured that there are robust mechanisms to ensure that the evidence to support compliance is in place and available, and is routinely monitored and reported upon within the Trust's governance and performance management framework. Internal controls review process The process that has been applied to maintain and review the effectiveness of the system of internal control was as follows: The Trust's Audit Committ ee approved an annual Internal Audit programme and received all Internal Audit reports. The Committee, with the support of the Quality Assurance Committee, reviewed the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of integrated governance, risk management and internal control across the whole organisation's activities (both clinical and non - clinical), that supported the achievement of the organisation's objectives. In 2019/20, the Committee submitted an Annual Report on the previous 12 months to the Trust Board which highlighted the work of the Committee with regard to the final accounts, risk management and the Board Assurance Framework and progress made on improving the system of internal control. The report concluded a successful and effective yea r. The Committee reviewed its own effectiveness in accordance with the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) Handbook for NHS Audit Committees and reviewed its Terms of Reference. The Quality Assurance Committee, on behalf of the Board of Dire ctors and Chief Executive, reviewed the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of risk management across the whole Trust's activities (both clinical and non -clinical) that supports the achievement of the Trust's objectives with regard to qual ity. The effectiveness of the Committee will be reviewed as part of the annual process and its work plan has been reviewed as part of a streamlining process to reduce duplication and ensure the Committee focuses on key areas. The Quality Assurance Committe e receives quarterly reports from the Clinical Audit and Effectiveness team and monitors the Trust's participation in local and national clinical audit and national confidential enquiries, Directorates receive a quarterly report from the Clinical Audit Department as part of a directorate governance meeting highlighting audit progression, audit findings and issues. This enables the directorate management team oversight and ownership of their audit programme. The Internal Audit's review of the organisation's overall arrangements for gaining assurance has concluded that: \"The organisation has an adequate and effective framework for risk management, governance and internal control. However, our work has identified further enhancements to the framework of risk management, governance and internal control to ensure that it remains adequate and effective\". The work performed by Internal Audit during 2019/20 has been driven by a robust planning process, which included a focus on particular areas of potential weakness identified by the Trust. Internal Audit reviews have been completed to plan and the recommendations made have been accepted and are being actioned by the Trust. There are three areas where only partial assurance has been given - nursing documentation follo w up review, financial management and budgetary control and discharge management. In addition partial assurance was given to specific areas within the reviews of medical staffing employment checks (for completion of statutory and mandatory training) and k ey financial controls (in respect of payroll specifically the management of overpayments, retention of vacancy approval forms and exception reporting). Management have been fully engaged in making improvements to these areas to address the weaknesses iden tified, with action updates being reported to each Audit Committee meeting. However, progress has been delayed in some areas as the Trust focusses on the operational challenges of the next few months. During this period, individual actions are being revi ewed by the executive directors to confirm their applicability and to agree realistic timescales for completion of recommendations where applicable. 38 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 With regard to counter fraud and corruption arrangements during 2019/20, there have been five new refer rals and four referrals were brought forward from the prior year. Five have been concluded, three are pending closure and one remains on going. The potential financial value of the referrals was not material to the overall finances of the Trust. The Loc al Counter Fraud Specialist (LCFS) has supported the Trust to ensure that investigations are carried out promptly and efficiently. In addition, the LCFS has continued to carry out proactive work at the Trust in line with NHS Counter Frau d Authority Standar ds, to prevent, detect and deter fraud and bribery within the NHS and to also raise awareness of the role of th e counter fraud specialist within the Trust and the NHS as a whole. The self -assessment of compliance with the NHS Counter Fraud Authority Standards rated the Trust as green. Other work has included a comprehensive fraud risk assessment; full review of pre -employment, procurement and invoice processes; and training of around 475 new members of staff. Furthermore, the heightened risk of fraud arising from the pandemic has been highlighted and communicated throughout the Trust , with specific examples and advice being given to areas as these risks emerge . This proactive work has helped to establish an effecti ve anti -fraud and anti -bribery cu lture and zero tolerance approach within the Trust that is fully supported by the Board of Directors. Learning from incidents The Trust seeks to learn from incidents to develop good practice. Incidents are discussed in a number of forums, including the Pat ient Experience Group, Serious Incident Group, individual clinical and non -clinical governance meetings and at Board sub -committee and Board level. During the past 12 months, the Trust has recorded 45 serious incidents, which is a 10 per cent decrease from 2018/19 presented at the Serious Incident Group. The Trust also reported 3Never Events. The largest single trend was falls with 17 reported which is comparable to the 18 reported in 2018/19. Each incident has been inve stigated using Root Cause Analysis (R CA) and actions put in place to reduce the likelihood of re -occurrence. A monthly falls group has also been established. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) and NHS Resolution (NHSR) consider trusts who are high reporters of incidents to have a better and a more effective safety culture. In 2019/20, a total of 7349 incidents were reported, which shows a decrease of 3% on the previous year. To promote incident reporting, the governance team are working closely with the Directorates to improve incident reportin g, identify learning points and provide feedback to staff. To ensure lessons are learnt and shared, all RCA reports are discussed at the Serious Incident Group (SIG) meeting. This multi -disciplinary group, chaired by the Medical Director, is well -versed in providing challenge in a supportive environment. The group meets once per month and reports into the Quality Assurance Committee. To supplement the SIG meetings, additional table top meetings take place with the multidisciplinary team involved in the pati ents care. They are pro - active meetings that enable timely learning to be shared across the organisation and to establish a root cause of the incident. The Trust has proactively implemented a Pressure Ulcer Serious Incident Group and Falls Group to allow t he sharing of learning and implementation of actions Trust -wide to reduce and prevent pressure ulcer prevalence and reduction of incidence of falls. The function of the groups is to review all SIRI reports to ensure a comprehensive investigation has been u ndertaken; ensure lessons learnt have been identified and shared within the Trust. The groups also monitor implementation of action plans developed to minimise the risk of reoccurrence. This is then fed back to directorate governance meetings and to ward o r departmental monthly meetings to ensure that lessons learnt are shared across the Trust. Examples of shared learning from incidents include: An elderly patient was admitted to the Trust following a fall at home that resulted in a fractured neck of femur. Whilst awaiting surgery the patient's condition deteriorated with evidence of reduced urine output and an acute kidney injury. The patient con tinued to deteriorate and, despite attempted resuscitation, sadly died. The investigation highlighted that there was a failure to recognise a deteriorating patient and action the appropriate plan of care in a timely manner. Throughout the investigation it was evident that there was both 39 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Glen Bu rley Chief Executive 12th June 2020 poor written and verbal communication between the teams to manage the patient effectively. Learning has been implemented to address the issues identified including review of the neck of femur pathway to include management of patient within the Emergency Department, reinforcement of a structured handover process to be implemented for communicating escalation and embedding the use of safety huddles within the ward team to identify concerns or issues. Audit and spot checks of re cords are now in place to continue to drive improvement in documentation of care. An elderly patient with a history of lung disease attended the Emergency Department following a fall at home where she sustained a fractured neck of femur. She was transferre d to the Clinical Decision Unit initially and then to Elizabeth Ward where she received Non - Invasive Ventilation, oxygen and nebuliser medication in order to treat her breathing difficulties and maintain her oxygen saturations at 95%. The patient was taken to theatre for surgery to repair her fractured neck of femur; however, when the patient was transferred back following surgery her oxygen was mistakenly attached to the medical air outlet instead of the oxygen. This was identified and rectified immediatel y and changed to oxygen therapy. No harm was identified as a result of medical air initially being attached. The investigation identified that all actions from the previous never event had been implemented and staff on Elizabeth Ward were able to articula te these. Post-surgical patients would not normally return to Elizabeth Ward (a respiratory ward) but would return to a surgical ward or Intensive Therapy Unit for their recovery. The patient was on regular nebulisers four times a day so it was appropriat e that she was returned to the respiratory ward and that the medical a ir outlet was in situ in her bed space. Conclusion I am pleased to report that, based on the opinion of Internal Audit; the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust has an adequate and effective framework for internal control that supports the achievement of its policies, aims and objectives with no significant internal control issues identified. Appropriate arrangements are in place for discharge of the Trust's statutory functions. These ensure t hat any potential issues are highlighted to the Board and that the Trust is legally compliant with its statutory responsibilities. 40 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Remuneration and Staff Report Directors' Statement Directors of the Trust have confirmed that they know of no information which would be relevant to the auditors for the purposes of their audit report, and of which the auditors are not aware, and they have taken all the steps required to ensure that they have made themselves awa re of any such information and to establish that the auditors are aware of it. Pay multiples Reporting bodies are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid director in their organisation and the median remuneration of the organisation's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest paid director in the Trust during 2019/20 was \u00a3155,000 - \u00a3160,000 (2018/19: \u00a3155,000 -\u00a3160,000). This was 6.5 times (2018/19: 6.6 times) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a324,214 (2018/19: \u00a323,951). The small change in the multiple year -on-year is due to the increase in median pay, following the annual pay award. There has been no change in th e highest paid director and their associated salary banding. In both years this was the Medical Director. The median pay has increased slightly due to the annual pay award only, with there being no change to the pay banding used to calculate the median. In 2019/20, no employees (2018/19: none) received remuneration in excess of the highest paid director. Total remuneration includes salary, non -consolidated performance -related pay and benefits in kind. It does not include employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. Directors' Remuneration The following tables (at Figures 2.0/2.1/2.2 ) show the remuneration and pension benefits of the directors during the financial year and the prior year. This information is subject to audit. 41 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Figure 2.0: Salaries and Allowances 2019/20 Note 1.

Consultancy We incurred expenditure on consultancy of \u00a30.4m during the year. The largest element of this arose from the establishment of arrangements to manage savings opportunities in conjunction with the Service Improvement Team.

PSF and FRF are non -recurrent income from NHS England which we can only access if we achieve the agreed financial performance targets. The plan included PSF/ FRF of \u00a315.7m and the Trust will receive the full amount based on achievement of the financial target. By comparison, in 2018/19 we reported a deficit for the year of \u00a312.8m, whic h was a favourable variance of \u00a31.5m against the plan of \u00a314.3m. This included non -recurrent PSF income from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) of \u00a35.6m. We received cash support from the DHSC amounting to \u00a315.3m, in advance of PSF/FRF funding being received, which is dependent upon achieving our financial performance targets. These loans are due to be repaid once the Trust's reported financial position has been verified and FRF/PSF income is received. The cumulative deficit started at \u00a38.1m at the end of 2005/06 but reduced to \u00a32.0m by 2012/13. With deficits in the following six years, this has increased to \u00a371.9m in 2018/19 and remained the same in 2019/20. Healthcare income The Trust has contracts to deliver healthcare services which are co mmissioned by Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), NHS England (through specialist hubs and local teams) and local authorities. In 2019/20 we received 68 per cent of our healthcare income from Warwickshire North CCG. In total, 89 per cent of healthcare i ncome came from CCGs, a further 10 per cent from NHS England, which included the Prescribed Services, and one per cent from local authorities. The following chart (Figure 2.20 ) shows the income: Figure 2.20: Patient care income CCGs NHS England Local Authority52 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Expenditure Pay expenditure increased by eleven per cent in 2019/20 when compared with the previous year, amounting to an increase of \u00a312.1m. Of this \u00a34.2m is the notional cost of an increase to the employer pension contribution percentage, from 14.38% to 20.68%. Al though the increased cost has been centrally funded by DHSC during the year, the Trust has included the notional cost and the notional income offsetting this, within the accounts. Excluding this, the increase was seven per cent, or \u00a37.9m. We had an incr ease in permanent medical staff spend due to continued investment in clinical staffing. We also have vacancies which were filled with temporary medical staff, increasing the medical staff costs overall by \u00a32.9m. Nursing and health care assistant (HCA) cost s have increased by \u00a31.9m. Other pay expenditure has increased by \u00a33.1m. The increase in pay costs includes a pay award for non -medical staff of 3.4%, for medical staff of 2.5% and is also driven by an increase in staff numbers of 2%. This increase include s temporary staff recruited to ensure that the hospital can treat the higher levels of patients attending hospital during the winter period, where demand increased again compared with the prior year. In addition we have addressed skills mix issues particu larly in our Accident and Emergency department. This is illust rated in the charts at Figure 2.21 below: Figure 2.21: Pay expenditure analysis Non-pay expenditure increased by one per cent compared with the prior year. The Trust received a benefit from a reduction in the cost of 'insurance' premiums paid to NHS Resolution. However, this was offset by increased costs driven by services purchased from other NHS trusts, as well as an increase in premises related costs. Cash flow The cash balance was \u00a31.0m a t 31 March 2020, in line with the plan, which is the minimum cash balance that the Department of Health and Social Care requires the Trust to hold. 53 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 We applied to the Department of Health and Social Care for cash support to finance the revenue deficit. During the year this was provided as monthly loans, with interest charged at 1.5 per cent. Each loan was due to become repayable at the end of a three -year term. Total funding of \u00a315.3m was received during the year. In addition, capital loan funding of \u00a30. 8m was carried forward from 2018/19, to use in 2019/20. This loan has a term of 10 years and interest is charged at 0.97 per cent. The Trust was also allocated capital loan funding of \u00a32.6m to finance capital investment during the year. This loan also ha s a term of 10 years and interest is charged at 0.68%. Subsequent to these loans being drawn down, the Trust has been informed that all DHSC revenue and capital loans will be converted to Public Dividend Capital based on the balance at 1 April 2020. Altho ugh the loans are therefore now shown as current liabilities in the Balance Sheet, the Trust will not be required to repay any further loan principal or interest after 31st March 2020. The following chart (Figure 2.22 ) shows the cash balance throughout the year: Figure 2.22: Cash profile to March 2019 We have experienced fluctuations in cash balances during the year due to the timing of cash flows particularly related to loan drawdowns and the receipt of non -recurrent income. Prompt Payment Code We are a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code, which sets standards for payment practice. Measured by value, the Trust paid 58.9 per cent of non -NHS invoices within target (82.6 per cent last year) and 65.0 per cent of NHS invoices within target (compared with 47. 4 per cent last year). The following chart (Figure 2.23 below) shows overall performance for the year based on the number Cash plan Actual cash balance54 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Figure 2.23: Prompt payment code Performance has deteriorated compared with the prior year, with a consistently lower performance over the year due to the Trust's deficit cash position. The temporary improvement in January was due to clearance of those invoices which were ready to pay be fore transitioning to the new finance and procurement system. The Trust remains below target but expects this to improve as the temporary funding arrangements (which have been put into place for the NHS during the pandemic period) will provide cash in adv ance to assist with prompt payments over the first four months of the financial year. Better Payment Practice Code (BPPC) The Better Payment Practice Code ( Figure 2.24) requires NHS bodies to aim to pay all valid invoices by the due date or within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice, whichever is later. Figure 2.24: BPPC measure of compliance 2019/20 compared to 2018/19 We allowed a two -day buffer period for paymen ts in transit when calculating the number of invoices paid on time. 0.0%10.0%20.0%30.0%40.0%50.0%60.0%70.0%80.0%90.0%100.0% Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb MarPrompt Payment Code Target 32,398 55,367 34,743 58,066 Total 32,622 28,273 47,976 Percentage of 81.4% 82.6% NHS payables Total the year 984 9,695 1,102 8,385 Total NHS trade invoices paid within target 407 6,306 567 3,971 Percentage of NHS trade invoices paid within target 41.4% 65.0% 51.5% 47.4%55 | GEH Annual Report and Accounts 2019/20 Staff numbers Figure 2.25: Staff numbers The table above (at Figure 2.25) shows the total average whole time equivalent staff numbers, compared with the previous year. Overall, there has been a two per cent increase in the average number of whole time equivalents in 2019/20 from the previous year. This compares with a seven per cent increase in staff costs. There has been continued investment in nursing, medical and clin ical support staff. Capital expenditure This year, \u00a37.7m was dedicated to capital expenditure. This was funded from internally generated funds of \u00a33.7m, together with external financing of \u00a33.9m and donations from the hospital's charity of \u00a30.1m. Expendit ure on the estate in 2019/20 included the relocation and significant expansion of the Trust's Ambulatory Care Unit and creation of a 'Same Day Emergency Care' centre to improve the flow of patients previously presenting at Accident and Emergency (\u00a31.1m). We have also commenced preparatory work to install an additional 30 bed modular capacity, with \u00a31.1m being spent in 2019/20. The ward is expected to be complete and ready to use in August. Other expenditure included replacing medical equipment (\u00a32.2m), i nformation management and technology (\u00a31.7m) and improving infrastructure (\u00a31.6m). The following chart (at Figure 2.26) shows capital investment in 2019/20 compared to previous years. The expenditure in 2019/20 continues to address the low level of investm ent in previous years caused by uncertainty about the Trust's service delivery model, whilst being limited by the national availability of cash for capital investment particularly in the last three years.

The transfer of \u00a332k between reserves represents the elimination of the additional depreciation charge arising in the accounts due to some of the non current assets being shown at valuation rather than being held at historic cost. Page 3George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 Information on reserves Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. Additional PDC may also be issued to trusts by the Department of Health and Social Care. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, is payable to the Department of Health as the public dividend capital dividend. Revaluation reserve Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential. Financial assets reserve This reserve comprises changes in the fair value of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. When these instruments are derecognised, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised as other comprehensive income or expenditure are recycled to income or expenditure, unless the assets are equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income as a result of irrevocable election at recognition. Income and expenditure reserve The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the trust.

Notes to the Accounts Accounting policies and other information 1.1 Basis of preparation The Department of Health and Social Care has directed that the financial statements of the Trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2019/20 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. 1.1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.1.2 Going concern In accordance with international accounting policies, management are required to assess whether it is appropriate to prepare the accounts on a going concern basis. There are no plans for the dissolution of the Trust and it is anticipated that services will continue to be provided in the future. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis. In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors has considered the Trust's overall financial position and expectations of future financial support. The Trust received deficit support loan funding of \u00a33.7m during 2019/20, all of which was repaid in year in line with the plan. In addition, loan funding amounting to \u00a313.3m was drawn down in advance of PSF/FRF. The Trust has delivered the control total for the year and has received the remaining PSF/FRF in May 2020. The usual planning process hasbeen suspended byNHS Improvement duetothepandemic payments andadditional on-going cash inadvance inorder tofacilitate prompt payment of suppliers, with retrospective claims to be made for exceptional costs incurred. Thearrangement willbeinplace atleast until July andtheTrust Board hasapproved anannual budget based onthe temporary funding arrangements toensure that appropriate financial governance continues. Whilst on-going arrangements have notyetbeen definitively announced, NHS England andNHS Improvement have made astatement available which confirms thataGovernment mandate hasbeen provided toNHS England forthecontinued provision of health services inEngland. Clinical Commissioning Groups have been given funding allocations which include sufficient funding fortheremainder of2020/21. Trusts aretherefore advised tocontinue toexpect funding toflowatsimilar levels to that previously provided where services are reasonably still expected to be commissioned. NHSI hasalso announced afunding restructure, with theintention 2020. AnyDepartment andSocial future cash requirements willbemetinthe form ofPublic Dividend Capital rather than through loan funding. The Trust willberequired topayadividend onthis capital funding, TheTrust NHSI toensure that forecast cash requirements arereviewed inatimely manner and that any issues are highlighted so these can be resolved. The Trust isalso working with theother organisations intheCoventry and Warwickshire Partnership offinancial sustainability across thewider local health economy inthe medium to long-term. Page 6George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.1.2 Going concern (continued) Due totheimpacts ofCovid-19 andtherevised financial framework currently only covering theperiod level ofuncertainty. tofund services and maintain financial stability inthehealth sector including payments tosuppliers. The Trust Board therefore anticipates that NHSI willcontinue tosupport theTrust's requirement concern basis hasbeen adopted forpreparing the accounts. 1.2 Interests in other entities Charitable Funds Under the provisions of IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, those charitable funds that fall under common control within NHS bodies are consolidated within the entity's financial statements. In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, restated prior period accounts are presented where the adoption of the new policy has a material impact. As the value of George Eliot's Charitable Funds do not have a material impact, they have not been consolidated. 1.3 Revenue 1.3.1 Revenue from contracts with customers Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for under IFRS 15. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). 1.3.2 Revenue from NHS contracts The main source of revenue for the Trust is contracts with commissioners in respect of health care services. Revenue in respect of services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised services to the customer, and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allocated to that performance obligation. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where a patient care spell is incomplete at the year end, revenue relating to the partially complete spell is accrued in the same manner as other revenue. Where income is received for a specific performance obligation that is to be satisfied in the following yer, that income is deferred. The method adopted to assess progress towards the complete satisfaction of a performance obligation is to match income against the expenditure incurred. 1.3.3 NHS injury cost recovery scheme The Trust receives income under the NHS injury cost recovery scheme, designed to reclaim the cost of treating injured individuals to whom personal injury compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises the income when performance obligations are satisfied. In practical terms this means that treatment has been given, it receives notification from the Department of Work and Pension's Compensation Recovery Unit, has completed the NHS2 form and confirmed there are no discrepancies with the treatment. The income is measured at the agreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less an allowance for unsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts in line with IFRS 9 requirements of measuring expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. 1.3.4 Provider sustainability fund (PSF) and Financial recovery fund (FRF) The PSF and FRF enable providers to earn income linked to the achievement of financial controls and performance targets. Income earned from the funds is accounted for as variable consideration. 1.3.5 Other forms of income Grants and donations Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. Where the grants is used to fund capital expenditure, it is credited to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income once conditions attached to the grant have been met. Donations are treated in the same way as government grants. Page 7George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.4 Expenditure on employee benefits 1.4.1 Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment-related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry-forward leave into the following period. The Trust's annual; leave policy requires leave to be used in year. 1.4.2 Pension costs NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Both schemes are unfunded, defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, general practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in England and Wales. The scheme is not designed in a way that would enable employers to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as though it is a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the trust is taken as equal to the employer's pension contributions payable to the scheme for the accounting period. The contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the scheme except where the retirement is due to ill-health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. 1.5 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 1.6 Discontinued operations The Trust does not have any operations which have been discontinued during the year. 1.7 Property, plant and equipment 1.7.1 Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust it is expected to be used for more than one financial year the cost of the item can be measured reliably the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000, collectively, a number of items have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have similar disposal dates and are under single managerial control, or items form part of the initial equipping and setting-up cost of a new building, ward or unit, irrespective of their individual or collective cost. Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly different asset lives, e.g., plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful economic lives. Page 8George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.7 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 1.7.1 Recognition (continued) Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. 1.7.2 Measurement Valuation All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Assets are measured subsequently at valuation. Assets which are held for their service potential and are in use (i.e. operational assets used to deliver either front line services or back office functions) are measured at their current value in existing use. Assets that were most recently held for their service potential but are surplus with no plan to bring them back into use are measured at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. Land and buildings used for the Trust's services or for administrative purposes are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at their revalued amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any impairment. Revaluations of property, plant and equipment are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying values are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Current values in existing use are determined as follows: - Land and non-specialised buildings - market value for existing use - Specialised buildings - depreciated replacement cost as indexed on 31 March 20 using indices supplied by the valuer, Avison Young (UK) Limited. Previously all land and buildings were restated to fair value using professional valuations in accordance with IAS 16 every five years. This has now been changed to update the valuation at 31 March each year. An update was undertaken at 31 March 2020. Valuations are carried out by professionally qualified valuers in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Manual. The property valuations are carried out primarily on the basis of Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) for specialised operational property (e.g., NHS patient treatment facilities) and Existing Use Value (EUV) for non-specialised operational property. The value of land for existing use purposes is assessed at EUV. For non-operational land including surplus land, the valuations are carried out at Market Value. HM Treasury has adopted a standard approach to depreciated replacement cost valuations based on modern equivalent assets and, where it would meet the location requirements of the service being provided, an alternative site can be valued. The Trust's land and building valuation was carried out by the Trust's current valuer Avison Young, on a MEA \"Optimised Alternative Site\" method valuation, and applied on 31 March 2020. The valuation has been undertaken having regard to IFRS as applied to the UK public sector and in accordance with HM Treasury guidance. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, where capitalised in accordance with IAS 23, borrowing costs. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought into use. IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings, and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful economic lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. Page 9George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.7 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 1.7.2 Measurement (continued) Depreciation Revaluation gains and losses Impairments 1.7.3 De-recognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'held for sale' once all of the following criteria are met. The sale must be highly probable and the asset available for immediate sale in its present condition. Following reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Depreciation ceases to be charged. Assets are de-recognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recognition as 'held for sale' and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset's useful life is adjusted. The asset is de-recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs.Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'held for sale' cease to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction and residual interests in off-Statement of Financial Position PFI contract assets are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the trust, respectively. Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating expenditure. Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income'. In accordance with the GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains.

Expenditure on research is not capitalised. Expenditure on development is capitalised where it meets the requirements set out in IAS 38.Internally generated intangible assets Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, eg an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset.SoftwareDonated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met. The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. Useful lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. The range of useful lives are shown in the table below: Finance-leased assets (including land) are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or the lease term, unless the Trust expects to acquire the asset at the end of the lease term in which case the assets are depreciated in the same manner as owned assets above. Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

The cost of inventories is measured using the weighted average cost method. This is considered to be a reasonable approximation to fair value due to the high turnover of stocks. Investment properties are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised as gains or losses in income/expenditure. Only those assets which are held solely to generate a commercial return are considered to be investment properties. Where an asset is held, in part, for support service delivery objectives, then it is considered to be an item of property, plant and equipment. Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. In the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the Trust's cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. The CRC scheme is a mandatory cap and trade scheme for non-transport CO2 emissions. The trust is registered with the CRC scheme, and is therefore required to surrender to the Government an allowance for every tonne of CO2 it emits during the financial year. A liability and related expense is recognised in respect of this obligation as CO2 emissions are made. The carrying amount of the liability at the financial year end will therefore reflect the CO2 emissions that have been made during that financial year, less the allowances (if any) surrendered voluntarily during the financial year in respect of that financial year. The liability will be measured at the amount expected to be incurred in settling the obligation. This will be the cost of the number of allowances required to settle the obligation.Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Page 12George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.13 Financial assets and financial liabilities Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument, and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by the Office for National Statistics. This includes the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements and are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, ie, when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. Financial assets Financial assets are recognised when the Trust becomes party to the contractual provision of the financial instrument or, in the case of trade receivables, when the goods or services have been delivered. Financial assets have been derecognised when the contractual rights have expired or when the asset has been transferred and the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of has not retained control of the asset. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus or minus directly attributable transaction costs for financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value is taken as the transaction price , or otherwise determined by reference to quoted market prices, where possible. Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. The classification is determined by the cash flow and business model characteristics of the financial assets, as set out in IFRS 9, and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets measured at amortised cost are those held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and where the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes most trade receivables, loans receivable, and other simple debt instruments. After initial recognition, these financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are those held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and where the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. The Trust does not have any financial assets of this type. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are those that are not otherwise measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. This includes derivatives and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. The Trust does not have any financial assets of this type. Impairment For all financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (except equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income), lease receivables and contract assets, the Trust recognises a loss allowance representing expected credit losses on the financial instrument. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment, in accordance with IFRS 9, and measures the loss allowance for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For other financial assets, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition (stage 2), and otherwise at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). Page 13George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.13 Financial assets and financial liabilities (continued) Impairment (continued) Expected credit losses are determined by providing in full for non-NHS debtors over 90 days old and for Injury Cost Recovery income using national guidance. HM Treasury has ruled that central government bodies may not recognise stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against other government departments, their executive agencies, the Bank of England, Exchequer Funds, and Exchequer Funds' assets where repayment is ensured by primary legislation. The Trust therefore does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. Additionally, the Department of Health and Social Care provides a guarantee of last resort against the debts of its arm's length bodies and NHS bodies (excluding NHS charities), and Trust does not recognise loss allowances for stage 1 or stage 2 impairments against these bodies. For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is recognised in profit or loss as an impairment gain or loss. In accordance with the Department of Health guidelines 21.79% of injury costs recovery revenue is provided in a bad debt provision. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised when the Trust becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument or, in the case of trade payables, when the goods or services have been received. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the liability has been extinguished - that is, the obligation has been discharged or cancelled or has expired. Other financial liabilities After initial recognition, all other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the life of the asset, to the amortised cost of the financial liability. In the case of DHSC loans that would be the nominal rate charged on the loan. De-recognition All financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. 1.14 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 1.14.1 The trust as a lessee Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The implicit interest rate is that which produces a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for an item of property plant and equipment. The annual rental charge is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Finance leases Page 14George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.14 1.14.1 1.14.2 1.15 Provisions Nominal rate Short-term Up to 5 years 0.51% Medium-term After 5 years up to 10 years 0.55% Long-term Exceeding 10 years 1.99% Inflation rate Year 1 1.90% Year 2 2.00% Into perpetuity 2.00%Leases (continued) The trust as a lessor Early retirement provisions and injury benefit provisions both use the HM Treasury's pension discount rate of minus 0.5% (2018-19 positive 0.29%) in real terms. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is disclosed at note 36 but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using HM Treasury's discount rates effective for 31 March 2020: HM Treasury provides discount rates for general provisions on a nominal rate basis. Expected future cash flows are therefore adjusted for the impact of inflation before discounting using nominal rates. The following inflation rates are set by HM Treasury, effective 31 March 2020:Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Trust's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the trust's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.Finance leases Operating leasesThe trust as a lessee (continued) Operating leases Leases of land and buildingsOperating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives are recognised initially in other liabilities on the statement of financial position and subsequently as a reduction of rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. Page 15George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.15 Provisions (continued) The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and in return receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any excesses payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. 1.16 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.17 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. The Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for (i) donated and grant funded assets, (ii) average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short-term working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the \"pre-audit\" version of the annual accounts. The dividend calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. 1.18 Value added tax Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.19 Corporation tax The Trust has no corporation tax liability based on the activities undertaken and the financial position.Non-clinical risk pooling Page 16eorge Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.20 Foreign exchange The functional and presentational currency of the Trust is sterling. A transaction which is denominated in a foreign currency is translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Where the Trust has assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency at the Statement of Financial Position date: monetary items are translated at the spot exchange rate on 31 March non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains or losses on monetary items (arising on settlement of the transaction or on re-translation at the Statement of Financial Position date) are recognised in income or expense in the period in which they arise. Exchange gains or losses on non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the same manner as other gains and losses on these items. 1.21 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties in which the Trust has no beneficial interest (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts. However, they are disclosed in a separate note to the accounts in accordance with the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM . 1.22 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis. The losses and special payments note is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. 1.23 Gifts Gifts are items that are voluntarily donated, with no preconditions and without the expectation of any return. Gifts include all transactions economically equivalent to free and unremunerated transfers, such as the loan of an asset for its expected useful life, and the sale or lease of assets at below market value. The Trust did not receive any gifts of assets during the year. 1.24 Transfers of functions to and fromother NHS bodies or local government bodies There were no transfers of functions to or from other NHS bodies or local government bodies in the year. Page 17George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.25 1.26 1.26.1 1.26.2 Other standards, amendments and interpretationsEarly adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2019/20. Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or adopted IFRS 16 Leases The DHSC GAM does not require the following IFRS Standards and Interpretations to be applied in 2019-20. These Standards are still subject to HM Treasury FReM adoption, with IFRS16 being for implementation in 2020-21, and the government implementation date for IFRS17 still subject to HM Treasury consideration. IFRS 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Trust.IFRS 16 Leases will replace IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease and other interpretations and is applicable in the public sector for periods beginning 1 April 2021. The standard provides a single accounting model for lessees, recognising a right of use asset and obligation in the statement of financial position for most leases: some leases are exempt through application of practical expedients explained below. For those recognised in the statement of financial position the standard also requires the remeasurement of lease liabilities in specific circumstances after the commencement of the lease term. For lessors, the distinction between operating and finance leases will remain and the accounting will be largely unchanged. IFRS 16 changes the definition of a lease compared to IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The Trust will apply this definition to new leases only and will grandfather its assessments made under the old standards of whether existing contracts contain a lease. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 April 2021, the trust will apply the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised in the income and expenditure reserve at that date. For existing operating leases with a remaining lease term of more than 12 months and an underlying asset value of at least \u00a35,000, a lease liability will be recognised equal to the value of remaining lease payments discounted on transition at the trust's incremental borrowing rate. The Trust's incremental borrowing rate will be defined by HM Treasury. Currently this rate is 1.27% but this may change between now and adoption of the standard. The related right of use asset will be measured equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments. No adjustments will be made on 1 April 2021 for existing finance leases. For leases commencing in 2021/22, the Trust will not recognise a right of use asset or lease liability for short term leases (less than or equal to 12 months) or for leases of low value assets (less than \u00a35,000). Right of use assets will be subsequently measured on a basis consistent with owned assets and depreciated over the length of the lease term. The Trust has implemented processes to ensure that leases are identified and captured in a lease register. Existing contracts have also been reviewed to identify any potential elements which would be treated as leases under the new definitions. HM Treasury revised the implementation date for IFRS 16 in the UK public sector to 1 April 2021 on 19 March 2020. Due to the need to reassess lease calculations, together with uncertainty on expected leasing activity in from April 2021 and beyond, a quantification of the expected impact of applying the standard in 2021/22 is currently impracticable. However, the Trust does expect this standard to have a material impact on non-current assets, liabilities and depreciation. IFRS 16 Leases - the Standard is effective 1 April 2020 as adapted and interprested by the FReM, with the implementation date having been revised to 1 April 2021. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts - Application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted. The Trust has a small number of operating leases for medical and IT equipment/ software which are part way through their lease term. The standard will mean that operating leases will in future be accounted for as finance leases, with the assets to which they relate being capitalised and shown on the Statement of Financial Position. This change will be taken into account in any future business cases considering purchase or lease of assets. Page 18George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 1.27 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies 1.27.1 Sources of estimation uncertaintyThe following are the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below) that management has made in the process of applying the Trust accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: The Trust has entered into lease agreements for medical equipment during the year. In each case an asssessment has been carried out to determine whether the leaseshould be accounted for as an operating or finance lease. The following are assumptions about the future and other major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Land and buildings valuations were updated through a 'desk top' assessment at 31 March 2020 whilst continuing to be based on the 'alternative site valuation' principles. Two former employees are being paid a permanent injury allowance by the Trust. Their life expectancy is calculated using published interim life tables for England published by the Office of National Statistics, with the resulting calculated provision being discounted by minus 0.5%. Every year their life expectancy and appropriate discount factor is reviewed and updated.The valuation exercise was carried out in March 2020 with a valuation date of 31 March 2020. In applying the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation Global Standards 2020 (Red Book), the valuer has declared a material valuation uncertainty in the valuation report. This is on the basis of uncertainty in global financial markets caused by Covid-19. The values in the report have been used to inform the measurement of property assets at valuation in these financial statements. With the valuer having declared this material valuation uncertainty, the valuer has continued to exercise professional judgement in providing the valuation and this remains the best information available to the Trust. Of the \u00a355.6m net book value of land and buildings subject to valuation, \u00a355.2m relates to specialised assets valued on a depreciated replacement cost basis. Here the valuer bases their assessment on the cost to the Trust of replacing the service potential of the assets. The uncertainty explained above relates to the estimated cost of replacing the service potential, rather than the extent of the service potential to be replaced.

Pension costs 10.1Retirements due to ill-health During 2019/20 there were no early retirements from the trust agreed on the grounds of ill-health (5 in the year ended 31 March 2019). The estimated additional pension liabilities of these ill-health retirements is \u00a30k (\u00a3206k in 2018/19). These estimated costs are calculated on an average basis and will be borne by the NHS Pension Scheme. National Employment Savings Scheme (NEST) The Trust also operates the National Employment Savings Scheme (NEST). This is a defined contribution workplace pension scheme. The amount of contribution is in accordance with the national guidelines and is a precentage of employees salary.b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019 to 20.6%, and the Scheme Regulations were amended accordingly. The 2016 funding valuation was also expected to test the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap set following the 2012 valuation. Following a judgment from the Court of Appeal in December 2018 Government announced a pause to that part of the valuation process pending conclusion of the continuing legal process. Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2020, is based on valuation data as at 31 March 2019, updated to 31 March 2020 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office.

The Trust does not have any investment property (31 March 2019 \u00a3nil).The Trust had no donations of property, plant and equipment received during the year (2018/19 \u00a3Nil) Other investments / financial assets (non-current)Land, Buildings and Dwellings were valued as Modern Equivalent Assets (MEA) at the 31st March 2020 by Stephen Pollock BSc FRICS Cert Independent Property Valuers, in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation Standards, January 2014, IFRS and FReM guidelines. The value is based on the IFRS 13 definition of Fair Value and the definition adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), being the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) is recognised under IAS 16 as a basis of valuation for financial reporting purposes. DRC assessments were undertaken for those properties considered to be specialised properties. A Specialised Property is a property that is rarely if ever sold in the market, except by way of a sale of the business or entity of which it is part, due to uniqueness arising from its specialised nature and design, its configuration, size, location, or otherwise. The valuation is subject to adequate service potential, which is defined as: \"The capacity of an asset to continue goods and services in accordance with the entity's objectives\". It is assumed that the current use/services would still have to be provided by the Trust in the locality of Nuneaton. In accordance with Valuation Standard 2 of the RICS Valuation - Professional Standards January 2014, incorporating the International Valuation Standards 2013, the Market Values of the properties for alternative use (on cessation of the existing business) are likely to be materially lower than the Market Value, with continued use and Depreciated Replacement Cost figures reported. The basis of the valuation for the property, which is all freehold, is as follows:- Page 32George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 23. Disclosure of interests in other entities 24.

These are provided for using national assumptions about the likelihood of debt recovery. The Trust's policy for calculating the allowance against other debtors is that debts over 90 days are reviewed and an allowance made for any debts for which there is a risk of non-recovery. Amounts being recovered by instalment payments are excluded. An assessment has been undertaken of the remaining \u00a3370k based on the historical recovery of debts in the categories of private patients, local authorities and other individuals. This was based on the debtors outstanding at 31 March 2019 and the rate of recovery in year. This was broadly in line with the Trust's policy for calculating the allowance, which has therefore not been restated. Page 34George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 28.

Page 40George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts 2019-20 40. Financial instruments 40.1 Financial risk management Currency risk Interest rate risk The Trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Credit risk Liquidity riskBecause the majority of the Trust's revenue comes from contracts with other public sector bodies, the Trust has low exposure to credit risk. The maximum exposures as at 31 March 2020 are in receivables from customers, as disclosed in the trade and other receivables note. The Trust's operating costs are incurred under contracts with Clinical Commissioning Groups, which are financed from resources voted annually by Parliament. The Trust funds its capital expenditure from funds obtained within its capital resource limit. The Trust is not, therefore, exposed to significant liquidity risks.Financial reporting standard IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or changing the risks a body faces in undertaking its activities. Because of the continuing service provider relationship that the NHS Trust has with Clinical Commissioning Groups and the way those Clinical Commissioning Groups are financed, the NHS Trust is not exposed to the degree of financial risk faced by business entities. Also financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of listed companies, to which the financial reporting standards mainly apply. The NHS Trust has limited powers to borrow or invest surplus funds and financial assets and liabilities are generated by day-to-day operational activities rather than being held to change the risks facing the NHS Trust in undertaking its activities. The Trust's treasury management operations are carried out by the finance department, within parameters defined formally within the Trust's standing financial instructions and policies agreed by the Trust Board. Trust treasury activity is subject to review by the Trust's internal auditors. The Trust is principally a domestic organisation with the majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the UK and sterling based. The Trust has no overseas operations. The Trust therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations. The Trust borrows from government for capital expenditure and for revenue deficit support, subject to affordability as confirmed by the NHSI. The capital borrowings are for 1 - 10 years, in line with the life of the associated assets, and interest is charged at the National Loans Fund rate, fixed for the life of the loan. The Trust may also borrow from government for revenue financing subject to approval by NHS Improvement. Interest rates are confirmed by the Department of Health (the lender) at the point borrowing is undertaken.

Events after the reporting date On 2 April 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England and NHS Improvement announced reforms to the NHS cash regime for the 2020/21 financial year.

Page 46George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust Annual Accounts (20.5%) (29.7%) (41.2%) (46.3%) (39.6%) The Trust has a statutory duty to break even on a cumulative basis. In 2005-06 the Trust incurred a \u00a37.3m deficit and in April 2006 a Public Interest Report was issued under Section 8 of the Audit Commission Act 1998 in relation to the financial standing of the Trust. The Trust developed a 5 year Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) which was agreed with the Strategic Health Authority and the Department of Health to achieve cumulative break even by the end of 2011-12. During the 6 years to March 2013 the Trust generated surplus and was able to repay part of the deficit still leaving a balance of \u00a32.4m to be repaid in the future. In 2011-12 and 2012-13 the Trust required support funding of \u00a32.3m and \u00a35.0m respectively to breakeven. In 2013-14 the Trust incurred a deficit of \u00a310.2m due to the investment in clinical services following the implementation of the Keogh Action plan. The surplus in 2014-15 was achieved with the support of income from the Department of Health amounting to \u00a312m. The deficit in 2015-16 was \u00a315.2m against the original plan of \u00a316m. The deficit in 2016-17 was \u00a313.8m which an improvement against the plan of \u00a314.7m. The deficit reported in 2017-18 worsened to \u00a318.0m and in 2018-19 improved to \u00a312.8m. In 2019-20 the Trust reported a minor surplus position. The cumulative deficit at the 31st March 2020 therefore remained at \u00a371.7m. Because of the cumulative deficit External Auditors have been required to issue Section 30 letters to the Secretary of State for Health informing him that the Trust has not met its statutory duty to break-even over a 5 year period in accordance with the Audit Commission Act 1998.
