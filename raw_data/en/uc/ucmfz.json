Try This. Julie Potiker Author, Mindfulness Expert Mindful Methods for Life Being tapped into the digital world can become downright overwhelming for many of us, but we don't have to just brace ourselves and take it. Mindfulness is a simple and easily accessible tool that can help us feel better. Here are some ways to get started: 1) Try something new: Which info streams do you partake of most? A favorite cable news channel? Your most-used social media stream? Try switching the form and frequency of your consumption. Breaking the pattern that causes you stress by consciously choosing the \"what, where, and when\" of your news cycle can be empowering. 2) Take a break: Challenge yourself to take a technology break. Plan activities, interactions, outings, or quiet time that are completely free of smartphones, computers, and tablets. It really can do wonders for your well-being. 3) Make a difference: Don't let bad news or online divisiveness make you feel powerless, because you're not. You can choose to take specific actions that make a difference in the world for the people and causes you care about most. One of the best ways to do this is to volunteer for or donate to a cause you believe in. There are hard, painful truths in this world \u2014 and you can still serve as a force for good.\" Author and mindfulness expert Julie Potiker is an attorney who began her serious study and investigation of mindfulness after graduating from the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program at the University of California, San Diego. She was trained by Kristin Neff, Christopher Germer and UCSD as a Mindful Self-Compassion Teacher. She went on to study with Rick Hanson, becoming a graduate of his Positive Neuroplasticity Training Professional Course. Potiker also completed Bren\u00e9 Brown's Living Brave Semester. Now, she shares these and other mindfulness techniques with the world through her Mindful Methods for Life trainings and her new book: \"Life Falls Apart, but You Don't Have To: Mindful Methods for Staying Calm In the Midst of Chaos.\" She holds a B.G.S. from the University of Michigan and a J.D. from George Washington University.

A realization of unity can put an end to this. Be curious, ask yourself these questions: What problem do I see happening here right now? And how am I part of the problem? Who else can I join to help repair and resolve the problem?\" Anita Sanchez, Ph.D., Aztec and Mexican-American, is a transformational leadership consultant, speaker, coach and author of the international bestselling book, \"The Four Sacred Gifts: Indigenous Wisdom for Modern Times,\" available in paperback, hardcover, e-book, and audiobook from Simon & Schuster.

Those activities are unfulfilling distractions, which is why we first can't get enough of them, then get bored by them. Don't distract; instead, connect. How? It requires less of the mind and more of the heart, so activities that encourage creativity and deep-rooted reflection will do the trick. 1) Journal your experience. 2) Listen to music. 3) Play and create.\" Veronica Vargas was a creative and whimsical child, but after decades of conformity she found herself struggling with dissatisfaction and a deep longing for fulfillment. In her forties, she returned to her childhood passions - drawing, writing, and playing - and established Shaboo Prints, a boutique lifestyle brand designing positive, feel-good products.

Katy McQuaid Author, leadership consultant McQuaid Corporate Performance, LLC \"1) When you eat, really dig in and enjoy your food just like dogs do! Sometimes it's fun to share, and sometimes your yummy treat can be all for you. 2) When dogs go for a walk outside, they smell everything! What can you smell when you go for a walk? Take nice, deep breaths, all the way into your belly. Enjoy the fresh air, and all the outside smells that come with it. 3) Have you noticed that dogs' ears perk up when they notice things? Practice opening your eyes and ears to look and listen to everything around you. You can practice right where you are and take in everything there is to hear and see. 4) Dogs love to dig! It's a fun, playful, and natural instinct they have. When you're free to play and get dirty, go for it! Have fun, and enjoy the laughter and silliness that comes from play. 5) Dogs are great listeners. They love it when their people talk to them, and they perk up their ears. When a person you love speaks, you can practice perking up your ears, too, to show how much you enjoy being together.\" Author and leadership consultant Katy McQuaid spent more than three decades in the CIA, including 12 years living abroad. Her work in communities all over the world and the endearing, unconditional love of her four-legged muse Grace inspired her to write the \"Everybody Loves Grace\" series of illustrated books. Parents, kids of all ages, executives, and organizational leaders hail the series as a beacon of hope and inspiration for anyone navigating change or challenging circumstances.

In my \"Holistic Keto for Gut Health\" book, I have an entire chapter on the dangers of dairy \u2014 a food group that is \"allowed\" in a standard ketogenic diet. We aren't designed to consume dairy products other than human breast milk, especially after the age of 5. There are also other inflammatory foods you should hear about, like nuts and eggs, that can cause nagging symptoms no one can figure out. 2) Focus on digestive health: Holistic keto differs from the typical keto-type diet in that it omits inflammatory foods and focuses instead on digestive health, which leads to healthier immune function and vibrant health overall. It does eliminate the same carbohydrates that a standard keto diet omits (i.e., grains, legumes, and starchy root vegetables), but then it gets even better by incorporating gut healing foods, supplements, and lifestyle recommendations. 3) Improve digestion: Typical keto never mentions how you're supposed to digest all that fat and meat, but holistic keto for gut health goes into this in depth. You're not only what you eat, you're what you can digest and absorb. Most people have subclinical gall bladder issues (sludge in the pipes, so to speak) and low stomach acid, which blocks your ability to digest fats and other nutrients properly. If you don't break them down well, you can't absorb them and your entire body and mind suffer. 4) Whole-self wellness beyond food: What you eat, digest, and absorb matters, but those aren't the only factors for vibrant health. Holistic keto incorporates other important variables such as hydration, exercise, sleep, self-awareness, healthy relationships, appropriate boundaries, honest and responsible communication, and inner peace. A holistic and individualized approach to health and nutrition will always offer the best results. 5) Rebalance your gut: Most people have some level of gut dysbiosis \u2014 an imbalance between the \"good guys\" and the \"bad guys\" in your gut. These imbalances can lead to diseases because of how they influence your immune system. Holistic keto can help you halt, heal, and prevent autoimmune issues by healing your gastrointestinal tract.\" Health and lifestyle expert Kristin Grayce McGary (LAc., MAc., CFMP\u00ae, CST-T, CLP) is an internationally recognized author and speaker. She is an authority on autoimmunity, functional blood chemistry analysis, thyroid and gut health, pain alleviation, family wellness, extreme exhaustion, resolving blocks to healing, and food as medicine.

Online Tips to Overcome Feeling Overwhelmed Holistic Physician and Author Dr. Bradley Nelson \"1) Learn to Say No \u2014 Even if you're already feeling overwhelmed, there are things and people you want to say yes to: service opportunities, your boss, your kids... but ask yourself if all those obligations are really necessary. If it's going to stress you out, politely say no. If your boss is expecting an unrealistic deadline, remind her or him of everything on your plate and propose a different solution. If you need a personal time out ... take one. It'll help you be more effective when you're back at it!\" 2) Let Go of Perfectionism \u2014 Sometimes we need to learn to let go of the need to control everything or have it all turn out perfectly. No matter what people choose to show (and filter) on social media, nobody's life is perfect. Let go of the thought of being the ideal family, spouse, or parent. Setting realistic goals is one thing (and a good thing!) but expecting perfection of yourself, others, or the circumstances of life may easily lead to feeling overwhelmed. 3) Simplify \u2014 Take regular stock of the ways you might be needlessly complicating your schedule, expectations, or day-to-day living. What can you cut loose, at least for now? 4) Free Yourself Emotionally \u2014 When life seems to pile up, you might have so many things on your task list that you don't even know where to begin. No matter the cause, when you're truly feeling overwhelmed you might be so stressed that you're enveloped in negative energy. You might feel frustrated, angry, or confused more easily than you otherwise would.\" Veteran holistic physician Dr. Bradley Nelson is one of the world's foremost experts on natural methods of achieving wellness. He has certified thousands of practitioners worldwide to help people overcome physical, mental and emotional discomfort of all kinds by releasing their emotional baggage.
