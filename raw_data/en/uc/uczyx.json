However,these vaccines are not devoid of adverse effects requiring post-vaccination follow-up. Aim: Determine the frequency of adverse events(AEs)of an anti-COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccine (mRNA) collected among health care workers(HCW) at Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study carried out in September 2021, involving the HCW of the Charles Nicolle hospital in Tunis who had received the first dose of an mRNA anti-COVID 19 vaccine during a mobile vaccination campaign in the workplace. The data collection was carried out using a pre-established questionnaire containing the adverse vaccine reactions defined by the Tunisian Ministry of Health technical sheets. Results: The study population was composed of 139 HCW. Post-vaccine AEs were reported in 78% of cases. A predominance of women was noticed(78%). The age group most affected was between 40 and 45 years old. The most common AEs were injection site pain in 65% of cases, fever in 30% of cases, headache in 15% of cases and myalgia in 14% of cases. In addition, four cases of dizziness, two cases of generalized pruritus and one case of lymphadenopathy and acute peripheral facial paralysis were reported. The time to onset of AEs ranged from the same day to three days. The average duration of these AEs ranged from one to seven days. Five percent of our population took time off work which variated from one to three days. Conclusion: The occurrence of AEs following vaccination with an mRNA vaccine should not destabilize the promotion of vaccination in the workplace. However, close post-vaccination surveillance is necessary to ensure good occupational activity in the care setting. Footnotes Cite this article as Eur Respir J 2022; 60: Suppl. 66, 4295.
