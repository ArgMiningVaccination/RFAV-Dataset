It's been a very busy year at Stony Brook Medicine, and I am happy to provide an update on all we have been doing to continue to achieve excellence. In 2019, we will welcome 129 new physicians into the community of medicine, having successfully completed the rigorous Renaissance School of Medicine curriculum and passing all of their national board examinations. Their intellect, drive, mastery of the complex interaction between the art and Congratulations to the Class of 2019 on their graduation from the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. They have done very well academically, continuing to excel in all national standardized exams, and successfully matched into very competitive residency programs. We know that many of them end up as chief residents and future leaders in medicine. Last summer , we started an accelerated program to complete the MD degree in three years. The 3YMD program, aligned with our own residency programs, demands a higher academic rigor than the standard LEARN curriculum. We are very excited about this News from Alumni Relations PAGE 3 Summer Research Fellowship Awards PAGE 4 Match Day Celebration 2019 PAGES 5-7 Scholarly Concentrations Program Annual Research Day PAGES 8-10 Student Refl ections: Scholarly Concentrations Program (SCP) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) PAGES 11-13 African Diaspora PAGE 14 Hispanic Heritage PAGE 14 Asian Extravaganza PAGE 15 Evening of the Arts PAGE 16 Class of 2019 Honor Societies PAGE 16the science of medicine, their humanity and their devotion to the principles of medicine have been truly inspiring. The Class of 2019, our 45th graduating class, is an outstanding and diverse group of nascent internists, surgeons, emergency medicine physicians, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists, and other generalists and specialists. About one-third of our graduates are headed toward careers in primary care disciplines \u2014 general internal medicine, pediatrics and family medicine, although some of these physicians will ultimately specialize \u2014 with program that off ers considerable fi nancial benefi ts to participants and allows physicians to enter the workforce earlier . I am pleased to mention several exciting happenings at our school. The naming of the school in recognition of the numerous generous contributions from Renaissance T echnologies is the fi rst one. With their philanthropy, the families affi liated with Renaissance T echnologies have transformed the research, educational and clinical possibilities at the Renaissance School of Medicine.

About one-half of our graduates will stay in New York for their residency training, matching at Cornell, Columbia, NYU and Mount Sinai \u2014 and because of our retention eff orts, 16 will remain at Stony Brook Medicine, which is great for the home team! Those graduates who sought out training in 21 other states also did quite well, with addresses next year that include Massachusetts General Hospital, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, UCSF , UCLA and UCSD, among others. Over 36 percent of our graduates are heading to the most prestigious residencies in the country, which I defi ne as the top 20 residencies in each fi eld. And if history is any indication, most will be viewed as the top interns and residents in their classes, and if history is a guide, many will remain in academic medicine, either at Stony Brook Medicine or in other academic positions, as our school ranks 95th percentile in the nation in this realm. Research funding has again risen within the Renaissance School of Medicine this year compared to last, mostly in our focus areas of cancer , immunology, neurosciences and biomedical informatics. We have created a Stony Brook Institute for Engineering-Driven Medicine, which held its fi rst brainstorming session in December 2016 and second in early May 2017, and funded several pilot grants again this year . It will build on current strengths and focus on cardiology and cardiovascular disorders, cancer medicine, neurosciences, and digital and wireless medical device development. And, we are in the design phase of an approximately 50,000-square-foot building on the Research Dean's Message continued from cover new buildings: the Medical and Research T ranslation (MART) building and the adjacent Hospital Pavilion allows for new educational facilities for team-based learning and interactive small group activities for our medical students.

Thank you all. and Development Campus of the University, the IDiME building (Institute for Discovery and Innovation in Medicine and Engineering), which will house many innovative engineering- driven medicine programs. We have also advanced our historic affi liation agreement with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) to partner in research, academic and clinical endeavors. On the research side, we renewed our pilot funding program, which supports six new joint SBM/ISMMS projects. The educational affi liation with Mount Sinai will include Medical, Nursing, Health T echnology and Social Welfare student rotations, interinstitutional graduate student thesis committees and experiential learning sites. On the educational front, we are now nearly fi ve years into our LEARN curriculum, and by all accounts, our audacious goals are being accomplished. This year we launched a three- year medical school curriculum for a very select number of students in the matriculating class of 2019, and are evaluating adding additional students to the cohort from our fi rst-year class. Our students are smarter , more experienced and more accomplished at matriculation than ever before, and the number of applicants who want to come to the Renaissance School of Medicine continues to be robust: more than 5,000 applicants this year! And, based on our curriculum and a myriad of other parameters, at the time of this writing in early April, we are anticipating a successful Liaison Committee for Medical Education (LCME) reaccreditation visit, our once-every-eight-years \"show and tell.\"Again this year , we witnessed signifi cant growth in our clinical impact. Our 120,000-square-foot multidisciplinary clinic in Commack, known as Advanced Specialty Care, includes extended-hour primary care and over 30 specialties and subspecialties. Stony Brook University Hospital has been as busy as ever , with recent census numbers hitting all-time highs, and our total number of patient encounters across our healthcare system exceeding one million this year . Our operations at Stony Brook Southampton Hospital have been a model, expanding the range of services off ered to patients on the South Fork of Long Island, including having successfully performed more than 500 cardiac catheterizations in the fi rst cardiac catheterization laboratory in eastern Suff olk County. And, we will continue our move this year into the remainder of the nearly 500,000 square feet of research, educational and clinical space that make up the MART (Medical and Research T ranslation) building and Hospital Pavilion/Stony Brook Children's Hospital. In sum, there is much to celebrate here at Stony Brook Medicine. We continue to make progress on all our missions, research, education, clinical and community outreach, and the impact of all the members of Stony Brook Medicine continues to grow. I hope you all take great pride in our accomplishments. I certainly do.

This year, many of the graduating students are giving back by making a $20.19 donation to help support future students. Alumni continue to reconnect with their alma mater by providing both moral and nancial support. The Class of '83 at their 35th anniversary reunion.The New York Academy of Medicine (the Academy) is a health policy and advocacy organization founded in 1847 by a group of leading New York metropolitan area physicians as a voice for the medical profession in medical practice and public health reform. Today, the Academy has over 3,000 fellows dedicated to maintaining and improving health. Each year, The New York Academy of Medicine Fellowship Awards contributes more than $400,000 in grants and fellowships to medical students, clinicians and researchers to support the advancement of healthcare studies. The Academy's student grants and fellowships allow medical students the opportunity to gain direct, hands-on experience in a high-quality research environment, as well as exposure to health policy making and leadership development. The David E. Rogers Student Fellowship Award is meant to enrich the educational experiences of students through projects that couple medicine with the needs of underserved or disadvantaged patients or populations.The Ferdinand C. Valentine Medical Student Research Grants are awarded to medical students to support research in urology. Medical students across the country compete for these $4,000 awards by submitting a planned research project to be completed between the first and second years of medical school. The awardees are selected by a committee of fellows of the Academy. The students are then required to present their research to a committee made up of the president and invited fellows of the Academy. Since 2016, our students have been awarded these competitive fellowship awards annually for the following global and local research projects:Class 2019: Jaydon Kiernan and Koeun Choi Stony Brook University Global Health Institute Identifying the Cultural Practices That Perpetuate Cysticercosis in Infandiana, Madagascar Class 2020: Emile Redwood and Annabelle Jones David E.

I also received much benefit from presenting my research the following fall, and learning from the other research presentations. I'd recommend the experience to any medical student looking for research funding.\" \" The student forum at NYAM was also a valuable experience for us. I was glad that we were able to share our preliminary results and to meet with other researchers who share the same interests.\" 55This year's Match Day Celebration was held on Friday, March 15, in the Health Sciences Galleria. There was another successful Match this year, with 98 percent of the class matching to a residency program. Thirty-two percent of students matched to primary care residencies (medicine, pediatrics, family medicine). Other students matched in other specialties, such as anesthesiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, neurological surgery, neurology, OB/GYN, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, otolaryngology, pathology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, plastic surgery, psychiatry and child psychiatry, radiology (diagnostic and interventional), surgery, urology and vascular surgery. A record 36 percent of students matched to one of the top 20-ranked residency programs in the country. Congratulations to the Class of 2019!

It has been no secret that for the last four years, I have been dying to go somewhere warm for residency. Do not get me wrong: Snow is beautiful ... on Google images. But in real life, it's miserable. Humor aside, I've spent most of my entire life in Suffolk County, New York. I went to Patchogue-Medford High School, continued at Stony Brook University and stayed for medical school. I have lived in my parents' home my entire life. Heck, I have never cooked a meal. For most people, Match Day is the day they find out where they are going. For me, it was IF I was even going. There was a fear that I would be a Suffolk County resident my entire life. The process itself is grueling. I was told by my advisors that since I had spent my entire life in New York, it would be more difficult to relocate to another state, as many out-of-state programs would view me as a casual applicant. I ended up doing three two-week rotations in Florida to send a message that a New Yorker like me was desperate to move to the Sunshine State. One place I rotated at, I fell in love with: Florida Atlantic University. The culture and work-life balance were amazing. Not to mention, the hospital was a walk away from the beach. As I finished my two-week rotation, I knew I was going to rank this place first. I wanted this place to be home for the next three years. Beautiful beaches, no state income tax and more beautiful beaches. What more could I ask for? The typical applicant submits applications in September and interviews from November through January. The final rank list submission is due in mid-February. Then, you just wait three weeks till \"Match Day,\" which for the Class of 2019, fell on March 15, the Ides of March. For me, the timeline between rank list submission and Match Day was surreal. Everyone knows their fate is decided, but it is the anticipation that drives us nuts. The worst part is explaining this process to non- medical friends and family. Friend: \"What are you up to?\" Me: \"Just applying for residency and going on interviews.\" Did you get any acceptances yet?\" Me: \"Yeah ... it doesn't work like that. It's this process where you apply to X amount of programs; then Y programs decide to interview you. Then you have to rank those programs. And the programs have to rank all the people they interviewed. Then some computer runs a program where they take every applicant's rank list into consideration and match the students at one place and you are stuck where you match. You cannot switch out.\" Friend: \"That sounds horrible. Good luck with that.\" Me: \"Thanks.\" Now I will admit, even though this sounds horrible, it's actually one of the few things in the whole process that is efficient and fair. Yet, the buildup and stress-inducing anticipation isn't. Apparently, this whole algorithm runs within a day. But the people behind this madness make you wait a month. That is like using a dating app that matches you to a spouse, but decides to tell you a month later in a public ceremony, in front of all your friends and family. Just give me my results tomorrow! As you can tell, Match Day is like nothing else, as no other field announces its job offers in such a public manner. Yet, at the end of the day, it's a memorable occasion, because for the past four years, this is what we were working for. To think that four years of hard work culminates into an opening of an envelope to find out where you will spend the next several years is horrifying. The night before Match Day, I mentally prepared scenarios of what might happen. Would I cry on the spot? Or would I just walk away? Wait, what if I match into one of my top spots, and it is one of my friends who do not match where they want? Thousands of thoughts like this were racing through my mind. Finally, it was Match Day. Everyone looked their best. Loved ones surrounded each and every student. Cameras flashed like we were on the red carpet. Happiness and pride filled the room, but the silent anxiety was still there. We all felt it. I was handed my envelope. Part of me wanted to run off and open it in the bathroom. Part of me didn't even want to open it. As the countdown began, I zoned out. When it ended, I paused. I listened to others scream and shout. I just wanted to soak everything in. I opened my envelope a good 10 seconds after the countdown ended. I slowly pulled the paper out and opened it. I saw the name \"Schmidt.\" I panicked. I never ranked any place called Schmidt. However, a split- second letter, I saw \"FAU Schmidt COM. \" FAU being Florida Atlantic University. I matched at my top choice and was thrilled. Yet, the excitement didn't soak in until the weekend. I was lying down, going through Google images of Boca Raton (yes, I Google images a lot). For the first time, in a long while, I was genuinely happy. I was going to be somewhere I wanted to be. Not somewhere where I had to be. I smiled. Finally, this process is over. I can pull a LeBron James and say \"I am taking my talents to South Beach.\" Beautiful beaches, no state income tax and more beautiful beaches. What more could I ask for?

marks the culmination of four years of hard work for myself and many of my Class of 2019 classmates, as we present our research projects for the Scholarly Concentrations Program at Research Day. At the start of our fi rst year we all made a commitment to dedicate much of our summer breaks, elective time and late nights/weekends during clinical rotations to a research project of our own choice and creation. We were assigned the formidable but exciting tasks of developing new research questions, writing IRBs for approval, fi nding research mentors, applying for grants, authoring abstracts or manuscripts and for some students, even traveling to other countries to collect data or collaborate with other institutions. Despite these daunting expectations, I have nothing but great things to say about the Scholarly Concentrations Program and the many opportunities and career shaping eff ects it has had on my time at Stony Brook. Before medical school, I never thought of myself as much of a researcher. I did bench research in high school, worked in an animal behavior lab during college and did data collection for a prospective study as a summer job, but with each of these projects my role was tangential \u2014 none of them were my own. The Scholarly Concentrations Program (SCP) provided me with my fi rst opportunity to develop a research project from start to fi nish. In the fall of my fi rst year, I reached out to multiple mentors who had volunteered to be contacted by students looking for research topics to pursue. I was so lucky to fi nd my PI and mentor, Dr. Kathleen Stergiopoulos, through this process. Dr. Stergiopoulos is a cardiologist whose clinical and research focus is on treating pregnant women with heart disease. As an MD PhD and experienced mentor for students in the SCP , she was able to help guide me through so many fi rsts: my fi rst grant application, my fi rst abstract submission, my fi rst scientifi c poster composition, my fi rst oral presentation at a medical conference, my fi rst manuscript submission, the list goes on and on. During the summer between fi rst and second year, I was able to start working on my research project, thanks to funding through the SCP . Together with Dr. Stergiopoulos, I chose to study the maternal and fetal outcomes in mothers with various forms of heart disease in pregnancy. The number of women with heart disease during pregnancy is growing, but there is very little data published on how diff erent types of heart disease (valvular, congenital, pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy) impact the babies of these mothers. After helping to tailor the IRB and getting it accepted, we were able to analyze the data we acquired from the New York State SPARCS database (a statewide registry of inpatient hospitalizations that allowed us to link the mother's record with her baby's health record). I spent afternoons combing through the data with our statisticians in the bio statistical core at Stony Brook. They were a tremendous help in analyzing the data using SPSS and Stata. In order to keep up with the other MDs on our research project, I read all of the papers I could fi nd published in this fi eld and sought to understand the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy, along with the many ICD-9 codes that represented the diagnoses we were studying. My research helped integrate and accelerate what we had learned in our CPR and Endo Repro classes with real-life examples of the disease state. During that fi rst summer, I also learned how to apply for grant funding and was lucky to be awarded over $8,000 in project support from various organizations such as the New York Academy of Medicine, American Heart Association and American Medical Association. One research question led to another, which led to another, so we kept analyzing diff erent subgroups and trends in the data. During my third year, I was invited to travel to present my research at the American College of Physicians annual conference in sunny San Diego, as one of the young achievers abstract winners. Even as a poor medical student, the SCP gave me the chance to travel the country to meet other researchers and attend procedure workshops and talks about new guidelines. The greatest part of the SCP for me, though, was the opportunity it provided for me to combine my two most passionate interests. Unlike many of my classmates who came into medical school knowing exactly what fi eld they wanted to enter as a physician, I was a little uncertain. I loved each clinical rotation more than the last, and even did two sub-internships, because I was still so torn between medicine and ob/gyn at the end of my third year. My research project (continued on page 12)12allowed me to combine these two interests perfectly and helped me to ultimately decide on the Internal Medicine Primary Care track at Mount Sinai Hospital for residency, where I will be able to focus on women's health. I got to attend and present my research at general medicine, cardiology-specific and obstetric national meetings, giving me amazing exposure to these various fields of practice. Had you told me four years ago that I would be so involved in a research project I love, on a topic I truly care about, with a first-author published paper in a reputable journal, I would have never believed you. The Scholarly Concentrations Program gave me and so many others a unique opportunity to defy the odds. Thank you to Dr. Stergiopoulos and all of the other amazing mentors for taking a chance on us eager first-year medical students, and congratulations to my classmates on all of their amazing research accomplishments! STUDENT REFLECTIONS It was a cold day in February with the grant application only a few days away. I changed my desktop background to a picture of Nyhavn, the beautiful colored houses that lined the harbor in Copenhagen, in the hopes of good luck. I was waiting to hear if I was accepted to receive funding to travel to Denmark to pursue my Scholarly Concentrations Program in the medical humanities, studying physician empathy in Danish general practice. I had first fallen in love with Denmark when I studied there for a semester in college. There, I first learned about their general practitioner-driven healthcare system that had a strong focus on the physician-patient relationship and continuity of care. I knew I wanted to return, but I didn't know how. The opportunity arose after a Medicine in Contemporary Society class on empathy and compassionate care taught by Stephen Post, PhD. I approached him after class, told him of my interest in primary care and the therapeutic role of the physician-patient relationship, and started talking about a project idea to study physician empathy in general practice. I suggested Denmark as the location for the study. Dr . Post connected me with Mohammadreza Hojat, PhD, the creator of the Jefferson Empathy Scale used globally to measure physician empathy. With their guidance, I drafted a project proposal and was set to apply for funding through the International Health Fellowship run by Mark Sedler , MD, MPH. However , I still needed to have a research mentor local to Denmark that would sponsor my project and provide the resources needed to complete it. I set out on a quest, emailing the corresponding authors for every related paper I could find, hoping that someone would be willing to take on my project. After a wild goose chase that lasted many months, I received an email from Jens S\u00f8ndergaard, MD, PhD, GP , the head of the Research Unit for General Practice in Odense. He accepted the offer on behalf of his department to be my research mentor and offered to have me spend two months in the research unit, working under the mentorship of T roels Kristensen, PhD. Shortly thereafter , I learned my project was accepted for funding and I hurriedly booked my plane ticket to Denmark. I arrived on a warm June day to Odense, home to the famous fairy-tale writer Hans Christian Andersen. I was welcomed with open arms to the research team, and we began work on our project. The aims of the project were to assess empathy in a population of Danish general practitioners (GPs), assess a variety of demographic, professional and job satisfaction characteristics, and determine the relationship of these characteristics to empathy. This was no easy feat, especially because we needed everything to be in Danish, and I knew only a few words of the very complicated language. However , at the end of the summer , with the mentorship of the team and some fantastic translators, the survey was ready to be sent to 1,200 Danish GPs. While I was in Denmark, I also had the opportunity to attend the WONCA Europe Conference in Copenhagen, which hosted GPs from all over the world for several days of interesting seminars, workshops and research presentations. Once I returned home from Denmark and the results of our study were in, Dr . Kristensen and I began the data analysis. We found Danish GPs to have above average levels of empathy, and GPs who viewed interpersonal aspects of medicine to be most important to their job satisfaction tended to be more empathetic than their peers. Dr . Kristensen and I made time to speak over Skype despite the six-hour time difference and set out to draft a manuscript on our exciting results. Over the course of the next few years, I would travel to Iceland, The Netherlands and back to Copenhagen to present our findings. Then came the manuscript submission. The process was daunting, as it was the first paper I'd ever written. I probably have hundreds of back-and-forth emails with revision suggestions, new papers to read and brainstorming over how to address the comments sent back by reviewers. But lo and behold, in March 2018, we had a paper accepted to a peer-reviewed journal! Scholarly Research Program Leads to Study in Denmark By Justin Charles, Class of 201913Reflections on the Medical Scientist T raining Program By Himanshu Sharma, Class of 2019 T wo weeks after turning 30, I stood in a room filled with the brightest, kindest and most driven people I have ever met. We had gathered to discover and to celebrate our collective next step \u2014 residency. In this company, at-once inspiring and intimidating, I silently contemplated my own circumstances. Behind me lay medical school and a PhD. Ahead stretched a life as a neuroscientist and neurosurgeon. This was a moment I could not have predicted even a few years ago. I haven't always wanted to be a doctor or a scientist. In fact, I am living a dream that I didn't fully discover until I was 29. The common thread of my dreams has always been a desire to help people and to tackle important, complex problems. Chasing the important, in college I explored physics, economics and international relations, eventually finding my way to medicine. Throughout most of my time in the Medical Scientist T raining Program (MSTP), I remained undifferentiated. Continuing to pursue the complex, I studied neural stem cells during my PhD, finding their potential both beautiful and profound. Ultimately, I found my home in the neurosurgical OR.In the process, however , I discovered something far more beautiful and profound than anything I've ever seen in the OR or under the microscope. I found a group of eclectic, brilliant and awe-inspiring men and women: my MSTP cohort. They were students with a shared desire to stand astride, with one foot in the laboratory and the other in the clinic. Thus balanced on the shoulders of those two giants, my classmates were eager to peer just a little further ahead. And we were not alone. In the process of discovering that balance \u2014 a process incredible, terrible and wonderful that took the better part of a decade \u2014 we each found friends, teachers and role models in the students, staff and faculty around us. Indeed, as I reflect back on my time in the Stony Brook MSTP , I find that it has been the single greatest privilege of my life to work with and learn from these people. People like my research mentor Holly Colognato, PhD, who gave me the freedom to try and fail over and over for years, failing a little better each time, until eventually, we succeeded. Their acts of generosity have left indelible marks on my life and those of my cohort. Acts like the unbidden kindness of an administrative assistant, Ms. Roseanna Stasik, who arranged for my first glimpse of neurosurgery seven years into an eight-year program. In four short days, this kindness changed my career forever , allowing me to discover a new dream. These people have shaped not only my academic career , but also the scientist, the physician and the man I hope to become. It is, I believe, a debt I can only repay by paying forward. In the larger estimation, the people of Stony Brook have made the defining impact during our time in the MSTP . It is truly a credit to our program and this institution that the impact has, on the whole, lifted us to new heights and helped us deserve our dreams. For me, these people have also contributed to my own intellectual coming of age. Here, at the Stony Brook MSTP , I have found exactly what I needed when I started at 22. I found a place to train with good, decent people who also have the audacity to believe that we can, through hard work, creativity and dedication, fight at the very edge of our ability to discover and to heal. Perhaps one day, some of us will be lucky enough to have the phrase (albeit in Latin) on a medal as yet more proof, but for my MSTP family the phrase already rings true: They who bettered life on earth through their new-found mastery. In a few short months, my six colleagues will scatter across the country to leverage their unique talents as physicians, scientists and teachers. Their patients and students will be profoundly fortunate to have them. I, myself, am incredibly excited to watch what they do. Whatever it is, I know this: They will do well, and they will do good. A few months later , we had the wonderful opportunity to host my Danish colleagues at a colloquium at Stony Brook. It was titled \"Empathy in Medicine: Lessons from Health Care in Denmark.\" We presented about the Danish healthcare system and findings from our research in physician empathy in Danish General Practice, and hosted a panel on Medical Engagement and Organizational Vitality, which featured hospital executives and Dean Kaushansky himself. We also presented our research findings at Sidney Kimmel Medical College to Dr . Hojat and his colleagues, where we received invaluable feedback for the future direction of our project. In the future, we plan to analyze the relationship between empathy and perceived workload of GPs, antibiotic prescribing patterns of GPs and health outcomes of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD and diabetes. I could not have done this without the endless support of the wonderful research mentorship I've gotten here and abroad, the Scholarly Concentrations Program and the International Health Fellowship. I am endlessly grateful for the late hours Dr . Kristensen spent revising our work, giving me targeted feedback and offering consistent guidance to help me develop into a more competent researcher . We are excited to pass the torch on to a current first-year student who will be traveling to Odense this summer to help us continue our work and present at the Nordic Congress of General Practice in Aalborg, Denmark. 14 On February 8, the Stony Brook chapter of the Student National Medical Association (SNMA), hosted its tent-pole cultural event, The African Diaspora Celebration. Each year, fi rst-year medical students organize a fun, exciting night to uplift and shine a light on black culture throughout the diaspora and fundraise for causes they are passionate about. The event started out with a moving rendition of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" \u2014 a song often referred to as the \"Negro National Anthem\" \u2014 by the Stony Brook Gospel Choir. The night then progressed into a showcase of talent in poetry, dance, trivia skills, fashion and music. The event took place during Black History Month and, as such, served as an opportunity to refl ect on the progress that has been made in diversifying the face of medicine. Our very own Aldustus Jordan III, EdD, Associate Dean for Community Engagement and Service Learning Emeritus, presented an inspirational speech on the struggle black physicians experienced to create a space where they could practice medicine and empower future generations after their rejection from the American Medical Association. He then charged us to continue to be forces for positive change in our local and global communities. At the end of this event, through a ra e from vendors throughout Suff olk County, the SNMA raised funds for several vital causes that predominantly impact minority and underserved communities. These include Stony Brook HOME (Health Outreach and Medical Education), a student-run free clinic that serves the uninsured, and the Hemoglobinopathy Center at Stony Brook Children's Hospital, which is recognized by New York State for assisting children with disorders, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. AFRICAN DIASPORA HISPANIC HERIT AGE On October 9, 2018, the Stony Brook Chapter of the Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA) hosted its annual Hispanic Heritage Night celebration. It was a celebration of Hispanic culture from around the world. The evening featured a talk by Cristina Hernandez, MD, Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, about her international outreach. Attendees were treated to a fl amenco guitar performance and a salsa lesson, as well as a feast of fl avorful foods. The evening served as a venue for the Stony Brook Medicine community to celebrate all that the Hispanic culture has to o er. 15 ASIAN EXTRAVAGANZA On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, the Asian Pacifi c American Medical Student Association (APAMSA) hosted its annual school-wide event, Asian Extravaganza, to introduce, explore and celebrate the diverse cultures of Asian/Pacifi c Islander American (APIA) communities at Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. This year's theme represented the Silk Road that touched and connected hundreds of cultures in Asia, titled \"Journey on the Silk Road,\" with the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere of the event refl ecting its historical symbolism. In accordance with APAMSA's mission of advocating for APIA health, this annual event is one of many opportunities for medical and dental students to demonstrate their steadfast support of APIA communities in Suff olk County. With hundreds of attendees present, individuals enjoyed refreshments from various Asian cultures and participated in several entertainment activities of their choice. The event featured an a cappella group, poetry reading, stand-up comedy, several talented medical and dental students dancing in a Bhangra competition, and students singing songs from their culture. The highlight of the night was the annual Asian Extravaganza fashion show with students displaying traditional clothes from many diff erent Asian cultures as they walked the stage. The event also provided ra e prizes fi lled with countless gifts donated by members of School of Medicine faculty and local communities of Stony Brook, with proceeds going to support APAMSA and APIA health within Suff olk County.
