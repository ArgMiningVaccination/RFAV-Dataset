With the addition of Red Tea Extract, Seaweed Extract, and Hyaluronic Acid, this wonderful scrub helps balance moisture, while delivering skin nourishing antioxidants and mineral goodness! Key Ingredients Mechanical exfoliation is the perfect intervention in order to regulate the desquamation cycle. It is excellent for decreasing the appearance of superficial hyperpigmentation, and photo-damage, while helping to diminish fine lines, wrinkles and shallow acne scars. The effectiveness of the exfoliation is determined by the quality of the abrasive medium, and the supplemental nourishment provided to the skin. Courtney Sykes' Molecular Resurfacing Scrub uses medical-grade crystals as the scouring catalyst. These crystals are inert minerals that do not cause adverse or allergic reactions to the skin. They have low heat retention and are extremely fine, so they don't rupture or damage healthy and living cells, yet are still very adept at lifting dirt and dead cells. To reduce inflammation, and nourish the freshly exposed skin, Sykes included Jojoba Oil, Red Tea Extract, Apricot Kernel Oil, Squalane and Hyaluronic Acid. These soothing and natural ingredients penetrate deep into the freshly exposed skin and provide protection against environmental elements, pollution and free radicals. Courtney's Application Recommendations: Wet face with water and apply a small amount of product into the palm your hand. Use alone with water or mix with a Courtney Sykes Cleanser. Massage in circular motions over face and body. Avoid eye areas. Rinse well and apply Courtney Sykes "}
