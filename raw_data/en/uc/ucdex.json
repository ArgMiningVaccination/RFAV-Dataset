NY1 Health Reporter Erin Billups has more on the alert. These adults had blood lead levels at more than three times what is considered normal. Health department investigators determined they were lead-poisoned after using ceramic ware to serve food in, and drink from. We have all seen this pottery; it's supposed to be use for decorative purposes. But after heading out to the stores where the poisoned victims bought their ceramics, department officials discovered that the pottery was being sold alongside foods and produce, with shop owners telling patrons they were safe to use for cooking and food presentation. Several of the items that were tested had stickers identifying they were made in Mexico. The lead was found in the glaze, paints, and clay of the pottery. Lead poisoning often does not have any symptoms until levels are very high, so there may be more people impacted by this. Symptoms include stomach pain, constipation, headaches, loss of appetite, memory loss, pain, or tingling in the hands and feet, weakness, and irritability. It is rare for lead poisoning to cause death, but lead exposure is even more dangerous for children and developing fetuses, as lead can cause learning delays and behavioral problems. \"The most important thing is stop using it, and then call your doctor and get yourself tested for lead,\" First Deputy Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said. \"The other thing that we would ask you is to call 311 and let us know where you bought the pottery, so we can go out and make sure no other pottery that could potentially affect other individuals is being used,\" Barbot continued. In response, the health department has issued a Commissioner's Order to businesses selling this merchandise, requiring them to post signs about the lead hazards. Investigators found contaminated items in stores in Bushwick and Jackson Heights. The department is also doing outreach in those neighborhoods. "}
