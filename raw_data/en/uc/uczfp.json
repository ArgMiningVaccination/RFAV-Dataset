Hi Leah, how do you think about risk? I've taken several risks in life and I continue to do so. From moving to Los Angeles from the mid west, to opening my first business as an esthetician and now starting another business after finding my life's passion. I feel that it is very important to go for what you want and give it a try. If it doesn't work out, the worst that can happen is you just try something else. But you will always learn and make memories. Alright, so let's move onto what keeps you busy professionally? When I was a teenager I worked as a receptionist and a hair salon and as I got older I really didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up. I decided to go to school to become an esthetician because I was used to working in the beauty industry already. I had really bad acne and I thought if I could learn how to fix it I could help others with their skin as well. I was a licensed aesthetician for over 10 years running my own salon for six. I always had in the back of my mind that I would love to be a therapist but I didn't really like the idea of going to college. I noticed when clients would come to see me it wasn't always about the beauty services that I was providing. It was more about the conversations and the connection. I wanted people to leave their time with me feeling beautiful, not just looking beautiful. After a while my passion for waxing vaginas faded and I knew that I needed to find my real purpose in life. I started my own self healing journey to become the best possible version of myself. When Covid hit I was forced to not work anymore which gave me a lot of extra time to work on myself. I then discovered my real passion of wanting to help others be the best possible version of themselves by diving into every possible thing I could learn about self love, meditation, and psychic work. I took a trip to Colorado to see a shaman I worked with Reiki healer's I worked with multiple psychics to find out everything I could about this field. I spent months practicing in honing my abilities and I am most proud of myself for taking the leap of faith to pursue this career. I have developed a four week program called the energy body program which is my favorite offering I have so far. It helps you dive deep into childhood and past life trauma and really find out what is holding you back in this current life. It's not easy to face your shadow self. And I am not a super fluffy person. I show Tough love because I want you to really alchemize your trauma once and for all so you can truly be free of what's holding you back. I will push you and help you along the way and give you the tools that you need to continue to help yourself even when our sessions are over. I have experienced a lot of trauma in my life and I have figured out how to overcome it and now my life's work and passion has become about helping others do the same. It brings me the most joy to watch someone go from their first session being scared, lost, sad, depressed to their fourth session where they blossom into a new individual and I can see how much they've grown. The 10+ years I spent as an aesthetician really helped me to be where I am now because I know how to make people feel comfortable and safe in a vulnerable situation. I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and I am truly grateful for everything I've gone through and where I am today. Any places to eat or things to do that you can share with our readers? If they have a friend visiting town, what are some spots they could take them to? In California we really have it all from desert to beaches to the mountains. I would definitely take them on a driving tour through the hills to see the wonderful views and the beautiful houses. We would go for a hike at Runyon Canyon or Griffith Park up to the observatory. There are so many amazing places to eat in Los Angeles I cannot name them all but I absolutely love the sunset Marquis restaurant and Laurel Hardware. A quick trip to Palm Springs at the ace hotel is also a nice getaway. Jazz nights at the Black rabbit roses are always a good time. And I would make them work out with me at health house in weho Shoutout is all about shouting out others who you feel deserve additional recognition and exposure. Who would you like to shoutout? There have been so many people involved in my growth on this journey that I am so appreciative of. My Reiki teacher Tarah Bird kick started my learning process with healing sessions and then teaching. My most recent coach Meena with Your Soul Warrior really solidified my offerings and truly set me up for success. Wouldn't be where I am today without these wonderful ladies.
