Over the summer, hundreds of individuals raised nearly $1 million in one week to save the laboratory site of Nikola Tesla, the late physicist and engineer whose work in the late 1800s and early 1900s formed the foundation for wireless and X-ray technology. The funds are to be used to purchase the land where Tesla worked and to build a museum in his honor. The interest and initiative taken by donors to keep a scientific legend's work alive is more than moving. New legendary scientists are being dis- covered every day. In September, I was lucky to be able to attend the PhRMA Research & Hope Awards ceremony in Washington, DC, where nine individuals were honored for their work in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, a disease that is not only plaguing healthcare systems and distressing caregivers worldwide, but that also presents complex scientific challenges. Also in September, 10 major biopharma-ceutical companies formed a nonprofit called TransCelerate BioPharma, with the aim of accelerating the development of new medicines, with an initial focus on clinical trial execution. This month, our Executive Editor Pa- tricia V an Arnum will be in Madrid to meet the winners of the CPhI Worldwide Pharma Awards, which recognize compa-nies that are breaking new ground in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, drug delivery, and sustainable packaging. Across the Atlantic, I will be meeting the recipients of the AAPS Graduate Student, Innova-tion, and Research Achievement awards in Chicago. The recipients of the various awards are dedicating their studies to im-proving pharma analysis, formulation de-sign, drug delivery, biotechnology, product performance, and more. All of the individuals working to iden- tify new disease diagnostics and therapeu-tics, whether or not they are recognized on the global stage, serve as the backbone to this industry. For without new products to manufacture for patients in need, where would we be? Just where R&D lies in America's future may very well depend on federal spending and support. With the US presidential election around the corner, I thought it important to examine where the country's candidates stand on this issue. Much has been said along the campaign trails regard-ing manufacturing and innovation, but the candidates' specific views on R&D and re-lated federal spending do not always make the headlines. Here are a few goals from Obama's court based on his FY2013 presidential budget proposal, which calls for $140.8 billion in overall federal R&D spending, an increase of $2 billion over the FY2012 enacted level: t\u0001 Enhance innovation in the manufac- turing sector by supporting invest-ment in new products, processes, and industries, and by investing in cross-cutting technologies t\u0001 At NIH, level funding for biomedical research ($30.7 billion); focus more on translational studies; and to get more out of funds, aim to increase the num-ber of new research grants by 7% t\u0001 Provide $2.2 billion for federal ad- vanced manufacturing R&D at the National Science Foundation, and 23 other agencies, a 19% increase over 2012. This includes funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology to advance research in smart manufacturing, nanomanu-facturing, and biomanufacturing t\u0001 Improve the patent system and protect IP by giving the US Patent and Trade-mark Office full access to its fee col-lections and strengthening its efforts to improve and speed patent reviews t\u0001 Help small businesses obtain early stage financing. Both President Obama and Governor Romney support basic stem-cell research (in addition, Obama removed the federal funding ban on broader embryonic stem-cell research in 2009), and both candidates support making the research and experi-mentation tax credit permanent. Obama would also like to increase the alternative simplified credit from 14% to 17%. Romney's official website includes his plan for American jobs and economic growth. The 160-page document includes language on R&D and basic research, but that language largely focuses on clean en-ergy spending and technologies. The core policy sections of Romney's plan\u2014tax, reg-ulation, trade, energy, labor, human capital, and fiscal management\u2014do not include medical research or science policy (other than from an educational standpoint), and my email request to the Romney campaign team about his take on NIH and FDA spending was not answered. Media reports from earlier this year note that Romney would like to shrink the NIH biomedical budget. As governor of Massa-chusetts, however, he did support the state's biotech and life-sciences industry. It will be interesting to see how the win- ning candidate's goals are carried out given that Congress largely controls the final fed-eral budget. Let's hope that, no matter how Election Day turns out, that R&D still has a significant role. PTA World without R&D Angie Drakulich Will the next US Presiden t suppor t the backbone of our industry?

It is important that scientists and researchers establish these relationships within big and small pharma, academia, government, and professional organizations, such as the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS), to help keep the industry moving forward. But, as with any relation-ship, there are bound to be challenges. Managing partnerships with CROs, for example, is a necessity for many in the pharmaceutical sector. Pharma companies have a broad strategic rationale for clinical outsourcing and are still experimenting with different CRO relationship models. According to an April 2012 report from Booz & Company, \"Nimble Partnerships in the Pharma Industry ,\" there are four types of relationship models emerging: Qualified Talent Supplier, Preferred Capacity Partner, Preferred Capability Partner, and Strategic Partner. To develop sustainable value from these relationships, companies must align the design, structure, and performance measures of their relationships with their strategy. Companies that adopt a quick, capability-centered approach to partner-ships are likely to be more focused, make better use of their distinct capabilities, and generate more value.Much of consulting is about one's net- work. Partnerships with other consultants can broaden a consultant's network, pro-vide more opportunities, and allow one to assemble a \"complete package\" for a given project. For example, if approached by a client to complete a clinical trial, I might design the trial, write the protocol, analyze the data, and write the report. But I need a partner to run and monitor the trial, complete the bioanalytical assays, possibly prepare regulatory documents, and provide a medical opinion on the safety aspects of the trial. By partnering with the right group of consultants, I can put together a \"virtual project team\" to complete the study with expertise in every required area. In recent years, industry has also taken a more collaborative approach with aca-demic research institutions. Academia holds a strong role in the advancement of drug discovery and has created great partnering relationships with compa-nies. Tightening federal budgets have put a strain on academic laboratories, and the industry is trying to cut costs and im-prove productivity by outsourcing. This environment allows for the increased opportunity for collaboration from both parties and an increased acceleration in drug discovery. AAPS recognizes the importance of partnerships in our field. During the past few years, the association has partnered and cosponsored events with numerous organizations, including FIP, FDA, ACCP, ASCPT, and GBC. In addition, the association continues to partner with its members to bring them the information, both scientific and for profes-sional development, they need. One area of focus during my presidency has been on the changing nature of our membership. Last year, AAPS created a Big Pharma/Small Pharma Task Force to identify the unique needs of the members from smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology compa-nies, CROs, and consultants, and to deter-mine how AAPS could adapt to meet their changing needs. The task force presented recommen- dations to ensure that members who are part of small pharma and biotech com-panies do not feel overshadowed by those employed in Big Pharma. These recom-mendations are particularly important to AAPS; nearly 50% of our members now reside at a small pharma/biotech company, CRO, or as a consultant. One recommen-dation was to allocate programming at this year's annual meeting (taking place Oct. 14-18 in Chicago) geared specifi-cally towards members working at small companies, which has been completed. Additionally, we have learned that there is a need for more programming on discov-ery, a primary activity of small pharma, biotech, and academia. Lastly, we're or-ganizing a summit of key pharmaceutical leaders to discuss the progression of the industry over the next 20 years. Our goal is to identify what industry, government, and academia need to be successful and how AAPS can help. AAPS continues to take steps to adapt to shifting trends through partnerships with other organizations and our mem-bers. Part of adapting to our changing industry is continuing to provide the tools that members need to access the latest information and stay connected.

Each are packed into cases of 10 with crush zones around the edges. However, these zones make the case big and fewer fit onto a pallet. The European factory ships most of its product overseas, and so they wanted to minimize the number of pallets. For this reason, they designed the small-est possible case and used no crush zones. Both products are marketed in the same country, however, we had many complaints for breakage on the EU-manufactured product and almost none on the US-manufactured prod-uct. Now we either overpack the EU-made product, or replace the case with a more protective one. Someday we'll get the EU factory to start with a more protective case.\" Forensics \"We found mold in our aseptic-filling rooms on a routine touch plate,\" com-plained our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"This is a serious issue, because most cleaning and disinfection chemicals that we used do not kill mold. We immediately closed the room and quarantined the product that had been filled since the sample was taken. We then disinfected with a mold-killing agent, applied twice over two days, and then resampled. Only after a clean bill of health did we resume filling.\"We also needed to find the source. In a review of all the relevant data, we found the same mold on an employee's gown plate and on his glove touch plate. Following further sampling, we found more mold in the bulk tank staging room. The bulk tank had been stored for an abnormally long time in a cooler, and an employee noted that there was some condensation on it, which made it an excellent place for mold to grow. We found mold in the cooler as well, so we surmised that the mold grew in the cooler and the transport vector was the bulk tank exterior. The mold must have been transferred to the product hose, which is pushed through the opening from the bulk tank staging room into the fill room. The hose was disinfected in the fill room using ethyl alcohol, which doesn't typically kill mold typi-cally. So the employee in the fill room transferred the mold around the fill room because it was on his hands from the hose. We fully disinfected the cooler and bulk tank hold rooms. The two weeks' loss of use of the fill room could have been catastrophic if not for having suf-ficient capacity in two other fill rooms,\" our Agent concluded. Guess which batch \"We got a telephone call from the Cen-ter for Biologics Evaluation and Re-search's lot-release branch,\" said our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"They said they had received a container of unlabeled samples. Without a label, they could not tell which batch each sample came from, and therefore, could not test and release any of the batches that the container purported to hold. We had to replace the samples and chide the logistics staff, who were supposed to label them before shipping. It turned out that the regular logistics staff were on vacation, so it was a new-to-the-job person who did this and clearly didn't understand all the requirements.\" All steamed up \"It started with a LAL (endotoxin) test failing for our clean steam system,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place grumbled. \"The next day, the test passed, but then two days in a row failed. This intermittent LAL out-of-specification continued, and while it did, there were also intermittent total organic carbon and particulates failures. As part of the corrective action, we cleaned some condensate traps and found them to be full of junk, including many metal filings. This gave us a clue. There had been some piping replaced in the clean steam system and it had not been properly cleaned and passivated postinstallation. We lost a week of pro-duction, but finally got it cleaned up.\" PTOnly the strong survive when it comes to pharmace utical packaging and shipping.Case Closed Pharmaceutical \"Agen t-in-Place\" column distills true-life cautionar y tales from the files of Control, a senior comp li- ance officer.

PhRMA Research and Hope Awards Presen ted Foreign firms struggle agains t stricter patent laws , but all is not lost. Report from: INDIA Swiss-based Novartis is taking India to court in a bid to seek pat- ent protection of its leukaemia drug, Glivec (known as Gleevec in US). Novartis first applied for the patent in 2006 but was denied. In similar instances, Swiss-based Roche's anticancer drug Tarceva and US-based Gilead Sciences' HIV medicine Viread have failed to secure patent protection in India. Looking back, patent laws in India have come a long way. In- dia's patent history began in 1856 with Act VI, which encouraged innovations and sharing of creations between inventors. Based on the British Patent Law of 1852, Act VI was in effect for 30 years. When the British amended the laws in 1800s, India followed suit. In 1911, the Indian Patents and Design Acts came into ef-fect whereby a Controller was installed to manage patent-related issues. When India gained independence from Great Britian, the Patent Act of 1970 was introduced to spur innovation and economic growth. It abolished the product patent system based on the \"Ayyangar Committee Report, 1959,\" which examined the factors influencing the high prices of the drugs and pharmaceu-ticals in India. The Patent Act has been revised three times since then and made compliant with the Trade-Related Aspects of In-tellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement in 2005.

India has since enforced a set of strict patent laws, and foreign players are facing obstacles in the review process, patent tracking, and pregrant and postgrant opposi-tion, says Ajaykumar Sharma, associate director, pharma and biotech, healthcare practice of Frost and Sullivan (South Asia and Middle East). The interpretation of different sections of the Patent Act of 2005 and review of application remain the big-gest challenge. This challenge is increased by the lack of trained manpower that further delays the review process. The Indian Patent Office, additionally, does not have an efficient database system to facilitate searchable full text databases of all patents and applications. Foreign players continue to face an increase in pregrant and postgrant opposition by generic-drug companies. Litigation and infringement cases usually take longer to resolve. India has enforced stricter patent laws compared to other countries such as South Africa. For a drug to be patentable in India, the invention has to be novel (i.e., new to the industry), inventive, and industrially applicable. In contrast, weak patent standards and the absence of a patent agency in South Africa have resulted in the granting of a high number of patents yearly. In 2008 alone, South Africa issued a total of 2442 patents. The Indian patent agency has set a higher bar for patent ap- proval that is frustrating pharmaceutical manufacturers who are deeply concerned over the agency's standpoint of intellec-tual property in the country. In Novartis' case, the company is challenging the efficacy clause stated in Section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Law. However, the Indian agency views its deci-sion as a move to curb the \"evergreening\" practice, whereby a drug is tweaked slightly in a bid to extend patent protection. Specifically, the Novartis patent application was denied on the grounds that the drug lacks innovation because it is considered a salt formulation of the drug and not a new drug altogether. If Novartis gets its way with the patent, the decision could result in a flood of new patent applications and possibly threaten patients' access to essential drugs tagged at afford-able prices. More significantly, it may upset India's position as a generic-drug manufacturer and role to provide affordable drugs to other developing countries. The Indian Patent Law has also made provisions for the Controller of Patents to issue compulsory licenses to deal with extreme or emergency situations. Recently, it gave ap-proval to Natco Pharma to produce the generic version of Nexavar. As a result, Natco is able to price the drug at $158 for a 120-tablet package. Despite the concerted efforts to provide low-cost drugs, the problem of poor medical access is still prevalent in the country. To date, a significant number of infants (aged 12 to 23 months) have yet to be fully vaccinated against six major childhood diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio and measles) even though the Indian government has made these primary vaccination programs free across the country. Tapan J. Ray, director-general of the Organization of Pharmaceuti-cal Producers of India, an association of R&D pharmaceutical companies in India, says: \"Only a short focus on the rejuve- nation of the fragile healthcare delivery system, healthcare financing, and rapid development of healthcare infrastructure by the government or public private partnership will address the access issue.\" It is also impractical to envisage that the granting of com- pulsory license will resolve the issue of access to patented medicines on a long-term basis. Granting of these licenses should only be done after exhausting all access improvement measures, Ray says. Sharma adds, \"Compulsory license should not be a bench- mark for possible future decisions taken by the government. But I foresee a need and evolution of a new business model that will reach out to the masses by foreign players. This can take place possibly in the forms of differential price launches, pa-tient assistance programs, or state medical purchase policies.\" Asked whether it is possible to strike a balance between maximizing profits and providing patient access to drugs, Sharma comments that this can be achieved through dif-ferential pricing. For example, GlaxoSmithKline's Ventolin asthma inhaler is priced at the lowest level possible for the lowest-income patients, Flixotide at a lower discount for those with higher incomes, and Diskus priced highest for citizens with the highest incomes. Roche is working on details to offer discounted versions of two cancer drugs, Herceptin and Mab-Thera, in India by early next year. Given the current restricted parameters, foreign companies should start looking for innovative engagement models to op-erate on Indian soil, Sharma says. In fact, mergers and acquisi-tions have taken place between foreign and Indian firms. In 2010, Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories' acquisition of Mum-bai-based Piramal Healthcare for $3.7 billion has brought its market share in India to approximately 7%, and the company is expecting revenues to grow an estimated 20% a year to more than $2.5 billion by 2020, propelling the company to the leading position in the Indian market. In January 2011, Bayer Healthcare has inked a joint venture agreement with Mumbai-based Zydus Cadila in a bid to enhance its presence in India. \u2014Jane Wan is a freelance writer based in Singapore CSR and sustainability forum Pharmaceutical Technology's Sourc ing and Managem ent eNewsletter provides specialized coverage of the bio/pharmaceutical industry's activities in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability as well as developments from other business sectors, government organizations, professional, trade, and scientific associations, and NGOs.

A. The best approach to deal with an observation with which a company does not agree is to prevent an FDA-483 observation in the first place. During the course of an FDA in- spection, there will be many opportu-nities to ascertain the areas of interest and potential areas of concern of the investigator. The clearest opportunity to understand the true concerns of the investigator will be during the periodic wrap-up sessions, which should occur on a daily basis per Investigations Op- erations Manual (IOM) Section 5.2.3: \"... investigators and analysts should make every reasonable effort to discuss all observations with the management of the establishment as they are ob-served, or on a daily basis, to minimize surprises, errors, and misunderstand-ings when the FDA 483 is issued...\" (1). FDA investigators are human beings just like the rest of us and mistakes or misunderstanding can happen. The agency encourages the industry to use these communication opportunities to ask questions or request clarification, and if during the course of these com-munication opportunities it becomes apparent that there is an area of mis-interpretation or misunderstanding, additional information or documenta-tion should be presented quickly and clearly. It is highly encouraged that a professional posture be maintained, even when a company does not agree with the investigator. It is better for both the company and for FDA if any and all observations on the FDA-483 are understood, are factually accurate, and are grounded in law or regulation. The ability to take prompt corrective action is another advantage of having periodic discussions during the inspec-tion. While corrective action may not prevent an FDA-483 observation, it will mitigate the impact and demonstrate to the agency how the executive manage-ment is committed to compliance. Any corrective actions taken in response to a potential FDA-483 observation should be comprehensive in scope and should address the underlying system problem. The FDA-483 is not a final agency action and does not represent an agency level position. It is a list of objectionable conditions observed by the investigator(s) during the course of the inspection which are, in the in-Regulation and Compliance Q&A with David Elder and Richard Wright of Strategic Compliance Consulting, PAREXEL International. Both Elder and Wright formerly served with FDA. David Elder is a principa l cons ultant at PAREXEL and for- mer senior officia l with FDA. Richard Wright is a principa l cons ultant with PAREXEL and former investigator with FDA.

The investigator owns the FDA-483; once issued, it would be a very rare exception to the rule to have it revised and reissued. In fact, the IOM limits such conditions to errors discovered prior to leaving the facility and errors discovered after leaving the facility (see IOM, Section 5.2.3.1.6). The only real fruitful areas of discourse are, therefore, factual inaccuracy and ob-servations that do not accurately rep-resent violations of law or regulation. Once the FDA-483 is issued, the best opportunity to deal with an observa-tion with which you do not agree (and which contains a factual inaccuracy or does not accurately represent viola-tions of law/regulation) is within the FDA-483 response, which should be submitted within 15 days of the con-clusion of the inspection. It is perfectly appropriate to present information and evidence in an FDA-483 response that repeats, and augments as appropriate, that which was provided during the inspection in addition to completely addressing all other observations, in-cluding those presented verbally by the investigator. If all efforts undertaken do not achieve the desired result, keep in mind that it is only after further agency review that the objectionable conditions listed on the FDA-483 may be considered to be violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or other statutes (see IOM Section 5.2.7) and, therefore, subject to consideration for regulatory action.

The statistics surrounding AD have been plaguing fami lies for decades. The disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the US today, according to the Alzheimer 's Associa tion, with 5.4 mil- lion peop le currently affected. By the year 2050 , one American will develop AD every 33 seconds. The costs surrounding AD, from both a financia l and time perspec tive, are also dishear tening. The Alzheimer 's Associa tion notes that the US spends an estimated $200 billion on AD per year, and fami lies across America and around the globe are all too aware of the intense care and attention that AD patients require. These are just some of the reasons why PhRMA has focused on AD for its awards program , which launched this year, replacing the PhRMA Discover's awards program. In terms of the day-to-day work being done to find a treatment and impro ve care, the 2012 PhRMA Research and Hope Awards honor the following : -The Research & Hope Award for Academic Research in Alzheimer's: Bradley T. Hyman , MD, PhD, Professor Holtzman , Andrew B. and Gretchen P. Jones Professor and Chairman ; Department of Neurology, Washing ton University Schoo l of Medicine. Hyman 's labora tory is looking to develop methods to examine clinica l-pathologica l corre lates and biomarkers in AD, as well as anima l and cell mode ls to explore the natu- ral history of the disease. Holtzman 's team has been focusing on how apoE influences Abeta metabolism and the risk for AD, the influence of synaptic activity and sleep on Abeta metabolism, the potential ability of anti-Abeta antibodies to act therape utically and diagnos tically in AD, and new methods to study protein metabolism in the CNS for both diagnos tic and theranos tic purposes. -The Research & Hope Award for Biopharmaceutical Industry Research in Alzheimer's: The Merck BACE Team , including Eric M. Parker , Senior Director and Neuroscience Site Lead; Andrew W. Stamford , Director, Discovery Chemis try; Matthew E. Kenned y, Associa Director, Neuroscience ; Mark S. Forman , Director, Clinica l Research ; and Julie A. Stone, Senior Scientific Director. The BACE team is evaluating the safety and efficac y of the beta-amyloid prec tors, including MK-8931, which is Merck 's lead AD pipe line compo und. Clinica l trial results to date evalu- ating the safety and tolerabi lity of MK-8931 in 40 healthy adults aged 18 to 45 associa ted single doses with marked reductions in amy- loid beta peptide concen tration levels. -The Research & Hope Award for Patient Advocacy : Kate Maslow at the Keck Center Institute of Medicine (IOM). Maslow, a scho l- ar-in-residence at the IOM Nationa l Academ y of Sciences , is focusing on issues tied to the care of peop le with AD and other demen tias Maslow previously spent 15 years at the Alzheimer 's Associa tion, directing practice and policy initiatives to impro ve the qual- ity, coordina tion, and healthcare outcomes of long-term services and supports for AD patients and their caregi vers. -The Research & Hope Award for Volunteer Champion: Neha Chauhan at the AFA Teens for Alzheimer 's Awareness.

Afte r years of resistance, generic-drug maker s agreed last year to provide funds to FD A to support speedier approval of abbrevi - ated new drug applications (ANDAs ) and prior approval supplements (PASs) , as well as timely inspection of domesti c and foreign manufacturers and suppli - ers of APIs . To launch the new fee program o n Oct. 1, 2012, FDA issued a wave o f Federal Registe r notices an d guidance r documents in August 2012 that of - ficially inform manufacturers of rel - evant procedures and obligations. Th e various fees authorized by GDUF A will provide $299 million in fundin g for FDA in fiscal year 2013 and $1. 5 billion over five years. Applicatio n fees of approximately $50,000 will ad d up to almost $100 million, primaril y from payments on an expected 750 to 900 ANDAs each year, plus some 75 0 supplements. Approximately $15 mil - lion will be levied on newly reference d (type II) drug master files (DMFs) o n a one-time basis according to a fairl y complex process; an FDA Q&A guid - ance spells out specifics on this an d other issues and how fees will be cal - culated (1) .Identifying facilitie s Approximately $175 million in fees wil l be levied annually on facilities operate d by manufacturers of both finished dos - age forms (FDFs) and API producers, th e majority (approximately $140 million ) collected for FDFs. The payments will b e $15,000-$30,000 higher for foreign fa - cilities to reflect added inspection costs , and plants that produce both finishe d drugs and APIs will pay both fees. On e tricky issue is how to account for facili - ties with several buildings at one site . Such complexes may owe only one fe e if FDA determines that the site can b e inspected at one time, based on activitie s and ownership structure.

In addition to determining who ha s to ante up, FDA expects the facilit y identification program will provid e important information to promot e global supply chain transparency. Th e data will go into new generic-drug fa - cility databases, which will provide in - formation to help FDA address globa l supply chain issues. Among othe r stated goals, FDA will conduct bien - nial GMP surveillance inspections o f generic API producers and produc t manufacturers, with the aim to achiev e parity in inspection frequency betwee n foreign and domestic firms in 2017 . Cutting the backlo g FDA's Office of Generic Drugs (OGD ) also will collect a one-time ANDA back - log fee this year on pending ANDAs , which will generate an expected $50 mil - lion to support the processing of almos t 3000 ANDAs currently in the applicatio n queue.

Ideally, the two halves of a split tablet would be identical, but there are no standards for ensuring that result. FDA issued draft guidance in August 2011 proposing criteria for evaluating and labeling scored brand and generic products. The United States Pharma- copeia also is examining the issue for a General Chapter on uniformity of dosage units. At issue is whether scoring yields consistent split doses and how to evalu-ate the stability and friability of the splits. The agency sought advice on the rec- ommendations in its draft guidance at the August 2012 meeting of the Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Science and Clinical Pharmacology. Key top-ics discussed were how to assess ease of splitting, loss of mass, and variations in weight as an indication of content uni-formity. Also on the agenda was whether to apply standards just to new products and to permit existing scored drugs to remain as is. The advisors agreed that a test for content uniformity should not in-volve tablet splitting by patients, as that would inject too much variability into the evaluation process. But there were ques-tions about the value of stability data on split products and the status of marketed scored drugs. FDA is, therefore, headed back to the drawing board to clarify scor-ing and splitting test proposals. Opportunities with orphan drugs Pharmaceutical manufacturers are eye-ing the orphan-drug market as a source of growth, as revenues and profits for widely used medicines fail to keep pace with new cancer therapies and other crit-ical treatments for small patient popula-tions. Despite limited markets, orphans accounted for $50 billion in global sales for 2011, according to an August report by Thomson Reuters. These select thera- pies benefit from extended exclusivity that can delay generic competition, as well as speedy FDA approvals based on smaller clinical trials. The analysts ex-pect growth to continue for new orphan drugs, as well as expanded indications for initial therapies. Fast track safety? Despite pressure on FDA from patient groups and industry to moderate test-ing requirements and accelerate reviews of new drugs, particularly therapies for seriously ill patients, critics continue to complain that \"fast track,\" \"priority re-view,\" and \"accelerated approval\" poli-cies permit harmful products to reach the market. The latest entry to the de-bate comes from Thomas Moore of the Institute for Safe Medicine Practice and Curt Furburg, professor at Wake For-est School of Medicine, who identify safety issues for three drugs recently ap-proved under expeditious approaches. Their analysis in the Sept. 5 Journal of the American Medical Association cites one therapy for seriously ill cancer pa-tients, which carries a limited distribu-tion program. Another drug aims to prevent multiple sclerosis relapse and is subject to tight postmarketing review. More problematic is the blood thinner Pradaxa for stroke prevention, which has experienced serious adverse events since it was approved in 2010. The remedy, according to Moore and Furburg, is longer clinical trials and ex-tensive analysis to ensure that benefits outweigh risks of new therapies. Their conclusion contradicts efforts in Con-gress to expand expedited review for breakthrough drugs. And it runs coun-ter to a main theme of the new FDA user-fee legislation (PDUFA IV), which calls on the agency to acknowledge pa-tients' willingness to accept risk with new therapies. More data on drug samples FDA is implementing a new program that requires pharmaceutical manufac-turers to submit data on drug sample distribution, a provision of the Afford-able Care Act (ACA) of 2010 that aims to increase transparency in industry interactions with doctors and prescrib-ers. Data submission officially began on Apr. 1, 2012, but FDA didn't issue guidance on how to submit data until Apr. 3, 2012 and, thus, said it would not enforce the requirements until Oct. 1, 2012. Under the new program, drug-makers have to file data that identify distributed samples and recipient phy-sicians every April 1st for activities dur-ing the previous year, using the FDA Electronic Submissions Gateway and the XML data scheme. The ACA program overlaps to some extent with policies set by the Prescrip-tion Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which requires manufacturers to main-tain records of all samples distributed by sales representatives to licensed practi-tioners. For PDMA, however, companies do not submit the data to FDA, but hold it for three years. The aim is to track theft or illegal diversion of drugs and to prevent adulterated medicines from reaching consumers, explained John Oroho of Porzio LifeSciences at CBI's Forum on Aggregate Spend in August 2012. The ACA program aims to identify which drug samples are going to specific healthcare professionals, similar to \"Sun-shine\" provisions elsewhere in the health reform legislation that focus on disclos-ing which doctors receive payments and gifts from the pharmaceutical industry. The PDMA and ACA programs are expected to \"mesh seamlessly,\" accord-ing to FDA officials, but manufacturers are skeptical. Complicating the picture is a new drug sample disclosure program in Vermont that went into effect April 1. Definitions and data submission re-quirements differ for Vermont, the ACA transparency program, and PDMA. For example, Vermont specifies that manu-facturers do not have to submit data on drugs provided for clinical trials or re-search, but there is no similar caveat under the ACA policy. Just what FDA or Vermont will do with this informa-tion remains to be seen.Hot-Topic RoundupIntroducing BilcareOptima Scientic analysis of your product for optimum packaging solutions and faster speed to market.

An August Federal Register no- tice further encourages manufacturers to withdraw backlogged applications that they no longer wish to pursue (3). The agency calculated that if 2000 ap-plications remain in the backlog (of the 3000 pending in August), the backlog fee would be $25,000 per application. FDA also promises to meet a range of GDUFA performance goals outlined in a commitment letter to manufacturers that is structured similarly to programs that have been in place for brand drugs for 20 years (4). Under a phased-in ap-proach, FDA will \"review and act on\" 60% of ANDA submissions within 15 months by the third year of the program; the timeframe tightens in year five to review of 90% of submissions within 10 months. ANDA evaluation will take longer if a manufacturer files major amendments during the review process, and OGD won't accept an ANDA until the application fee is paid, a situation that could be important in determining which generic firm is \"first to file.\" OGD will strive to clarify review deci- sions by issuing complete response letters and DMF \"completeness assessments,\" instituting rolling reviews, and holding first cycle deficiency meetings with spon- sors. If minor problems crop up during a review, OGD staff will try to inform sponsors of \"easily correctable deficien-cies\" that can be remedied quickly. OGD reviewers expect that issues raised in com-plete response letters will be addressed initially through teleconferences with the agency; eventually GDUFA will provide time and resources for sponsors to meet with OGD reviewers in person to discuss specific complete response letter issues. Sponsors still may file applications on paper, but FDA does not have to meet user-fee performance goals un-less the ANDA is filed electronically, a process that FDA expects will become universal in the near future. FDA would like to see continued improve-ment in the quality of applications to reduce the frequent back-and-forth questioning that routinely delays ap-provals. OGD has been encouraging generic-drug makers to adopt quality-by-design (QbD) approaches by issu-ing sample pharmaceutical develop-ment reports with QbD principles for both immediate-release and modified-Under a phased -in approach , on\" 60% of ANDA submissio ns withi n 15 months by the third year of the program. 34 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comRegulatory Watch release solid oral dosage forms. The agency recently updated its Question-Based Review system to incorporate QbD models and has tightened initial criteria for filing ANDAs to discourage incomplete submissions. OGD has es-tablished a central system to track the progress and status of each application as it moves through the review process, and a broader OGD quality manage-ment system aims to clearly document procedures to provide more consis-tency across review divisions. Some of the GDUFA revenues also will support development of further guidance and research to facilitate development of more complex generic products, such as anti-epileptic drugs and inhaled products. FDA held a public meeting in Septem- ber to review with manufacturers these and other program implementation is-sues. GDUFA policies also were a prime topic at the PDA/FDA Joint Regulatory Conference on September 11, 2012 in Baltimore and at the fall technical con-ference on Oct. 2-3 sponsored by the Ge-neric Pharmaceutical Association. Implementing GDUFA will involve a significant expansion in OGD staff on all levels, along with extensive train-ing for new hires and expanded IT systems. To provide the broader man-agement structure needed to oversee this more complex generic drug pro-gram, CDER director Janet Woodcock recently announced plans to elevate OGD to a \"super office\" with other of-fices reporting to it. Instead of being part of CDER's Office of Pharmaceuti-cal Science (OPS), OGD will be a par-allel umbrella organization, similar to CDER's Office of New Drugs and Office of Compliance. New OGD di-rector Greg Geba will head the super OGD, reporting directly to Woodcock and better positioned to work with CDER's Office of Executive Programs on GDUFA implementation. The larger plan is to replace OPS with a new Office of Pharmaceutical Qual-ity (OPQ), which will be responsible for overseeing drug quality throughout the product lifecycle. The new OPQ will absorb certain OPS functions as well as some activities performed by the Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality in the Office of Compliance. And, when we went to press, there was considerable anxiety that Congress would fail to enact an FDA appropria-tions bill by Oct. 1, which is needed for the agency to collect any 2013 user fees. Hopefully, that impass will be remedied by the time you read this report. References 1.

Although this year's LOEs were well-anticipated, a confluence of unex-pected financial events and negative con-ditions in key global markets are creating additional challenges for a pharmaceutical industry seeking sustainable growth. Declining first-half sales for top pharma Among the leading (top 10 in global rev-enues) multinational pharmaceutical companies, first-half 2012 sales fell by $8 billion, or 3%, globally from the year-ago period. The Eurozone crisis contrib-uted to this decline as European aggre-gate sales fell 6% in the first half of 2012, reflecting a weaker pricing environment for branded drugs as well as increased generic-drug substitution. Emerging markets have been a growth driver for pharma in the last several years, with aggregate sales rising 12% in 2011. It is a different picture for 2012, however, as first-half sales growth for emerging mar-kets decelerated to approximately 7%, principally due to slower growth in gross domestic product and declining transac-tion volume, particularly mergers and acquisitions. Although pharma's appetite for inorganic growth in emerging mar-kets remains strong, those markets have become increasingly competitive, creating challenges to getting deals done. Also, gov-ernment policies intended to support local industry are affecting market share and pressuring prices, albeit volume growth generally has remained strong. As a result, some pharmaceutical companies may be concluding that growth could be better realized in markets where uncertainty ap-pears to be decreasing. For all the concerns about the United States, the \"known un-knowns\" in the US may be better than the \"unknown unknowns\" that characterize some emerging market countries. US bolt-on deals back in vogue? Following the US Supreme Court's de-cision in June to uphold the Affordable Care Act and the US Federal Reserve re- affirming its stance to keep interest rates low through 2014, the US life-sciences in-dustry could be moving into a new phase of heightened domestic deal activity. In the third quarter of 2012 in the US, there were several noteworthy mergers and ac-quisitions featuring Big Pharma: almost all were under $10 billion in value. These bolt-on deals are likely to continue as a core strategy given that overall industry growth is projected to remain anemic over the next several years. Dividends and buybacks on the rise As the pharmaceutical industry faces negative revenue growth, profit growth has waned even after waves of cost-cutting. Companies have responded to shareholders' demands by increasing dividends and buying back stock. The pharmaceutical industry's historic rela-tively unlevered balance sheets may be changing as debt-to-equity ratios rise to an estimated 18% this year versus 9% in 2007. Also, with payout ratios for many top life-sciences companies hovering around 40% and with less willingness to lever up, this constraints on financial resources mean that megamergers ap-pear increasingly unlikely. For certain multinationals, the answer has been to \"grow smaller,\" by optimizing growth by divesting noncore or underperforming operations. With most of the top phar-mas facing similar strategic challenges\u2014modest near-term growth prospects with increased investor scrutiny of capital al-location\u2014we could see a continuation of the recent wave of divestitures. Hopeful signs emerging This year is likely to be remembered by new lows in growth rates. Although 2013 appears challenging, too, there are three reasons to view the glass as half-full: t\u0001 Several recent FDA approvals in obe- sity, cardiovascular, and oncology, after a dearth in brand pipeline ap-provals could revive domestic growth. t\u0001 The implementation of healthcare reform in the US could jumpstart growth in 2014. t\u0001 Restructuring and diversification into businesses with less exposure to patent cliffs (e.g., consumer, animal-health) are beginning to pay off. For the past several years, the industry has made difficult strategic decisions, cut costs, and expanded into more promising markets while exploring new business models with a goal of achieving more growth with less risk. Most optimistically, pharmaceutical stocks have recently outperformed the major aver-ages, and for 2012, have pulled even in per-formance after years of lagging. Forward-looking, investors may be signaling that the worst days are likely behind us. PT Andrew Forman, Transaction Advisory Services, Ernst & Young.

Andrew Forma nShifts in Pharma Capital Agendas Peace of mind with triple A polishing technologies38 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comSTATISTICAL SOLUTIONS PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGES PharmTech.com/statsPharmTech.com/stats Since the mid to late 1800s, statisticians and mathematicians have been devel-oping increasingly useful statistical tools and statistical theory. Statisticians and nonstatisticians alike have readily adopted some of these tools and theories. Explor-atory data analysis (EDA), for example, was quickly accepted within and outside the field of statistics (1). Other tools languish forgotten for years and even decades before being accepted by mainstream users. An example is the Plackett-Berman designed approach to experimentation. Published in 1946, the experiments were not appreciated and used until the early 1980s (2). Evolutionary operation Another valuable tool that has yet to gain wide acceptance is an optimization tech-nique known as evolutionary operation (EVOP) ( 3). EVOP is experimentation done in real time on the manufacturing process itself. Small changes are made to the current process, and a large amount of data is taken and analyzed. The changes are small enough that the process still makes acceptable products and remains in a state of control. The small changes are compensated by the large amount of data collected. The designs are simple fac-torials which, when analyzed, direct the process to a new point of operation that is more optimal for the critical quality at-tributes. This process is repeated until no further optimization is achieved. Also, for processes that vary with input materi-als and environment, it is possible to track and maintain optimality over time. This achievement is the ultimate in continuous improvement philosophy. George Box and Normal Draper, both highly regarded and pragmatic statisti-cians, stated the goal in the preface of Evo- lutionary Operation . \"What originally mo- tivated the introduction of EVOP, however, was the idea that the widespread and daily use of simple statistical design and analysis during routine production by process op-eratives themselves could reap enormous additional rewards\" (4). And it should be said that there would be an increase in quality as well. Why was this theory not wildly and immediately accepted in the 1970s? Com-panies had often spent years working to make their processes achieve a certain level of performance. Even if that level of performance was poor, management was not going to let anyone, particularly floor operators, start experimenting with an ac-cepted process. Are we still at that point today? Yes, but changes in the industry and at FDA may make EVOP a tool whose time has come. The combined intersections of process analytical technology (PAT), risk analysis, quality by design (QbD), the ICH troika of Q8, Q9, and Q10, and the strong emphasis of continuous improvement may provide a window of opportunity. Additional tools The designs in Box and Draper are based on full and fractional factorials. A further discussion with an extensive example can be found in chapter 15 of Box, Hunter, and Hunter (5).A second design approach uses a sim- plex or triangle as the basis of the data col- lection. (See reference 6 for a full textbook presentation.) Finally, Charles Hendrix states, \"An- other popular method of optimization works very much like a game of leapfrog. It begins with a patterned set of experiments in all of the interesting variables. (For ex-ample, an eight-run Placket Burman or fractional factorial with seven factors.) The pattern is a triangle in two variables, a tetrahedron in three variables, or a sim-plex (i.e., a multidimensional triangle) in four or more variables. When this pattern of experiments has been run, the experi-ment that gave the worst result is identified. This experiment is then discarded and replaced by a new experiment according to a definite rule. When the replacement experiment has been run, the worst of the set is again identified and discarded. This continues until no further improvement is observed. This method is called ... self di-rected optimization, or just SDO\" (7). Has EVOP's time arrived? The po- tential is enormous and worth a serious investigation. References 1. J.W. Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis (Addi- son-Wesley, Reading, PA 1977). 2. R. L. Plackett and J. P.

Combination therapies provide an opportunity for in-novator drug companies to extend the lifecycle of a given API by developing a fixed-dose combination product that may offer improved and synergistic efficacy, im-proved dosing regimes, and greater patient compliance. Combination drugs also allow specialty pharmaceutical companies to use specialized drug-delivery and formulation strategies for product differentiation. Chal-lenges, however, exist in developing fixed-dose combination products compared with single API products, such as maintaining the physical and chemical stability of the APIs and modulating drug release. Regulatory framework Combination products encompass a wide range of products, including drug-device combinations. By regulatory definition, a combination product is a product com- posed of any combination of a drug and a device; a biological product and a device; a drug and a biological product; or a drug, device, and a biological product (1, 2). Under 21 CFR 3.2 (e), a combination prod- uct is defined to include: t\u0001\"A product comprised of two or more regulated components (i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic) that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity\" (e.g., a monoclonal antibody combined with a therapeutic drug, a device coated or impregnated with a drug or bio-logic, prefilled syringes, insulin t\u0001 \"Two or more separate products pack- aged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug prod-ucts\" (e.g., drug or biological product packaged with a delivery device). t\u0001\"\u0001ESVH \u0001EFWJDF \u0001PS\u0001CJPMPHJDBM \u0001QSPEVDU \u0001 packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or bio- logical product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and...the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed (e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administra- tion, or significant change in dose).\" t\u0001\"Any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its pro-posed labeling is for use only with another individually specified inves-tigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indica-tion, or effect\" (e.g., photosensitiz-ing drugs and activating laser/light sources and iontophoretic drug de-livery patches and controllers) (1-3). In fiscal year 2011, FDA received 288 original applications classified into nine categories of combination products (see Table I ). These applications included 26 new drug applications and 134 new investigational new drug applications, of which the majority were drug-device combinations (see Table I) (2). Combination products also include oral fixed-dose combination drugs of two or more APIs in a single product form (i.e., tablet and capsule). According to 21 CFR 300.50, \"two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component makes a contribution to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and ef-fective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as de-fined in the labeling for the drug\" (4).

Earlier in 2012, Boehringer Ingel-heim and Eli Lilly received FDA approved for Jentadueto (linagliptin and metformin hydrochloride [HCl]) for treating Type II diabetes. In January 2011, Boehringer In-gelheim and Eli Lilly formed a strategic al-liance in diabetes, and Boehringer Ingel-heim partnered with the CDMO Patheon, in a three-year deal announced in October 2011, for developing fixed-dose combina-tion drugs to treat Type II diabetes. As part of their diabetes alliance, AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb developed Kombig-lyze XR (saxagliptin HCl HCl), which was approved in 2010. In Au-gust 2012, the companies expanded their alliance following Bristol-Myers Squibb's acquisition of Amylin Pharmaceuticals. Merck & Co. received approval earlier this year for Janumet XR, an extended-release formulation of its fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin phosphate and metformin HCl (see Table II ). Gilead Sciences received FDA approval for two fumurate) in 2012\u2014and received a new indication of treating HIV infection in 2010 with Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil hemifurmate, the API in its antihypertensive drug Tekturna. In received with one of for the combination product, Tribenzor (olmesartan medoxil, amlodipine besylate, and hydrochlorothia-zide), which FDA approved in 2010. Bayer gained approval for several oral contracep-tive fixed-dose combinations (see Table II) . Formulation strategies Fixed-dose combination therapies are a challenge. The presence of an additional API or APIs adds complexity to the for-mulation in maintaining the physical and chemical stability of the APIs, mitigating interactions (i.e., API-API, API-excipient, excipient-excipient), reconciling incom-patible pharmacokinetics, and addressing differing drug-release rates and targets in drug delivery. Some ways to address these problems in solid-dosage fixed dose com-binations include monolayer tablets, bilayer tablets, trilayer tablets, inlay tables, and pel-lets or granules in capsules (6). Recently approved fixed-dose combina- tion products use various strategies. Merck & Co.'s Janumet XR is an extended-release metformin core tablet coated with an immediate-release layer of sitagliptin. The sitagliptin layer is coated with a soluble polymeric film (7).

Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 4748 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.com Technical Forum: Disposables Disposables have been widely adopted for commercial-scale bioprocessing, but use of these technologies for downstream processing has lagged behind that for other applications. PharmTech spoke with industry experts about the challenges of implementing disposable chromatograpy systems. Participating in the roundtable are Eric Grund, PhD, senior director of bio-pharma applications at GE Healthcare, Marc Bisschops, PhD, scientific director at Tarpon Biosystems, Tracy Thompson, CEO of Polybatics, Fred Mann, PhD, pro-gram manager, biopharm process solutions at Merck Millipore, and Stephen Tingley, vice-president, bioprocessing sales and marketing at Repligen. Barriers to implemetation PharmTech: Chromatography has been one of the last components of the biopro-cessing train to be adapted for single-use. What are the constraints of the chromatog-raphy process that have proved challenging to implement in single-use format? Grund (GE Healthcare): The biggest constraint to single-use is probably a men-tal barrier based on a narrow view of the pros and cons. Chromatography media are often very tolerant to cleaning and with-stand re-use, so it's tough to throw them away after single-use, especially if tests show they still perform well after many cycles. The benefits of speed, facility flex- IMAGE: INFLUX PRODUCTIONS, PHOTODISK, GETTY IMAGESibility, facility output, and avoidance of cleaning are not yet fully appreciated. Bisschops (Tarpon Biosystems): This statement is absolutely true for applications that involve capture of the product and/or some high resolution polishing steps. For flow-through applications (or negative chromatography), membrane adsorbers have already paved the way for disposable chromatography. One of the most important reasons why chromatography has not been available in a disposable format is caused by the nature of the chromatography process itself: it is essentially a mass driven process, where the size of the column is governed by the amount of product that needs to be bound. For membrane processes and other flow-through applications, the most important system dimensions are determined by the volume that needs to be processed. As a result, the successful introduction of disposable bioprocessing has largely been enabled by the process intensification that resulted from the increases in expres-sion levels over the past decade. In essence, this has allowed us to produce the same amount of product with much less water and hence with a significantly reduced volume. All volume-driven unit operations have benefited from this, whereas the mass driven processes were not affected. Everybody acknowledges that the costs of chromatography media currently are too high to justify a single-use application. These costs need to be depreciated over many cycles in order to make the econ-omy work. This hampers the translation of batch-wise chromatographic processes into a single-use or disposable application, unless one uses a technology that would allow one to use the media over so many cycles in a single batch or in a campaign. Thompson (Polybatics): Columns are very expensive systems, and the cost of buying these large chromatography systems is a cost that companies are re-luctant to walk away from. Also, the cost of buying the resins themselves are fairly expensive, particularly Protein A. Protein A has been on patent until around March 2010, so there's been a monopoly on that particular ligand, which has maintained a very high price of the resin. I think those two factors have been a real impediment Disposable Chromatography Moderated by Amy Ritter50 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comto going to a disposable chromatography system. And there hasn't been anyone out there who has come up with a format that is truly comparable to traditional packed-bed chromatography in terms of its ability to purify and capture the target. In terms of implementation, packing of the columns is very fussy. You pump a slurry into the column, and have to let it settle. If it doesn't settle quite right, you can get voids in the column, and you have to pack again. There's a lot of art in packing the column to get it to perform right. One of the problems of implementing a dispos-able system is finding a medium that can either be pumped into fixed columns or finding a complete cartridge that is kind of plug-and-play. Until recently, there haven't been those kinds of plug-and-play systems. Mann (Merck Millipore): Chroma- tography processes, while not fully single-use, have been operating in a hybrid way for some time with the implementation of single-use bags for buffers and product collection. Elimination of stainless-steel tanks and replacement with single-use bags is, together with the use of single-use bioreactors, the biggest contributor to cost savings when comparing single-use to tra-ditional stainless-steel facilities. This is due to the elimination of clean-in-place (CIP) and steam-in-place (SIP) for tank/vessel cleaning. In contrast, the chromatography system is cleaned by process buffers includ-ing sodium hydroxide and does not need a separate CIP system. Constraints of the chromatography process that make it difficult to imple-ment as a disposable system include first, the greater complexity of the flow path in chromatography systems compared with other unit operations, for example the number of valves required to enable mul-tiple buffer inlets, column flow reversal and bypass and fraction outlet. Coupled to this has been the greater number of dif- ferent sensors deployed and the operating range and accuracy required of those sen-sors. Second, the cost of chromatography resins, especially the affinity resins such as protein A, has meant they tend to be used for multiple batches requiring cleaning and storage between times and so are not seen as single-use per se. Tingley (Repligen) : If we take a look at the process as a whole, and we look at the adoption curve of single-use technologies, you can essentially split the process into functional and nonfunctional technolo-gies. It's the nonfunctional technologies that have taken the lead because they've been easier to implement and easier to get to an economical cost point than the functional technologies. Examples of non-functional technologies would be replac-ing stainless-steel pipework with plastic tubing, or replacing stainless-steel tanks with plastic bags. When you start looking at the process, for instance, a bioreactor or filtration technology such as ultrafiltration or microfiltration, these are examples of functional technologies, which have to be disposable. Making functional technology costs money, and functional technologies are often reused to defray some of the costs. It just so happens that one of the most complex of the functional technologies is purification. That includes capture, using Protein A which we know is an extremely expensive chromatography resin, and hy-drophobic interaction or ion exchange or multimode resins which are also reason-ably expensive. And processes use a lot of them\u2014that's multiple tens of liters mul-tiplied by multiple thousands of dollars. With chromatography, it's a very expensive, very critical functional technology that is hard to get into a single-use format. So, there are two parts of the problem: can you make a disposable or single-use container for the chromatography, that is, a column, and then, can you make a single-use media or functional element to go into that. That's the problem that's made it so intractable. When people want to move to single- use technologies, they may be reducing column sizes and cycling them harder. What users are doing is making the media work harder, so it's less painful to throw it away. What you're seeing today is compa-nies offering the easy part, the containment part, of the disposable chromatography, the column shells, and packing them. The dif-ficult part of the technology is finding new ways to stretch the economics of running longer, running smaller batches, cycling the columns more often, and things like that. Choosing a disposable platform PharmTech: A few disposable chromatog- raphy platforms are currently available, in-cluding packed-bed, simulated moving bed (SMB), and membrane chromatography. What are the factors that would influence the choice of platform for a process? Grund (GE Healthcare): Packed beds are used in steps following feed clarifica-tion, when binding capacity and resolving power are prioritized. Conventionally, the first step in downstream purification is product capture, in bind/elute mode, and a packed bed is needed to achieve the objec-tives of the unit operation. The question of whether or not to use SMB is different. Frequently, a small num-ber of cycles is used to handle large volumes of feed. SMB takes this further by provid-ing a continuous processing approach with several small columns cycled in sequence. Generally, SMB offers higher loading ca-pacity, greater exploitation of resin life, and more efficient use of buffers. So, SMB can be a door-opener to using disposable chro-matography columns because small col-umns are used for multiple cycles to handle material from the bioreactor. This helps ad-dress the cost equation because the resin is used for many cycles before disposal. Accurate control and synchronization of the different phases in the chromatography cycle is critical. Single-use components are attractive in SMB since they assure repro-ducible performance and avoid multiple column-packing in the production work-flow. The downside in SMB is system com-No one has come up with a format that is truly com parable to traditio nal packed - bed chromato graphy in terms of its ability to purify and capture the target. \u2014 Thompson, PolybaticsTechnical Forum: DisposablesWisdom From Within Eliminate reliance on transmitters with Arc intelligence engineered into your sensor head.

Multiple columns require many valves and sophisticated control to assure accurate column switching without cross contamination. Chromatography is also used in product flow-through mode to remove impurities. The further downstream you are in your process, the fewer the impurities. When there are only small amounts remaining, membrane chromatography is attractive for impurity scavenging. The low binding capacity and low resolving power is not an issue and the high flow rates that can be used can be fully exploited. Single-use components are often preferred for scav-enging, especially because cleaning may be challenging for several reasons. For producing tons of product, the col- umn volumes are large, several hundred or even thousands of liters, and at this size, single-use designs are not viable. In general, the smaller the scale, the more attractive single-use chromatography is. Bisschops (Tarpon): First of all, dispos- able technologies will generally result in more flexibility in manufacturing and in a shorter change-over time. These features are particularly important for multiprod-uct facilities such as clinical manufacturing facilities and contract manufacturing or-ganizations. For these types of operations, the advantage of disposable bioprocess-ing technologies is more obvious than for single-product facilities. Prepacked chromatography columns fit very well in streamlining the workflow in a facility by taking away the packing op-erations. The costs for prepacked columns were, until recently, cost prohibitive to consider them as a single-use or disposable product for other applications than clini-cal manufacturing. The scale limitations of prepacked columns also restricts the application of this technology to clinical-scale manufacturing. SMB enables manufacturing of large amounts of product with reasonably small columns, which are cycled many times during a batch. As a result, this technol- ogy can make prepacked disposable chro-matography a viable alternative, especially when you pair disposable columns with a fully disposable, simplified valving system. Disposable valving is the missing link in providing economically viable, fully disposable downstream processing for bind/elute applications. Another feature of continuous chromatography is that it allows the entire cascade of downstream processing unit operations to be operated as a fully continuous train. This conti-nuity eliminates or significantly reduces interstage product hold steps and allows multiple unit operations to be operated simultaneously. Thus, the time in facility can be shortened by a factor of two, which in many cases translates into a significant increase in facility throughput. Mann (Merck Millipore): Probably, the specific application is the first criterion, in so much as to how much freedom there is to pick and chose a chromatography platform. For instance, if the product is a monoclonal antibody, then likely there is a template already in place for purifica-tion, typically protein A affinity chroma-tography, followed by cation exchange bind-elute and then anion exchange flow through. Both the protein A affinity and cation exchange are almost certainly going to be conventional packed-bed columns. Although traditionally the anion exchange was also a packed-bed column, anion ex-change flow through membrane adsorbers are being deployed because of convenience (i.e., no column packing) and buffer sav-ings (i.e., no cleaning/reuse). Membrane adsorbers are also finding application elsewhere when used in flow through mode for capture of impurities. Generally, they are less competitive with conventional packed columns for bind-elute applications because of lower capacity compared with resins. SMB is relatively new to biotech. While frequently used for small molecule pu-rification, it has not found adoption in protein separations primarily due to the greater complexity of the flowpath and the difficulty with engineering it in a sani-tary manner. The new single-use systems coming onto the market may address that aspect, but the added complexity of op-eration compared to conventional batch chromatography will likely continue to be a hurdle to adoption. One attraction of SMB or similar multicolumn approaches is that, compared with batch, it uses smaller columns that make it more amenable to prepacked columns and coupled to the fact that the resin is cycled more times per batch. This has benefits especially for clini-cal-scale batches where, conventionally, the resin may be thrown away after only a few batches and so is nowhere near its end of life point. Multicolumn approaches enable better resin utilization, getting closer to the lifetime of the resin and thus saving cost. The second criterion is probably scale, which is linked to cost. Although single-use implementation shows clear cost benefits at the smaller pilot/clinical scale manufac-turing, at large commercial scale, stainless-steel installation can be more cost-effective. In addition, larger scale will require larger columns than currently available in a pre-packed, disposable format. Tingley (Repligen): In stepping back a little bit, you can ask\u2014why do people want to adopt single-use technologies? I don't think the answer has changed as we've changed the technologies\u2014it's speed\u2014getting through the process quicker, being able to develop multiproduct facilities, being able to put more molecules through a facility in a short period of time. This is the reason why the disposable trend has developed and has been so successful over the past 15 or 20 years. When you look at chromatography and ask what do people want to do with a dis-posable system, there are two answers. At one end of the continuum are users who really want to use chromatography col-umns the way they've always used chro-matography columns, they just don't want to pack them any more. At the other end of the continuum are companies that have built truly single-use platforms, and don't have any capability to manage hardware. These companies are buying disposable If the product is a monoclo nal antibody , then likely there is a tem plate already in place for purificatio n. \u2014 Mann, Merck MilliporeTechnical Forum: DisposablesShimadzu has been at the forefront of HPLC design and manufacturing for over 30 years, developing instruments that enable chromatographers in any environment to select the system best suited to their application.

Users operate on a continuum, and you see systems ranging from pure disposables to hybrid facilities. So, when you ask what factors influence the choice of platform, the answer for me is that the traditional process and the traditional technologies are the number one drivers. How do people get the convenience of dis-posables doing what they do today? In addition to packed columns, there are also alternate technologies such as membranes that are good for some of the flow through applications. I think it's still early days, but some of these technologies are working well and tend to be in smaller processes. Barriers to adoption PharmTech: What barriers do you see to more widespread adoption of single-use chromatography? Grund (GE Healthcare): Weighing up the pros and cons will give a different answer from case to case and it really de-pends on the application in question. Not all applications are best suited to disposable chromatography columns, speed is not the only goal. Operational efficiency can be addressed in other ways and many hybrid solutions are possible. Another factor is ob-viously that large, hard-piped facilities in existence around the world\u2014dedicated to a small number of products\u2014can operate very economically and there is little mo-tivation to refurbish them. There are also many smaller facilities based on conven-tional stainless-steel approaches and these will probably only be replaced with single-use components when the pressure on flex-ibility and facility throughput is high. The strongest push towards single-use is in multiproduct facilities that switch prod-ucts frequently, especially at small scale, for example, in process development, produc-tion for clinical trials, or contract manufac-turing. Here the barrier is more related to a conservative attitude with general reserva-tions about using disposables. Manufactur-ers are concerned with issues such as risks from leachables, poor documentation, and increased risk of operator error.Bisschops (Tarpon): One of the most important barriers to introducing dispos-able chromatography is most likely the sunk capital in legacy facilities. We do see, however, a growing trend in even existing legacy facilities moving to disposables in process steps where the facility design itself becomes a limitation either because of increasing titers, holding tank capacity, or water-for-injection capa-bility. This is where disposable continuous processing can have a huge impact. Thompson (Polybatics): I think one of the challenges that equipment sup-pliers haven't really addressed is the cost issue. Single-use manufacturers haven't really addressed the cost aspect\u2014they've just shifted them from one-time upfront to ongoing operational expenses. I think you have to get to a 30% savings or more before manufacturers will take the invest-ment they have in existing processes and systems and shift them. Otherwise, there just doesn't seem to be the economic incen-tive to shift to disposables. Will there ever be a completely dis- posable system? There will still be some components of any system, whether it's membrane or resin-based, that will be re-usable. I do believe there will be systems on the horizon as technologies evolve that are truly disposable. Whether that means systems that are single-use, or say, 10 uses for a campaign... My suspicion is that it will be more along the lines of using a unit for a campaign, then once the campaign is done you get rid of it. So you still get the benefits of disposablility but leverage some of those costs over 10 or 20 cycles. Mann (Merck Millipore): One bar- rier is the availability of systems, includ-ing systems that have gradient capability. Greater capability and system choice will likely drive adoption. A second barrier is the availability of true single-use devices or prepacked col-umns. While single-use membrane ad-sorbers are being adopted, especially for flow through applications, the relatively lower capacity compared with resins lim-its application for bind-elute applications. Consequently, higher capacity membrane or similar device format could facilitate adoption. Alternatively, or in combina-tion, lower cost, prepacked columns would make single-use operation more attractive. Tingley (Repligen): For me, the way to get adoption of these chromatography products is to make them easy to adapt to what people are doing now. If they can get a prepacked column that's prepared in ex-actly the same way as their glass column, that's used exactly the same way as their glass column, and gives exactly the same results as their glass column, that will be the first step in making chromatography disposable. With that, I think, will come pressure to look for alternatives to make chromatography truly single-use. From a vendor's point of view, for years we've been having great conversations with the biopharma industry about in-troducing new technologies and making changes. But, the actual adoption rate of game-changing technology is poor. Just because of the way we do things in this industry, we're more likely to be evo-lutional than revolutional. As long as people can think about how they can use the product as a disposable or semidis-posable step and it makes sense to them, then they can easily see it fit within the confines and contraints of their own company's regulatory philosophy and guidance, and it's an easy step to make. This is what will take us down the path to truly game-changing technology in the years to come.

Outsourcing rather than out-taskin g In out-tasking, pharmaceutical tech - nology and manufacturing companie s utilize third-party vendors to carry ou t various maintenance tasks on specialize d equipment, such as water-for-injectio n (i.e., stills) or compressors and boilers , while leaving the responsibility for th e quality and scope of the work and the in - ternal documentation in the hands of th e client. In contrast, when the operation s and maintenance program include s regular, preventive, and predictiv e work, as well as corrective tasks an d technical support, then the client is op - erating under the outsourcing model . In other words, outsourcing involve s contracting a whole function, rathe r than a specific task. Greater saving s and efficiencies are found in outsourc - ing, rather than out-tasking . Outsourcing energy service s Implementing highly reliable energy solu - tions at research and manufacturing facil - ities is a significant challenge for pharma - ceutical companies. The traditional mode l has been to run a facility with the com - pany owning, operating, and maintainin g all equipment itself, thus assuming expo - sure to risk on issues such as equipmen t durability, fuel volatility, and maintainin g the expertise required to keep the syste m working properly in-house. Pharmaceu - tical facilities, however, are increasingl y embracing the outsourcing model . The outsourcing service provide r can be contracted to operate and main - tain complex energy plants and ancil - lary equipment, such as : t\u0001On-site generation and cogenera - tion asset s t\u0001Steam, chilled-wate st\u0001Mechanical facilitie s system s t\u0001Electrical system s t\u0001Safety system s t\u0001Plumbing/sanitary system s t\u0001General building maintenance . After the outsourced service provide r has been selected, the client and servic e provider should agree on a well-define d scope and clear objectives, which shoul d be captured in a service level agreemen t (SLA). Using a risk-based approach, th e scope and responsibility of the servic e provider can be built up over time , which will ensure client satisfaction, spe - cifically around regulatory compliance .

Linking the score to contract payments, by with-holding an agreed-upon percentage each quarter, drives performance from the ser-vice provider's point of view and ensures client satisfaction. As the relationship between the service provider and client evolves, or as business expands, it is com-mon to review and adjust the KPIs. Outsourcing maintenance allows the client to reduce costs without reducing core-business company headcount and, as the pharmaceutical company becomes the customer of the service provider, to more easily drive change and continuous improvement. Outsourcing also allows management to focus on developing and manufacturing the product rather than on the non-manufacturing activities in-volved in facilities engineering. Leveraging combined heat and power Another key advantage of outsourcing energy management is that full-service outside providers possess the expertise to evaluate, design, build, and then op-erate technologies such as combined heat and power (CHP) to optimize energy ef-ficiency. CHP, sometimes referred to as cogeneration, is an efficient energy tech-nology that simultaneously generates power (i.e., electricity) and thermal en-ergy, which is used for heating, cooling, and production of high-pressure process steam, while typically consuming only 60% of the fuel required for separate pro-cesses (1). Figure 1 illustrates the higher energy efficiency of CHP compared to separate heat and power production. CHP technology is currently experienc-ing a resurgence in pharmaceutical facili-ties due to its many operational benefits. CHP can provide increased energy reli-ability, greater fuel flexibility, and mar-ket responsiveness. CHP can also miti-gate lost products and research projects due to utility grid failures. CHP reduces greenhouse gas emissions; the waste heat generated during the power production process can be captured, recycled, and used for process applications without the need for boilers within each building. CHP is a proven solution for industrial manufacturing environments, in which reliable power is crucial. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Combined Heat and Power Part-nership, 88% of existing CHP plants are utilized for industrial purposes (2). The other 12% are used by commercial and institutional entities such as hospitals, municipal and state governments, col-leges, and universities. With a full-service outsourcing provider, designing, building, and operating complex energy infrastruc-ture may be achieved seamlessly. Customers that implement CHP typ- ically experience the following benefits: t\u0001Cost savings. Burning less fuel generates cost savings. CHP users avoid buying from the market at peak price periods. CHP can also be configured to use locally-sourced renewable fuels.t\u0001Reliability. Utility power outages will not interrupt CHP operations, so critical processes continue un-interrupted. t\u0001Environmental benefits. Green- house gas emissions and criteria air pollutants are reduced when less fuel is combusted. t\u0001Fuel diversity. CHP plants may be designed for input of multiple sources of fuel. This multi-fuel ability increases energy security and can also mitigate volatility in fuel commodity prices. Conclusion Outsourcing may seem like a simple concept, but the potential benefits are significant, especially when complex energy infrastructure must be operated and maintained at the highest levels of reliability. Pharmaceutical research and manufacturing processes are costly to operate, so outsourcing the facility's en-ergy plant operations and management can be a solution to control costs, reduce fuel and energy consumption, and eval-uate and implement energy solutions and technologies that can ensure the integrity of the underlying processes.

Particle-engineering technolo-gies can be applied in various crys-tal design for controlling crystallization and producing cocrystals; particle-size reduction, achieved through jet-milling, wet polishing and nanoparticle genera-tion; and amorphous solid dispersions, produced by several approaches, such as spray-drying (including as inclusion complexes), hot-melt extrusion (HME), and spray-congealing. Pharmaceutical Technology discussed these issues with Colin Minchom, vice president, of the Particle Design Business Unit at Hovione. Crystallization PharmTech: Under what type of situa- tions would crystallization be used? How does it facilitate the delivery of poorly soluble drugs? Minchom: Interest in cocrystals has increased in recent years, and the re-cent FDA guidance on a proposed clas-sification of cocrystals has prompted further discussion and counter propos-als from the industry. The proposed US FDA classification of cocrystals as crystalline materials containing two or more molecules in the same crystal lat-tice is limited but can serve as a start-ing point for discussion. The addition of a cocrystal former into the crystalline structure of the API changes its physical and chemi- IMAGES ETC LTD/GETTY IMAGESParticle-engineering technologies, such as crystal design for controlling crystallization and producing cocrystals, particle-size reduction, and amorphous solid dispersions, help to optimize delivery of a drug.

It is possible, in some cases, to improve bioavailability to adequate levels while preserving the stability of a crystalline form. For APIs with low glass-transition temperatures, a cocrystal may be favoured over the amorphous form. As such, the use of a cocrystal may be an attractive platform to overcome the solubility limitations of Biopharmaceutics Classification System Class II and Class IV drugs. Cocrystal formation is a favored ap- proach for increasing apparent aqueous solubility for poorly water-soluble mol-ecules that have no ionizable groups, and for which salt formation is not possible, or for where the physical properties of the salts formed are not desirable. Solvates and hydrates are well-accepted crystal forms. In many ways, a cocrystal can be thought of as a solvate, but one whose components are solid at room temperature. The co-crystal will form if the resulting crystal is thermodynamically more stable than the components. Resulting cocrystal proper-ties are dependent upon many factors, in-cluding the starting properties of the API, the physical properties of the co-former and the mechanism by which the cocrys-tal is formed. To increase the probability of success, we [Hovione] recommend that at early-development stages to test other proven platforms, such as solid disper-sions, micronized and nanosized crystals and inclusion complexes. PharmTech: Controlling nucleation during crystallization is an important task. What are the mechanisms for controlling crystallization? Minchom: Where milling techniques can be thought of as top-down sizing techniques, controlled crystallization is where the desired particle-size dis-tribution is achieved from the bottom up. The objectives of a crystallization process are twofold. On the one hand, the aim is to isolate the API in the right crystal form, typically a polymorph that provides the required level of exposure and stability. On the other hand, crys-tallization may also be a purification stage, whereby the impurities remain mostly dissolved in the mother liquors. The kinetics of crystallization (nu- cleation and crystal growth rates) are driven by the imposed supersaturation levels.

Moreover, the relative importance of each factor can change at each scale. Particle-size reduction PharmTech: What factors determine particle size? What are the differences in particle size achieved through jet-milling, wet polishing, and nanopar-ticle generation? Minchom: Particle-size reduction is not a simple phenomenon. The mecha-nism of generating the material of the prescribed particle size has a profound effect upon a range of physical proper-ties that may have a significant effect on the resulting pharmaceutical behavior. The final particle size of a material sub-jected to a comminution process is dic-tated by particle attributes, such as crys-tal hardness, morphology, and original crystal size, as well as the size-reduction method and energy applied. Jet-milling and wet polishing may generate mate-rials with equivalent median particle sizes; however, the resulting span from jet-milled material is likely to be wider than the wet-polished material. Amor-phous material and highly reactive sur-faces also may result from jet-milling while a higher level of crystallinity is maintained with wet polishing. Dry methods, such as jet-milling, tend to be more cost-effective (mainly because they do not require sophisti-cated isolating techniques), but they are more aggressive, less reproduc-ible, and more limited in terms of the achievable size reduction. Amorphous solid dispersions PharmTech: What factors determine which method (i.e., spray-drying, HME, spray-congealing, and inclusion- complex generation) to use amorphous solid dispersion? Minchom: Amorphous solid disper- sions represent a tremendous oppor-tunity for solubility enhancement of oral drugs. The resulting supersatura-tion levels (and hence bioavailability) and the physical stability of the final dosage form, however, depend on the manufacturing method applied. Many approaches are available to generate amorphous solid dispersions. Spray-drying, being a solvent method, is the most versatile technique to obtain solid dispersions due to its gentle process conditions and much wider formulation options. Spray-dry-ing is a technology that works well in nearly every compound. Another ad-vantage of spray-drying is that it can be effectively operated using much smaller quantities of drug substance, thereby making it the most cost-effective option during early-stage development.Melt methods, such as HME and spray-congealing, on the other hand, are more cost effective at the larger scale manufacturing and have the ad-ditional advantage of being solvent-free techniques. To use these meth-ods, however, the compound needs to be soluble in the polymer/matrix and physically stable complexes need to be created. These methods are also limited to drug substances that can sustain relatively high heat loads. All these techniques are relatively well-established within the pharmaceutical industry, although spray-drying is a step ahead in terms of maturity. Although challenging at a very small scale, the rationale design of an HME formulation is viable when the API is available in pilot-scale quantities. Where an API has low solubility in all preferred spray-drying solvents or retains exten-sive solvent following drying, HME may represent the best way forward for the development of a stable amorphous solid dispersion. Spray-congealing can uses a number of lipophilic excipients, which are useful in formulating poorly water-soluble compounds that will form self emulsifying drug-delivery systems (SEDD) or self micro-emulsifying drug-delivery com-monly used in spray-dried amorphous solid dispersions. PT Researchers at the US Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory have discovered a way to use sound waves to levitate individual droplets of solutions containing pharmaceuticals (1). The research facilitates the process for placing drugs from solution into an amorphous state. The researchers applied an acoustic levitator that uses two small speakers to generate sound waves at frequencies slightly above the audible range at approximately 22 kilohertz (1). With the proper alignment of the top and bottom speakers, the speakers create two sets of sound waves that produc e a standing wave. At ce rtain points along the standing wave, there is no net transfe r of energy. The ac oustic pressure from the sound waves is sufficient to overcome the effect of gravity, thereby allowing light objects to levitate when placed at these points in the standing wave (1). A video showing the technology may be found at the laboratory's website (www.anl.gov/videos/acoustic-levitation). The technology now can produce only small quantities in an amorphous state, but it is considered a useful tool in elucidating the conditions that optimize producing amorphous material. Argonne National Laboratory's Technology Development & Commercialization Division is developing a patent for the method and is evaluating the technology for licensing for commercial development with pharmaceutical industry partners (1). Chris Benmore, an X-ray physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, led the study and teamed with various scientists for adapting the technology for drug research. These scientists include Professors Stephen Byrn and Lynne Taylor in the Department of Industrial and Physical Pharmacy in the College of Pharmacy at Purdue University (US) and Professor Jeffrey Yarger of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State University (US) and director of the university's Magnetic Resonance Research Center. The researchers also are now working on identifying drugs most suited to applications with the acoustic levitator. Source 1. J.

Producing a well-ordered crystal, particularly for proteins, which can be studied through crystallography, however, is not an easy task. Recent research involves examining the effects of microgravity on protein crystallization and a computational model for protein elucidation. Protein crystallization and microgravity effects The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), manager of the International Space Station (ISS) US National Laboratory, is collaborating with Merck & Co. to conduct research on protein crystallization on board the ISS in 2013. The research will examine the effect on protein crystallization using microgravity. In July, CASIS announced its first request for proposals (RFP) focused on advancing protein crystall ization using microgravity. Additionally, in early September 2012, CASIS announced an RFP focused on materials testing in the extreme environment of space. Proposals for this RFP will be accepted until Oct. 24, 2012. The final agreement with Merck is dependent on approval by CASIS' evaluation and prioritization process, a requirement for all ISS projects. If approved, the research will begin in mid-2013. \"We at Merck are excited to work with CASIS and explore the microgravity effects on several bioprocessing applications within the unique environment of the ISS National Lab,\" said Paul Reichert, chemistry research fellow at Merck Research Laboratories, in a September CASIS press release. CASIS is the nonprofit organization promoting and managing research on board the ISS US National Laboratory, which includes a solicitation for proposals in relation to advancing protein crystallization using microgravity. The RFP seeks to identify projects within the field of crystallography that CASIS will suppor t through grant funding, facilitation of service provider partnerships, and flight coordination to and from the ISS. Crystallography is the technique used to determine the three-dimensional structures of protein molecules. Protein crystallization, when performed in space, may produce large, better-organized crystals, thereby allowing for more focused drug development. CASIS believes that its RFP will lead to the production of better crystals in the microgravity environment than can be grown on Earth. \"CASIS has evaluated research performed to date in the life sciences and believes it is time to formally test the promising hypothesis that microgravity may produce greater internal order in protein-crystal growth,\" said CASIS acting Chief Scientist Timothy Yeatman, in a June 26, 2012, CASIS press release. \"This could potentially lead to sharper resolution of crystals and their cognate proteins, which could produce more effective drugs for cancer and other debilitating human diseases.\" In 2005, the US Congress designated the US portion of the ISS as the nation's newest national laboratory to maximize its use for improving life on Earth, promoting collaboration among diverse users, and advancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. The laboratory environment is available for use by other US government agencies and by academic and private institutions to provide access to the permanent microgravity setting, vantage point in low-earth orbit, and varied environments of space.Computational approaches for protein elucidation Determining the structure and sequence of proteins is an important part of understanding the protein's biological properties and potential utility as a drug. Designing predetermined crystal structures, however, can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization (1). Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania recently reported on a computational approach for the design or proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals (1). \"People have designed crystals out of smaller, much less complex molecules than proteins, but protein design is much more subtle,\" said Jeffrey G. Saven, associate professor of chemistry and biological and theoretical physical chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, in a university press release. Saven conducted the research and recently reported on its results (1). Protein crystals are attractive as a nano-scale building material because their prope rties, particularly their exterior surfaces, are highly customizable, ac cording to the university release. The researchers targeted a crystal built using a relatively small protein containing a sequence of 26 amino acid positions. The researchers assigned specific amino acids to eight of the positions, but with 18 different types of amino acid to choose from for each of the remaining 18 slots, the algorithm addressed well more than 1022 potential combinations. The researchers accounted for other characteristics, such as the spacing between proteins and their orientation with respect to one another, increasing the variables being considered, according to the release. \"We worked on synthesizing bo th of those steps, doing the characterization of structure and the sequence at the same time,\" said Saven said in the university release. \"As we move through this process, we eliminate things that will never work, such as proteins where atoms overlap in space or where amino acids don't fit into a given site. At the same time, we identify proteins that, as you vary the structure, are likely to yield a crystal.\" Specifically, the research used a three-helix coiled-coil protein designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which had a \"honeycomb-like\" structure and hexameric channels that spanne d the crystal (1). The approach involved creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry, characte rizing this ensemble to identify \"designable\" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures, and experimentally characterizing candi date proteins. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis. The target crystal the researchers produced is a proof of concept. \"There's still much we don't know about the interactions that govern crystallization,\" Saven said, in the university release. \"With this technique, we can explore what those interactions are or how we might take an existing protein and engineer those interactions so we get much better structures.\" Source 1.

Submitted: Mar. 22, 2012; Accepted Apr. 13, 2012. NICHOLAS EVELEIGH/GETTY IMAGESDirect Compression There are several reasons to micronize APIs in a solid- dosage formulation. Many new drug molecules are poorly soluble, and one means to enhance solubility is to enlarge surface area by micronizing the API. Ob- taining a homogenous mixture of the micronized API and excipients in a solid dose and maintaining product stability, however, can be challenging. Additionally, micronized APIs are used in the formulation of highly potent drugs that re-quire low dosage. In this case, content uniformity is crucial and difficult to achieve when seeking to evenly distribute content of less than 1% API in a solid formulation. The pure physical mixture based on statistical distribu- tion often has no stability of homogeneity. For this reason, many formulators switch to more expensive wet- or dry-granulation processes instead of direct compression (DC) or sachet formulations. A mixture has the best chance for stability if the particles of the API and excipients are of the same size range (1). For handling reasons, the mixture of excipients and API should be in a granulate form rather than in powdered form. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether such APIs could create stable mixtures with larger excipient par-ticles and support a DC-tableting process with good content uniformity. An earlier study demonstrated the stability of so-called \"ordered mixtures\" with spray-dried sorbitol and much smaller API particles (2, 3). Hersey first introduced the concept of ordered mixtures to explain the behavior of interacting particles in a powder mixture (4). These examples from the literature dealt with spray-dried sorbitol, which at the time, was a rare example of a DC ex-cipient. Today, mannitol is used as a DC excipient due to its inertness, its low hygroscopicity and its fast-release qualities. The study in this article focuses on different DC-grades of mannitol available on the market. Materials and methods Two types of spray-dried DC-mannitol were used, re-spectively named in this study as DC-Mannitol A and DC-Mannitol M, and one type of granulated mannitol, DC-Mannitol B (see Table I) .

API-mannitol mixtures (batch size 300 g) were prepared using a shaker-mixer (Turbula T2C, Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik). To evaluate the quality of mixing, the homogeneity was measured by taking six samples from the mixtures and ap-plying a sample divider (Retsch Type RT 6.5, Retsch AG) after a specified period of mixing time (2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min). The procedure was repeated three times. The API content in each sample was analyzed (n = 18). For ascorbic acid, the content was determined through a volumetric analysis by titration with an iodine solution (TitriPUR, Merck KGaA), which provided an accuracy of measurement with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.12%. The ribofla-vin content was determined spectro-photometrically at 444 nm according to the European Pharmacopoeia (5). The RSD of the API concentration was examined as a function of mixing time (see Figures 1 and 2 ). To challenge the mixture stabil- ity and to show the strength of ad-sorption of low-dose formulations, API-DC-mannitol mixtures with a drug content of 1% and 3% were ap-plied to an Alpine air jet-sieve (A 200 LS, Hosokawa Alpine) and analyzed for their drug content after 15 min of airflow. The applied mesh size was 40 m, and the vacuum pressure was 2000 mPa.

The results of this investigation are later dis-cussed under the \"Results of field testing in a R&D case study\" portion of this article. Results The reduction of the RSD of the measured API concen-trations shows how the mixture approaches homoge-neity with rising mixing times (see Figure 1 ). A time of 30 min was chosen as sufficient to view the mixture of DC-mannitol with micronized ascorbic acid as homoge-neous (RSD = 0.67%). The mixing behavior of a blend is dependent on the API and the excipient, as well as on mixer type, scale, and the degree of filling of the mixer. As the latter parameters were constant for all as-sessed blends, differences in homo-geneity must be due to either the API or the excipient. In this case, the micronized hydrophobic particles of riboflavin tend to re-agglomerate during mixing. This re-agglomera-tion is why at first the homogeneity decreases before the mixture reaches a steady state (see Figure 1 ). The resulting mixing time of 30 min seems to be rather high. It has to be taken into account that this small laboratory-scale mixing unit is cer-tainly not optimized. More impor-tantly, however, the micronized API granules have a tendency of agglom-eration to each other due to their high surface energy. This binding force has to be broken up and replaced by an alternative binding force\u2014adsorption and van der Vaals interaction-with the carrier surface. This is a dynamic equilibrium process and takes more time than just a statistical distribu-tion of different particles in space. The comparison of different DC-mannitols at optimum mixing time reveals differences in the homo-geneity of such a mixture with mi-cronized ascorbic acid and riboflavin (see Figure 2 ). Clearly, for a hydrophilic API, the achievable homogeneity is greater than for a hydrophobic API. In this case, the different attraction forces of the hydrophobic API to a hy-drophilic carrier cause more API par-ticles to re-agglomerate rather than bind to the carrier surface. This is not a surprising observa- tion because this relationship would be true for all excipients. There are, however, differences in the achievable blend uni-formity among the compared carriers. The best homogeneity for both API cases was found for the excipient with the high-est surface area, DC-Mannitol M (see Table I) . This observa- tion gives a hint for a correlation of BET surface area and/or pore volume to the achievable homogeneity. There also are significant differences between spray-dried and granulated DC-mannitol even having similar BET-surfaces (see Figure 3 ). The quality of the surface structure, not only the quantitative size of the surface area, seems to be relevant. 800.772.8786 SpectrumChemical.comOver 22,000 TCI Organic Chemicals Available from Stock Manufacturing Specialists of Research Organics Organic Synthesis Reagents & Intermediates Inorganic / Organometallic / Glycochemistry Science Scan with your Smartphone to order a catalog70 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comDirect Compression To prove an adsorption of the API to the excipient surface with a certain force, the remaining concentration of ascorbic acid and riboflavin was measured after 15 min on an air-jet sieve. By this procedure, a separation of fine API particles from the carrier can be expected if they were not strongly adsorbed. A recovery of 100% would mean a perfectly strong adsorption of the API to the carrier while a recovery of 0% shows no ab-sorption to the carrier. A much stronger adsorption was found for the spray-dried DC-manni-tols in comparison to the granulated quality (see Figure 4 ). For low API con- centrations of a hydrophilic drug, both spray-dried mannitols show similar results. Using higher API loads, it was demonstrated that the higher surface area of DC-Mannitol M shows advan-tages of a higher binding capacity. This effect was confirmed with a hydropho-bic API, riboflavin. This finding may again result from the different surface structure of the investigated excipients. The lower recovery of hydrophobic API again confirms a weaker force of sur-face adsorption by this class of API. To visualize the API distribution on the excipients' surface, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was em-ployed. Figure 5 shows the SEM image of a mixture of ascorbic acid and DC-mannitol M. The micronized API particles are readily identifiable due to the different crystal structures of API and carrier (colorization per-formed manually). The API crystals were found within the pore structure of the much larger excipient particles. Figure 6 shows the SEM image of spray- dried DC-Mannitol A and ascorbic acid. In this case, less areas are pres-ent that are suitable for the absorption of the API. The overall surface is less structured. A similar distribution on the excipients' surface was determined for the hydrophobic model drug ribo-flavin (see Figure 7 ). The importance of the surface area and the pore volume of an excipient for the homogeneity of the mixture was demonstrated. In the next step, the surface area and porosity of vari-ous excipients available for direct com-pression were analyzed using the BET method (nitrogen adsorption). As the API is adsorbed to a porous surface, the observed differences of the excipients may give rise to a different behavior in the adsorption of the micronized APIs (see Figure 3 ).

Pore volume (BET) Parteck M 200 Parteck (1% ascorbic acid) showed that stable mix- tures of much smaller micronized API particles with DC-excipients can be achieved. The next question exam-ined was whether this approach was suitable for the DC process for an ac-tual formulation. Results of field testing in a R&D case study The question whether low-dose pharmaceutical formulations with micronized APIs are suitable for a DC process was challenged using a water-sensitive R&D API at only 0.4% in the final dosage form (0.5 mg API in a 120-mg tablet). Wet granulation could not be applied be-cause of the water-sensitivity of the API. The micronized API (Dv50 10 m), therefore, was premixed for 30 min using a shaker-mixer (Turbula T2C) with 15% of the total amount of DC-grade mannitol DC-Mannitol M (Dv50 200 m) and mixed with the rest of the formulation using a Turbula T20P (Bachofen AG) (see Figure 8 ). A test run of 2 h on a rotary press (Korsch Pharmapress PH230, Korsch AG) was performed at two different rotation speeds (40,000 and 80,000 tablets/h). The tablets were as-sessed for their weight, hardness, and disintegration time This result was surprisingly good as constant values were detected for tablet weight (RSD 0.6-0.9%), tablet hardness (RSD 4.1%), and disintegra-tion time (see Table II ). Content uni- formity was measured to be \u00b1 1.8 %.Conclusion Although the concept of ordered mixtures has been exten-sively studied and reported, little was known about the mechanisms and reasons behind ordered mixtures (6-9). The results clearly show that the effect of ordered mix-tures can be found with DC-mannitols as a function of surface area and structure. To a greater extent, this func-tionality can be found for spray-dried qualities with a porous surface structure. A large surface area is helpful for good binding capacity. Stable mixtures are not only achieved with components of similar particle sizes as the literature suggests. It is also possible to achieve a stable Table II: Comparison of tablets manufactured at different speeds of the rotary press. 40 , 000 tablet s/h 80,000 tablet s/h Tablet weight 120.1 mg (RSD 0.6%) 118 .8 mg (RSD 0.9%) Tablet hardness 178 N (RS D 4.1%) 173 N (RS D 4.1%) Disintegration time 3 min 25 s 3 min 22 s RSD is standard deviation.

The stability is caused by an adsorptive binding force strong enough to withstand the mechanical separation forces. This effect was successfully demonstrated for hydro-philic and hydrophobic APIs. This result confirms the feasibility of DC for low-dose applications with accept-able content uniformity as the example showed. It also helps to show that micronized APIs at higher concentra-tions can be applied in solid formulations to enhance their solubility. This approach can be applied for DC, sachet formulations, or in roller compaction.References 1. Y. Qiu et al, Eds., D eveloping Solid Oral Dosage Forms (Academic Press, Burlington, MA, 2009). 2. I.

QbD concepts are aimed at improving the robustness of manufacturing processes based upon adopting a systematic and scie ntific approach to development and implementing a control strategy based on the enhanced process understanding this provides. Many pharmaceutical companies have also recognized that QbD concepts can be used to improve the reliability of analytical methods. The authors describe how traditional approaches to analytical method transfer and validation also may benefit from alignment with QbD concepts and propose a three-stage concept to ensure that methods are suitable for their intended purpose throughout the analytical lifecycle: method design, method qualification, and continued method veri fication. This paper represe nts a refinement and enhancement of the concepts originally proposed in an article written by P. Nethercote, T. Bennett, P. Borman, G. Martin, and P. McGregor (1).

Quality by Design To help in implementation of the goals of FDA's Pharmaceu- tical cGMPs for the 21st Century-A Risk-Based Approach (2), FDA recently issued guidance for industry describing the general principles and practice of process validation, which seeks to align process validation activities with product lifecycle concepts. This guidance (3) addresses some of the is-sues with traditional approaches to process validation where a focus on a one-time, three batch approach, with the use of the best talent during the day shift with the same lot of raw material does little to ensure that the manufacturing process is and will remain in a state of control. The traditional approach to process validation encourages a \"do not rock the boat\" mindset since the product is approved and the process is validated and fails to foster continuous improvement in quality or efficiency (4). These issues have parallels in analytical method validation. Analytical methods for pharmaceutical products are validated in accordance with the International Conference on Harmoniza-tion (ICH) Q2 Guideline, Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology , usually by the experts who have been involved in developing the method (5). Method validation is often treated as a one-time event with no guidance on how to ensure continu-ing focus on consistent method performance. There also is lack of guidance on how to demonstrate in practice that a method is fit-for-purpose (i.e., what are suitable acceptance criteria). There is potential for the validation process to seem more focused on producing validation documentation that will withstand regu-latory scrutiny than on ensuring that the method will actually perform well during routine application. There is a risk that both regulatory authorities and industry use ICH Q2 in a check-box manner rather than its intent, which is to provide guidance on the philosophical background to method validation. After the method has been validated by the developing group, it may be transferred to another laboratory, which involves transfer-ring the knowledge of how to operate the method to those who will use it routinely and documenting that both parties obtain comparable results. The routine operating environment, however, is not always considered during the method-development and validation exercise. The lack of an effective process for capturing and transferring the tacit knowledge of the development analysts can cause methods to fail to perform as intended in the receiving Quality by Design for Analytical Methods Implications for Method Validation and Transfer Phil Nethercote and Joachim Ermer5 Service Models, including Fee For Service, FTE and our award-winning Professional Scientic StafngSM give you endless flexibility & cost-saving laboratory service options.

Much effort is then expended on identification of the variables that are causing the performance issues and the exercise is repeated. As in the case of the initial method validation activity, the transfer exercise is typically performed as a one-off process. There is a risk that the exercise will focus more on producing the method-transfer report than on ensuring the ability of the receiving laboratory to run the method accurately and reliably and ensuring the continuity and integrity of analytical results. The recognition that an analytical method can be considered a process that has an output of acceptable quality data led Bor-man et al. to take the QbD concepts designed for manufacturing processes and show how these could also be employed for ana-lytical methods (6). It follows, therefore, that the concepts of life-cycle validation being developed for manufacturing processes might also be applicable to analytical methods. This concept aligns well with the lifecycle concept of equipment qualifica-tion in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), consisting of equipment design, followed by operational and performance qualification, and with analytical method validation activities proposed by Ermer and Landy (7, 8). A QbD framework for analytical lifecycle management QbD is defined as \"A systematic approach to development that begins with predefined objectives and emphasizes prod-uct and process understanding based on sound science and quality risk management\" (9). FDA has proposed a definition for process validation that is \"the collection and evaluation of data, from the process design stage throughout production, which establishes scientific evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality products\" (3). When con-sidering a lifecycle approach to method validation a similar definition could be adopted, \"the collection and evaluation of data and knowledge from the method design stage through-out its lifecycle of use, which establishes scientific evidence that a method is capable of consistently delivering quality data\" (1). A method, as defined in this article, is a synonym for analytical procedure and includes all steps of the procedure (e.g., sample preparation, analytical methodology, calibration, definition of the reportable result, and specification limits). From these definitions, it can be seen that there are a number of key factors that are important in a QbD lifecycle approach. These include: t\u0001The importance of having predefined objectives t\u0001The need to understand the method (i.e., having the ability to explain the method performance as a function of the method input variables) t\u0001The need to ensure that controls on method inputs are designed such that the method will deliver quality data consistently in all the intended environments in which it is used t\u0001The need to evaluate method performance from the method design stage throughout its lifecycle of use. In alignment with the approach proposed in the FDA guid- ance for process validation, it is possible to envisage a three-stage approach to method validation.t\u0001Stage one: method design. The method requirements and conditions are defined according to the measurement requirements given in the analytical target profile and the potential critical controls are identified. t\u0001Stage two: method qualification. During this stage, the method is confirmed as being capable of meeting its design intent and the critical controls are established. t\u0001Stage three: continued method verification. Ongoing as- surance is gained which ensures the method remains in a state of control during routine use. This includes both continuous method performance monitoring of the routine application of the method as well as a method performance verification following any changes. Measurement requirements Before commencing method validation, it is key to understand what the product critical quality attributes and process control requirements are. These requirements form the basis for the de-velopment of an Analytical Target Profiles (ATP) (10). While the paper in reference 10 introduced the concept of an ATP and de-scribed how it could have potential as a tool to facilitate regulatory oversight of change, its principal aim is to act as the focal point for all stages of the analytical lifecycle including method validation, which is the focus of this paper. To build the ATP, it is necessary to determine the characteris- tics that will be indicators of method performance. These should include all of the characteristics that will ensure the measure-ment produces fit-for-purpose data and are likely to be a subset of those described in ICH Q2 (e.g., accuracy, precision) (5). Once the important method characteristics are identi- fied, the next step is to define the target criteria for these (i.e., how accurate or precise the method needs to be). After ensuring safety and efficacy, a key factor in selection of the appropriate criteria is the overall manufacturing process capability. Knowledge of the proposed specification limits and the expected process mean and variation is helpful in setting meaningful criteria. To draw a parallel to qualifica-tion of new analytical equipment, the ATP is similar to a user requirement specification that would be produced to support qualification of new analytical equipment. Stage one: method design The method design stage involves selecting appropriate technologies and developing a method that will meet the ATP requirements. Appropriate studies are then performed to understand the critical method variables that need to be controlled to ensure the method is robust and rugged. Method development. Once the ATP has been defined, an ap- propriate technique and method conditions are selected that will likely meet the requirements of the ATP as well as business needs. This step can range from developing a new method to making a change to an existing method. While method development is obviously a very important part of the method lifecycle, it is not necessary to elaborate here because it has been extensively ad-dressed in the literature.Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 77Method understanding. Based on an assessment of risk (i.e., the method complexity and potential for robustness or ruggedness issues), an exercise focused on understanding the method (i.e., understanding which key input variables impact the method's performance characteristics) may be performed. From this, a set of operational method controls is identified. Experiments can be undertaken to understand the functional relationship between method input variables and each of the method performance characteristics. Knowledge accumulated during method devel-opment provides input into a risk assessment. Tools, such as the fishbone diagram and failure mode effects analysis (FMEA), can be used to determine which variables need studying and which require controls. Robustness experiments are typically performed on method factors using design of experiments (DoE) to ensure that maximum understanding is gained from a minimum num-ber of experiments. The output from the DoE should be used to ensure the method has well-designed system-suitability tests, which can be used to ensure that a method meets ATP require-ments (i.e., is operating in the method design space). When developing an understanding of the method's rug- gedness, it is important that variables that the method is likely to encounter in routine use are considered (e.g., different ana-lysts, reagents, instruments). Tools such as measurement system analysis (i.e., precision or ruggedness studies) can be useful in providing a structured experimental approach to examining such variables (11). Precision or ruggedness studies may instead be performed as part of Stage two, particularly if a developer has sufficient prior knowledge to choose appropriate method conditions and controls. Method design output. A set of method conditions and controls that are expected to meet the ATP should be developed and de-fined. These conditions should be optimized based on an under-standing of their impact on method performance. Stage two: method qualification Having determined a set of operational method controls dur-ing the design phase, the next step is to qualify that the method will operate in its routine environment as intended, regardless of whether this is research and development or industrial qual-ity control. Method qualification involves demonstrating that the defined method, including specified sample and standard replication levels and calibration approaches, will, under routine operating conditions, produce data that meet the precision and accuracy requirements defined in the ATP. This may involve performing a number of replicate measurements of the same sample to confirm that the precision of the method is adequate and to demonstrate that any potential interferences do not intro-duce an unacceptable bias by comparing results with a sample of known quality. If the respective experimental results have already been obtained during Stage one, they only need to be summarized for the final evaluation. Stage three: continued method verification The goal of this stage of the method lifecycle is to continually en-sure that the method remains in a state of control during routine use. This includes both continuous method-performance moni- toring of the routine application of the method as well as perfor-mance verification following any changes. Continued method performance monitoring. This stage should include an ongoing program to collect and analyze data that relate to method performance (e.g., from replication of samples or standards), by trending system suitability data, assessing precision from stability studies (12), or by trending data from regular analysis of a reference lot. This activity aligns with the guidance in USP Chapter <1010> on system performance verification (13). Close attention should also be given to any out-of-specification (OOS) or out-of-trend (OOT) results generated by the method once it is being oper-ated in its routine environment. Ideally, by using a lifecycle approach to method validation, laboratories should encoun-ter fewer analytically related OOS results, and if they do, it will be easier to determine or exclude a root cause. Monitor-ing performance parameters also serves to control method adjustments (i.e., changes within the method design space). Method performance verification . Method performance verifi- cation is undertaken to verify that a change in the method that is outside the method design space has no adverse im-pact on the method's performance. The activities required to be performed as part of method performance verification are determined through risk assessment of the impact of the wmpg.com 800-282-882 3 Don 't com promise on tubing.

These activities may range from a review to en-sure that the post-change operation of the method continues to meet the system suitability requirements to performing equivalency studies aimed at demonstrating that the change has not adversely affected the method's accuracy or preci-sion. (See Appendix 1 in the expanded, online version of this article at PharmTech.com/Nethercote for examples of how a risk assessment could be performed.) Change control During the lifecycle of a product, both the manufacturing process and the method are likely to experience a number of changes through continuous improvement activities or the need to operate the method or process in a different en-vironment. It is essential that all changes to the method's operating conditions are considered in light of the knowledge and understanding that exists on the method performance. For all changes, a risk assessment should be carried out and appropriate further validation activities performed. (See Appendix 2 in the expanded, online version of this article at PharmTech.com/Nethercote for examples of actions for different types of changes.) Method installation If a change involves operation of the method in a new loca-tion, appropriate method-installation activities, including knowledge transfer, need to be performed in addition to a method-performance verification exercise. Method instal-lation focuses on ensuring that the location at which the method is intended to be operated is adequately prepared to use the method. It includes ensuring that the analytical equipment is qualified and appropriate knowledge transfer and training of analysts has been performed. The method conditions and detailed operating controls along with all the knowledge and understanding generated during the design phase are conveyed to the location in which the method will be used. Performing a method-walkthrough exercise with the analysts in the original and new locations can be extremely valuable in ensuring all tacit knowledge about the method is communicated and understood. The extent of the method-installation activities should be based on an assessment of risk and should consider, for example, the level of preexist-ing knowledge of the analysts in the new location with the product, method, or technique. As part of the initial quali-fication of a method, a second laboratory may be involved in producing data to determine the method's reproducibility. In such a case, the second laboratory can be considered as being within the method design space, and any subsequent opera-tion of the method in that laboratory would not be considered a change. Nevertheless, the described activities with respect to method installation would be performed before starting the reproducibility study. Other scenarios This approach to method qualification focuses on activi-ties that would typically be performed for a method that is developed and used within a single company. Other sce-narios exist in which a laboratory may need to use a method for which it has no access to the original method design or qualification information, such as in a contract-testing laboratory. In these situations, it is important that the per-Table I: Comparison of traditional and lifecycle approaches to analytical method validation.

An appropriate quali-fication study is then performed to demonstrate that the method meets its ATP. Implications Adopting a QbD approach to analytical-method lifecycle man-agement would have significant implications for analytical sci-entists in the pharmaceutical industry. Industry and regulatory authorities will need to modify the way they use ICH Q2, which, ideally, would prompt a revision of this guidance to align it with the lifecycle-validation concepts promoted by ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 (9, 14, 15). The need for a revision of ICH Q2 as a conse-quence of increasing adoption of QbD concepts and use of PAT has also been identified by Criuzak (16). The activities that were previously defined as method trans- fer (i.e., knowledge transfer and confirmation of equivalence) would become intrinsic components of the lifecycle validation approach (i.e., they would be described as method installation and method performance verification activities) and would be traced back at all stages to the ATP requirements, rather than being treated as distinct from traditional method validation. A key advantage of adopting the approach described in this article is the flexibility to perform all the validation stages against the specific ATP defined for the intended method use. This would eliminate the approach of creating a validation document against ICH Q2 in a check-box manner, which can lead to unnecessary and non-value-adding work. Because this approach could be adopted for all users of analytical methods, it also offers the potential to standardize industry terminology and create a harmonized method validation approach. This ap-proach aligns terminology to that used for process validation and equipment qualification, supports a lifecycle approach, removes existing ambiguities in validation terms (e.g., method validation, revalidation, transfer and verification), and clarifies what is required for each part of the process. Table I summarizes this comparison of the traditional and lifecycle approaches to method validation. Conclusion The switch to a QbD approach to method development is al-ready beginning to bring improvements to the performance of analytical methods. Opportunities also exist to modernize and standardize industry's approach to method validation and transfer. By aligning method validation concepts and terminol-ogy with those used for process validation as well as equipment qualification, there is an opportunity to ensure that efforts in-vested in method validation are truly value adding, rather than simply being a check-box exercise, and to reduce confusion and complexity for analytical scientists.

A quality risk-management program systematically identifies and analyzes the risks associated with a product or process , mitigates those risks deemed unacce ptable, and monitors the overall risk profile as conditions change. These programs facilitate more informed decision-making within a company regarding a product's quality and provide greater assurance to a company's stakeh olders of the ability to deliver the highest quality product to patients.

It is, therefore, essential that these risks are assessed and mitigated throughout the product life-cycle. Risk assessment is especially critical when changes are made to validated processes or systems to ensure the integ-rity of the product is preserved as the risk profile evolves. Not all risks pose a concern; it is important to distinguish between risks that are problematic and require mitigation efforts and those that do not. Thus, an effective risk as-sessment will ensure that maximal resources are directed towards products, equipment, and processes deemed high risk and minimal resources towards those deemed low risk. Less-formal tools for managing change control Risk management tools provide the necessary means by which risk can be successfully understood and controlled, making the entire process both efficient and consistent. While there are several well-known formal tools for risk assessment, such as failure mode effect analysis (FMEA), fault tree analy-sis (FTA), hazard operability analysis (HAZOP), and hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP), ICH Q9 notes that the use of formal tools is not always appropriate or nec-essary to manage risk. It is, therefore, important to select the appropriate tool based on the objective and scope the assess-ment. The greater the risk and complexity of the system (or process) under review, the greater the level of formality and detail is required of the risk tool (see Figure 1 ). Less-formal tools, such as the comparison matrix (CM) and the risk esti-mation matrix (REM), which are designed to be easily imple-mented and broadly applied, are useful when assessing simple or well-understood systems or changes. Less-formal tools can also be used to make preliminary decisions about whether to stop or advance a given project or to employ more formal risk assessment methodologies. There are two primary goals in the assessment of risk when managing change: to assure that a company is not taking on Integration of Less-Formal Risk Assessment Tools into Change Control A Practical Approach to Risk Management Kelly Waldron and Marissa GrayAquacoat\u00aeARC: the coating that gives you controlled release with alcohol resistance.

The risk tools selected to assess changes should also be simple enough to use in a fast-paced manufacturing environment and clearly communicate the scope and impact of the change to all stakeholders. CM and REM are two such tools. Both the CM and REM have a foun- dation in critical parameters\u2014that is, categories of attributes that are deemed critical to the proper functioning of a system and must be considered to fully characterize the implications of a given change. Critical parameters are sys-tem-specific and should capture such elements as critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical or key process parame-ters (CPPs/KPPs), critical aspects (CAs) of equipment, system capacity, process capability, raw materials, and product-contact materials. These critical param-eters will serve as the input into the risk assessment process. Comparison matrix The CM is a less-formal risk tool used to compare two different states in an effort to understand what the differ-ences mean from a risk-based perspec-tive. The primary objective of the CM is to determine if, overall, the change will lead to more or less risk exposure for the process or system. The CM is particularly helpful when making \"go/no-go\" decisions regarding individual change requests. The process for the CM is as follows:1. Identify critical parameters for the system under re- view. 2. Populate the CM with details for each critical param- eter, for both the current and proposed states. 3. Determine what the differences between the current and proposed states mean from a risk-based perspec-tive (i.e., the change to overall risk profile for each criti-cal parameter). 4. Evaluate whether changes to overall risk profile are ac- ceptable. A hypothetical change request, for example, related to scaling up the production of saline solution may identify the following attributes as critical parameters: bioburden speci-fications, environmental exposure, vessel type, and vessel capacity. Once the CM is populated with details on how the current and proposed states fulfill each of these critical pa-rameters, the potential impact of each change on the overall risk profile is assessed (see Table I ). This assessment must take into consideration the nature (i.e., types of risk or potential failures), the gravity (i.e., frequency or severity of a failure), and the pervasiveness (i.e., where the failure might occur or what downstream impact it might have) of each risk. The overall risk profile may be increased if the proposed change increases variability, reduces reproducibility or ro-bustness, introduces a variable that is not well understood (such as a new technology), or cannot be quantified. Con-versely, the exposure to overall risk may be reduced if the change decreases variability, improves reproducibility or ro-bustness, or upgrades an element of the system in a way that is well-understood and controlled. Overall risk may remain the same if the change does not affect that particular critical parameter or if it is proven or expected to be equivalent to Figure 1: Risk assessment tool formality.

As with any risk assessment, available data should be cited as justification for the conclusions drawn. The final step in the CM process is to assess whether the change is acceptable from a risk-based perspective. In general, the proposed change is acceptable if the overall risk profile has not changed or has been reduced for the majority of critical parameters. If the overall risk profile, however, has increased for the majority of critical parameters that were assessed, the pro-posed change should not be accepted until additional analyses are conducted or risk mitigation measures are pursued. To continue the hypothetical example in Table I, the overall reduction of the risk profile suggests that it is appropriate to move forward with this change. The critical parameter surrounding the introduction of a new product-contact material, however, increases risk and should be examined more thoroughly. Although the CM illustrates whether a given change should be pursued, individual risks associated with the pro-posed state (change) are not thoroughly explored through this tool. These individual risks are best assessed through another less-formal tool, the risk estimation matrix (REM). Table II: Risk action level.

MediumThe risk associated with the critical parameter may be acceptable provided additional actions are taken (e.g., risk control/mitigation measures , validation ) or appropriate justification is documented.

D. Ahunji Aoki, Hyogo University of Health Sciences, Japan84 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comRisk estimation matrix REM is a simple risk assessment tool that assumes failure of each critical parameter and uses the likelihood and severity of that failure to determine the overall risk. REM is based on a 3 x 3 matrix, similar to a heat map. Like CM, REM is limited in that it is not a formal risk assessment tool; hence, it does not have the level of detail and rigor that more complex systems and processes may require. The process for REM is as follows:1. Determine qualitative scales for likelihood and severity rankings. Develop an action level table (see Table II ). 2. Identify critical parameters for the system under re- view. 3. Brainstorm potential failures for each critical parameter.4. Rank each potential failure for likelihood and severity using the criteria established in Step 1. 5. Determine overall risk using the risk matrix (see Table III). Propose mitigation for unacceptable risks. In order to preserve objectivity and ensure consistency of the risk assessment to follow, the first step in the REM methodology involves the establishment of risk ranking scales. T wo qualitative scales will be developed, each con-taining three potential scores. The likelihood scale addresses how likely is it that the failure will occur, given the cur-rent controls in place. This scale includes options ranging from remote (unlikely) through average (likely) to certain (very likely or unknown). The severity scale addresses the question: If that failure did occur, how severe would the consequences be? The severity scale ranges from minor (in-significant impact) through moderate (moderate impact) to critical (significant impact). The final scale that must be established is an action level table that dictates the acceptability for overall risk, including whether mitigation measures are required. Low-risk items may not require any mitigation activities or resource ex-penditure, whereas high-risk items will require additional risk control measures to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Returning to the hypothetical saline solution scale-up, the risk team would first brainstorm potential failures as-sociated with each critical parameter for the saline solution process. For example, the batch could fail the bioburden specification, the closed aseptic system could be breached, the new material may not be biocompatible, or the vessel capacity may be insufficient for production needs (see Table IV). Each of these potential failures is then ranked for likeli- hood and severity and the overall risk identified using the risk matrix in Table III. Focusing on the new product-contact material, it may be difficult to assign a likelihood score if there is no available data on the biocompatibility or extractable/leachable profile of this material. In such cases, it is best to take a conserva-tive approach and assign a likelihood score of \"certain\" to the lack of biocompatibility. Based on the potential patient impact of this failure, the severity would be given a score of \"critical.\" The intersection of \"certain\" and \"critical\" in the risk matrix shows this risk to be high. Thus, the risk of changing the vessel type to a new material is not accept-able, and additional risk control measures must be taken. Because in this example the overall risk is driven primarily by a lack of data, mitigation efforts would focus on biocom-patibility testing to better understand the implications of the new material on the product. Once this action is taken, it is expected that overall risk would then be reduced to an acceptable level. Conclusion To ensure that the quality system and associated processes remain in control over time, every company must under-stand how their risk exposure is affected as validated sys-tems evolve. The application of quality risk management principles and tools facilitate this understanding, allowing for more comprehensive strategy development and informed decision-making. It is not always, however, necessary to per-form lengthy, formal risk assessments to reach these goals. For simple systems and processes as well as for changes that are well understood, less-formal tools such as the compari-son matrix and risk estimation matrix provide a comprehen-sive picture of the associated risk in an easily applied format. The consistent use of these tools can enable the pharmaceu-tical industry to prioritize resource expenditure and provide only the highest quality products to patients. Reference 1.

A working group of the consortium aims to develop a set of recomm endations that can help the industry identify opportunities to improve lead time to first-in-human studies and reduce development costs while maintaining required quality standards and ensuring patient safety. This article is the fifth paper in the series and focuses on specifications.Position Paper: Early GMPs The International Consortium on Innovation and Qual- ity in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ Consortium) was formed in 2010 as an association of over 25 pharma-ceutical and biotechnology companies with a mission to advance science-based and scientifically-driven standards and regulations for medicinal products worldwide. In previous issues of Pharmaceutical Technology, papers written by the IQ Con- sortium's \"GMPs in Early Development Working Group\" de-scribed the desire and rationale for more clear and consolidated recommendations for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in Early Development (Phase 1 through Phase 2a) (1-4) . In this issue of Pharmaceutical Technology , the IQ Consortium presents a proposal for the analytical assessment and control of both drug substances (DS) and drug products (DP) in early development specifications. These recommendations take into consideration the differences in clinical trials in early development versus those in later development and provide a starting point to stimulate discussion on specifications in early development. Previous industry position(s) on the topic of science-based spec- ifications have not addressed early development needs or differ-entiated the role of specifications in early versus late development (5). During preclinical and early development, the primary focus is to progress the product into the clinic for safety and preliminary efficacy assessment. Due to the high attrition rate in early develop-ment, consistent specifications that ensure patient safety are desir-able. During late development, specifications evolve as the clinical focus expands from safety to include efficacy, and as the product and corresponding synthetic and formulation process undergo significant transformations (e.g., synthetic route changes during scale-up, evolution of dosage forms from fit-for-purpose to robust formulations and processes suitable for commercial manufactur-ing). Therefore, early development specifications should also focus on those tests and acceptance criteria determined to be critical for the control of product quality with an emphasis on patient safety and supported by preclinical and early clinical safety studies. Based on the cumulative industry experience of the members of this IQ working group, the authors of this paper have proposed standardized early phase specification tests and acceptance criteria for both DS and DP, which are discussed herein.

These tests can be performed to collect information for product and process understanding, or to allow for tighter control (i.e., target criteria tighter than the release testing criteria), to ensure product quality will be maintained throughout the product's retest period. Based on the information obtained in early development, additional tests and acceptance criteria for other attributes (e.g., water content) can be included as the late development focus shifts to process and product performance and consistency; eventually aligning with the available ICH guidelines (6). The scope of this position paper has purposely been limited to traditional small molecules that are formulated into solid oral dosage forms intended for US regulatory filings with the desire to build consistency across all worldwide regulatory regions. How-ever, it is believed that the concepts presented can be easily adapted to other dosage forms and routes of administration. Although de-signed as an industry proposal, it is recognized that each company needs to evaluate these DS and DP specification recommendations based on their individual business needs. Proposed drug substance specifications The DS used in the first-in-human (FIH) enabling GLP drug safety studies, referred to in this article as the \"tox batch,\" is a fundamen-tal part of the product lifecycle in defining the specifications for an early phase clinical DS. For the DS used in the tox batch, internal targets rather than formal specifications are routinely used while gathering knowledge about impurities, structural identification, process purging capabilities, rework processing procedures, and potential impact to the safety study. The DS tox batch is typically subjected to a series of tests to confirm description, identity, po-tency, and purity.

The testing may be similar to the DS tox batch, but with established acceptance criteria. In early development, the depth of knowledge regarding the synthetic route is still evolving and the DS has not been fully characterized. Accordingly, the initial clinical acceptance criteria are often based on target specifications (see Table I ), with the safety limits established from the tox batch being evaluated during the disposition process of the GMP clinical DS. If the tox batch is also intended to be used in a clinical study, there is an advantage in that the qualification of impurities for the clinical studies is inherently assured. In this case, the formal specification for clinical disposition of the DS may be established based on the results of tox batch testing. To further highlight the differences in expectations for early phase DS specifications, the authors propose a standardized set of clinical DS specification at-tributes in the following sections.

Description, or appearance, is a test describing the visual attributes of the DS. Although technically simple in terms of the test, it can be the subject of much discussion due to poten-tial discrepancies in visual observations from analyst to analyst. Important aspects of this specification are to ensure that there is no visible contamination or anomalous appearance within the DS. The recommended early phase acceptance criteria is often a somewhat broad range of colors (e.g., \"white to almost-white to light yellow powder\") because there is typically little batch history in early development related to the color of the DS. If it is known that the DS has an inherent color, the specification should be ad-justed accordingly. Identification . At least one form of discerning chemical identi- fication (ID) testing is performed in the early clinical release DS specifications. This testing ensures that the drug being dosed is traceable to the same chemical entity that was qualified in the safety studies. A single ID test by a spectroscopic method such as IR is often employed. Often, the spectroscopic method compares the DS with a known batch that has been well characterized by several analytical methods. Counterion. The counterion, if present, often is a relatively large percentage of the DS and as such is important to understand the overall potency. The recommended acceptance criteria is \"report results\" while batch data is accumulated and the variability of the analytical methods is assessed. If the DS is sensitive to extreme counterion levels (e.g., changes in hygroscopicity), internal targets may be implemented to prospectively alert the internal product development team of any potential issues. Assay. Assay is a critical DS component used to determine the ac- curate dosing concentration for the corresponding clinical DP. The recommended range is 97.0% to 103.0% (wt/wt on a corrected an-hydrous basis) based on typical assay variability for an HPLC-UV method and an acceptable accuracy range required for the early phase clinical studies. This range may be modified with justifica-tion for particular circumstances that require a wider acceptance range (e.g., elevated levels of a qualified impurity). In the absence of a reference standard, which may be the case for the initial DS lot, the assay value may be derived by using an assigned chemical potency factor that takes into account related substances, residual solvents, moisture, counterion, and inorganic impurities present. Impurities and degradation products. Controlling organic impurities and degradation products through the DS specification is required during all stages of drug development, except in initial microdose studies. As discussed, understanding the profile of impurities qual-ified in the Tox batch is crucial to establishing acceptance criteria for impurities in early phase clinical DS. It is also important to monitor degradation products and impurities present in the clini-cal DS which may not have been qualified in toxicology studies.

Table 2 provides qualification scenarios for individual impurities based on levels in the initial lot used for GLP safety studies versus lots produced for Phase 1 through Phase 2a clinical studies. 2 For a DS with two or more chiral centers , specific rotation may be used to monitor chiral purity in early development due to the comple xity of the molecule. Chiral impurities can also be monitored and/or controlled upstream. 3 Solvents used in earlier steps of the synthetic process can be monitored as internal specifications. 4 Physical properties , such as polymorphic form and particle -size distribution , are typically monitored throughout development as non-specification characteri zation tests. As development progresses towards commerciali zation , specifications may be introduced. 5 Internal testing can be performed in addition or in replacement of release testing on the final DS. Internal testing may have target acceptance criteria tighter than the release testing criteria. Note: NM T is not more than. ICH is International Conference on Harmoni zation.

ADI is acceptable daily intake.90 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comPosition Paper: Early GMPs In early phase development, there is limited exposure to the clinical candidate and low numbers of individuals participate in these early clinical studies. The risk to patient safety is relatively low compared to late stage development (7, 8). Therefore, this IQ working group proposes controlling impurities in early stage DS at levels that are three times (3X) higher than those defined in ICH Q3 guidelines (9, 10). As clarified in the preamble of these guidance documents, the ICH impurity guidelines are intended for pharmaceuticals approaching the point of final commercial ap-plication submission. It is inappropriate to apply these commercial ICH expectations during early clinical development based on the shorter duration of exposure during these earlier clinical studies. This 3X ICH recommendation for DS impurities in early develop-ment translates to a qualification threshold for individual impuri-ties being three times the commercial ICH Q3A limit. Specifically, the early phase DS impurity qualification threshold is proposed to be 0.5% or 3 mg per day intake, whichever is lower, for a maximum daily dose 2 g/day. It is recognized that individual companies within industry may choose to apply different impurity qualifi-cation thresholds in early development based on an assessment of safety in the context of the individual development program. Similarly, an identification (ID) threshold of three times the ICH Q3A limit (0.3%) is proposed for unknown impurities that have not been qualified by toxicology studies. This ID threshold can be set higher for unknown impurities that have already been qualified. It is expected that as development progresses, impurities would be assessed from a toxicological perspective, appropriately qualified as necessary, and the relevant specifications updated ac-cordingly. Later in development (Phase 2b and beyond), when a larger patient population is exposed to the clinical candidate for longer durations of time, the DS specifications for unqualified impurities should be narrowed to approach the limits outlined in the commercial ICH guidelines. Table II provides examples of vari-ous impurity scenarios to illustrate the utilization of the proposed early clinical identification and qualification thresholds and their potential impact on the acceptability of several example DS lots. All of the included examples assume a maximum daily dose of < 2 g/day and that the individual impurities are nongenotoxic. For individual impurities that exceed the 0.5% threshold but are supported by toxicology data, an upper limit of not more than (NMT) 1.0% in the DS is appropriate for this stage of development. In some situations, an upper limit greater than 1.0% can be justi-fied if the impurities are qualified at a higher level or if it is evident that the specific compound is also a known metabolite. In either case, a close review of the impurity profiles is required to ensure the quality of the clinical lot(s) is appropriate for the intended use and comparable based on projected exposure levels to the tox lot impurity profile. This may be triggered through the use of internal targets with alerts corresponding to the identification or qualifica-tion levels discussed above. For total impurities, the acceptance criterion often correlates with what is known about the individual impurities. An upper limit of 3.0% for total impurities is proposed as suitable for this stage of development. However, a higher upper limit for total impurities may be justified if there are a number of qualified impurities present in the DS. Chiral impurities. Chiral impurities are usually held to the same criteria as any other impurity or degradation product with a known structural identification, leading to a proposed specifica-tion of NMT 1.0%. However, the target limit for the minor enan-tiomer can vary based on understanding of its pharmacological activity, toxicological qualification, metabolism pathway, and purging capabilities of the synthetic process. Sometimes it is dif-ficult to determine the absolute chiral purity of a DS that has mul-tiple chiral centers due to chromatographic separation challenges. For these molecules, specific rotation can be used to monitor the chiral purity in early as well as late development.

FIH is first in human.Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 91able approach to controlling chiral impurities in the DS is to moni- tor the chiral purity of the starting material or at an intermediate stage, where the corresponding isomers can be readily prepared and chiral chromatographic methods developed. Residual solvents . The early development specifications for residual- solvent control are often set using the ICH established limits, including the consideration of maximum daily dose for Class 2 solvents (Option 2) (11). If the residual-solvent levels are likely to exceed the ICH limits, the specification limits in early development may be set higher than these ICH limits if they are realistically based on the manufacturing process capabilities and if there is low toxicity potential (e.g., Class 3 solvents that form solvates with the DS). In lieu of setting the standard ICH acceptance criteria, evalu- ation of known safety data are normally provided and justified by the appropriate drug-safety organization. It is also common prac-tice to only set acceptance criteria on non-Class I solvents used in later steps of the synthetic process (e.g., final recrystallization and last synthetic steps) while assuring all solvents are purged through internal/characterization testing of intermediates and/or final DS. Other internal/characterization tests In addition to the specification tests already described, there are several tests routinely performed but not included in the specifi-cations that are designed to gather information on the DS as the Table III: Proposed specifications for powder-in-bottle (PIB) and powder-in-capsule (PIC).

See us AAPS, 464492 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comPosition Paper: Early GMPs compound advances through process and analytical development. These tests are often linked to process consistency, and in early phase development there is sometimes a temptation to set wide limits based on limited manufacturing experience. Instead, it is recommended to gather data through internal/characterization testing as manufacturing experience is gained. These tests may become part of the formal specifications when meaningful limits can be introduced based on experience with the compound. These additional characterization tests are discussed below. Potential mutagenic impurities. Limits for mutagenic or potentially mutagenic impurities have been the subject of much discussion among the industry because ICH is currently drafting its M7 guideline on this topic (12). While the landscape for this class of impurities continues to evolve, the recommendation is to follow existing guidances, such as the 2007 CHMP Guideline on the Limits of Genotoxic Impurities, until ICH M7 is finalized (13). Inorganic impurities. Inorganic impurities are typically monitored via Residue on Ignition (ROI) and heavy metals tests using US Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapters <281> and <231>, respec- tively. The recommendation for ROI in early development is an internal specification of NMT 1.0% with the knowledge that this specification may be tightened as development progresses. The current USP heavy metals test is not typically sensitive to many of the metals used in an DS synthetic route and is also currently scheduled to be retired in the near future. As such, residual met-als are often monitored internally by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or ICP-atomic emission spectros-copy (OES), or some other metal specific test. The recommended limits for these metals are those set forth in EMA guidance (14). This guidance provides classifications and permitted daily ex-posures (PDEs) for many of common metal catalysts and metal reagents. Limits for metals not contained within this guidance should be discussed with the internal product development team and appropriate drug safety organization. Water content, polymorphic forms, and particle size. The proposed in- ternal specifications for water, polymorphic form and particle size distribution (PSD) are all \"report results\" for compounds in early development. For water content, there is normally limited infor- mation available about a compound's sensitivity to moisture in early development. Although it is important that data be collected, initially the acceptance criteria should be \"report results\" unless the product quality is known to be sensitive to water. In the case where the DS is a known hydrate or shown to be hygroscopic, a target water content range is typically established in the DS specification. X-ray diffraction, Raman, and solid-state NMR can be used to monitor the polymorphic form of the DS. Because the polymor-phic form can impact on solubility, stability, and bioavailability, any change in form is typically monitored during stability studies. Particle-size distribution (PSD) can be crucial to the ability to formulate the DS into the desired dosage form. In early develop-ment, many of the formulations are relatively simple (e.g., powder in a bottle) and the PSD information is normally gathered for de-velopment purposes only as an internal test. However in certain cases (e.g., low dose tablets, inhaled products), it is worth consid-ering a suitable PSD target which is normally set in collaboration with the formulation development group. Other tests to consider. Other tests may be considered as additional specification tests or non-specification tests for data collection pur-poses. For example, certain physicochemical properties of the DS, such as pH of an aqueous solution, melting point/range, and re-fractive index may be considered depending on the physical nature of the DS and its intended use. Similarly, there may be a need to specify the total count of aerobic microorganisms, the total count of yeasts and molds, and the absence of specific objectionable bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) in the DS. If so, these should be suitably determined using pharmacopeial procedures. Proposed DP specifications Quality attributes that affect DP performance are typically not known during the early stages of drug development. Regulatory specifications should focus on ensuring that accurate and repro-ducible dosing can be achieved in the clinic and that patient safety is not compromised. For many tests, it is important that charac-Table IV: Proposed specifications for tablets and capsules.

Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 93terization data be acquired, reported, and monitored to gain an understanding of the DP in the context of characterizing chemi-cal, processing, and packaging sensitivities. As product development continues, the DP formulation and process, along with the corresponding analytical methods usually undergo significant changes. The specifications evolve as additional knowl-edge is gained (e.g., tightening or widening acceptance criteria, adding tests). As mentioned in the introduction to this paper, the authors have purposely limited the scope to oral dosage forms with an em-phasis on US filings. The following sections outline proposed specifications for powder-in-bottle (PIB), powder-in-capsule (PIC), and tablets and capsules used in early de-velopment. Powder-in-bottle and powder-in-capsule specifications. The PIB formulation is the simplest presentation of a DP for early clinical trials. It involves extemporaneous compounding of the DS into a solution or suspension for oral administration. The development of PIB requires a solubility assessment of the DS and selection of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle based on the expected clinical dose range. The DP is then manufactured by weighing the DS into appropriately sized bottles for re-constitution with the chosen vehicle at the clinical site. With the selection of PIB for clinical trials, the product development re-sources and timelines can be reduced sig-nificantly as there is no formal formulation development and thus additional analytical testing for stability, content uniformity, and dissolution are not necessary. Because only neat DS is weighed into the bottles, the specifications for the release of the DS can be readily used to release the DP. Thus, the results of the appearance and identification tests used initially for releasing the DS can be used for the DP as well. Similarly, the initial impurity results for the DP are normally taken from the DS release data and the degradation prod-ucts are monitored as part of the recom-mended DP stability assessment. For PIB assay, the 90.0-110.0% range covers the typical variability observed in fill weights for this formulation. A stability study of the reconstituted PIB is normally conducted to support its use at the clinical site within the recommended storage conditions, as well as holding and dosing times. Verifying the uniformity of the dos- age units is recommended as an inter-nal specification test only. In PIB cases where it is intended to be weighed at the clinical site, a simple weight check dur-ing release testing assures that sufficient DS is contained in the bottle. This weight check may be omitted from the DP spec-ifications if it is conducted as part of an in-process control. In cases where the entire contents of the PIB are to be used to make the clinical dosing solution and only a small amount of material (e.g., 1-2 mg) is provided in the bottle, then a more suitable quantitative analytical technique (e.g., a chromatographic method) may be required to verify the accuracy of the dos-ing concentration. Similar to PIB, the PIC formulation is another simple presentation of neat DS in a capsule. PIC also provides dosing flexibility but has the added advantage of allowing easy manufacture of matching placebos. The only major difference in its development process compared with PIB is that a compatibility study of the DS with the capsule shell should be done to select a suitable capsule. The typical PIC specification tests used in early development are comparable to those used for PIB formulations (see Table III). Specifically, appearance, identifica- tion, and assay all rely on the DS release results. Uniformity of PIC dosage units is performed according to USP General Chapter <905> but it can be omitted as a regulatory specification if it is part of an in-process control. In addition, disintegra-tion test per USP General Chapter <701> is recommended to ensure that the cap-sules rupture to allow the release of the drug for absorption. Tablet and capsule specifications. In early development, tablet and capsules for oral administration often employ \"fit-for-pur-pose\" formulation approaches designed to be suitable for wide classes of compounds, with the ultimate goal of facilitating rapid entry into FIH clinical trials. In the case of tablets and dry fill capsules (DFC), these formulations often employ a dry blend or granulations of a nonreactive diluent, a disintegrant, and a glidant to aid in pro- We make pharmaceutical feeding processes work PureFeed\u00ae Pharmaceutical Feeders For pharmaceutical feeding solutions, call: (800) 558-0184 www.accuratefeeders.comCONTINUOUS MIXING MELT EXTRUSION CONTINUOUS GRANULATIONFEEDING IN:Product Line Features: '\u000feed rate range from .02 kg/hr to 150 kg/hr.

As shown in Table IV , standardized specifications are fre- quently established for capsules and tablets that are used in early development that can be segregated into the following attributes: Description and identification: Visual description of the dosage form and correct identification of the active dose are critical to the integrity of the clinical study and thus are important attributes to be included in the DP specifications. The appear-ance specification should note the external color and shape of the dosage form. A single discerning identification test is normally sufficient and may be derived from the HPLC test used for assay or impurities based on the comparison of the sample retention time or photodiode array spectrum to that of a comparator DS batch. Assay: An assay specification of 90.0-110.0% is normally attain- able and controllable for most tablet and capsule formulations used in early development and ensures dosage integrity and patient safety. Additionally, this acceptance criteria provides reasonable formulation process control while accounting for typical assay variability and formulation inconsistencies in early development given the higher levels of impurities/degradation products nor-mally observed at this stage. Impurities and degradation products : Similar to the earlier proposal for DS, it is proposed that identification and qualification thresholds of three times those listed in ICH Q3B guideline (regardless of maximum daily dose), be applied for both impurities and degra-dation products in DP in the early stage. The proposed limit for unspecified individual degradation products in early development is NMT 1.0%. The limit of 5.0% for total degradation products in early phase DPs is higher than the corresponding limit of 3.0% for total impurities in DS due to the additional variability contributed by the formulation excipients, DP manufacturing process, and DP analytical methods. In early development, these limits are justified because clinical studies are of limited size and duration and stability information on early drug candidates with respect to sensitivities to moisture, hydrolysis, and oxidation is still being acquired. Later in develop-ment, process control, formulation design, and product protection strategies to minimize product degradation can be implemented after the compound sensitivities are better understood and thus tighter degradation product controls are justified. Uniformity of dosage units: The uniformity of active material in dos- age units is important to the integrity of the clinical trial and to patient safety. The guidance for acceptance values is defined in USP General Chapter <905>. These acceptance criteria set a mini- mum standard for batch homogeneity and should be attainable at all stages of development for both capsules and tablets. Water content: As described for DS, a DP specification only needs to be established to control moisture levels in an investigational capsule or tablet dosage if the product quality or performance is known to be sensitive to water. As development progresses and additional knowledge is attained about product performance and stability in the presence of water, a specification may be applied, as necessary for release, shelf life, or both. Dissolution and disintegration: For rapidly dissolving immediate release formulations, it is recommended to include disinte-gration as a regulatory filed specification. Dissolution may be performed as an internal specification (i.e., report results without defined acceptance criteria) to gather product knowl-edge during early development (e.g., for poorly soluble drugs). As additional knowledge is gained toward establishing an in-vitro-in-vivo correlation (IVIVC), dissolution acceptance criteria should be established in later development (i.e., Phase 2b and beyond). Other tests to consider. Other tests may be added to the DP specifi- cation as required. For example, residual solvents should be tested if solvents are used in the DP manufacturing process. Similar to DS, microbial testing may be considered, although a risk assess-ment may be performed to justify not including this test in the specification for solid oral dosage forms in early development. Some in-process control tests such as hardness and/or friability may have a critical impact on drug product quality (e.g., chewable tablets). In these cases, acceptance criteria should be included in the specification. Conclusions A standard, risk-based approach has been presented for setting DS and DP specifications in early development for conventional solid oral dosage forms intended for US regulatory submissions. The recommendations herein are aimed at ensuring patient safety while allowing the flexibility to adapt to the frequent product and process changes that occur early in development. The authors' goal is to promote clarity and consensus within the pharmaceutical industry and to establish a more detailed approach to specifications in early development that are aligned across the industry and regulatory agencies. To further stimulate discussions on these approaches within the industry and with worldwide health authorities, this IQ working group is planning on conducting a workshop in the near future to promote robust debate and discussion on these proposed specifications in early development. In closing, it is recognized that each company needs to evaluate these early development recommendations based on the objectives of their individual drug development programs and may choose not to adopt this industry proposal on phase appropriate specifications.

PHIL ASHLEY/GETTY IMAGESCoating Coatings are applied to particles for various reasons. Cosmetic coatings are used to achieve an appealing appearance, to help differentiate between different dosage forms, and to help with blinding the samples in clinical trials. Functional coatings are required for the protection of the drug from moisture, to mask the bitterness or smell of drugs, and to modify the release of actives by, for example, providing gastric resistance, targeting certain regions in the gastrointestinal system, or prolonging the release. Another commonly used application is drug layering of particles. Here, the API is suspended or dissolved in a binder solu-tion (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone) and sprayed onto the substrate. A coating with a functional polymer is often applied directly after the drug-layering step. Common polymers used in coating have a range of proper- ties and functions, and some examples are shown in Table I . The amount of polymer in the coating is given as a range because the actual amount depends on several factors, including: t\u0001Surface area of the particles, with smaller particles re- quiring higher amounts of polymer to achieve the desired functionality. t\u0001 Solubility of the actives, with higher solubility requiring higher polymer weight gains, as in the case of sustained release coatings, in which the drug is released via diffusion through the coating layer. t\u0001 Surface structure of the substrate and mechanical stability. The actual polymer amount should be calculated based on the measured, specific surface area. Specific surface area can be de-termined by using a BET gas adsorption method or by an image-aided, particle size and shape analysis method. Coating liquids Polymers for liquid coating are available as solutions or dispersions with a broad range of viscosities, and the liquids may contain sus-pended particles. Liquid properties should always be considered when choosing the right equipment for processing. Table II gives an overview of coating liquids and recommendations for stirring pump and spray systems. General considerations for processing coating liquids include: t\u0001 Suspend particles thoroughly during preparation of the spray- ing suspension, preferably with high shear forces t\u0001 Use low stirrer speeds t\u0001 Use larger stirrer diameters for good mixing t\u0001 Keep all coating liquids free of air bubblesUnderstanding Particle Coating Considerations for Coating Polymers Felix Hofmann and Harald StahlMORE TECHNOLOGY.

With dispersions, as shown in Figure 1 , the polymer and the liquid phase are in a heterogeneous system. With solutions, the polymer and the liquid phase are in a ho-mogeneous system, as shown in Figure 2 .

Film formation (i.e., coalescence) can only be observed at temperatures above the MFT. For fast film formation during coating, temperatures 10-20 K above MFT are recommended. Aging or further coalescence can occur if the film is stored at temperatures above the T g. During aging, free volume is reduced, which typically leads to lower permeability and a reduced dissolution rate of the API. Such polymer films need special postprocessing to accelerate the aging process and ensure stable storage formulations if the storage temperature is not well below the T g. The film formation of solutions is sim- pler because they do not have an MFT. The film is formed by evaporation of the solvent, and the process temperature de-fines the evaporation speed. If the solvent is evaporated too fast, free volume in the polymer film will be generated, and aging effects can occur as described above. In general, removing volatile sub- stances (i.e., solvent) from the film can reduce the permeability of the film inde-pendently of the T g. A drying process is recommended, therefore, for all coating liquids. This effect should not be con-fused with aging of the polymer film. Types of coaters and associated process parameters Top-spray systems. These systems were developed mainly for making agglomer-ates. With a spray nozzle placed above the product bed, particles are locally overwet-ted. Such particles will meet randomly and form larger granulates by sticking to each other. In the case of coating, exactly the op-posite is required. No particles should meet in a wet state because of the risk of forming agglomerates. In a top-spray process, the only way to tackle this problem is by reduc-ing the spray rate until unacceptable levels of agglomeration or picking (i.e., particles sticking for a short duration to each other and damaging the coating when they sepa-rate again) are eliminated. This reduction in spray rate will in turn increase overall process time. Bottom-spray systems. Compared to top-spray coaters, the mechanical set-up of the bottom-spray coaters is better for preventing agglomerates. The most commonly known bottom-spray system is the Wurster coater. It was invented in 1953 and continued to be the state-of-the-art for 35 years. For simpler applica- tions such as cosmetic coatings, the Wurster coater was used successfully until the mid-1980s. By that time, however, com-panies commercialized more complex formulations that often faced serious issues with agglomeration, regular nozzle block-ages, and necessity of splitting batches if higher weight gains were required. These problems sometimes led to significant product losses, extremely long processes, and difficult scale-up procedures, which drove demand for the development of a new generation of coaters.Coating Table III: Input parameters for the application.

The Aeromatic-Fielder Precision Coater and the Glatt Wurster HS were introduced in the late 1980s. Both follow the princi-pal idea of the Wurster coater but elimi-nate most of its limitations through me-chanical optimizations and improved fluid dynamics. These machines elimi-nated many of the shortfalls in earlier systems and were technology leaders for the following decades. They al-lowed, for example: t\u0001\u00013VOOJOH \u0001NVMUJUVCF \u0001JOTUBMMBUJPOT and Aeromatic-Fielders FlexStream marked the next stage in de-velopment by eliminating the need for columns. Both systems use tangential spray and remove the risk of particles get-ting thrown into the highly moist zone in front of the nozzle tip(s) by introducing a protective air stream around the nozzle. The systems' performance is similar to the modern bottom-spray systems described above. Additionally, the tangential-spray systems can be used for granulation with-out using extra product containers. Their design allows easy scale-up. Application matrix Because particle coating is a highly com-plex process, thorough knowledge about the type of application, coating liquid, and substrate type is required. An ap-plication matrix was developed from the experience of numerous particle-coating projects to assist in rating the difficulty connected with coating.

A multi-layer coating applica-tion, for which D=5, involved a functional coating followed by in-process curing with purified water, for which D=1. The coating liquid was a low viscous dispersion with suspended particles with D=3. The application matrix equation resulted in a cumulative difficulty score of 30. With this score, the work could have been conducted in a Wurster or modern bottom-coating system, but a tangential sys-tem (Aeromatic-Fielders, FlexStream) was chosen because of its easier scale-up. Experiments were run with lab, pilot, and produc-tion scales using 2.5, 10, and 60 kg of core material, respectively, that was coated and in-process cured using three sizes of a fluid-bed processor (Aeromatic Fielders, Flexstream MP 1, MP 2/3 and MP 4/5, respectively). Process parameters are listed in Table VII. A coating of 12% dry matter of a polymer (Evonik, Eudragit NE 30 D) was applied on the core material for each batch. Coating excipients were 100% talc, 10% polysorbate 80, and 10% mPas) based on the dry matter (Evonik, Eudragit NE 30). Purified water was used as diluent; the solid content of the spraying suspension was 20%. A silica suspension (Grace, Syloid 244FP, 10% into the process to avoid pellet agglomeration. After heating to the desired product temperature, water was sprayed into the process to control the humidity level. Once curing conditions were reached, the process was kept steady for 30 min. The key parameters for in-process cur-ing were product and outlet temperature and outlet air humidity (see Table VIII) . Differences in drying air capacity and inlet air humidity were compensated by the spray rate and inlet air temperature. The dissolution test was carried out in a United States Pharmacopeia (USP) appa- ratus II (i.e., paddle apparatus) with 100 rpm in 900 mL 0.1N hydrochloric acid for 2 h followed by a full change to 900 mL phosphate buffer with a pH=6.8 (1). Stor-age stability of the pilot-scale batch was conducted according to ICH guidelines using high-density polyethylene bottles for packaging (2). An F-test (95% signifi-cance level) showed no difference between the release profiles of the different scales or during the six-month storage stability test (see Figures 3 and 4 ). This example shows how a fundamen- tal understanding of the process complexi- ties and the appropriate choice of a fluid-bed processor led to suc-cessful scale-up of a particle coating. Conclusion From a processing point of view, most coating applications are similar. Nevertheless, the level of coating difficulty varies dramati-cally depending on the core materials, the type of coating fluid, and the amount of coating that needs to be applied. The applica-tion matrix helps identify the optimal coating process and equip-ment, which, along with an understanding of how the components interact, can ensure successful particle coating.

CREATIVE CROP/GETTY IMAGESQuality by Design Quality by design (QbD) is a systematic approach to de- signing and developing pharmaceutical formulations and manufacturing processes to ensure predefined product quality (1). In the case of hydrophilic matrix tablets, it is important to consider potential variability in material attributes of the rate-controlling polymer in ad-dition to variability in the API properties and processing conditions (2-4). This proactive and enhanced understand-ing supports efficient pharmaceutical product development. This study examines the effect and interaction of variations in hypromellose physicochemical properties on powder flow, the physical attributes of tablets, and in vitro drug-release pro- files from two model formulations of extended-release (ER) hydrophilic matrix tablets using QbD principles. This article presents a QbD approach to determine the effect of material at-tributes on both the physical properties and in vitro drug-release performance of the matrix tablets. The excipient hypromellose United States Pharmacopeia (USP) substitution type 2208 (Methocel K15M Premium CR, Dow Chemical) was used as the rate-controlling polymer for two case studies with a soluble drug (propranolol hydrochloride [HCl]) and slightly soluble drug (theophylline). Normal varia-tion of Methocel material attributes (apparent viscosity, percent hydroxylpropoxyl (HP) substitution, and particle size) was stud-ied at polymer concentrations of 15% w/w and 30% w/w. The study demonstrated consistent physical properties for direct-compression blends and subsequent tablet cores, irrespective of the Methocel concentration or drug included. In vitro drug release, however, showed greater sensitivity to material-attribute variability at lower polymer concentration. The importance of QbD QbD is a systematic approach to pharmaceutical development that results in increased quality and reduced costs. QbD means designing and developing formulations and manufacturing processes to ensure predefined product quality (1). Adoption of QbD principles for new-chemical-entity and generic-drug products is becoming an expectation by regulatory agencies to better ensure that high-quality medicines are available to the end-user, namely the patient. Building quality into drug prod-ucts by design also benefits developers. Successful first-cycle ap-proval, reduction of postapproval changes, and the potential of real-time release could offset initial investment associated with QbD implementation.Applying Quality by Design For Extended-Release Hydrophilic Matrix Tablets Ian.

Before FDA introduced QbD into the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) review process in 2004, the amount of product waste due to manufacturing mistakes was reported to be as high as 50% (5). Clearly, for the end-user, the patient, drug-product recalls associated with quality issues, and po-tential shortages of medicines are a risk to health. For the manufacturer, these problems can lead to severe financial penalties due to loss of market share and even litigation. Needless to say, adverse publicity also can erode consumer confidence and damage a manufacturer's reputation. The foundations of QbD for drug-product development are contained within the International Conference on Harmoni-zation (ICH) quality guideline ICH Q8 (R2) Pharmaceutical Development (R2) (6). This guideline for pharmaceutical de- velopment includes \"determining the critical quality attributes (CQA) of the drug substance (and) excipients and selecting the type and amount of excipient to deliver drug product of the de-sired quality\" (6). This determination is of particular importance for designing drug products for ER applications, where the per-formance of the rate-controlling excipient is crucial to precisely deliver the required amount of drug over time. Typically, for ER technologies, such as hydrophilic matrices, barrier membrane-coated multiparticulates and osmotic delivery systems, the dose of the drug within a single unit is much greater than in an immediate-release product. Understanding the primary rate-controlling excipients' physiochemical properties (i.e., material attributes) is important to ensure robustness of the finished prod-uct and to mitigate any risk of batch-to-batch variability and/or potential premature drug release that could impact the patient. Hydrophilic matrix products Hydrophilic matrices are a well-established ER delivery plat-form due to their flexibility in delivering a wide range of drugs, relatively simple manufacturing, and generally good product stability and shelf-life. The majority of marketed hydrophilic matrix products use high-viscosity hypromellose (HPMC) as the rate-controlling polymer. HPMC polymers are semisyn-thetic materials derived from cellulose with chemical modifi-cation to add both the methoxyl (CH3-O-) and hydroxypro-poxyl (CH 3CHOHCH2-O-) functional groups. In addition to the type and distribution of these functional groups, the poly-mer molecular weight (measured indirectly by apparent vis-cosity) and particle size are key material attributes that could affect drug-product manufacturability and performance. Methocel for hydrophilic matrix applications uses two types of chemical substituent groups signified by either \"E\" or \"K\" designations (7). Methocel E chemistry is the USP substitution type 2910; K chemistry is the substitution type 2208. The num-ber that follows the chemistry designation identifies viscosity in millipascal-seconds (mPa\u00b7s), measured at 2% weight/volume aqueous solution at 20 \u00b0C. The letter \"M\" is used to represent a multiplier of 1000.Along with the polymer, ER matrix formulations typically consist of the API, filler, binder, glidant, and lubricant. Other functional ingredients also may be added, such as additional polymers to modify the release rate, buffering agents to miti-gate the effects of pH-dependent drug solubility, stabilizers, and surfactants. Commonly, a matrix-tablet formulation also will be film-coated with a conventional immediate-release coating or may be coated with a functional modified-release coating system. Accordingly, the matrix formulation can be designed to influence the mechanism and rate of drug release. The design can include polymer type and concentration, drug solubility and dose, polymer-to-drug ratio, filler type and concentration, polymer-to-filler ratio, the particle size of the drug and polymer, and the shape of the matrix (8-12). Drug solubility is an important factor in determining the mechanism of drug release from hypromellose hydrophilic matrices (i.e., diffusion, diffusion and erosion, or erosion) and guides the selection of other excipients as well as the viscosity and chemistry grade of the hypromellose. Nevertheless, as the principal rate-controlling excipi- ent, it is important to assess the criticality of both polymer concentration and the effect of material-attribute variation (within the manufacturer's sales-specification limits) on the final drug-product quality. This knowledge is important to justify development of a robust formulation and to set an appropriate control strategy for consistent manufacture of a high-quality finished product. Materials and methods Two case studies were designed to investigate the influence of material attributes: the percent HP substitution, viscosity, and particle size on the functional performance of hydro-philic matrix-tablet formulations (2-3). The rate-controlling polymer in K15M Premium CR ( USP substitution 2208). The designation of \"15M\" describes a relatively high-viscosity material, and the \"CR\" grade is designed for controlled-release applications. Polymer concentration can be an important factor for matrix robustness. Two polymer concentrations, therefore, were evaluated: 30% w/w, which has been shown to produce robust formulations, and 15% w/w, which was considered relatively low and could result in performance differences of the hydrophilic matrix tablet associated with variability in the material attributes. For these case studies, Methocel K15M Premium CR batches were carefully selected. Six of the batches were selected on the basis of having two out of three material attributes (percent HP , particle size, and apparent viscosity) within the nominal manufacturer sales-specification values, with the third prop-erty at the \"high\" or the \"low\" extremes of the normal sales- specification range. In addition, one batch had all three prop-erties close to the nominal specification values, denoted as \"center point\" (see Table I ). A total of 14 matrix formulations (seven each for 15% and 30% w/w OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comwere prepared. The Methocel K15M Premium CR batches used in these studies will be referred to by the \"batch name\" listed in Table I . The methoxyl substitution content could be considered another material attribute for Methocel that may affect the robustness of the formulation. Prior assessment of the methoxyl content variation (from the manufacturer's sales- specification) showed this to be precisely controlled, and therefore, it was not considered to be a significant variable and was excluded from the study. Propranolol hydrochloride ER model formulations For the first study, the model API was propranolol HCl (soluble drug, 50 mg/mL, 160-mg dose). The formulation is detailed in Table II. Tablet preparation procedure. Propranolol HCl, hyprom- ellose, and microcrystalline cellulose were passed through an ASTM #30 mesh (600 m) screen and mixed in a four-quart V blender (Model B Lab Blender, Patterson-Kelley) at 26 rpm for 10 min. Magnesium stearate was screened through an ASTM #40 mesh (400 m) screen and added to the powder mixture, followed by blending for an addi-tional 3 min. The final powder mixtures were compressed at 5-20 kN (compaction pressure of 70-280 MPa) using an instrumented 10-station rotary tablet press (Piccola, RIVA) at 20 rpm using standard round 9.52-mm concave tooling and a tablet weight of 350 mg. The formulated powder blends were analyzed for bulk and tapped densities using a VanKel density tester (Model 10705, Varian), flowability using a flow tester (Sotax FT 300, Sotax), and loss on drying (LOD) using an infrared (IR) moisture balance (Model IR-200, Denver Instrument). Tablet weight, breaking force, diameter, and thickness were measured with an automated tablet tester (Multicheck V, Erweka). Tablet friability was measured using a VanKel fria-bilator (Varian) at 100 revolutions and 25 rpm. A dissolution study was performed using an USP Apparatus II, 100 rpm, with sinkers, and 1000 mL of a pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. Propranolol release was detected at a wavelength of 289 nm using a ultraviolet of hypromellose 15 Premium CR , Dow Chemical) batches.

The similarity factor ( f2), which is a measurement of the similarity in the percentage of dissolution between two curves, was calculated by comparing the high versus the low end of the selected physicochemical property. Two dissolution profiles are considered similar when the f 2 value is > 50. In addition, the release exponent ( n) and release-rate constant ( k) were calcu- lated by fitting the dissolution data to the Power Law equation (M t/Minf) = k tn, where Mt is the amount of drug released at time t; Minf is the amount of drug released over a very long time, which corresponds in principle to the initial loading; k is the kinetic constant; and n is the release exponent (12). Theophylline ER model formulations In the second study, the model API was theophylline anhydrous (slightly soluble drug, 8.3 mg/mL, 160-mg dose). The formulation is detailed in Table III through an ASTM #30 mesh (600 m) screen and mixed in a four-quart V blender (Patterson-Kelley) at 26 rpm for 10 min. Mag-nesium stearate was screened through an ASTM #40 mesh (400 m) screen, added to the powder mixture, followed by blending for a further 3 min. The final powder blends were compressed at 15 kN (210 MPa) using an instrumented 10-sta-tion rotary tablet press (Piccola, RIVA) at 20 rpm using a standard round 9.52-mm concave tooling and a tablet weight of 350 mg. All blends were analyzed for bulk and tapped density using a VanKel density tester (Varian) and LOD (Model IR-200, Den-ver Instrument). Tablets were examined for physical proper-ties, including weight variation, thickness, and hardness as well as friability. Drug release was measured using an USP Ap- paratus II (VK 7000, Varian) at 100 rpm with sinkers and 1000 mL of deionized water at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C. Theophylline release was detected at a using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453, Agilent Technologies) fitted with quartz flow cells of a 2-mm path length. The similarity factor ( f 2) was calculated by comparing the high versus the low end of the selected physicochemical property. In addition, the release exponent ( n) and release-rate constant ( k) were calculated by fitting the dissolution data to the Power Law equation (11).

All matrix tablets had comparable hardness, tensile strength, and friability values. Similar results were observed for all formulations with 15% w/w polymer concentration, in-dicating that the material attributes (i.e., percent HP, particle size, and viscosity) of Metho- cel K15M CR had minimal or no influence on the physical properties of the formulated powder blends or tablets. All matrices showed low friability ( 0.06%) and consistent con-tent Propranolol when polymer 15% to 30% w/w At both 15% and 30%, drug-release profiles were similar (f 2 = 63 and 68, respectively) despite variations in Methocel viscosity (see Figure 1 ). Use of higher polymer concentration ( 30% w/w) resulted in lower tablet-to-tablet variability as indicated by the error bars. The effect on drug release of the percent HP substitution of hypromellose on the drug-release profiles is shown in Fig-ure 2. Here too, at both 15% and 30% polymer concentration, the drug-release profiles were similar ( f 2 = 82 and 91, respec- tively) despite variations in percent HP content. The effect of Methocel particle size on the drug-release profiles is shown in Figure 3 . At 30% polymer concentra- tion, the drug-release profiles were very similar ( f2 = 95) despite variations in particle size. At 15% polymer con-centration, however, the batch with the larger particle size (low percentage through 230 mesh) gave a faster and dissimilar ( f 2 = 46) drug-release profile compared with the batch with the finer particle size (high percentage through 230 mesh) of the polymer. In addition, tablet-to-tablet variability was higher in the formulation contain-ing the coarser particle size in comparison to the center point and fine particle-size formulations. All formulations produced good results fitting to the Power Law equation (R 2 > 0.99). The release exponent ( n) was in the range of 0.59-0.63 for 30% w/w polymer formulations and 0.48-0.56 for 15% w/w polymer formulations, indicating drug release mainly by diffusion (11). Higher polymer concentration may decrease sensitivity of the formulation to minor variations in raw materials or the manufacturing process. The potential for particle-size variability to influence in vitro drug release was shown to be negated when higher concentration of Methocel K15M CR was used. Theophylline ER model formulations . Study results indicated that comparable physical properties were obtained for the-ophylline powder blends and compressed tablets at both 15% and 30% polymer concentration. All matrices showed low tablet-weight variation (1.0-1.9%), low friability ( 0.14%), consistent content uniformity (94.8-100.0%).Figure 3: Propranolol hydrochloride release profiles\u2014effect of particle size. 100 80604020 0% D issolved 0 2 468 1 0 1 2 Time (h)High % thru 230 mesh/low l evel Low % thru 230 mesh/low l evel Cente r point/low l evelHigh % thru 230 mesh/high level Low % thru 230 mesh/high level Cente r point/high level30% polymer f2 = 9515% polymer f2 = 46Quality by Design biddle sawyer CORPORATION MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVES AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PHARMACEUTICAL EXCIPIENTS 114 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comPharmaceutical Technology and Patheon are partnering to provide you\u2014our readers\u2014with CMC advice from some of the leading formulation scientists and pharmaceutical manufacturing experts in the world.

At both 15% and 30% polymer concentrations, drug-release profiles were similar ( f 2 > 50) despite variations in Methocel viscosity, percent HP substitution, and particles size. Results for all formulations fit to the Power Law equa-tion (R 2 > 0.99). The release exponent ( n) was in the range of 0.50-0.62 for 30% w/w polymer formulations and 0.39-0.48 for 15% w/w polymer formulations, indicating that diffusion is the principal mechanism of drug release (13). The linear-regression model also was applied to exam- ine the relationship between drug-release response (i.e., release constant ( k), release exponent ( n) or time for 80% drug release [ T 80%])and predictor variables (i.e., viscosity, percent HP, and particle size measured by percent through 230 mesh). Results indicated statistically an insignificant relationship (p value > 0.1). Conclusion The study demonstrated that evaluation of hypromellose materials-attribute variability on matrix formulation robustness can be readily determined. It was shown that material-attribute-variability effects can be dependent upon the rate-controlling polymer concentration. This observation has important impli-cations for designing Methocel-based ER matrices. Results indicate that the ranges studied for viscosity, per- centag of HP, and particle size of Methocel K15M Premium CR had no significant effect on the physical properties of propranolol HCl or theophylline formulation blends and tablets. This finding is important for direct-compression processing because blend properties, such as flow and com-pactability, can impact CQA, such as content uniformity for a matrix formulation. For both model formulations, the drug-release profiles from Methocel matrices were slower when the polymer con-centration was increased from 15% to 30% w/w. At concentration, profiles of propranolol HCl were similar ( f 2 > 68) de- spite variations in viscosity, percent HP, and particle size. At 15% w/w polymer concen-tration, the drug-release profiles of propranolol HCl were simi-lar (f 2 > 63) despite variations in viscosity and percent HP substi-tution; therefore, for these case studies, both material attributes were noncritical. An early indication of risk associated with material-attri-bute variability is an important factor in formulation design and the subsequent manufacturing-process selection. The formu- lator can develop an enhanced understanding by building quality into its drug product by evaluating material attributes and \"designing out\" variability effects. Development of poorly designed and understood products can lead to manufactur-ing and cost inefficiencies, including customized excipient specifications and batch selection as well as producing out-of-specification drug products. The approach, presented in this study, provides a useful starting point for identifying and managing excipient material-attribute criticality when devel-oping drug products through Yu, Pharm.

AUGUST STEIN/PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESPharmTech.com/edqm Recent development in analytical technology has made possible the fast determination of unit con- tent in a large number of dosage units from a batch using nondestructive analytical methods during produc-tion. These measurement techniques are often referred to as process ana-lytical technology (PAT). Using such methodology, a better understand-ing of the manufacturing process, in line with the quality-by-design (QbD) concept according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Quality Guidelines Q8-Q11, and a closer control of the drug product can be obtained compared with the use of traditional analytical methods. The in-creased process control that is achieved by PAT is attractive both from the pa-tient's point of view (improved product quality) and from the industry's point of view (increased production efficacy, less batch rejection). Acceptable batch quality is demon- strated by compliance with the drug product specification. Usually, several of the tests of a specification refer to pharmacopeial test methodologies and acceptance criteria. One such test is the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.) General Chapter 2.9.40 on Uniformity of Dosage Units (UDU). To take full ad-vantage of the increased batch control that is gained by P AT in general and large sample size in particular, there has been a demand for a test method that utilizes large sample sizes to dem-onstrate compliance with UDU. Such a test has recently been adopted by the European Pharmacopoeia Commission, and will be published as Ph.Eur. General Chapter 2.9.47. In this paper, the new test is presented and explained. Background To ensure the consistency of dosage units, each unit in a batch should have an active substance content within a limited range around the label claim (1). Ph.Eur. General Chapter 2.9.40 on UDU addresses the recommended test to demonstrate this critical property in a batch of drug product. The general monograph was introduced in Supple-ment 5.2 of the Ph.Eur. , and is harmo- nized with the Japanese Pharmaco- peia (JP). The test is also included in the US Pharmacopeia (USP) , but with a reservation against the possibility to demonstrate UDU by mass variation rather than content uniformity, which is allowed in Ph.Eur. and JP under cer- tain circumstances (2). When justified and authorized, acceptable dose uni-formity may be demonstrated by com-pliance with Ph.Eur. General Chapter 2.9.5 Uniformity of Mass of Single-Dose Preparations (2.9.5) or General Chapter 2.9.6 Uniformity of Content of Single-Dose Preparations (2.9.6) in-stead of the UDU test (3). With the harmonized UDU test, acceptable and nonacceptable batches, respectively, are more precisely judged than with the 2.9.5/2.9.6 tests, as the sample size is larger (n = 30, as opposed to n = 20, and n = 10, respectively). The UDU test returns a numerical measure of the dose consistency\u2014that is, the acceptance value (AV). In addition, UDU takes into account sample mean: a stricter standard deviation require-ment applies if the sample mean is more than 1.5% off-target. The perfor-mance of the old and the new General Chapters has been discussed by Lim-berg and Savsek (4). Although it is assumed that the sample is representative for the batch, it is acknowledged that the evaluation of a small sample will only provide an estimate of the batch quality. There is always a risk that a highly variable batch would pass the UDU test and be released. Likewise, there is always a risk that a good quality batch can fail the UDU test and be rejected. Increas-ing the sample size leads to a more pre-cise estimate of the batch variability. Concerns have been raised that the UDU requirements discourage the use of modern analytical techniques that are fast and nondestructive (e.g., PAT techniques) (5-10). It was unfortunate that a pharmacopoeial requirement \u00d8. Holte and M. Horvat Uniformity of Dosage Units Using Large Sample Sizes M. Horvat is a leading scientist with Lek Pharmaceuticals.

Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 119Inside Ph.Eur.ALL FIGURES ARE COURTESY OF THE AUTHORScould be regarded as a disincentive to the implementation of such analytical methods. The main concern with the UDU test when applied to large samples was the requirement that no single result of the test sample is outside \u00b1 L2 % of the reference value M (M = \"sample average\"; L2 = 25.0, unless otherwise specified. For a precise definition of M, refer to Ph.Eur. 2.9.40). Such an un- conditional requirement is included in both General Chapters 2.9.5/2.9.6 and the UDU chapter. The requirement was established to disclose batches with largely deviating units, even if the sample mean and the overall sample variance is acceptable. This \"safety net\" does not assume any distribution in the sample or in the batch (e.g., normality), and it seems reasonable enough not to allow any largely deviating unit in a small sample. Even in normal distributed batches of good quality, a small number of largely deviating units is expected. As sample size increases, the probability to detect one of these units becomes significant. In the new General Chap-ter 2.9.47 (2.9.47), a small number of largely deviating units is allowed for large sample sizes. This allowance is not considered an acceptance of largely deviating units as such, but rather recognizes that the large sample has a greater probability to contain such units, even when the batch in total is considered to be of acceptable quality. A proposal for 2.9.47 was published in Pharmeuropa 23.2 in March 2011, together with a background paper explaining the elaboration of the pro-posal in detail (9). During the public consultation period, several comments were submitted by industry and regula-tors. The feedback was fairly uniform, and the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) PAT working party accordingly elaborated a revised proposal for Chapter 2.9.47. The revised text was adopted by the European Pharmacopoeia Commis-sion in April 2012, and it will be pub-lished in Supplement 7.7 of the Ph.Eur. and implemented on Apr. 1, 2013. Industry comments and applied feedback The following section summarizes the comments received during the public consultation, and explains how the industry feedback has been taken into account in the revised text. The pri-mary concerns raised during the public consultation were related to four key issues, as outlined below. \"What is the relation between the Ph.Eur. new General Chapter 2.9.47 and the existing chapters (2.9.5, 2.9.6, and 2.9.40)?\" Before the adoption of 2.9.47, there were al-ready three general chapters in Ph.Eur. addressing dose variability. The new chapter does not represent a fourth set of acceptance criteria for the determi-nation of dose variability. Rather, as an alternative to demonstrating com-pliance with 2.9.40 with a traditional sample size n = 30, compliance with the UDU test could be demonstrated by compliance with the criteria of 2.9.47 Figure 1: Operations characteristic (OC) curves of the initial proposal for 2.9.47: Selected sample sizes (including the obsolete sample size n = 75) are compared with the UDU test (n = 30). The red oval represents the higher probability to pass the 2.9.47 test than the UDU test for certain batch distributions. The simulated batches follow normal distribution with a certain standard deviation (indicated along the X-axis). Figure 2: OC curves of selected sample sizes for the adopted 2.9.47 (Alternative 1 and 2, respectively), compared with the uniformity of dosage unit (UDU) test (n = 30).

Chap-ter 2.9.47 should always be applied in conjunction with chapter 2.9.40, where the relevant parameters (e.g., acceptance value, reference value) are defined and explained. In fact, 2.9.47 is meaningless without a reference to 2.9.40. There is no formal link between 2.9.47 and the older dose variability tests described in 2.9.5 and 2.9.6. General Chapter 2.9.47 presents two alternative sets of acceptance criteria: one parametric and one nonparametric test. It is the user's choice which of the two sets of criteria to apply. For a given sample, the two sets may not give the same result, due to their fundamental difference (parametric versus nonpara-metric). However, both alternatives are considered equivalent in the demon-stration of compliance with 2.9.40. The nonparametric test criteria for largely deviating units (L2/c2-criteria) are identical in the two alternatives. There is no regulatory expectation that 2.9.47 should be used by a mar-keting authorization (MA) applicant or a MA holder, in the determination of compliance with 2.9.40. There is also no regulatory expectation that any of the two alternative sets of test criteria should be favoured over the other. The new chapter does not represent a new requirement. It is the user's decision to demonstrate compliance with 2.9.40 by any of the criteria described in the new 2.9.47. However, it is not acceptable that a batch failing the criteria of 2.9.47 is retested by the traditional criteria of 2.9.40, with the intention to achieve a more fortunate result. It is also not ac-ceptable to retest a batch using the other alternative set of criteria in 2.9.47 if a batch has produced an unsatisfactory result with any of the two alternatives. \"The general acceptance criteria of the new chapter are too wide.\" The feedback from both industry and regulators was harmonized in that both parties argued that the new proposed accep-tance criteria of 2.9.47 were too wide. From Monte-Carlo simulations, it was evident that for certain batch distribu-tions, with unusually high standard deviation, a large sample fulfilling the acceptance criteria of 2.9.47 could eas-ily fail the criteria of 2.9.40 when evalu-ated on a subset of the sample (n = 30). This concern is illustrated in Figure 1, where the red oval represents batch characteristics where there is a larger probability to pass the test criteria for large samples, than the UDU criteria for a small sample. For the batches with a standard deviation between 6 and 8.8 %, the probability to pass the pre-viously proposed version of the 2.9.47 test is greater than the probability to pass the harmonized UDU test. Consequently, the revised criteria of the adopted 2.9.47 are such that a very small range of batch characteristics gives a greater possibility to pass the new criteria, than the 2.9.40 criteria for n = 30. These batches already have a high probability (> 90 %) to pass the UDU test (indicated by the red oval in Figure 2 ): \"The specific acceptance criteria for largely deviating units in the large samples are too strict.\" In the original proposal for large sample test criteria, the first largely deviating unit (LDU) was al-lowed at sample size n = 500 (see Table I). A batch that complies with these ac- ceptance criteria for LDU when evalu-ated on a large sample would have a 90% probability to pass the zero-toler-ance criterion for LDU when evaluated on a small sample n = 30 (9). In practice, current technology typically returns sample sizes of a few hundred, so that if the first largely deviating unit is allowed at n = 500, it was argued by several stakeholders that such acceptance criteria would not fully resolve the main concern\u2014 Table I: Draft proposal ( Pharmeuropa 23.2): Number of largely deviating units allowed for a selection of sample sizes. n (exact) < 479 479 763 1903 4754 9888 n (rounded) < 500 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 c 2 01261 6 3 4 Table II: Adopted test ( Ph.Eur. supplement 7 .7): Number of largely deviating units allowed for a selection of sample sizes. n < 176 176 280 490 908 1956 4995 9919 c 2 012481 8 4 7 9 4 Figure 3: OC curves for normal distributed batches with an off-target mean. 01 0 203 04 0 506 0 70 80 90 100Probability to pass [%] 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 2 Batch Standard Deviation [%]Batch mean = 96% Nsamp 100 Nsamp 200 Nsamp 500 Nsamp 1000 ICH U DU option 1 (blue) option 2 (red)Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 121Inside Ph.Eur. the 2.9.40 zero-tolerance criteria for a largely deviating unit. On the other hand, a batch that complies with the adopted acceptance criteria for LDU when evaluated on a large sample would have a 75% prob-ability to pass the zero-tolerance cri-terion for LDU when evaluated on a small sample n = 30 (9). An extract of the revised acceptance criteria that are now integrated in the adopted chapter 2.9.47 is presented in Table II : \"Editorial issues.\" In the adopted Ph. Eur. text, the introduction to the gen- eral chapter has been rewritten to fur-ther clarify the relationship between the two alternative tests of 2.9.47 and the existing 2.9.40 (as discussed above). The tables of acceptance criteria (k, c1, c2 versus sample size n) have been ex-panded, and there has been no round-ing of the sample sizes performed where a certain set of acceptance criteria apply. The criteria for a \"medium-sized\" batch sizes (30 < n < 100) have been removed, as these were found to be less relevant for the problem statement (demonstration of UDU using large sample sizes). Demonstration of the performance of the adopted 2.9.47 test. In the following, a se- ries of operations characteristic (OC) curves are presented to demonstrate the performance of the new test, com-pared with the performance of the har-monised UDU test (Note: in the fig-ures, Alternative 1 and 2 are denoted as \"Option 1 and 2\"; reference is also made to Figure 2 ). Figure 3 represents the same situa- tion as shown in Figure 2, except that the simulated batches has an off-target mean at 96 %. The batches are normal distributed around the off-target mean. In Figure 4 , the probability to pass the criteria of Alternative 1 for long-tailed and bimodal batches, re-spectively, is compared with the OC curve for normal distributed batches (n = 1000). The long-tailed distribu-tion could typically appear in a batch where there is an inadequate blending process, or where demixing occurs. The bimodal distribution could typi-cally appear where several independent pieces of equipment are involved in a crucial stage of the process, and one of the pieces is faulty. Examples include a rotary tablet press and single-dose preparations (e.g., powders) that are filled by several independent filling stations. Obviously, the long-tailed and the bimodal batches always have a smaller probability to pass the test than the normal distributed batches, provided that overall standard de-viation is the same. The UDU test is also sensitive to the distribution of the batch, but there is a wide range of stan- dard deviations where the UDU test is indecisive or in some cases even less discriminating for non-uniformly dis-tributed batches. The new alternative tests are more precise as they evaluate a larger sample. In Figure 5 , the same simulated batches have been evaluated by the non-parametric test criteria of Alternative 2. Comparing Figures 4 and 5, it is evident that the two alternatives are very similar in their evaluation of the tested batches, Figure 4: 2.9.47 Alternative 1: OC curves (sample size n = 1,000) for long-tailed and bimodal distributions, as compared to normal distributions with the same standard deviation. The results are compared with the UDU test (dotted curves).

When looking at Fig- ure 6 , it is evident that any differences in evaluation based on the general L1 criteria would be compensated for by the L2 criterion, which is identical in the two alternatives. Figure 6 illustrates whether the dif- ferent simulated batches are rejected based on the general L1 criteria (AV/ c1), or based on the additional L2 criteria for largely deviating units (c2). The green + red area represents the probability that the batch passes the L1 criteria, and the red area alone represents the probability that a batch that passes the L1 criteria but fails the L2 criteria. Consequently, the green area alone is equivalent to the area under the curve in Figure 4 , which represents the probability to pass the 2.9.47 test. It is apparent that the L2 criterion is important to disclose bi- modal- and long-tailed distributions, as well as other deviations from normality. For the normal distributed batches, the L2 criterion hardly contributes to the evaluation at all. However, when evalu-ating the dose uniformity of a batch, and in particular by a third party, it is not practical, nor necessary to make any assumption as to the distribution of the batch or the sample. Conclusion The recently adopted Ph.Eur. Gen- eral Chapter 2.9.47 should resolve the problems that have been addressed re-garding the applicability of the harmo-nized UDU test (Chapter 2.9.40) when applied to large sample sizes. With the new test criteria, more information from the large sample is taken into ac-count in the evaluation of dose unifor- mity than is available in a subset of the sample (n = 30). Thus, manufacturing processes where a large sample size is available are more precisely evaluated. The new test does not represent new regulatory expectations. Chapter 2.9.40 represents the requirements for accept-able dose uniformity, and 2.9.47 is just an alternative means to demonstrate compliance with the 2.9.40 criteria. The proposed test criteria are at least equally stringent as the requirements of Ph.Eur. 2.9.40, and more discriminating due to the larger sample size. Although the new test originally has been moti-vated by PAT applications, it is applicable also to traditional sampling and analysis.

FUSE/GETTY IMAGESThird-Party Audits Ingredient adulteration has been a growing concern for regulators. In June 2009, FDA sponsored a conference on economically motivated adulteration. In October 2009, the results of a study conducted on imported povidone analogs showed there was substandard excipient offered for sale (1). After confirmation, FDA issued an import alert for povidone analogs from an overseas manufacturer (2). Since then, FDA inspections of pharmaceutical manufacturers have added em-phasis on supplier qualification. FDA announced at the FDA/Xavier University Global Outsourcing Conference in 2010 that site inspection of component suppliers will become a future re-quirement (3). Similar expectations are developing in Europe. The Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) 2011/62/EU requires the holder of the manufacturing authorization to ensure that appropriate GMP is applied to the manufacture of ingredients (4). Although the FDA and EMA requirements for site audits have not yet been mandated for excipients, the excipient indus-try must be prepared to receive increasing numbers of audits. Excipient manufacturers often host 10 or more audits per- formed by their direct customers per year, which is a small frac-tion of their many direct and indirect pharmaceutical custom-ers. These audits do not include potential audits by excipient users that purchase material through distributers. The excipient manufacturer usually has no knowledge of the identity of those customers. Thus, it becomes impractical both physically and economically to host an audit from all direct and indirect phar-maceutical customers. Regulators worldwide recognize this co-nundrum and now allow the pharmaceutical company to rely on third-party audits and certification. As stated by FDA, an impor-tant consideration for acceptance is proper qualification of the third-party audit or certification provider. This article provides an overview and comparison of a third-party audit, Rx-360, and excipient GMP certification programs EXCiPACT and Rx-360 The Rx-360 International Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Consor- tium is a nonprofit international industry organization established in 2009. The mission of this organization is to develop and imple-ment enhanced global quality systems and processes that will help ensure product quality and authenticity throughout supply chains. Members of Rx-360 include pharmaceutical companies and sup-Supplier Qualification A Comparison of Comprehensive Third-Party Excipient GMP Audit Programs Darcy Ewalt, Tracy L. Holtz, and Irwin SilversteinPharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 125pliers, working in partnership to achieve the mission of Rx-360. Pharmaceutical associations and industry groups, auditing firms, and regulatory agencies are updated on the status of the audit pro-grams and other initiatives of the consortium. In support of the mission, the consortium developed a Joint Audit Program and a Shared Audit Program, both of which aim to provide knowledge on the quality and authenticity of supplies and their suppliers. Joint audit program. Pharmaceutical companies that are Rx-360 members (sponsors) can confidentially submit a request to the Rx-360 secretariat to have an audit performed by an Rx-360-qualified third-party audit firm, at a supplier site. Currently, Rx-360 supports audits of API, excipient, raw material, basic chemicals, and packaging suppliers, with potentially more cat-egories to be added into the program (e.g., laboratories). As part of the audit request, the number of additional sponsors required for the audit to progress is stipulated. This can result in a single sponsor or multiple sponsors per audit, depending on the spon-sor's needs. The sponsor's confidentiality is sustained through-out the entire audit process. A supplier that is targeted for an audit through Rx-360 must also agree to the third-party audit. The program benefits both pharmaceutical companies and suppliers. For pharmaceutical companies, the cost of the audit is shared by the number of sponsors, which has the potential to significantly reduce the cost per audit. Additionally, Rx-360 pro-vides a supplemental means to complete routine audits required by regulators worldwide. Suppliers benefit by having a potential reduction in time and resources spent hosting and responding to numerous audits, especially in cases where multiple sponsors are interested in auditing the same supplier. Auditors from select qualified third-party auditing firms per- form each audit. Each auditor must have the education, experience, and accreditation to be eligible to perform an audit. The experience required is specific to the type of audit being performed, whether API, excipient, raw material, or packaging material. Auditors use audit guides during the audit, which have been developed by Rx-360 and agreed to by the pharmaceutical company members. These guides ensure consistency of the audits performed and are based on industry standards such as ICH Q7, Good Manufacturing Practice for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients for APIs and EXCi- PACT GMP or GDP standards (see below) for excipients. Each sponsor reviews the draft audit reports to ensure clarity of the report, completeness of the audit, and validity of observa-tions. Following sponsor review, the audit report is returned to the auditor to address any questions and any needed revisions for clarity, before the report is issued to the supplier. Responses to any observations are provided to the auditor for review and concur-rence. If a sponsor determines that a specific audit observation requires additional follow-up due to its company procedures, or if the response is not adequate per sponsor standards, the spon-sor has the responsibility to negotiate further with the supplier. If a pharmaceutical company is not an initial sponsor for an audit, the company may purchase the given audit report follow-ing approval of the report and permission from the supplier. Rx-360 non-member companies can also purchase audit reports, again pursuant to supplier agreement.Shared audit program. Rx-360 member pharmaceutical compa- nies, with agreement from the supplier, can elect to submit an audit report performed by the pharmaceutical company (rather than through an Rx-360 third-party audit), into the shared audit program. Information is redacted to protect any confidential in-formation from both the pharmaceutical company and supplier perspective. These audit reports can be purchased by another Rx-360 member company, pursuant to supplier agreement, as a means of obtaining additional information about a supplier. This can be quite useful for companies evaluating a new supplier. Sup-pliers benefit by gaining visibility to a large number of potential customers, and a potential reduction in pre-audit paperwork as well as audit frequency or time spent on a single audit. For both Rx-360 audit programs discussed, confidentiality is strictly maintained to ensure that only the appropriate informa-tion is visible to a sponsor or supplier. EXCiPACT EXCiPACT is a voluntary international scheme to provide in-dependent third-party certification of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors of pharmaceutical excipients worldwide. It aims to ensure patient safety, through supplier quality, while mini-mizing the overall costs for assessing the excipient supply chain. In early 2009, the European Fine Chemicals Group (EFCG), the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) Europe, IPEC Americas, the European Association of Chemical Distributors (FECC), and the Pharmaceutical Quality Group (PQG) (UK) formed a project consortium to jointly develop a set of cGMP and current good documentation practice (cGDP) standards for pharmaceutical excipients. Launched as a project of the IPEC Federation, the EXCiPACT Association will become a stand alone not-for-profit organization based in Brussels once commercial activities fully commence. The EXCiPACT standard is based on the Quality Manage- ment System ISO 9001:2008 and provides two annexes to ISO 9001:2008, which cover GMP and GDP requirements for ex-cipients. Excipient manufacturers would be assessed to ISO 9001:2008 and the EXCiPACT GMP annex together, whereas distributors would utilize ISO 9001:2008 and the EXCiPACT GDP Annex. The remaining sections of EXCiPACT cover the requirements for third-party audit organizations, firstly for au-ditor competency and secondly for quality system requirements for these organizations. The former is based on ISO 19011:2002, Guidelines for Quality and/or Environmental Management Sys-tem Auditing, whereas the latter is based on ISO/IEC17021:2006, Conformity Assessment\u2014Requirements for Bodies Providing Audit and Certification of Management Systems. Because the EXCiPACT Association has no auditors, the qualification of EXCiPACT auditors authorized to perform the certification audits is one of the program's most important ele-ments. The EXCiPACT Scheme has two grades of certification: EXCiPACT Auditor and the EXCiPACT Audit Team Leader. These are equivalent to International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA) Quality Management Systems (QMS) 2008 certification grades. To be eligible for EXCiPACT Scheme cer-126 Pharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 PharmTech.comtification, applicants must meet the requirements stated in the EXCiPACT Auditor Competency annex to ISO 19011. Being certified as an IRCA QMS 2008 Auditor or Audit Team Leader meets the basic auditing requirements; however, additional knowledge of excipient manufacturing, GMP, and GDP EXCi-PACT Scheme auditing competencies are also required. Both grades require successful demonstration of the application of the fundamental competencies to excipient supplier audits against the EXCiPACT GMP and GDP standards. Demonstration of the additional requirement for at least five years of the IRCA general work experience to be in the pharmaceutical or excipient sup-plier industry for GMP auditors or three years for GDP auditors for all auditors is also required. If auditors wish to perform GMP and GDP audits then the additional requirement is five years. For both grades, the successful completion of an EXCiPACT Association approved pharmaceutical excipient supplier audit-ing course is a prerequisite. This training should be completed within the three-year period immediately prior to application to undertake EXCiPACT certification. Training completed prior to this period may be accepted if evidence is provided of recent, relevant work experience, and currency of their auditing skills, as laid down in IRCA 602. The list of the qualified third-party auditors is published online at www.excipact.org. The excipient supplier is the sponsor of the EXCiPACT cer- tification audit. The supplier selects from qualified third-party auditing companies listed on the website. The excipient sup-plier pays for the audit (approximately US$12,500 [10,000 EUR] for the certification audit and approximately US$6500 [5000 EUR] for the annual surveillance audit) and the certification fee (US$7000 [5500 EUR]). EXCiPACT Certification is expected to take an additional one to three days depending on the size and complexity of the site when done simultaneously with an ISO 9001:2008 audit. The excipient supplier can choose between a GMP, GDP, or combined audit depending on the activities performed with the scope of the EXCiPACT Certification similar to the ISO 9001:2008 audit. The excipient supplier selects the third-party auditing company, the scope, and the date of the EXCiPACT certification. Surveillance audits are performed every year and a recertification audit every three years. The audit report is reviewed and approved by the Certification Body so that a decision on certification is made. The EXCiPACT Association acts as arbitrator in the case of disputes between the third-party audit organization and excipient suppliers. The audi-tee and the Certification Body agree to disclose the audit report and associated corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan to parties approved by the auditee. The auditee can share the audit report with any of its customers. The excipient user can verify audit report and certificate with the Certification Body. IPEA International Pharmaceutical Excipients Auditing (IPEA) was or-ganized in 2001 as a subsidiary of the IPEC-Americas, as a conse-quence of the poisoning in Haiti that resulted from contaminated Glycerin USP. The objective of IPEA is to reduce the cost of sup-plier audits through a shared audit program, which can facilitate broader site audit of excipient suppliers for supplier qualification. Shared audit program. The basic audit is a one-day audit at the excipient manufacturer for a single monographed excipient plus additional time for each additional monographed excipient. The sponsor pays for the audit with the price beginning at US$5500. However for each audit report sold, the sponsor receives a credit of US$500 to be used for the purchase of other services from IPEA. The excipient manufacturer reviews the report for factual accuracy and may append a corrective action plan. Pharma-ceutical purchasers of the report remain confidential. To date, The IPEA shared audit program has gained limited acceptance. ANSI Accredited Certification Program. In 2008, FDA asked IPEA to become accredited by the American National Standards Insti-tute (ANSI) as a conformity body for the operation of an excipi-ent GMP certification program. This accreditation was achieved in April 2010. IPEA certifies conformance to the IPEC-PQG Excipient GMPs, but will soon use the new ANSI Standard NSF/IPEC 363, which is designed for audit assessments. Certification requires a minimum of four man-days at the site with additional time allotted for multiple excipients or processes and off-site op-erations, including subcontracting. Annual surveillance audits are conducted for one-half the time of the certification audit. Draft audit reports are reviewed by IPEA for completeness, clarity, the appropriate rating of findings, and to ensure the ter-minology will be understood by the pharmaceutical reader. The draft is then sent to the excipient manufacturer to review for factual accuracy and so a corrective action plan can be prepared. The draft report and corrective action plan are then submitted to the Certification Board. The Board is comprised of four members with extensive ex- perience in the excipient or pharmaceutical industry including responsibility for supplier qualification. During a teleconfer-ence, the Certification Board reviews the report and corrective action plan and interviews the audit team. If the consensus of the Board is that the site is in substantial conformance to excipi-ent GMPs, the site is recommended for certification. Certification is founded on the audit and audit report. Audi- tors must demonstrate extensive prior experience in the perfor-mance of GMP audits of component suppliers with an emphasis on excipients. Candidate auditors receive one to three days of training in the certification program, excipient auditing, and conformance expectations. Successful candidates are assigned an excipient audit witnessed by an IPEA executive. The auditor is deemed qualified upon demonstration of appropriate audit skills, rating of observations, and audit report preparation. Qualified auditors are subcontractors who execute an agree-ment with IPEA that requires their compliance with IPEA stan-dard operating procedures (SOPs) including conflict of interest and maintenance of client confidentiality. Qualified IPEA auditors conduct certification audits as a member of an audit team. Periodic performance reviews are conducted by an IPEA executive based upon review of their audit reports, participation in Certification Board meetings, and/or witnessing an audit plus their continuing improvement activities.Third-Party AuditsPharmaceutical Technology OCTOBER 2012 127Certification is paid for by the excipient manufacturer and begins at US$20,000. Annual surveillance audit, priced at 50% of certification, is conducted at the site such that every two years the site has been audited for an equivalent number of days as during the certification audit. To facilitate acceptance of IPEA certification, the audit report is offered to pharmaceutical com-panies at a nominal cost of $500-750. The majority of the pro-ceeds from sale of audit reports are credited to the excipient manufacturer to defray their surveillance fee. Conclusion It is apparent that many generic manufacturers and smaller pharmaceutical companies use means other than physical audit to qualify their suppliers. An ANSI accredited certification pro-gram, therefore, is particularly useful because the program has been qualified by ANSI and can be so recognized by govern-ment agencies. An ANSI accredited certification program, fur-thermore, allows pharmaceutical companies to use certification in lieu of site audit for supplier qualification. Assuring the safety of the drug supply has modified the de- velopment of each of these programs. FDA has explicitly stated at meetings and presentations that shared-audit and third-party audit programs are acceptable as part of a supplier qualification program (5). Continuing reports of economically motivated adulteration reminds the industry that each site supplying excipi-ents must be physically audited to ensure conformance to GMP requirements. Supply chain security must begin with a site audit. Participation by an excipient supplier in any one program can provide adequate assurance of the conformance of the excipient to GMP because the basis of the audit is the well accepted IPEC-PQG GMP Guide for Pharmaceutical Excipients . As described herein, the Rx-360, EXCiPACT, and IPEA programs each ex-ercise great care in the selection, training, and qualification of their auditors. FDA has informally stated that these schemes meet regulatory expectations because they have addressed the issue of auditor competency as a core part of the audit process. Thus the schemes can provide the excipient user with a high degree of assurance that excipient from suppliers that have participated in a program meet cGMP expectations and will continue to do so. The cost barrier for this assurance can be greatly reduced by these programs. These schemes, therefore, can help to ensure patient safety when the drugs that patients consume have been formulated with excipient components supplied by manufacturers whose facilities have been audited.

PT contin. from page 47 Researchers at the Methodist Neurological Institute and Rice University recently reported on their work in developing a hydrophilic carbon clusters (HCCs) antibody drug-enhancement system (HADES), a methodology for cell- specific drug delivery (1). The researchers manufactured antigen-targeted, drug-delivering nanovectors by combin ing specific antibodies with drug- loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-HCCs (PEG-HCCs) (1). In the HADES, the drug and antibody component can be varied for selective killing of a range of cultured human primary glioblastoma multiforme (GMB). The researchers used three different chemotherapeut ics and three different antibodies without the need for covalent bonding to the nanovector (1). HCCs are nanovectors with protective antioxidant properties, capable of transporting and delivering drugs and bioactive molecules, explained an Apr. 16, 2012, Methodist Hospital System press release. To bring the drug carriers close enough to the cancer cells and successfully deliver the chemotherapy combination, three di fferent antibodies were combined with the HCC to allow the nanoparticle to stick to the cell membrane. The drugs stayed inside the HCC until it attached to the cell membrane. Once binding occurred, the drugs were releas ed into the lipid environment in the membrane. The chemical properties of the chemotherapy drugs inside the HCC are such that they prefer to accumulate in areas with high concentrations of lipids and avoid areas with high water content, such as the extracellular space, according to the release. The researchers used a 20-nm syringe to deliver the drug. \"Without our nano-delivery system, we know that current drug delivery would be highly toxic to patients if we tried to deliver all three of these drugs at once,\" said David Baskin, MD, neurosurgeon at the Methodist Neurological Institute, in the press release. \"But delivered in combination using these nano-syringes, our research demonstrated extreme lethality, with at least a threefold increase in the number of dead cancer cells following treatment. The nano-syringes selectively deliver these drugs only to cancer cells and appear not to be toxic to normal neurons and other noncancerous brain cells.\" The researchers noted that the carrier system is an advance over previous nanotube-based systems, which were shown to be toxic. \"Some of the chemotherapy agents used in this re search traditionally perform poorly with GBMs,\" said Martyn Sharpe, scientist with the Methodist Neurological Institute 's Department of Neurosurgery, in the release. \"Now that we've shown a successful kill rate of these cells in vivo , we're looking at treating human tumors that will be grown in immune-compromised mice models.\" Sources 1.

Pharm-Source gets that question more than any other. Published estimates of market size vary widely and often seem to be exaggerated or inflated. Measuring the market Determining the size of the contract-manufacturing market is a methodological challenge. The biggest obstacle is the fact that most CMOs are either privately owned and do not report their financial results or are part of larger corporations that usually do not break out their CMO revenues in their financial reports. Although good re-search can overcome some of these prob-lems, determining market size ends up requiring some amount of \"guesstimation.\" Another methodological problem is defining what is included as \"contract manufacturing.\" Many published re-ports are unclear about what they are measuring, which can lead to widely divergent market-size estimates. Un-derstanding a given market size esti-mate requires that the reader and user fully appreciate what is being measured. Some of the dimensions that must be considered are discussed below: t\u00018IJDI\u0001QSPEVDUT\u0001BSF\u0001JODMVEFE\u0001JO\u0001UIF\u0001 NBSLFU \u0001 The definition can include pre- scription products, over-the-counter (OTC), and nutritional products. Al- though prescription and OTC products are both governed by drug GMPs, nu-tritional products often are not, so the market dynamics and participants tend to be different, albeit with some overlap. t\u0001*T\u0001UIF\u0001QSPEVDU\u0001CFJOH\u0001NBOVGBD - UVSFE\u0001QSPQSJFUBSZ\u0001UP\u0001UIF\u0001DMJFOU\u0001PS\u0001JT\u0001JU\u0001HFOFSJD Some estimates of the contract-manufacturing market appear to include generic APIs, which are re-ally commodities that can be bought by any company looking to manufacture a generic or OTC drug. There also are generic or OTC drug products that the manufacturer licenses to a customer to be packaged under the customer's name, the so-called \"private label\" business. By contrast, pure contract manufacturing involves a CMO manu-facturing an API or drug product using the client's proprietary process or pro-prietary formulation. t\u00018IBU\u0001SFHVMBUPSZ\u0001TUBOEBSET\u0001NVTU\u0001CF\u0001 NFU Many manufacturers in emerging markets offer contract manufacturing, but they do not operate under North American, Western European, or Japanese regulatory standards. These companies are competing in a differ-ent market and under a different set of terms than manufacturers that meet higher regulatory requirements.Given the potentially broad dimen- sions of the CMO industry, users of market-size data must be clear about the applicability of the data they are using. PharmSource recently published its own estimate of the size of the dose CMO market, %PTF\u0001$.0T\u0001CZ\u0001UIF\u0001/VN - CFST/u137\u0013\u0011\u0012\u0013\u0001&EJUJPO . We measured the market for contract manufacturing of a client's formulation under FDA, Western European, or Japanese GMP standards and built our estimate based on extensive research of company rev-enues and revenue modeling. We (PharmSource) arrived at a con- tract-dose manufacturing market size of $13.7 billion in 2011. That was up 7% from 2010, but that growth rate includes revenue from facilities that became contract-manufacturing sites during the year after they were acquired by CMOs from biopharmaceutical/pharmaceu-tical companies. The organic growth rate (i.e., the growth of revenues at fa-cilities that were in CMO networks in 2010) was 6%. We estimate that overall, dose CMOs accounted for 22% of the biopharmaceutical/pharmaceutical indus-try's dose-related cost-of-goods in 2011. Of course, size and growth are not the only dimensions that matter for the health of the industry. Contract-dose manufacturing suffers from overcapac-ity, especially for solid-dose forms, and the intense competition to sell capacity means that only a minority of dose CMOs make reasonable profits. Further, global biopharmaceutical/pharmaceutical com-panies continue to show a strong prefer-ence for building captive manufacturing, shutting CMOs out from some of the most attractive segments of the market. Sizing the Market for Contract Manufacturing Measuring the size of the marke t for contract- man ufacturing services requires a caref ul hand. The contract-dose manufacturing market in 2011 was $13.7 billion.

When that happens, the industry may not be so big or growing at the same rate, but it will be getting healthier. Getting paid A recent analysis of working capital management practices ofbiophar-maceutical/pharmaceutical compa-nies has some mixed implications for the contract-services industry. The report from financial services giant Citi claims that the global biopharmaceutical/pharmaceutical companies could release $33 billion in cash by managing their working capi-tal better. Working capital is the dif-ference between current assets (which include accounts receivable and inven-tories) and current liabilities (which in-clude accounts payable and short-term debt). Companies use cash when they build up inventories and receivables and pay their bills; they increase their cash when they run down their inven-tories, slow payments to suppliers, or collect receivables more aggressively. Companies could free up that cash by reducing inventories and taking longer to pay their bills, according to the Citi re-port. The additional cash resources could be used for licensing and acquisition deals or could be returned to shareholders as dividends and stock buybacks. Having to wait longer for their money is not something that CMOs and CROs want to hear. Service pro-viders are already getting squeezed on prices and profit margins, and a slow-down in payments will eat further into their profits by forcing them to borrow more against their lines of credit or to forego discounts they might get from paying their own suppliers. In the worst cases, CROs and CMOs could be forced to delay hiring or purchasing materials and equipment, which would hurt the quality and reliability of the services they provide. On the other hand, helping their biopharmaceutical/pharmaceuti-cal clients to reduce their inventories could be a big opportunity for CMOs. Managing inventories is about man-aging production schedules, cycle times, and supply chains. These are skill sets at which CMOs are supposed to excel because they are at the core of modern manufacturing practice . CMOs that are able to reduce sched-ule lock-in times from the traditional three months for dose forms and six to twelve months for APIs could increase their share of business from key cus-tomers and probably earn somewhat higher margins. The working-capital challenge raised by the Citi report is further proof that success for CMOs will go beyond traditional measures of qual-ity and cost of goods.

Assessing potency ensures that the test system receives the appropriate amount of ac-tive ingredient based on predetermined specifications. Potency determinations are made using a validated analytical method. Preclinical dose formulation potency Assessing the potency of preclinical dose formulation is completed by sam-pling the prepared formulation and assaying using a validated analytical method. Each dosing concentration is sampled and assayed; typically, assays are completed in duplicate. The ob-served concentration is compared to the theoretical amount and a percent of the theoretical concentration is de-termined. Typical acceptance criteria are listed in Table I . In the event that a dose formulation does not meet the predetermined ac-ceptance criteria, the result must be investigated for laboratory error. If an analytical error cannot be discovered, the effect on the study must be deter-mined. Each dosage concentration, includ- ing control samples, should be assessed for the first and last test batches of in vivo studies, at a minimum. Theoreti- cal concentrations considering dis-placement factor and density will aid in achieving the targeted concentra-tion, but measuring the actual result of a formulation will detect the true potency level of the drug in vehicle. Conversely, achieving the correct po-tency level is not always a simple addi-tion of active ingredient to vehicle. The use of laboratory equipment, filtration, compound characteristics, storage, and chemical instability, including weigh-ing and mixing procedures, are factors that can affect potency. Mixing Proper and appropriate mixing of a compound is essential to ensure ade-quate potency and homogeneity of the ingredient in the formulation. How-ever, assumptions regarding solubil-ity frequently exist when preparing a simple formulation. For example, a formulation prepared as a solution may appear soluble; however, results can dictate otherwise. Such an occurrence was observed in a high-range quality control sample preparation shown in Table II . A laboratory investigation was con- ducted to identify an assignable cause for the low recoveries. A secondary di-lution was prepared from the primary dilution as the method instructed. This time, however, recoveries were within specification of 100% \u00b110. Although the solution appeared to be a true solu-tion, it was clear that the formulation presented problematic mixing and/or dissolution. Furthermore, in a consecu-tive run, precipitate was later observed in the primary dilution, indicating the potential problem was dissolution of the analyte in the primary dilution. The analytical method was updated to in-clude in the processing procedure that adequate mixing must be performed after the primary dilution to assure complete dissolution, because particles of the analyte may be present. Thereaf-ter, all samples passed the solution cri-Multiple factors arising during Whitsel, and Amy SmithDetermining Potency of Preclinical Dose Formulations Ashley Sanchez is an ssociate scientist, Melissa Whitsel is analytical manager, and Amy Smith is director of Analytical Laboratory Operations, all at MPI Research, Mattawan, MI.Table I: Typical acceptance criter ia for different formulation types.

In this instance, the formulation itself achieved the targeted potency; the problem arose during sample process-ing for analysis. Though the test system did receive the correct dosage potency, it is necessary to have the analytical data to support this conclusion. Equally important when carrying out many mixing procedures, espe-cially sonication, is allowing the for-mulation to cool before performing any additional aliquots. Neglecting this in itself can cause low recoveries when diluting. Special mixing considerations are also necessary when working with analytes that are not small molecules. Cautious inversion can effectively mix large molecules and proteins, without potential destructive effects observed from vigorous mixing procedures. Laboratory equipment Another factor to consider in achieving accurate potency is the effect of labo-ratory glassware and/or equipment. Interactions may occur between the analyte and surface of the volumetric flask used. Such an observation was discovered in preparation of samples in plastic versus glass (see Table III ). Solutions were left in plastic for 30 minutes. As demonstrated, the ana-lyte possessed a high affinity for plas-tic. Furthermore, an assessment made using a glass serological pipette yielded higher recoveries, as compared with using a positive displacement pipette containing a plastic tip. Filtration Filtration is an effective method for removing impurities from a solution; however, if the correct pore size and/or media are not used, the analyte may be removed along with the impurities. An experiment was conducted on a clear, colorless solution. The solution was fil-tered through a 0.22 m fluoride (PVDF) syringe filter, and ana-lyzed prefiltration low and high levels, the prefiltered solu-tion had an average percent recovery of 97.1% and 97.7%, respectively. Postfil-tered samples had 0% recovery at both low and high concentrations because the analyte was removed by the filter. Compound characteristics If potency issues exist after assessing most potential mixing complications, it is important to refer back to the com-pound characteristics. If a compound is micronized, problematic weighing may exist because of the static, cohe-siveness, and/or lightness of the ma- terial. Alternatively, the material may be highly hygroscopic and require the use of a desiccant in storage. When weighing a hygroscopic material, it is essential to consider the amount of water being absorbed, as this can cause uncertainty during the weighing pro-cess. It is also significant to account for a correction factor in consideration of salt factors and purity. This is impor-tant when considering manufactured lots used for in vivo studies that do not undergo purification processes that are performed for clinical trials. Storage A final factor in achieving correct po-tency is a consideration of storage and stability of the formulated compound. It is necessary to have data to support conditions and duration of storage. Degradation of a compound can be seen at different temperature condi-tions (e.g., ambient, refrigerated, fro-zen or ultra-frozen). Yellow light versus ambient light may also affect potency if the formulated test article requires protection from light. Analysis of po-tency of a formulated drug in specified storage conditions, extending longer than the dose formulation, should be performed before dosing. Covering the time window from preparation to dos-ing ensures that the proper potency of drug is delivered to the test system. Conclusion Potency of a dose formulation is an essential and crucial component in ensuring that the test system receives the appropriate amount of active ingre-dient based on predetermined specifi-cations. If the correct potency is not achieved, the toxicological effects of the drug may not be observed. Failure to achieve accurate potency levels may be affected by many factors including weighing and mixing procedures, use of laboratory equipment, filtration, and even compound characteristics and storage. When these problems occur, it is important to isolate and investigate each variable to identify the root cause.

On an industry level, what are some key develop- men ts and targe ts for deliver- It has to be acknow ledged that the challenge of delivering biologic -based drugs has been an impor tant driver of inno vation in the drug delivery techno logy industry. Unfortunately, man y of these techno logies have failed to deliver on their initial promise. We have all seen the bold claims for the oral delivery of proteins and peptides. Inha led insulin and the like burst on to the scene , and then faded into obsc urity. This was not for lack of effor t so, clearly, the technica l and marke t challenges are great. The fact that the industry, including 3M Drug Delivery Systems , continues to inno vate in this arena speaks to the great need to offer a real alterna tive to injections and pro- vide options for impro pharmacokine tic profi les and dose -sparing possibi lities. At 3M Drug Delivery Systems , we believe our Micros tructured Transderma l System (MTS) is a practical solution for addressing man y of these issues. Our initial clinica l success is turning concep t into reality and genera ting considerab le interest for a range of therape utic areas , ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to vaccines. PharmTech: How do you think persona lized medicine will influence drug-delivery techno logy and methods of delivery? Ingebrand: I think we will continue to see persona lized medicine expand in scope. We see this manifes ted in a number of ways, including the launch of companion diagnos tic tests as part of new drug introductions. Peering deeper into the crystal ball, I think the most interesting future developmen ts for the drug delivery industry will be around \"smar t dosing \" and therape utic feedback loops. I can imagine a time when one 's Smartphone , loaded with the latest apps , will moni tor key physiologica l parame ters and then either recommend or actually control the delivery of a therape utic agen t. 3M Drug Delivery Systems ' hollow microneed le arra ys (hMTS), for examp le, can provide a platform that could well enab le that sort of next-genera tion techno logy.

This scalability feature of CFRs is appealing for circumventing nonscaling problematic chemistries in a timely fashion. It is not uncommon for there to be one or more steps in an initial discovery synthesis that is not amenable to batch processing. When this occurs, significant time, effort, and money have to be invested in process research and/or development to reso lve the chemistry or retool the synthesis. CFR technology, on the other hand, offers the potential to scale the existing problematic chemistry to overcome the bottleneck. For example, Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ) dem-onstrated the utility of CFR technology for rapidly scaling gram to kilogram quantities of early-stage clinical trial API where batch processing was a concern (4). Several classes of reactions that presented safety or hazardous concerns for batch manufacturing were shown to scale efficiently, safely, and with shorter process research times. The reaction classes reported by the Johnson and Johnson group included exothermic reactions, reactions at elevated temperatures, reactions with unstable intermediates, and reac -tions involving hazardous reagents (4). Implementing CFR technology in an otherwise batch process to reso lve early scalable issues provides an attrac-tive strategy for expediting early-stage process development. Under this mixed \"batch-CFR\" paradigm, the problematic step(s) can be optimized to a CFR early on in the process allowing the chemistry to be readily scaled from grams to kilograms. Manufacturers of continuous CFRs such as Corning (Corning, NY) make smaller scale reactors that can be used for optimiz-ing the continuous-flow chemistry on a small scale and employing the smaller reactor to make the desired product on a scale of grams to about a kilogram. When larger-scale production is required, the chemistry is readily transferred to an identical larger reactor simplifying the technology transfer process from laboratory scale to plant scale. Consequently, the \"Batch-CFR\" approach has the potential to be more expedient and cost effective as it takes advantage of CFR technology's ability to scale existing chemistry that is not suitable or safe for larger-scale batch processing. CFR technology may also allow the CMO to scale reactions beyond the capacity of their fixed reactors as an alternative to doing a technology transfer to another facility with larger fixed reactors. The contract manufacturer will still likely use fixed equipment to process the continuous-flow reaction maelstrom. Although significant gains have been made in in-process monitoring and continuous crystallization, at the present time, it is more expedient for early-stage continuous flow reactions to be worked-up using traditiona l methodology such as filtration, extraction, solvent removal, and crystallization in fixed equipment. If the project moves to commercialization, particularly in the hands of a large pharmaceutical company, the process is more likely to become a fully optimized continu-ous process from start to finish. With a \"Batch-CFR\" process, this transition should be facilitated since the more challenging chemistry has already been adapted to CFR technology. The decision by a CMO to implement CFR technology to reso lve a process scale-up issue is a critical risk decision requiring buy-in from the sponsor client. The technology holds significant promise for efficient and cost-effective development of early-stage cGMP processes. The \"Batch-CFR\" approach provides a much greater probability for scaling the initial discov-ery synthesis directly, thereby requiring significantly less process research and development work. CFR technology, however, requires different strate-gic thinking and technical expertise compared with classical batch manu-facturing. Because most drug-development professionals are classically trained, there is likely to be some natural resistance to implementing CFR technology in early-drug development. This mindset has been referred to as \"batch mentality (5). Howe ver, with FDA and the pharmaceutical industry encouraging the shift to CFR technology, contract manufacturers are likely to follow suit. Sources 1. A. Pellek and P. Van Arnum, Pharm.

James Hamby, PhD, is vice-president of business development at Ash Stevens, 18655 Krause Street, Riverview, 9 pharmtech.com The Industry's Authoritative Source The current trend in the pharmaceutical industry for the manufacture of small-molecule therapeutic agents is moving toward continuous flow pro- cesses. In 2007, the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing was established with $65 million in funding from the drug company. The center is proposing a \"Blue Sky\" concept where there is a continuous process from the start of a chemical synthesis through final pharmaceutical dosage form (1, 2). The Blue Sky program is an ambitious goal but is gaining ground rap- idly among thought leaders in the pharmaceutical industry and US Food and Drug Administration. Consequently, the momentum for this concept is likely to have a trickle-down effect for contract manufacturers (CMOs) that design and develop early-stage manufacturing processes for clients devel- oping innovator small-molecule drugs. Continuous-flow technology Continuous-flow technology involves the continuous introduction of a stream of chemical reactants into a flow or microreactor to yield a desired reaction product on a continuous basis. The versatility and usefulness of continuous-flow reactor (CFR) technology is expanding rapidly with an ever broadening scope of applicable chemistries and the development of new flow technologies (3). Champions of continuous-flow technology cite a wide range of potential advantages compared with traditiona l batch manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. In general, the greater optimization and control achievable with CFR technology can trans late to significant sav- ings in time and costs and can have a favorable safety and environmental impact. Furthermore, the small-reaction volume, broad operating pressure and temperature ranges, and mixing efficiencies of flow reactors extends the repertoire of chemistries beyond that of the safety and technical limita- tions of batch reactors. The capital investment for CFR technology is also substantially less, as is the footprint required in the plant than a similar capacity batch-reactor system. Howe ver, even though the potential advan- tages of CFR technology can be significant, the technology is currently not applicable or practical in all situations. Early-stage development Adapting CFR technology to early-stage development projects has sig- nificant merit, but also significant challenges. CMOs work with numerous sponsor clients, diverse chemistries, and projects in all stages of develop- ment. Many of the projects CMOs encounter are very early stage with the development candidate being licensed out of an academic laboratory or coming directly from the sponsor company's discovery laboratories. These early-stage projects more often than not require various degrees of process research and/or process development to make the discovery synthesis amenable to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) scale- up. Also, to receive additiona l funding or secure a development partner, the sponsor company has a strong sense of urgency to enter the clinic and achieve proof-of-concept as soon as possible. This puts pressure on the CMO to rapidly develop a scalable process to meet the near-term active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) goals of the sponsor company and at the same time enable the process to further scale-up to meet later stage API demands. Small-molecule drug development processes are typically in the range of six to eight synthetic steps. Given the time constraints and level of technical challenge, the design of an initial six to eight step totally continuous-flow process for an early-stage drug development project is generally not practical and is typically reserved for established commercial processes. CFR technology, however, does offer the distinct advantage of Contract Manufacturing and Continuous Flow Reactor Technology for Early-Stage Drug Development James Hamby Have you been featured in Pharmaceutical Technology ?

It is disturbing that an FDA contractor also apparently in-advertently made accessible over its web-site a significant amount of sensitive FDA documents (1, 2). Companies spend huge amounts of money generating data to support the ap-proval of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical devices. Companies expect that FDA will keep this information confiden-tial and will not disclose it to competitors or to the public while the review process is ongoing. Disclosure of confidential infor-mation prior to a company receiving mar-keting approval or clearance can cause sig-nificant economic harm. Competitors can get advance notice of the products under review and adjust their marketing plans for competing products. Competitors may also use this information to further develop their own products. FDA staff, outside contractors, special government employees, advisory com-mittee members, and others who have access to company confidential, commer-cial, and trade-secret information must take their obligation to keep such infor-mation confidential seriously. FDA staff and others should not make the decision to disclose confidential information to the media just because they may disagree with or are challenging the scientific judgment of their superiors. FDA staff must follow the procedures established to present dif-fering views of scientific data and the con-clusions drawn with respect to safety and efficacy. If certain members of the FDA review staff disagree with the decision to approve or clear a product, they can docu-ment such objections in writing. If the re-view staff question the approval decision because they believe it was not supported by the clinical data, the public safety is at risk, the review process was compromised, or that there was corruption or incompe-tence uncovered during the review process, there are procedures that can be utilized to report such allegations. Staff can always raise concerns with internal management structure at FDA, Health and Human Services, the Office of Special Counsel, the President's staff, or through Congress. When raising the concerns up the chain of command, staff are well advised to pres-ent their allegations and documentation to support their assertions in an organized, responsible manner. Maintaining confidentiality As part of routine procedure, companies identify the parts of their submission (e.g., 510(k), PMA, NDA, and ANDA) that are considered confidential, commercial, trade secret information. Prior to approval or clearance, FDA is obligated to maintain that confidentiality. How should the agency ensure this confidentiality? It has been suggested by the attorney representing the whistle blowers that FDA have different computers and systems for maintaining confidential information that do not have, for example, Internet access. This is an ex-pensive option; therefore, FDA staff should be trained and reminded on a periodic basis of their responsibility and obligation to maintain the confidentiality of submis-sions. If FDA staff members feel compelled to discuss concerns with the media, they can have these discussions without disclos-ing confidential information. In closing, members of the FDA staff must understand and appreciate their ob-ligation to maintain the confidentiality of submissions and not disclose confidential, commercial, trade secret information to the media. There must also be checks and balances on the review process. FDA staff should be aware of and follow procedures for raising scientific concerns that can im-pact the public health and safety. Ultimately, the public must continue to have confidence that FDA is making sound decisions on the approval and clearance of products. References 1. S. Usdin, BioCentury, 20 (30), July 23, 2012. 2. E.

Rosen Recent news stories have reported that FDA scientists have been suspected of leaking confidential, commercial, and trade secret information to the media (1, 2). These scientists claim that faulty review procedures led to the clearance of medical devices that exposed patients to dangerous levels of radiation (1, 2). The scientists raised questions regarding the judgment and integrity of senior manage-ment officials in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). In investigat-ing the suspected leaks, FDA monitored the emails of these scientists through the use of sophisticated software that captured the keystrokes, keywords, and phrases of numerous individuals (1, 2). During the course of this monitoring, it appears that FDA may have gone beyond the scope of the initial suspected leak of confidential information by looking at protected in-formation such as individuals' password-protected private emails, communications to Congressional staff and the US Office of Special Counsel, attorney and client com-munications, workplace grievances, and items protected by whistleblower statutes. A need for checks and balances The Office of Special Counsel has found that the scientists' claims regarding the medical device review process were suf-ficiently valid to warrant a further inves-tigation (1, 2). In taking a step back from the news stories, it can be agreed upon by those involved in the FDA review and approval processes that it is sound scien-tific and public policy to have checks and balances on the FDA review and approval process. FDA has internal procedures that permit and encourage the presenta-tion and discussion of the interpretation of scientific data. Expressing the differing views of the product review team leads to a thorough evaluation and discussion of the data and, ultimately, to better deci-sion-making on the review and approval process for FDA-regulated products. Various positions regarding the inter- pretation of the data are discussed in a forum at FDA where the exchange of dif-fering views on safety and efficacy data are presented to an experienced team of senior FDA staff. There is an opportunity for all team members involved to pres-ent their analysis and views on the risks verses benefits of products. Invariably, disagreements as whether the benefit of the product is acceptable in light of the risks may occur. In the end, FDA must make a decision as to the acceptability of the data and whether the application can be cleared or approved for marketing. Ultimately, FDA senior management must weigh the scientific evidence and exercise their judgment and experience in making decisions on whether the data support the clearance or approval appli-cation. The American public puts its faith in processes and relies on the belief that FDA scientists and senior management review products and make decisions on the acceptability of the data. In my 30-plus years of experience in dealing with FDA-regulated products (including more than 14 years at FDA), I can personally attest to the fact that FDA staff take their responsibility for the review and approval of products seriously and work diligently to make decisions that are in the best in- terest of public health and safety. The importance of confidentiality In the recent situation reported in the media, the scientists questioned the ap-proval of a premarket approval application supplement and clearance of certain 510(k) applications (1, 2). The scientists claimed that FDA senior managers in CDRH and the FDA Commissioner were corrupt and incompetent (1, 2). The scientists report-edly publicly disclosed company confi-dential, commercial, trade secret informa-tion to the media in airing their concerns regarding the decisions made to approve or clear certain medical devices for mar-keting (1, 2). It is surprising and disturbing that the FDA scientific reviewers leaked confidential commercial information to the press. FDA regulations are clear: if the existence of a premarket submission has not been publicly disclosed and the sub-mitter requests that the intent to market a device remain confidential, provides a cer-tification to the Commissioner requesting confidentiality, and complies with various provisions regarding the maintenance of such confidentiality, then FDA will not disclose the existence of a premarket no-tification. This relates to existence and the intent to market a medical device, which is evident by the submission of a 510(k) application. There are similar confidenti-ality provisions relating to investigational products, full and abbreviated new drug applications, biologic license applications, and premarket approval applications. The news media has reported not only the ex-istence of the companies intent to market certain medical devices but appears to have received internal agency files, documents, and confidential commercial information Do you have to worr y about FDA releasing confiden tial data?
