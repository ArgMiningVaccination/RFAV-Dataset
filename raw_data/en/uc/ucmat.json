Everyone in the office was so accommodating and extremely nice to me especially the receptionist she was so understanding. I felt really great. I went in with a what I thought was a hamstring strain because I was told so by another doctor. I did few massages and therapy elsewhere and for 4 weeks my issue was not resolved. Coming here, the doctor IMMEDIATELY found out that my hamstrings are fine and it is my inner thigh muscles that are messed up. So when he started with massage I was feeling it in the exact places he told me my problem was. From that information only, I was so relieved. After massages he did cupping then acupuncture. For the day and the next, the pain was still there but not was much. TODAY, I can't believe I am saying this but now the leg with issue seems more healthy than the other leg which I think is just sore (but I am going in again for that and my neck). I can barely feel anything. My stretches are less painful when I am practicing. I feel so relieved. I have one more session (which will make 2 sessions) and I think it will be the last. He said in 1-2 weeks I should be fully healed if I warm up thouroughly before stretches (notice he did not tell me to rest for 1 week). I am really grateful for this facility. Thank you so much! - 8/10/2018 Dr. Kim is the best acupuncture doctor I have ever met. She knows what she's doing -- whenever I have any questions, she explains wholeheartedly with great details. One of the biggest reasons why I went to her was extreme menstrual cramps. With her needle skills and medicine, I no longer suffer monthly from menstrual pains. I know she prevented strokes from multiple people. Many people religiously come to her to receive her treatment. I love her! She's the best! Highly, highly recommend!!! - 1/6/2018 I came by to get help for my back but Dr Kim gave me a therapy which caused the pain.. Shes amazing!!! - 7/27/2017First to Review Acupuncturist Dr. Kyung Kim is ver kind and explains treatment very well. Best Korean oriental medicine clinic ever!!!
