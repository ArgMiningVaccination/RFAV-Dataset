In findings involving 2,564 individuals in the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS), scientists said that people who drank diet soda every day had a significantly higher risk of vascular events than those who reported no soda drinking. NOMAS is a collaboration of investigators at Columbia University and Miami's Miller School of Medicine, launched in 1993 to examine stroke incidence and risk factors in a multi-ethnic urban population. \"If our results are confirmed with future studies, then it would suggest that diet soda may not be the optimal substitute for sugar-sweetened beverages for protection against vascular outcomes,\" says lead author Hannah Gardener, Sc.D., epidemiologist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. In the soda study, researchers asked subjects at the outset to report how much and what kind of soda they drank. Based on the data, they grouped participants into seven consumption categories: No soda, moderate regular soda intake, daily regular soda, moderate diet soda, daily diet soda, moderate diet and regular soda, and daily diet and regular soda. During an average follow-up of 9.3 years, 559 vascular events occurred, including stroke. Even after accounting for patients' lifestyle habits, metabolic syndrome, and vascular disease and heart disease history, the increased risk of vascular events among those who consumed diet soda persisted at a rate 48 percent higher. Diet soda can adversely affect health: Caffeine, artificial sweeteners and sodium in diet soda can have negative health effects. Diet soda may not aid in weight loss or management. Body mass gain may be a consequence of artificial sweetener consumption. Acids in diet soda can affect dental health.

Acupuncture can become part of a therapeutic long-term health care regimen for hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. \"Despite the successes in reducing and treating heart disease over the last half century, even if we just maintain our current rates, we will have an enormous financial burden on top of the disease itself,\" says Paul Heidenreich, M.D., chair of the American Heart Association expert panel issuing the statement. The panel estimated future medical costs based on the current rates of disease and used Census data to adjust for anticipated population shifts in age and race. \"These estimates don't assume that we will continue to make new discoveries to reduce heart disease,\" says Heidenreich. \"If our ability to prevent and treat heart disease stays where we are right now, costs will triple in 20 years just through demographic changes in the population.\" The panel says effective prevention strategies are needed to limit the growing burden of cardiovascular disease\u2014the leading cause of death in the United States that accounts for 17 percent of overall national health expenditures. \"Unhealthy behaviors and unhealthy environments have contributed to a tidal wave of risk factors among many Americans,\" says Nancy Brown, American Heart Association CEO. \"Early intervention and evidence-based public policies are absolute musts to significantly reduce alarming rates of obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, and cholesterol levels.\" Acupuncture can be an excellent complement to other medical treatments, especially those for treating the cardiac system. Acupuncture applied to specific wrist, inner forearm and leg acupoints triggers release of brain opioid chemicals that reduce excitatory cardiovascular system responses. Acupuncture applied to these specific sites results in heart activity/oxygen intake decrease and lowered blood pressure. Acupuncture can be beneficial for various cardiac ailments. Key steps to prevent heart disease: Eat a healthy diet. Exercise regularly. Quit smoking. Maintain a healthy body weight.

Jerold Olefsky, M.D., and colleagues from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine recently identified key receptors on white blood cells, or macrophages, which are found in obese body fat. Obesity and diabetes are closely associated. The scientists say omega-3 fatty acids activate this cell macrophage receptor, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects and improved insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is the condition in which the hormone insulin becomes less effective at regulating blood sugar levels in the body, leading to type 2 diabetes and other health problems. These cell macrophages digest cellular debris and pathogens as an immune system response. Part of this response involves the macrophages producing proteins that cause inflammation, a method for destroying harmful cells and objects. Obese fat tissue contains lots of these macrophages producing lots of protein, which can result in chronic inflammation and rising insulin resistance. Fish oils, or omega-3 fatty acids, interact with receptors located on macrophages, generating a strong anti-inflammatory effect. \"It's just an incredibly potent effect,\" says Olefsky. \"The omega-3 fatty acids kill the inflammatory response. This is nature at work. The receptor responds to a natural product\u2014omega-3 fatty acids\u2014so that the inflammatory process can be controlled.\" Fish oils safely do this and suggest a possible way to treat the problems of inflammation in obesity and in conditions like diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease through simple dietary supplementation. In addition to fish oil supplementation, healthy dietary choices for diabetes management include: Fiber-rich foods\u2014legumes, whole wheat flour, wheat bran. Healthy carbohydrates\u2014low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables. Reduced amounts of food products containing saturated and trans fats. Limited intake of meats, eggs and other high cholesterol foods.

In addition to a balanced diet, Chinese food therapy can effectively prevent illness utilizing natural foods. Fiber has been hypothesized to lower risks of heart disease, some cancers, diabetes, and obesity. It is known to reduce blood cholesterol levels, improve blood glucose levels, lower blood pressure, promote weight loss, and reduce inflammation. Yikyung Par, Sc.D., of the National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Md., and colleagues analyzed data from 219,123 men and 168,999 women. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire at the beginning of the study. Participants' fiber intake ranged from 13 to 29 grams per day in men and from 11 to 26 grams per day in women. The risk of cardiovascular, infectious and respiratory diseases was reduced by 24 to 56 percent in men and 34 to 59 percent in women with high fiber intakes. The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend choosing fiber-rich fruits, vegetables and whole grains frequently and consuming 14 grams per 1,000 calories of dietary fiber. A diet rich in dietary fiber from whole plant foods may provide significant health benefits. Traditional Chinese medicine recommends that diet should change according to the season. As winter is a yin season, yang foods can offer warmth and energy during this time of the year. During summer, a yang period, yin foods can cool and lighten the diet. Both types of food should be included in the diet to keep the constitution in balance. Medicinal foods can: Improve health. Combat symptoms of health conditions. Reduce adverse side effects of medications. Strengthen vitality after illness.

Oxygen-related damage to DNA, proteins and fats may play a role in the development of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer. Alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and lycopene are all carotenoids with antioxidant properties which can counteract this damage. There are several dozen carotenoids that have antioxidant activity in the foods that we eat. Beta-carotene is the most well-known, since in most countries it is the most common in fruits and vegetables. However, in the U.S., lycopene from tomatoes now is consumed in approximately the same amount as beta-carotene. Antioxidants (including carotenoids) have been studied for their ability to prevent chronic disease. Findings suggest eating more fruits and vegetables is associated with lower risk of chronic diseases. Chaoyang Li, M.D., of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, and colleagues assessed the relationship between alpha-carotene and increased mortality risk for a JAMA Archives of Internal Medicine study. Among 15,318 adults who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Follow-Up Study, researchers assessed wellness in participants over a 16-year follow-up. Participants with higher levels of alpha-carotene in the blood had a lower mortality risk compared to those with lower levels. Higher alpha-carotene concentration also appeared to be associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease or cancer. \"Alpha-carotene is chemically similar to beta-carotene but may be more effective at inhibiting the growth of cancer cells in the brain, liver and skin,\" the authors write. Consumption of yellow-orange (carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and winter squash) and dark-green (broccoli, green beans, green peas, spinach, turnips greens, collards, and leaf lettuce) vegetables, which have a high alpha-carotene content, has been previously associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer. In addition to a diet high in levels of antioxidants, traditional Chinese medicine therapies can aid in promoting longevity and wellness. Acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine and massage therapy can: Reduce stress. Restore balance. Increase vitality. Enhance the body's "}
