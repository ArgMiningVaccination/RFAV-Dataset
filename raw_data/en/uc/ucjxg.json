Ayurveda is the original form of Holistic medicine and has stood the test of time for a reason. Proper nutrition, lifestyle and self-care regimes are as necessary as they are timeless. Ayurveda Orlando is dedicated to helping you achieve optimal health naturally. A note from your practitioner: I'm all for supplementing health with added vitamins, minerals and products but the heart of our wellness has to start with the habitual patterns we reinforce on a daily basis. What will make our break our health is the sum total of the staple routines of our lives; the food we eat, the company we keep, how well we sleep, the way we move and the thoughts we perpetuate. I see and love a lot of clients who request more herbs and supplements to layer into their already crowded capsule regimens. This is not inherently bad, but when I inquire deeper to learn about their food, sleep and stress status they're often reluctant to disclose a laundry list of reasons they're currently shaming themselves. Bad habits are not to be shamed. On the most basic level, most of us already know what's good for us and what's not. Berating ourselves over the things we're not doing well (including our food and lifestyle habits) is not helpful; but either is masking it will more supplements. First, release the guilt. If making ideal food and lifestyle choices was easy we'd all be doing it already. Our modern society is not set up in a way that naturally produces and sustains optimal mind-body wellbeing. For the most part we work too much, sleep too little and eat what the mainstream tells us is good (unfortunately, Americans get 80% of their daily calories from packaged and processed foods...not actual food). Pause, breathe. Good, now applaud yourself for caring. I know you care because you've read this far. Look, taking a ton of vitamins and supplements while still entertaining a stressed, hectic or polluted lifestyle is like planting magical seeds in a field of denatured soiled. It doesn't matter how great the seeds are; seeds don't thrive in depleted soil. Ayurveda helps to balance and nourish the terrain of your life by giving you tools to harmonize your food and lifestyle. Once your food and lifestyle are in check, you'll notice that correct supplementation hoists you off your plateau and helps you achieve new heights of wellness. To build sustainable wellness we have to start from the ground up. Have a good look at what your putting in your mind and mouth. Take a peak at how you move your body and throughout the day. A solid foundation built on natural rhythms, pure food, happy thoughts and supportive relationships is key. Love yourself for who you are and where you are now. If you need help moving forward; connect. There are knowledgeable, encouraging and trained people who want to help you. We're here. Ask. With love, Kristen "}
