The lists of herbal and other medicines and supplements have been compiled in a collaboration between international doctors, scientists, and holistic medical practitioners. As Covid-19 infections, Covid-19 vaccines, and the issue of spike protein harms are new, this guide is informed by established and emerging medical research as well as the clinical experience of international medical doctors and holistic health practitioners; it will evolve as new evidence emerges. The patent-free medicines and supplements included may have differing availability around the world. Who might benefit from this information? If you have had Covid-19, have recently had a Covid-19 injection, or are experiencing symptoms that may be related to Covid-19 vaccine transmission (also called shedding), you may benefit from using one or more items from our list of medicines and supplements to reduce spike protein load. The spike protein, which is both a part of the Covid-19 virus and is produced in our bodies after inoculation, can circulate around our bodies causing damage to cells, tissues, and organs. Many people have been unable to find help for spike protein related illness (also called spikopathy) through existing healthcare services. This information is relevant if you have experienced adverse reactions after a jab, have Long Covid, or have post Covid-Injection Syndrome (pCoIS). Important Note: This guide is for education only. If you are ill after vaccination, please seek help from a medical doctor or an holistic health practitioner. For information on post Covid-injection illnesses, see the [WCH post-injection guide](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/a-practical-approach-to-keeping-healthy-after-your-covid-19-jab/). The spike protein can be found in all SARS-CoV-2 variants. It is also produced in your body when you get a Covid-19 injection. Even if you have not had any symptoms, tested positive for Covid-19, or experienced adverse side effects after a jab, there may still be lingering spike proteins inside your body. In order to clear these after the jab or an infection, doctors and holistic practitioners are suggesting a few simple actions. It is thought that cleansing the body of spike protein (referred to as a detox from here on) as soon as possible after an infection or jab may protect against damage from remaining or circulating spike proteins. In this guide, we will discuss several key features of these conditions that can be targeted during a detox: - The spike protein - ACE2 receptors - Interleukin 6 (IL-6) - Furin - Serine protease Important Safety Information Before Beginning a Detox Please do not undertake a spike protein detox without supervision from your trusted health practitioner. Please note the following: - Pine needle tea, neem, comfrey, Andrographis paniculata - Should NOT be consumed during pregnancy. - Magnesium - Overdosing is possible, and it is more difficult to detect when consuming liposomal magnesium. Therefore, consider a mixture of liposomal and conventional magnesium, or just conventional magnesium. - Zinc - When consuming a multivitamin that already includes zinc, be sure to adjust the quantity of zinc consumed in other supplements. - Nattokinase - Do not take while using blood thinners or if you are pregnant or nursing. - Always consider dosing - When taking a multivitamin, remember to adjust the amount of individual supplements accordingly. (e.g. If your multivitamin contains 15mg of zinc, you should reduce your zinc supplementation by that amount.) - St John's Wort - This medicine interacts with many pharmaceutical drugs. It should not be taken if you are on other medication without advice from your doctor. Proactive and supportive measures Virtually all conditions are more easily managed in their early stages. After all, it is certainly preferable to avert a health crisis entirely than it is to react to one. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. A healthy diet is vital to support a healthy immune system. Tips - Alter your diet so as to reduce consumption of pro-inflammatory food items. A low histamine diet is recommended. Avoid processed foods and GMOs. - The food items found in Table 1 may also be incorporated into daily diets prior to contracting Covid-19 or receiving a Covid-19 jab, if you still choose to do so. - Intermittent fasting: The practice of intermittent fasting involves implementing meal timing schedules that switch back and forth between periods of voluntary fasting and non-fasting. Commonly, those who practice intermittent fasting consume all of their daily calories within 6-8 hours each day. This method of dieting is used to induce autophagy, which is essentially a recycling process that takes place in human cells, where cells degrade and recycle components. Autophagy is used by the body to eliminate damaged cell proteins and can destroy harmful viruses and bacteria post-infection. - Daily consumption of a multivitamin is advised. It provides a basic supply of vitamin A, vitamin E, iodine, selenium, trace elements, and more in addition to [vitamin C](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/vitamin-c-for-covid/)and vitamin D3. - Heat therapy, such as taking saunas and hot baths, are considered a good way of detoxing spike protein. What is the spike protein? The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains a spike protein on its surface. If you've seen images of the coronavirus, it is the sun-like protrusions often pictured on the outside of the virus. During a natural infection, spike proteins play a key role in helping the virus enter the cells of your body. A region of the protein, known as the S2, fuses the viral envelope to your cell membrane. The S2 region also allows for the coronavirus spike protein to be easily detected by the immune system, which then makes antibodies to target and bind the virus. Spike proteins are also produced by your body after taking a Covid-19 jab, and they function similarly in that they are able to fuse to cell membranes. In addition, since they are made in your own cells, your cells are then targeted by your immune system in an effort to destroy the spike protein. Thus, your immune system's response to spike proteins can damage your body's cells. Emerging evidence is also showing that in the nucleus of our cells the spike protein [impairs our cells' ability to repair DNA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34696485/). Why should I consider detoxing from the spike protein? The spike protein from a natural infection or a Covid vaccine causes damage to our body's cells, so it is important to take action to detoxify from it as best as we are able. The spike protein is a highly toxic part of the virus, and research has linked the vaccine-induced spike protein to toxic effects. Spike protein research is ongoing. The virus spike protein has been linked to adverse effects, such as: blood clots, brain fog, organising pneumonia, and myocarditis. It is probably responsible for many of the Covid-19 vaccine side effects discussed in the [WCH post-injection guide](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/a-practical-approach-to-keeping-healthy-after-your-covid-19-jab/). [A Japanese biodistribution](https://rightsfreedoms.wordpress.com/2021/06/03/confidential-pfizer-research-document/) study for the Pfizer vaccine found that, in the 48 hours post-vaccination, vaccine particles had travelled to various tissues throughout the body and did not stay at the injection site, with high concentrations found at the liver, bone marrow, and ovaries. Emerging evidence on spikopathy suggests that effects related to inflammation and clotting may occur in any tissue in which the spike protein accumulates. In addition, [peer-reviewed studies in mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00771-8) have found that the spike protein is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Thus, in humans it could potentially lead to neurological damage if it is not cleared from the body. How to reduce your spike protein load Supporting people with Long Covid and post vaccine illness is a new and emerging field of health research and practice. The following lists contain substances that may be useful. This list has been compiled by international doctors and holistic practitioners with diverse experiences in helping people recover from Covid-19 and post injection illness. Luckily, there are a host of easily attainable, natural solutions to reduce your body's spike protein load. Some \"Protein Binding Inhibitors\" inhibit the binding of the spike protein to human cells, while others neutralize the spike protein so that it can no longer cause damage to human cells. Spike Protein Inhibitors: Prunella Neutralizers: N-acetylcysteine (NAC), glutathione, fennel tea, star anise tea, pine needle tea, St. John's wort, comfrey leaf, vitamin C [Ivermectin has been shown to bind to the spike protein](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32871846/), potentially rendering it ineffective in binding to the cell membrane. - Several plants found in nature, including pine needles, fennel, star anise, St. John's wort, and comfrey leaf, contain a substance called shikimic acid, which may help to neutralize the spike protein. Shikimic acid may help to reduce several possible damaging effects of the spike protein, and is believed to [counteract blood clot formation](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/fo/c6fo00927a). - Regular oral doses of vitamin C are useful in neutralizing any toxin. - Pine needle tea has powerful antioxidant effects and contain high concentrations of vitamin C. - Nattokinase (see Table 1), an enzyme derived from the Japanese soybean dish 'Natto', is a natural substance whose properties may help to reduce the occurrence of blood clots. What is the ACE2 receptor? The ACE2 receptor is located in the cell wall, in lung and blood vessel linings, and in platelets. Spike protein attaches to ACE2 receptors. It has been proposed that large concentrations of spike protein may bind to our ACE2 receptors and effectively 'sit there', blocking the regular functioning of these receptors in various tissues. The disruption of these receptors has been [associated with a multitude of adverse effects through altered tissue functioning](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33275540/). - If spike proteins bind to the cell wall and 'stay put', they could trigger the immune system to attack healthy cells and possibly trigger autoimmune disease. - The spike protein could attach to ACE2 receptors located on blood platelets and the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, which may lead to abnormal bleeding or clotting, both of which are [linked to Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2021/04/01/01/42/vaccine-induced-thrombotic-thrombocytopenia-vitt-and-covid-19-vaccines) How to detox naturally protect the ACE2 receptors: - Ivermectin - Hydroxychloroquine (with zinc) - Quercetin (with zinc) - Fisetin Evidence suggests the [binding of ivermectin to the ACE2 receptor](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32871846/) prevents the spike protein from binding with it instead. What is Interleukin-6? Interleukin 6, or IL-6, is a primarily pro-inflammatory cytokine protein. This means it is naturally produced by the body in response to infection or tissue damage and initiates the inflammatory response. Why target IL-6? Some natural substances help the post-jab detoxification process by targeting Interleukin 6. Scientific evidence shows that cytokines such as IL-6, are found in far higher levels among those infected with Covid when compared to uninfected individuals. IL-6 has been used as a [biomarker for Covid progression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129451/). Increased levels of IL-6 have been [found in patients with respiratory dysfunction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7233239/). Meta-analysis has revealed a [reliable relationship between IL-6 levels and covid severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530350/). IL-6 levels have been [inversely related with T-cell count in ICU patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7205903/). Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are also expressed post-vaccination, and studies suggest that they [may reach the brain](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16877115/). [Il-6 inhibitors have in fact been recommended by the WHO for severe Covid cases](https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2021-who-recommends-life-saving-interleukin-6-receptor-blockers-for-covid-19-and-urges-producers-to-join-efforts-to-rapidly-increase-access), for which they have been described as life-saving. How to detox from IL-6 The following lists of natural substances, including several basic anti-inflammatory food supplements, can be used to prevent the adverse effects of IL-6 by inhibiting its action. IL-6 Inhibitors (anti-inflammatories): Boswellia serrata (frankincense) and cumin (Nigella sativa), K), zinc, magnesium, jasmine tea, spices, bay leaves, black pepper, nutmeg, and sage - Several natural, plant-based substances are used in antiviral therapy. The plant pigment quercetin has been shown to display a broad range of anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. - Zinc has been shown to work as a [potent antioxidant](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334492528_The_Role_of_Zinc_in_Antiviral_Immunity), which protects the body from oxidative stress, a process associated with [DNA damage, excess inflammation, and other damaging effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8005963/). What is furin? Furin is an enzyme, which cleaves proteins and makes them biologically activate. Why target furin? Furin has been shown to separate the spike protein and thus allow the virus to enter human cells. A furin cleavage site is [present on the Covid spike protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114094/), which is thought to make the virus more infectious and transmissible. Furin inhibitors work by preventing [ cleavage of the spike protein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720312432). How to detox from furin Substances that naturally furin: - Rutin serine protease can prevent spike protein activation and also reduce viral entry to cells, hence [reducing infection rate as well as severity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313365/). How to detox from serine protease Substances that naturally inhibit serine protease and may help to reduce spike protein levels in the body: - Green tea - Potato tubers - Blue green algae - Soybeans - N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) - Boswellia (frankincense) What to Take? How much to take? Where does it come from? Where to get it? Table 1.

Note: This list is not comprehensive and other substances, such as serrapeptase and CBD oil, have also been suggested. The World Council for Health will continue to update this document as new information emerges. Some holistic practitioners also recommend substances to cleanse the body of metals after vaccination, such as zeolite and activated charcoal. The WCH will prepare guidance on how to detox from metals in due course.

They may be something to consider using when treating the symptoms of dangerous blood clotting from the COVID-19 vaccines. Serrapeptase is a proteolytic enzyme that helps the body dissolve dead and damaged tissue such as blood clots. Nattokinase is produced by the bacillus natto during the fermentation of soybeans. Nattokinase has fibrinolytic properties. Fibrin is an insoluble protein necessary for proper blood clotting. [COVID-19 Vaccine Detoxification Regimen from Dr. Gerald H. Smith](https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-23-200-million-americans-may-want-to-consider-covid-19-vaccine-detox.html) [S.D. Wells, writing for Natual News explains:](https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-23-200-million-americans-may-want-to-consider-covid-19-vaccine-detox.html) In order to maintain proper mitochondrial health, supply the body with appropriate nutrients, boost the immune system and keep the blood from clotting, over 200 million Americans may want to consider the advice of [Dr. Gerald H. Smith](https://icnr.com/about/), who may be able to assist with a natural detoxification regimen for all these foreign toxins the Covid jabs are spreading throughout the body. The author of the Covid-19 vaccine detoxification regimen, Dr. Gerald H. Smith, is certified by the [World Organization for Natural Medicine](https://icnr.com/alternative-medicine/how-to-detox-and-antidote-covid-19-vaccine/) to practice natural medicine globally, and he's also a certified dental practitioner. His broad base of post-graduate training in natural medicine and dentistry helps him integrate an array of vital health care specialties. Using enzymes to destroy and clean out the vaccine-induced pathogens Covid vaccines are preventing your body from \"taking out the trash.\" Your body is failing at being a constant janitorial \"staff\" and the trash is piling up. Rotting. Cancer breeds here. This is like being constipated day after day after day. The Covid vaccines pollute the entire vascular system with toxic prions that look like virus particles. They are foreign to your body. How will you get them out, and in time to recover? For starters, [certain enzymes](https://icnr.com/alternative-medicine/how-to-detox-and-antidote-covid-19-vaccine/) (orally taken) work to help break down the fibrin that can cause lung scars, which may help breathing return to normal. Doctors around the world have been prescribing systemic enzyme therapy to treat fibrosis since the 1970s. Enzymes are also efficient in treating pain and inflammation associated with vaccine injuries and/or musculoskeletal disorders. Reducing inflammation is the first order of business for the severely and chronically-inflamed vaccinated masses right now, many of whom are suffering from thousands of microscopic blood clots that are not showing up on mainstream diagnostic tests (besides elevated heart beat and high blood pressure). Systemic enzymes can also dissolve the lipid coating that surrounds the spike protein, dissolving foreign (toxic) protein in your blood and tissues, all while destroying bacteria and preventing blood clotting. Author of Cancer Deconstructed and Remove the 'Splinters' and Watch the Body Heal is President of the International Center for Nutritional Research Dr. Gerald Smith is really stepping forward to help people who have already been Covid vaccinated and are feeling the repercussions of having billions of toxic spike proteins floating around in their blood. Dr. Smith understands the power of nutrition, and how to help people cleanse their blood using natural remedies, including glutathione, curcumin, magnesium, enzymes, vitamin E, maca, zinc, medicinal mushrooms, and the list goes on. Glutathione helps the liver detoxify, a cleaning process that's supposed to happen about every 3 minutes. The glutathione is anti-inflammatory, and chelates heavy metals, pulling them out of the body, thus reducing cell damage to the liver. Curcumin works as an anti-oxidant and increases a brain-derived protein (BDNF) that plays a major role in keeping neurons (nerve cells) healthy. To assist the immune system in removing foreign proteins, Dr. Smith recommends a combination formula (proprietary formula) that includes thymus, calcium, vitamin A and C. Add in some cordyceps (sinesis) to help prevent the rapid replication of mutated (cancer) cells in DNA while increasing cellular energy levels (ATP) and oxygen utilization in cells. Top that off with the corcyceps sinesis benefits of boosting the immune system against infections, boosting white blood cell count (which the Covid vaccines are lowering systematically more with each booster), and strengthening the kidneys. There's a lot more great information about detoxifying from the Covid spike-poison jabs and some guidelines for people who may be on blood thinners or other specific medications.

And remember, avoid the Covid booster shots like the plague, because they are one. [Dr. Geral H. Smith](https://icnr.com/about/) is a dentist and natural medicine practitioner. He wrote the following [article](https://icnr.com/alternative-medicine/how-to-detox-and-antidote-covid-19-vaccine/) that may be of some help to those who want to detox their body from the COVID-19 vaccine after realizing they made a terrible mistake. A doctor's first obligation is to do no harm. Dr. Smith proposes a detoxification regimen in the following article: There is no simple approach to detox vaccines from your body. For this reason, you must understand how vaccines affect your body and your immune system and then take a comprehensive approach to the vaccine detox. Little known history: The Faulty Germ Theory Narrative In the 1860s, the French chemist and researcher, Antoine Bechamp developed a theory that pathogens or germs occur when the terrain becomes toxic. Tis concept was in direct opposition to Louis Pasture's germ theory that was responsible for the disease. Unfortunately, Pasture had more political influence and his philosophy prevailed. Ten in the 1930s, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that healthy bacteria would transmutate into disease-forming pathogens when the medium on which they were growing was altered. He experimented and replicated this fact over 300 times proving that it was the environment in which the bacteria were growing that determined if the disease would occur. In the 1970s a French researcher, Gaston Naessens, living in Quebec discovered an ultramicroscopic subcellular living and reproducing particle in the blood, somatic; these particles represented the precursor of DNA which could be the building block of all terrestrial life. Dr. Naessens observed that when the terrain was altered these somatids produced pathological forms initiating disease. All three researchers scientifically documented the fact that it is the milieu or environment of the body that determines the occurrence of disease. Germs are the result of a toxic environment, not the cause. Factors setting the stage for COVID-19 and the vaccine 5 -G Networks 5G relies primarily on the bandwidth of the millimeter wave, known to cause a painful burning sensation. It's also been linked to eye and heart problems, suppressed immune function, genetic damage, and fertility problems. Low-frequency microwave radiation opens your voltage-gated ion channels (VGCCs), thereby allowing an abnormal influx of calcium ions into the cell, which in turn activates nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide which reacts nearly instantaneously to form peroxynitrite that then causes carbonate free radicals, which are one of the most damaging reactive nitrogen species known and thought to be a root cause for many of today's chronic diseases. Chemtrail Poisoning One of the chemicals being sprayed is aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin, which causes disturbed sleep, nervousness, emotional instability, memory loss, headaches, and even impaired intellect. Soil samples from Mt. Shasta and Siskiyou County, California had levels high enough to kill a moose. Prolonged exposure to high levels of aluminum can also cause: brain degeneration, impede the body's ability to digest calcium, phosphorous, and fluoride. Cause aching muscles, speech problems, anemia, digestive issues, impaired liver and kidney function, colic in babies. Barium carbonate or fluoride can lead to gastrointestinal signs and symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and watery diarrhea. Hypokalemia: generalized muscle weakness progressing to paralysis of the limbs and respiratory muscles, and even ventricular arrhythmias. Strontium 90: lowered red blood count and anemia, excess tiredness, blood that does not clot properly, and a decreased resistance to fight disease. Antidote for aluminum: N-acetyl-L-tryptophan 50mg/kg. Its ability to block substance P-mediated neuroinflammation, reduction in oxidative stress, and anti-apoptotic properties. To conclude, N-acetyl-L-tryptophan may be considered a novel neuroprotective therapy for Alzheimer's disease. Lead poisoning is the leading cause of death in the US Lead depletes vitamin B1, which has the same symptoms as COVID-19. U.S. researchers found that exposure to low lead levels from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s was linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death over the next 20 years. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), children are most susceptible to lead exposure; their developing bodies absorb the chemical in higher amounts and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to it. The team calculated that blood lead levels higher than 1 g/dL are responsible for around 412,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. Of these, around 256,000 are from Cardio Vascular Disease. Toxin Accumulation The [Environmental Working Group](https://ewg.org/) did a study on ten newborns; they had their blood analyzed at birth; on average, there were 287 chemicals in their blood. 60% of Americans suffer from one or more chronic diseases. In most cases, those most susceptible to vaccine damage are those with a compromised immune system - the same individuals who would suffer the most damage from the natural disease if they contracted it. One must understand that vaccines and their adjuvants accumulate in the body; 75% of aluminum is retained in a newborn and up to 40% in an adult, stored in the kidneys, spleen, liver, heart, brain, lymph nodes, and muscles. Other toxins stored include cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (a hazardous substance), MSG (a neurotoxin), 2-Phenoxyethanol (a hazardous toxin), and polysorbate 80 (a toxin associated with serious adverse effects including death), and this represents only a partial list. Many of these toxins are synergistically toxic, for instance, thimerosal's toxicity is multiplied by the presence of aluminum, and some antibiotics. You can have harmful reactions with your immunizations from stored past vaccines and stored medications and environmental chemicals Dental infections (periodontal disease and tooth decay), root canal teeth, mercury fillings, toxic resin fillings, cement and bases, and abscessed teeth provide a chemical overload to the immune system. Detoxing the Body as a Pre-requisite to Detoxing Vaccines There are no magic bullets to antidote the COVID-19 inoculation! Why must you take a comprehensive approach? - To enhance the body's detoxification mechanism. - Because the less of a burden there is on the immune system the more efficiently the body can remove the vaccine ingredients. - Key steps to detoxing the body: - Must clean out the intestines and repair the cells. Must remove the sources of toxins (processed foods, aluminum cooking utensils, metal food cans, sushi and other high mercury seafood, aluminum foil, etc. - Food grade diatomaceous earth: start with one teaspoon of FGD in 10 ounces of spring water upon awakening for one week; then one tablespoon in 12 ounces of water taken for 90 days. This scrubs the walls of mucous plaque, absorbs toxins, and kills parasites. 50% of Americans have parasites. On the 76th day and 90th day take Ivermectin (1cc per 100 pounds) to clean up any residual parasites. - Pre and probiotic to re-implant the healthy micro biome: Prescript-Assist, Kaqun Drops, or Bravo Yogurt. Test dosages. - Must provide essential nutrients to enable the liver to process the toxins being dumped: glutathione, superoxide dismutase, B-complex, Liver Chi. - Must remove the heavy metals especially aluminum, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and nickel: Platinum Plus (amino acid formula), boron and magnesium malate (both pull out aluminum), zinc, silicon, bentonite and montmorillonite clays, extracts of asparagus officinalis root or yucca root. The Gift contains nano particles of trace minerals to allow the body to let go of the heavy metals and also alkalize the tissues; it also contains Humic and Fulvic acids to cleanse glyphosate, from the intestines and blood respectively. - GABA products can also be used as an adjunct to balance the level of glutamate and to increase the amount of gamma-aminobutyric acid naturally present in the brain. - Repair the cell membranes and tissues: Clinician's Preference (11:1 ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 organic, cold pressed oils- vegetable based); Pure Synergy (60 different organic and wild crafted herbs, grasses, vitamins, minerals (supplies all the raw ingredients to repair the nerves, muscles, ligaments, and cells). - If there is a problem with candida, mold, yeast, and fungi, they have to be dealt with. One of the best products on the market is from New Zealand: [CanXida](https://www.canxida.com/) - Must clean out the intestines and repair the cells. Must remove the sources of toxins (processed foods, aluminum cooking utensils, metal food cans, sushi and other high mercury seafood, aluminum foil, etc. "}
