Almost 1 in 150 children are autistic (Rapin & Tuchman, 2008). It is said to prevail in the future and the prevalence rate is expected to increase (Schriebman, 2000). Therefore, one must give it importance in order to battle it. Knowing about autism and how it is caused and its factors is significant in order to prevent or treat it. Autism is a topic personally close to my heart as I have a dear cousin who is autistic. My aunt, Armaan's mother, although a nurse, felt helpless when her son would unnecessarily throw tantrums, cry and quite often bang his head against the wall. His parents were in despair when they were told that their son may never be normal again. Having answers and not letting parents feel vulnerable and helpless has made autism a field of interest amongst many doctors, and me, who strive to find a cure. Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM) takes a holistic and individualistic approach to treat autism. Under CAM, homoeopathy is said to be the most appropriate approach for autism (Sheffield, 2008). A holistic approach is needed for autistic children as according to Dr. Tinus Smits there are three main reasons as to how or why autism could be caused: - Stress factors after birth: this includes vaccinations, antibiotics, anesthesia, etc. - Toxic factors during pregnancy: mother's emotional stress or trauma, mother on antibiotics or heavy medications during the pregnancy, etc. - Toxic factors in the parents before conception: tropical vaccinations taken by either parent, parent(s) who have smoked or have used or abused alcohol, etc. Therefore, to touch on all the above-mentioned factors and to completely cleanse the body of any autistic behaviors, it is important to take a holistic approach (Smits, 2010). Furthermore, alternative medicines are also known for their individualistic approach which is another feature needed for autism. Vaccines, in a way, \"generalize\" the population and assume that all children will have the same reaction to the toxins in the vaccine; that the children's immune system will be strong enough to fight off the toxins in the vaccine and benefit from it. This did not happen in all cases. Those children who were unfortunate enough to already have their immune systems weakened due to pregnancy or delivery complications or were ill when they were given the vaccine were unable to fight off the toxins in the vaccine and developed some form of developmental disability (Smits, 2010). Therefore, an individualistic approach is needed to treat autism since each child is different and may not respond to vaccines in the same way. Keeping the effect that vaccines had on some unfortunate children in mind, one must try and see all aspects of vaccines. It is true that at some point (in the U.S) thousands of infants' lives were lost because of diseases like rubella (aka German measles), diphtheria and the whooping cough (Pediatrics, 2010). And now these diseases can be avoided thanks to the implementation of the vaccine policy. Vaccine advocates may admit that vaccinations could have adverse and severe side effects like seizures, paralysis and perhaps even death but they also firmly believe that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks (Pediatrics, 2010). However, one must keep in mind the seriousness of the situation. While vaccines may keep 150 children healthy, it also puts one child at risk and for that one child, the child's and the family's lives have changed forever. Because conventional medicine does not offer any direct cure or medication to cure autism most parents are led to believe that there is no hope for their child. However, vaccine opponents argue that there is a link between autism and vaccination and that has been proved through 22 medical studies (Walia, 2013). They all proved that the heavy toxins that the vaccines contain may trigger an autistic disorder in many children. Moreover, children have a natural immune system that can help them battle certain diseases (Pediatrics, 2010). It is safer and much less riskier to vaccinate children after the age of two, when their natural immune system is not as weak and their bodies are able to battle the heavy toxins that are in the vaccines (Smits, 2010). The reason the vaccines may cause the immune system to become dysfunctional is because it makes it hypersensitive and thus it tries to harm even the normal, healthy cells resulting in developmental disabilities (Walia, 2013).
