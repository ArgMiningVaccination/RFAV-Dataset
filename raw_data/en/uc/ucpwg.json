Two exotic insect pests, the brown marmorated stink bug and spotted- wing Drosophila, have been detected in the state. Of Asian origin, these pests threaten a wide range of fruits and vegetables. More than 326,000 mosquitoes were collected and tested for encephalitis viruses . The West Nile virus re-emerged in at least 30 towns and cities and caused illnesses in 9 persons. A fungus is being investigated as a possible control for ticks that transmit the Lyme disease agent and other pathogens. There is additional evidence that barberry growths enhance tick populations in or near forests and that there are higher numbers of ticks infected with the Lyme disease bacterium in these settings. Our crop research is making good progress. A patent application has been submitted for a new strawberry cultivar called Rubicon. Pest resistant lines of tobacco have been developed. Moreover, i mprovements have been made in growing grapes and vegetables. Diagnostic laboratories in the Departments of Entomology and Plant Pathology and Ecology have been busy answering public inquiries. Bed bug infestations and fungal infections of plants continue to be topics of great interest to homeowners and growers, respectively. Analytical chemists documented the presence of urea formaldehyde in building insulation material. Improvements are being made or planned for our buildings. The Jenkins- Waggoner L aboratory is in the design phase with Flad Architects of Stamford, CT. The Bond Commission allocated $500,000 to build a field laboratory in Griswold, CT. This facility will serve growers and oth er state residents in eastern Connecticut. Other funds were received to correct water problems in the boiler room. The Experiment Station's outreach programs reach millions of citizens. During this reporting period, there were 2,686,464 page views on our website. Staff members gave 1,266 talks and interviews. In addition, a 30-second video was produced to help describe the Station's research being conducted in different core areas. 6 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 BOARD OF CONTROL The management of The S tation is vested in a Board of Control as specified in Section 22-79 of the General Statutes of Connecticut.

The Century Farm Award was presented to the Brown Family Farm, located in Windsor Connecticut. The presenter was Dr. John F. Anderson. The Br own family was given a citation signed by Governor M. Jodi Rell, and a bronze plaque naming the Brown Family F arm as the recipient of the 2010 Century Farm Award. The Brown Family Farm, located in the Poquonock section of Windsor, was started in 1874 by James M. Brown. He grew Broadleaf tobacco and Havana seed and made his own cigars. In 1938, Hubbell Brown began growing Shade tobacco. The Brown family added other crops over the years including potatoes, asparagus, raspberries, and pick- your-own strawberries and peas. During the early 1960's, scenes from the movie \"Parrish\" were filmed on the property. Today, pumpkins are grown along with tobacco. The Brown Family Farm is now in its fifth generation. Day- to-day operations for more than 500 acres of farmland are conducted by Stanton and Jane Brown, daughters Kathi Martin and Susan Connor, and son Kevin Brown. Numerous family members and employe es over the years have contributed to the success of the business. The Brown family is dedicated to the agricultural industry and community interests. The Browns have been members of the Connec ticut Farm Bureau and served on the Farm Bureau's National Labor Boa rd. They contribute time to the Windsor Historical Society, Connec ticut Tobacco Museum, and are involved in the National Council of Agricultural Employers. Mrs. Brown was Chairperson of the local Farm Credit Association and a member of the National Co-Bank Board. The Browns also open their farm to community groups and are active in public education on agriculture. After the Century Farm Award was presented, Dr. Magnarelli introduced Dr. Dana Royer, Assistant Scientist, Departme nt of Earth & Environmental Sciences, Wesleyan University, who gave the Samuel W.

EVENTS HELD AT THE GRISWOLD RESEARCH CEN TER Growing of Direct Descendants of the Original Charter Oak 2010 marked Connecticut's 350 th anniversary. To mark the occasion, people from several state agencies contacted Robert Durgy at the Gr iswold Research Center to inquire about Charter Oaks that might still be growing at the Griswold Center. Other species previously planted were there, but there were no Charter Oaks. To meet requests for the trees, several scientists decided to grow some from acorns that came from direct descendants of the orig inal Charter Oak. Acorns were gathered from several different trees that were first generation descendants and were planted at the Griswold Research Center on October 4 th. The plants are well on their way. There are 50 trees in the ground that should be ready for transplanting in the spring of 2011. The Station, through this project, is continuing the tradition of cultivating the historic Charter Oak.

Narratives will be brief and presented in bulleted outlines where possible. Sources of more detailed information are provided, when available. This format should provide information more conveniently and be of more use to the public. FOCUS AREAS Service, research, and outreach activities in the Department are conducted within two Focus Areas: Environmental Monitoring/Remediation Food Safety Service and research activities in each focus area are often mutually complimentary. I. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Analyses are conducted across a wide range of sample matrices submitted to the Department of Analytical Chemistry by other State agencies, municipalities, police departments, non -profit groups, businesses, and other departments at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES). This list is not intended to be all- inclusive. 1. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPA RTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Analytical Chemistry has two long -standing programs with the CT Department of Agriculture involving the analysis of feed and fertilizer products. a. Animal Feeds: Analysts: Craig Musante, John Ranciato Goal: To assure products are in compliance with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station at its founding in 1875. Products for both household pets and commercial agricultural operations are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from the CT Department of Agriculture. Analytical results are reported to CT Department of Agriculture, who in turn reports findings to the product dealer and product manufacturer. From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, we completed analysis of 189 feed samples. These samples were analyzed for parameters such as protein, fat, moisture, fiber, and micronutrients. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 90 (47.6%). Analytical findings were turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory response. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 85 b. Fertilizers : Analysts: Craig Musante, John Ranciato Goal: To assure products are in complia nce with stated label guarantees. Summary : This was one of the primary analyses of the Station in 1875. Products from residential and commercial agricultural operations are included. Samples are collected by inspectors from the CT Department of Agricultur e. Analytical results are reported to CT Department of Agriculture, who in turn reports findings to the product dealer and product manufacturer. From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, we completed analysis of 126 samples for macronutrients, such as nitrogen, available phosphoric acid, and potash, and for micronutrients, including but not limited to, boron, sulfur, cobalt, magnesium, and iron. Samples deficient in one or more analytes (determined according to the investigational allowances outlined in the Official Publication of the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials) numbered 47 (37.3%). Analytical findings are turned over to the CT Department of Agriculture for regulatory response. 2. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , FOOD AND STANDARDS DIVISION Analyses conducted by the Analytical Chemistry department for the CT Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) are important to public safety. The results of these analyses are reported in a timely fashion and can lead to the recall of products that have levels of chemical residues deemed unacceptable by regulatory agencies. a. Pesticide residues in food: Analysts: Walter Krol, Brian Eitzer Goal: To determine concentrations of agrochemicals in fresh and processed foods from local, domestic, and imported sources offered for sale in CT and to assure compliance with established tolerances. Market basket survey samples are collected by Inspector Ellen Sloan of the DCP. Results are published in an annual Stati on bulletin available by mail and at www.ct.gov/caes . From July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, 195 samples of fresh (136; 69.7%) and processed (59; 30.3%) samples were analyzed for pesticide residues. Beginning January 1, 2006, all market basket samples were analyzed using the QuEChERS method, providing lower limits of detection and increased number of detectable agrochemicals (Figure 1). Please see past Records of the Year and Station bulletins for details. Of the 195 samples analyzed, 132 (67.7%) contained a total of 507 residues. There were 74 different pesticide active ingredients found. The three most commonly detected residues were the fungicide and metabolite found was 0.242 ppm, and the average number of pesticide residues per sample containing residues was 3.78. The impact on our program of fully implementing QuEChERS is shown graphically in Figure 1. Note that the number of residues observed and the proportion of samples with residues have dramatically 86 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 increased. At the same time, the average residue concentration has decreased by a factor of 10. This is because the new technique allows for the detection of many more pesticides at much lower concentrations Figure 1 . Pesticide Residue Data 2001 -2010 In 2010, the CT Department of Public Health (DPH) received a grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to test food in the marketplace for potentially harmful pathogens linked to human illness. Part of this grant included working with the Department of Analytical Chemistry at the CAES in its capacity as a chemistry Cooperative Agreement Program (cCAP) laboratory in the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN). Utilizing the collection and regulatory arm of the CT DCP, a pilot study was undertaken in which 68 of the aforementioned samples of food collected in the marketplace underwent concurrent pesticide residue and microbial analysis testing. In analyses conducted by DPH, three of the samples were found to contain the pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes . b. Peanut allergens Analyst: Christina Robb Summary - In February of 2011, we received approximately 13 samples from CT DCP to screen for the presence of peanut allergens. The analysis is by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); funding to purchase the analytical kits was through the FDA. At this time, the study is focused mainly on shelf-stable imported foods. Of the samples analyzed, none tested positive for peanut allergens. c. Miscellaneous samples Analyst: John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, 222 samples were submitted for analytical requests such as foreign material identification, possible product adulteration or The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 87 tampering. For some samples, we rely on the expertise in other departments, including Plant Pathology & Ecology, Entomology, and Forestry & Horticulture. 3. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , LIQUOR CONTROL DIVISION a. Beverages/products for ethanol content Analyst: John Ranciato, Terri Arsenault Goal: To provide % ethanol by volume for label registration and taxation purposes. Summary: We analyzed 23 products such as beers, wines, and liquors for ethanol content. The average % ethanol content for beers, wines and liquors were 5.20, 13.5, and 31.4%, respectively. b. Beverage authenticity Analyst: Brian Eitzer Goal: To determine if products offered to customers at CT establishments are authentic as to brand. Summary : 53 alcoholic products were examined for authenticity; 7 samples were found to not match the chromatographic profile of comparison authentic samples. These results are returned to the Division of Liquor Control, who then determine appropriate regulatory action. 4. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTION , PRODUCT SAFETY DIVISION Analyst: Craig Musante, John Ranciato, Terri Arsenault Summary : From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, we analyzed 9 samples for product safety. One sample was a painted wooden toy, which was analyzed for lead and cadmium; levels were found to be below current regulatory guidelines. Eight samples of blown- in insulation were analyzed for formaldehyde content; current state statutes indicate that no formaldehyde is permitted in spray foam insulation products. Impact: All samples of blown -in insulation were found to have formaldehyde. The content of 4 of the samples ranged from 20-52 ppm (parts per million) but the two of the remaining samples had levels of 2000-2100 ppm. The Product Safety Division of DCP is currently handling the regulatory response. 5. A NALYSES ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (DEEP), WASTE MANAGEMENT BUREAU a. Analysis of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) Analysts: Brian Eitzer, William Berger Goals: To ascertain the extent of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination. Common matrices include soils, waters, oils, sediments, surface wipes. Summary : From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, a total of 40 samples were analyzed from pre-existing sites and/or spill locations in CT. The sample collection by DEEP is part of mandatory long- term monitoring of these areas. As su ch, the findings are reported to DEEP for assessment of continued regulatory compliance. 88 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 b. Analysis of pesticides Analysts: Brian Eitzer, Terri Arsenault, Christina Robb Goals: To ascertain pesticide concentration associated with misapplication or drift in support of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Additional samples are analyzed in support DEEP surface and groundwater monitoring programs. Matr ices include, but are not limited to soils, waters, oils, sediments, surface wipes. Water, vegetation and soil samples can now be analyzed for glyphosate using liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Summary : From July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011, a total of 129 samples were analyzed under this program. Impact: In past years, the processing of samples for DEEPs surface and groundwater monitoring program for pesticides was done in two parts. DEEP staff would initially perform the enzyme-linked immun osorbent assay (ELISA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The DEEP inspector would then bring the positive samples to our laboratory for confirmation by chromatography (gas [GC] and liquid [LC]) with mass spectrometry. This year, due to resource limitations at DEEP, our laboratory assumed responsibility for performing the ELISA screening test in addition to our chromatographic analysis. We have discovered that the ELISA screen produces a large number of false positive results for atrazine. This finding is significant as other water monitoring programs may rely exclusively on the ELISA test, which overestimates the presence of atrazine in the environment. For instances where the ELISA test is used as a screen, the high cost of the supplies/kits may lead one to question the value of this assay since a large number of \"positive\" samples need to be analyzed by GC/LC -MS. 6. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF MUNICIPAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES a. Analysis of samples from Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) Analysts: Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Brian Eitzer, Craig Musante, Christina Robb, Walter Krol Summary: The Analytical Chemistry department has a Cooperative Agreement with the US FDA to conduct research and analyses related to chemical contaminants in food. The Department has successfully participated in proficiency tests and surveillance exercises for various chemical contaminants on several different analytical instruments. b. Analysis of samples for muni cipalities Analysts: Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Brian Eitzer, Craig Musante, Summary : From July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, Department staff analyzed 22 samples for municipalities. Several samples were analyzed for poisons and toxins, including a set of juice samples from the Town of Greenwich Health Department and a meat sample from the Montville Police Department; both came back negative. A frog from the Town of Fairfield Health Department was identified as to genus and species with the help of herpetologists from the Peabody Museum. Soil samples from Eastern Connecticut State University, the Town of Bristol Parks Department, The City of New Haven Parks, and the Connecticut Agricultural Education Foundation (CTAEF) were analyzed for organic and inorganic contaminants. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 89 Impact: The soil samples from the CTAEF were from taken from areas that were to be used by school- age children for vegetable gardens. The program is called \"Ag in the classroom\" and students will be planting, growing, and harvesting vegetables on school grounds. The food would then be donated to the school cafeterias for general consumption. Our results were returned with instructions to consult the CT Department of Public Health and the CT DEEP for data review. The \"Ag in the cl assroom\" program is currently underway at two Connecticut schools. 7. ANALYSES ON BEHALF OF OTHER STATION DEPARTMENTS a. Analysis for Soils- Department of Forestry and Horticulture Analyst: Craig Musante, John Ranciato Summary : From July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, a total of 317 soil samples from various sites across Connecticut were extracted and analyzed as part of a Forest Health Project being coordinated by Dr. Jeffrey Ward of the Department of Forestry and Horticulture. The soil extracts were analyzed for nutrient content, including nitrogen, aluminum, calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus. b. Analyses related to pollinator decline- Department of Entomology Analyst: Brian Eitzer Summary : Upon request from Dr. Kim Stoner in the Entomology Department, we determine concentrations of agrochemicals in pollen and wax to ascertain possible relationship to bee health. LC/MS methods have been developed for low level detection of pesticides. See Research section below. c. Analyses of samples for Nootkatone- Department of Entomology Analyst: Terri Arsenault; for the Department of Entomology. Summary : See Research/Natural products section below for details. d. Analysis of Xenon- Department of Environmental Sciences Analysts: Terri Arsenault Summary : Dr. Joseph Pignatello and Dr. Charisma Lattao of the Department of Environmental Sciences have been working with Department staff on the analysis of xenon in soil systems. The project is focusing on using xenon to measure contaminant induced alterations in soil organic matter structure and plasticity. e. Analysis of Pesticides in Tobacco Leaves- Valley Laboratory Analysts: Walter Krol Summary : The Department received approximately 20 samples of tobacco leaves from Dr. James Lamondi a at the Valley Laboratory. Department staff extracted and analyzed these samples for pesticide residues. f. Analysis of Pesticides in Irrigation Water - Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology Analysts: Terri Arsenault 90 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Summary : The Department received 4 samples of irrigation water that were collected by Dr. Yonghao Li of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. Department staff extracted and analyzed these samples for pesticide residues. 8. A NALYSIS OF CHECK SAMPLES Analysts: Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, William Berger, Christina Robb, Brian, Eitzer, Craig Musante Summary : Annual performance evaluation samples required by our certifying agency, Connecticut Department of Public Health, as well as annual proficiency testing samples related to our FDA FERN work, were completed during the reporting period. Our reported results exceeded required criteria in all instances. II. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Research projects in the Department of Analytical Chemistry include applied and fundamental studies. Research is often stimulated by our service work and in turn, research results often impact service activities. 1. FOOD SAFETY Project 1: Comparison of Methods for Determination of Pesticide Residues in Food Investigators : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Brian Eitzer, Summary: The implementation and validation of more sensitive extraction methods for pesticides in food more accurately reflects the residues present in food commodities. This information increases the effectiveness of food safety surveillance and also more accurately informs the consumer as to the residues present in the food they purchase. An extensive comparison of our previous extraction method, the VegPrep, with the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS) method is ongoing. In summary, the QuEChERS method can detect greater numbers of pesticides at concentrations up to ten -times lower than previously used methods. Project 2: Improvement to FERN Methods: Using an Exactive LC- MS for Pesticid e Surveillance and Identification Investigators : Brian Eitzer Summary : Integral to our Cooperative Agreement with the FDA is assessment of procedures for detecting toxins and pesticides in foods. The development of rapid, sensitive and accurate methods for chemical detection increases the robustness of food safety and security systems in the United States. This year we received a new High Resolution Liquid Chromatograph- Mass Spectrometer (LC -MS) from FDA and have been working with the Forensic Chemistry Ce nter (FDA), as well as the CA and FL FERN laboratories on a new pesticide screening method with this instrument. This instrument calculates the exact molecular mass of detected analytes to four decimal places, permitting precise identification of chemical residues, and is currently being validated with a screening method looking for more than 250 different pesticides. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 91 Figure 2. The Exactive LC -MS calculates molecular mass to four decimal places and enables accurate determination of violative pesticide residues and toxins in food. Project 2: Improvement to FERN testing: Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Investigators : Walter Krol, Terri Arsenault, Jason C. White Summary : As described last year's Record of the Year, we developed and validated a new screening method to rapidly test for oil contamination in seafood from the Gulf of Mexico. This program was part of our food safety cooperative agreement with FDA FERN. As the release of oil from the Deepwater well began, large areas of commercial fisheries in the Gulf were closed. The Forensic Chemistry Center (FCC), the CAES Department of Analytical Chemistry and the MN Department of Agriculture used the new PAH screening method to test nearly 450 reopening samples from the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, our laboratory analyzed 104 samples with a total analytical time of 312 hours. These samples included shrimp, finfish and crab from LA waters; finfish and shrimp from FL waters; and finfish, crab and shrimp from AL waters. In coordination with the FERN National Program Office (NPO), select samples were forwarded for parallel testing to laboratories performing the traditional NOAA method. Three members of our laboratory (Dr. Jason C. White, Dr. Walter Krol, and Ms. Terri Arsenault) have each received a Group Recognition Award signed by the FDA Commissioner and the \"Second to None\" Medal from the Public Health Service (Figure 3). Impact: The new analytical procedure developed and validated by CAES and its pa rtner laboratories has been adopted by the FDA, and has been accepted for publication in the peer reviewed journal J. AOAC International . The results produced by our laboratory were used to determine that oil contamination in specific closed fisheries was below that which cause a public health concern. As such, select waters off of LA, FL, MS, and AL were reopened for commercial fishing and shellfish harvest. 92 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Figure 3.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING/REMEDIATION Project 1: Nanoparticle contamination of agricultural crops Investigators: Craig Musante, Jason C. White Summary: Nanomaterials (NM) have at least one dimension less than 100 nm and this small size results in unique properties not observed with equivalent bulk particles. Current nanomaterial use is ubiquitous; over 1300 NM- containing products are commercially availabl e in areas such as electronics, health -care, cosmetics, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. Of special concern to our laboratory is the use of nanomaterials in agriculture, including pesticides and fertilizers directly applied to food crops . From a regulatory perspective, nanomaterials are considered to have the same risk and toxicity profile as the equivalent bulk material. However, recent data out of our laboratory and others have suggested that this assumption may not be true. This potential lack of understanding on NM fate and effects in agricultural systems is disconcerting given that food crop contamination could be significant uncharacterized pathway of human exposure. A new USDA competitive grant is funding research to defining the impact of NMs on food crops, with a focus on the risk posed to humans from exposure to these contaminated plants. In preliminary hydroponic experiments, we have shown the toxicity of a given nanoparticle may be significantly greater than that of the corresponding bulk material (Figure 4). Impact: Our research demonstrates that the toxicity of nanoparticles to agricultural plant species can be significantly greater than that observed for the corresponding non-nano or bulk material. These findings have implications for the widespread use of nanomaterials in commercially available products. Project 2: Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with weathered persistent organic pollutants (POPs) Investigators : William Berger, Jason C. White Summary: This project illustrates the overlap of service and research in the Department. In 1990, samples from our market basket survey were found to contain chlordane, although the registration for this insecticide had long been terminated. Our research has shown that some agrochemicals such as DDT and chlordane have half -lives in soil of years or decades. Several separate lines of investigation were pursued to determine the potential of plants to remediate soils contaminated with these pollutants. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 93 a. Previous data showed that zucchini cultivars have remarkable abilities to phytoextract the weathered residues but that significant crop variability may exist down to the subspecies level. Specifically, zucchini cultivars have the ability to accumulate contaminants whereas other squash do not. In previous field trials, traditional breeding techniques were used to create hybrid F1, F1 backcross, and hybrid F2 cultivars. In the current year, the abilities of these various cultivars were evaluated. In field experiments at our CAES campus, different zucchini and squash cultivars were grown in soil containing weathered chlordane. Analysis from this experiment is ongoing at the writing of this report but this investigation is an extension of a Figure 4. Growth of hydroponically grown zucchini plants in the presence of nanoparticle (NP) or bulk silver (Ag) particles. Control plants were not exposed to Ag. previous trial. In that preliminary study (described in last year 's Record), the ability of plants to accumulate DDE changed upon hybridization. Non- accumulating squash that are crossed with DDE-accumulating zucchini acquire the ability to extract the pesticide but then lose some of that potential when backcrossed with the original parent. Similarly, DDE- accumulating zucchini that are crossed/pollinated with squash retain partial ability to extract the pesticide but do not fully regain the capacity upon backcrossing with the original parent. The current study is evaluating greater numbers of cultivars and hybrid generations in two contaminated soils. b. Additional hydroponic investigations have been conducted to evaluate the role of aquaporins, water channels in the membranes of plant root cells, in providing entry into the cell for POPs. These root pores are known to transport a variety of small solutes. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is known to close aquaporin channels and previous hydroponic studies have shown that this closure corresponds to decreased chlordane uptake by zucchini. In subsequent soil- based studies, the reverse effect was observed as hydrogen peroxide addition increased chlordane uptake (Figure 5). However, this observation was shown to be the result of peroxide induced dissolution of soil organic matter and the resulting large -scale release of chlordane into solution. Impact: The ability to accumulate and translocate weathered POPs is a unique ability presumably restricted to zucchini. Mechanistic and inheritance studies such as these will enable elucidation of the underlying molecular basis for this phytoextraction ability, which will then permit optimization of this ability in zucchini or transfer of the gene(s) to other plant species.

Amount of chlordane accumulated by zucchini grown in contaminated soil; chlordane measured as the content of 5 components- TN, +TC, -TC, -CC, +CC. Half of the plants were amended with hydrogen peroxide during growth. c. In collaborative experiments with Dr. Om Parkash of the University of Massachusetts, the DDE-accumulating potential of crambe ( Crambe abyssinica) was compared to that of zucchini. In the last 12 years, over 60 different plant species have been compared to zucchini and none have been found to have comparable remedial potential. However, in a preliminary hydroponic study, crambe was shown to accumulate twice the amount of DDE as zucchini (Figure 6). A field trial is currently underway to further assess the remedial potential of crambe in contaminated soils. Impact: The ability to accumulate and translocate weathered DDE was thought to be a unique ability restricted to zucchini ( C. pepo ssp pepo). The potential discovery of another plant with similar abilities will provide another system in which to focus studies on the isolation of the molecular/genetic controls for this ability. Once th ose controls are understood, the development of a plant-based system for use at contaminated sites should be feasible. Project 3: Mechanisms controlling the uptake and distribution of arsenic in plants Investigators : Craig Musante, Jason C. White Summary: In collaborative experiments with Dr. Om Parkash of the University of Massachusetts, investigators are seeking to elucidate the mechanisms controlling the uptake and translocation of arsenic. Current plant systems being investigated include crambe and r ice. Impact: A molecular understanding of this process will enable further detailed investigations on enhancing uptake for remediation purposes (crambe) or excluding/preventing uptake for food safety (rice).

Project 4: Analysis of Pesticides in Connecticut Pollen - Baseline Survey Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Kim Stoner (Dept. of Entomology) Summary : We are conducting research into how honey bees get exposed to pesticides during foraging. A honey bee can travel up to two miles away from its hive as it collects pollen to bring back to the hive for use as food. During th is time, the honey bee can be exposed to pesticides used in the residential or agricultural fields from which it collects. Although all pesticides can potentially stress the honey bees, there is a particular interest in a new class of pesticides known as the neonicotinoids, as one member of that class (imidacloprid) has shown significant honey bee toxicity and has been banned in several countries. Our study is aimed at determining the current typical background exposure of honey bees to pesticides. We are collecting pollen from honey bee hives that represent urban, suburban and rural locations. The pollen is being collected from the same location for a period of several years allowing us to look at time trends within the data. The pollen is brought to the laboratory, where it is analyzed by using a multi- pesticide screening technique that we have developed. The method is based on the QuEChERS procedures used in our fruits and vegetables residue work, but has had several small modifications to enhance the utility for pollen analysis. During the past year, we have found an average of 4 pesticides per sample, with a single sample having as many as 10 different pesticide residues. Pesticide concentrations also vary with time and location. Observed concentrations in 2010 were mostly in the low ppb range but some residues were as high as several hundred parts per billion. Impact: Honey bees are being exposed to pesticides. Long- term monitoring from the same hives and locations provides baseline data that can be used to assess trends and changes in pesticide exposure. Project 5 : Analysis of Neonicotinoid Pesticides in Flowers, Pollen and Nectar Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Kim Stoner (Dept. of Entomology), Dr. Frank Drummond, (University of Maine) Dr. Anne Averill , (University of Stem SquashExposed to DDENon-exposed Controls CrambeCrambe96 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Summary : This two year project has now been completed. We were interested in learning how much of a systemic pesticide applied as a part of a normal agricultural practice would be found in the pollen of the plant when it blooms. To conduct the study, we grew summer squash, cranberries and blueberries. Within each crop, several different pesticide treatments were used. These treatments include seed treatments and foliar sprays used as directed. When the crop was in bloom, samples of the pollen and/or flowers were taken and brought to the laboratory for pesticide residue analysis (Figure 7). These analyses were conducted using the QuEChERS extraction procedures followed by LC/MS/MS. Our analyses have shown that the residues of these systemic pesticides can be found in the flowers of blueberry and cranberry (nectar and pollen samples were not submitted) and in the flowers, nectar and pollen of summer squash. These data indicate the potential exposure to these chemicals by foraging bees. Impact: Knowledge of the pesticide residue levels in pollen and nectar from differing plant treatment protocols can allow us to choose an application procedure that will minimize the exposure to honey bees. Figure 7. Honey bees may be exposed to pesticides through contaminated pollen. Pollen collection from male squash flowers. Project 6: Coordinated Agricultural Program on Honey Bee Health Investigators : Brian Eitzer and Keith Delaplane (University of Georgia, Lead Principal Investigator) Summary : This is a large multi-institutional project (over 20 funded investigators from 15 different institutions) that is considering issues related to the health of honey bees and other native pollinators. These is sues relate to various pathogens and parasites (colony collapse disorder, Nosema , Varroa mites, etc.), as well as management practices. One of the threats to honey bees is use of pesticides in agricultural settings as well as within the beekeeping communi ty. The role of the CAES within this project is the analysis of pesticide residues. These residues will be examined as a part of several separate research projects included within the overall program. Pesticide residues will be examined in pollen taken from sentinel apiaries (apiaries maintained by University researchers) on a monthly basis so that pesticide exposure can be examined as a co -factor in studies on honey bee health. In addition, the wax from these hives will also be examined. Our results from these apiaries show that the pesticide content varies not only with sampling date and location but also within hives from the same location and time. The pesticide data are currently being correlated against various measures of hive health. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 97 Impact: Analysis of pesticide residues from apiaries that are being intensively monitored for infectious agents and colony health will allow us to determine if they are a co -factor in some of the problems being faced by honey bees. Project 7: Quantifying routes of exposure of honey bees to neo-nicotinoid seed treatments of corn Investigators: Brian Eitzer, Greg Hunt, and Christian Krupke (Dr. Hunt and Dr. Krupke are at Purdue University - Dr. Krupke is the PI) Summary: Production of corn for food, feed (and recently fuel), represents the largest single use of arable land in North America. Pest management in corn (which includes scouting/monitoring and applying pesticides as needed) has been replaced by a form of risk management, where each seed is treated for management of a broad suite of pests (primarily insects and nematodes). Neonicotinoids thoroughly dominate this market. Virtually every corn kernel planted in North America (the lone exception being organic production = 0.2% of total acreage) is coated with neonicotinoid insecticides at approximately 0.5 mg/kernal. The nature of these molecules ensure that insecticide activity extends not only to the roots, but to the above-ground plant parts as well. The major compounds used are highly toxic to bees with LD50 values in the 0.02-0.03 ng/bee range. Given that corn is typically planted at a rate of 31,000 kernels/acre, it is essential that any potential routes for pollinator exposure be evaluated. We are monitoring for these neonicotinoid pesticides in samples of honey bees, honey bee pollen, soil, talc dust from seed planters, and dandelions from fields surrounding corn fields to try to determine possible exposure routes. All of the samples are being analyzed using the QuEChERs extraction protocol and LC/MS/MS. Impact: Knowledge of routes of exposure of honey bees to pesticides is important if we hope to minimize the impact of pesticide use on the pollinators of our food crops. Project 8: Analyses of samples Nootkatone Investigators: Terri Arsenault, Kirby Stafford and Anuja Bharadwaj (Dept. of Entomology) Summary : The effectiveness of nootkatone, an essential oil of grapefruit and other plants, for control of the deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ), the primary vector for the Lyme disease agent, is being investigated on lawns of cooperative homeowners. The reader can refer to the Records of the Year for reports of earlier findings. In 2010, a new nootkatone formulation, maillard soyscreen was compared to the lign in-based formulation by application at nine homes. The uniformity of the application was measured using filter paper assemblies collected immediately following application at seven of those locations. Analysis indicated that nootkatone was not distribute d as expected, which was not the case in 2008 using the raw formulation and the same protocol. Factors that may have caused this result include nonhomogeneous tank mix, uneven spray technique, and/or inadequate sample numbers. Nevertheless, the filter pa per samples collected over the course of one week continued to show rapid degradation of nootkatone in both formulatio ns. As a better measure of long -term stability, soil and foliage samples were collected before application, immediately following application, and at varying times over a two month period. Unfortunately, samples collected at two locations showed residues of conventional insecticides, even though homeowners had voluntarily agreed not to apply insecticides to their lawns during the trial. Since tick counts are used to measure efficacy, this was a relevant finding. In contrast to the filter papers, the soil and foliage samples showed that nootkatone 98 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 persists at some level for several weeks after application, which is consistent with the finding of fewer ticks at nootkatone- treated sites. Impact: The development and use of a persistent and effective natural product for deer tick control will reduce human exposure to both insecticides and to the Lyme disease vector. PUBLIC OUTREACH Telephone/internet inquiries : We receive about 500 calls from the public each year requesting information on issues such as pesticides in food and in the environment, lead in paint, food, soils, and consumer products. In some instances, we refer the call er to a more appropriate CAES Department or State agency. Station Bulletins and Fact Sheets : Station Bulletins are typically published annually by our Department. These bulletins are available in printed form and on the CAES web site ( www.ct.gov/CAES ). They are also available at libraries throughout Connecticut. Fact sheets are articles written for the general public regarding topics of timely and widespread interest, with examples focusing on issues such as wood preservatives, persistent organic pollutants, and removal of pesticide residues from produce. These are also available on our website and in printed form. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 99 DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND GENETICS Genetic Regulation of Leaf Development Dr. Neil McHale assisted by Regan Huntley continued work on the genetic mechanisms governing growth and development in plants. Just as in animals, plants use mobile signal molecules known as hormones to regulate their pattern of growth. The most versatile of the plant hormones is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) also known as auxin, the discovery of which dates back to the time of Charles Darwin. To this day, plant physiologists and geneticists are working to uncover the molecular pathways that allow this simple compound to regulate such a myriad of plant growth patterns, including initiation of leaves, flowers, roots and fruit. The answers emerging from these efforts will find a broad spectrum of applications in agriculture and at the same time reveal the molecular fo undations of plant morphogenesis. Our work in auxin biology began with the isolation of a series of single gene mutations in the model plant Nicotiana sylvestris , which compromised or eliminated formation of the leaf blade. Among the most dramatic was a mutation where leaf blades are initiated but then fail to grow outward from the flank of the primordium. Studies with the mutated gene led to the cloning of its wild -type counterpart named LAM1. The DNA sequence of LAM1 indicated that it encoded a transcriptional regulator protein with striking similarity to WUSCHEL (WUS), a key organizer of shoot and root apical meristems. To determine whether these genes actually shared a common function, we constructed a transgene where WUS was placed under the regulatory control of the LAM1 promoter, and inserted it into the \"bladeless\" mutant lam1 plants. Full restoration of blade formation in these transgenic plants demonstrated that LAM1 and WUS are functionally equivalent genes, even though they normally operate in different locations. Extensive investigations dating back to 1996 on the function of WUS in meristems thus became a windfall of new insights on the function of LAM1 at blade initiation sites. Among the most significant was evidence showing that WUS is an organizer of cross signaling between the auxin and cytokinin pathways. To test this experimentally for LAM1, we generated double mutant lines where both LAM1 and WUS transgenes were combined with other mutations known to alter auxin, cytokinin and gibberellin (GA) signaling. Double mutant analysis has confirmed that LAM1 like WUS acts through integration of auxin and cytokinin response. The main focus going forward is to examine the role of GA signaling in blade formation, and construct additional transgenics addressing the functional significance of LAM1 expression long after the blade initiation phase. The hypothesis is that LAM1 integration of auxin and cytokinin signaling is as critical during blade expansion as it is during blade initiation. Impact Genes controlling patterns of plant development have been used extensively by plant breeders to produce crop plants tailored to specific environments. Alterations in growth habit and time to flowering are examples of developmental changes with direct applications in agriculture. Cloned genes and mutant strains from our program have influenced the direction of investigations in many other research laboratories. Dr. Jun -Yi Yang in the Plant Molecular Biology program at Rockefeller University is using one of our transgenic strains and our bladeless lam1 mutant has been a subject of work for several years in the Plant Genome program at the Noble Foundation (Ardmore, OK). 100 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Protecting Honeybee hives from American Foulbrood Disease: Dr. Douglas W. Dingman , assisted part -time by Regan Huntley, continued investigations on the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae: causative agent of the disease American of honey bees ( Apis mellifera ). A total of 282 apiaries have been visited, in collabor ation with Mr. Ira Kettle (Connecticut state bee inspector), for conducting a multi- year survey of AFB prevalence in Connecticut. The level of AFB (sub- clinical and clinical infections) in Connecticut remains near 45% of the apiaries tested. Testing of P. larvae isolates for resistance to oxytetracycline -hydrochloride (i.e., Terramycin used by beekeepers to control AFB), via culturing and PCR techniques, has identified another apiary as containing Terramycin resistant P. larvae. At present, six different a piaries in Connecticut have been identified as containing antibiotic -resistant P. larvae. Genomic RFLP analysis of P. larvae isolates is continuing and the newly obtained antibiotic -resistant isolate will be examined to ascertain whether classification remains within the same genotypic RFLP grouping as all the other antibiotic- resistant isolates. Investigation of a sanitation protocol for combating AFB has been suspended for one year pending identification of beekeepers (with infected beehives) that wish to cooperate. A baseline sub -clinical infection profile for an apiary, over the course of a bee season, has been obtained and a second year analysis of another apiary is to be performed in the future. Baseline profiles will be useful for comparative analysi s of sanitation efficiency. Database entry of all registered beekeepers in Connecticut for the years 2007 -2009 has been completed with help from a student volunteer, Reese Blackburn. Survey results obtained for all the AFB isolates are being linked to this database for future GIS mapping analysis. Apiary registrations for 2010 and 2011 are being added to the database. Bacteriophage screening of P. larvae has identified several new bacteriophage. Isolation and sequencing of the bacteriophage will be done for further characterization. Initial investigations on presence of the microsporidia Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae , have been conducted to develop an assay procedure and to determine a course of investigation. A \"rough\" PCR diagnostic test has been developed for identification of N. apis and N. ceranae in samples of adult honeybees. Work with Mr. Mark Cooper (Weston, CT public health director) and Dr. Steven Jones (Univ. New Hampshire) relating to microbial source tracking awaits pending funding approval of a cooperatively- submitted implementation grant. Impact American foulbrood and nosemosis are devastating diseases of honey bees and cause significant economic losses to beekeepers and agriculture, worldwide. This investigation continues to show a high presence of AFB within Connecticut beehives and is beginning to demonstrate a high prevalence of nosemosis in Connecticut beehives as well. Beekeepers, being informed of this prevalence, are able to make informed decisions on control and treatment of diseased hives. Knowing baseline dynamics of these diseases wi ll help provide insight into better methods of control. Understanding molecular characteristics of P. larvae will provide information on how The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 101 this bacterium interacts with honey bees and possibly result in new approaches to lower the impact of the disease. Genetic Dissection of Photosynthetic Performance in Leaves Dr. Richard Peterson in collaboration with Dr. Neil Schultes and assisted by Carol Clark engaged in studies intended to characterize factors and ultimately genes that control the rate of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic fixation of CO 2 is the primary means for accumulation of dry matter by plants and improving its performance is widely conside red to be a strategy for increasing crop yields. Considerable research in laboratories worldwide has established that the full potential of photosynthetic carbon fixation is seldom, if ever, realized in leaves even under optimal conditions. Instead, leaf internal regulatory processes that are incompletely understood depress photosynthetic efficiency especially when light availability is high. This is known to involve accumulation of H + ions and specific carotenoids leading to increased conversion of light energy to useless heat. A blending of genetic and physiological approaches to the study of photosynthetic regulation could lead to successful engineering of photosynthetic capacity in crop species. Regulation by the LHCB7 gene. The target for regulated thermal dissipation of light energy is the light-harvesting pigment proteins of O 2-evolving Photosystem II (PSII). The PSII complex is ubiquitous in higher plants and algae and constitutes the starting point in the process of conversion of CO 2 to carbohydrate. A recently discovered component of the PSII antenna complex is a protein encoded by the nuclear LHCB7 gene. We have studied photosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana plants that lack this gene. The consistently observed effect of loss of LHCB7 is a shift in irradiance thresholds for regulated H +-dependent thermal dissipation of absorbed energy to lower light levels. Many physiological traits are unaffected by loss of LHCB7 such as growth, pigment composition, levels of other light- harvesting pigmen t proteins, and maximum photosynthetic efficiency (i.e. in the absence of excess light). Hence, the LHCB7 - deficient phenotype is subtle. This is important because it indicates that no gross rearrangements of the photosynthetic apparatus have occurred as a result of loss of LHCB7 . Instead, the LHCB7 gene product appears to define a specific compartment of chloroplast membrane important in the H +-dependent regulation of efficiency of conversion of light energy to chemical intermediates ATP and NADPH that d irectly drive the CO 2 fixation process. The search for genes underlying C 4 photosynthesis. The higher photosynthetic capacities and improved water use efficiency of plants possessing the C 4 pathway of carbon fixation generally result in faster growth a nd higher economic yields. The key metabolic feature distinguishing C 4 such as maize from the majority of agricultural plants which possess the less efficient C 3 pathway is the occurrence of photorespiration in the latter. Photorespiration is an O 2-requiring process of release of CO 2 within the leaf that operates concurrently with photosynthesis in the light. Hence, photorespiration opposes net fixation of CO 2 into carbohydrate. Various anatomical and biochemical adaptations exist in C 4 plants that effe ctively abolish photorespiration in air. An ambitious goal is to engineer the complex process of gene expression culminating in C 4 photosynthesis into C 3 plants. This could involve hundreds of genes underlying an evolving network of gene expression during leaf development. Fortunately, advanced nucleic acid sequencing techniques are now available that permit investigators to 102 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 record snapshots of the global profile of gene expression in a normal leaf. We have laid the groundwork to monitor the effects of elevated levels of glycolic acid, the carbon substrate for photorespiration, on gene expression in maize leaves. This work will be conducted in collaboration with Drs. Thomas Brutnell (Cornell University) and Tim Nelson (Yale University) who have studied longitudinal patterns of gene expression in the expanding maize leaf. Impact The main impact of this work will be development of crop plants with higher photosynthetic capacity, which would be able to withstand environmental stress. When water supply is limiting, for example, the photosynthetic apparatus can be damaged irreparably by continuous exposure to sunlight. Genes under investigation here contribute to protection from photodamage. Ou r work has had a direct influence on the course of related ongoing work in the labs of Dr. Agu Laisk, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Tartu, Estonia; Dr. Harry Frank of the Department of Chemistry, University of Connecticut; Dr. Thomas Brutnell, Boyce Thompson Institute; and Dr. Tim Nelson (Yale University). Plant Nucleobase Transporters Dr. Neil Schultes assisted by Regan Huntley pursues studies on plant metabolism. Plants must synthesize all of the molecules needed for life from scratch. As a consequence, plants have an amazing and intricate capacity for primary and secondary metabolism - that is synthesis of metabolites (e.g. amino acids, proteins, DNA, starch, lipids, hormones etc.). Metabolites are in a constant state of f lux in regards to concentration and distribution within plant cells and tissues. Understanding the rules governing this flux is the aim of biochemistry. Membrane bound transporters act as metabolite -specific gatekeepers that regulate traffic of metabolites between (chloroplasts, nuclei, vacuoles, mitochondria, peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum). As such, transporters are often key control points in plant biochemistry. Therefore , understanding how plant transporters function is an important goal for eventual enhancement of crop productivity. We concentrate on the movement of a particular group of molecules called nucleobases. Nucleobases are essential for plants being the building blocks of DNA and RNA, key intermediates in the s ynthesis of plant hormone cytokinin and secondary metabolites, such as caffine and main sources of nitrogen storage in seed endosperm. In plants, there are six different classes of transporters just for nucleobases. Our research defines the function for the nucleobase transporters in the nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT), Azaguanine- like transporter (AZG) and nucleobase-cation symporter (NCS1) classes. The function of particular nucleobase transporters is determined in plants through mutational analysis and using a well defined microbe - brewers yeast - to produce individual nucleobase transporters and test transport characteristics. We use T -DNA \"knockout\" lines of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana for our mutational studies. In these lines , individual genes encoding for particular NAT, NCS1 or AZG transporters are defective. The ability of the plant to take up radio- labeled 3H-guanine, 3H-adenine or 3H-uracil or grow on toxic nucleobase analogues is monitored. To assay the function of each individual nucleobase transporter, we clone the distinct Arabidopsis nucleobase genes into yeast, produce the corresponding transporter and assay both radio-labeled uptake and toxic analogue grow. We have determined the solute transport profile for the Arabidopsis NCS1 and AZG1 & 2 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 103 transporters. Currently, we are assaying the transport profiles for the Arabidopsis NAT 1-8 transporters by a similar manner. Impact The movement of nitrogen and carbon-based compounds within plants is highly regulated by transporter proteins in the cell membrane. Understanding nitrogen and carbon use patterns by plants will have important implications for both basic plant biology as w ell as applied science. Developing plants that use fertilizer more efficiently is just one example of how results from this research may be applied. Our investigations on nucleobase- ascorbate transporter genes in plants has an impact on a number of other research laboratories investigating similar research interests. One example is our collaboration with Dr. Mourad on uracil transporter-encoding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. 104 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY Staff members in the Department of Entomology are involved in a variety of service, research, pest surveillance, and regulatory activities. The primary service activities are provided through the Kenneth A. Welch Insect Inquiry Office. Sta ff in this office answer insect -related questions and identify insects and related arthropods for the public, government agencies, growers, and business organizations. All scientists provide information to citizens of Connecticut by answering telephone inquiries, making farm visits, participating in meetings of growers and other groups, and speaking on their research. Most of the research in the Department has a major applied aspect, addressing the integrated management of ticks, pests of field crops, nurseries, and orchards, wood-boring insects, and honey b ees and other bee pollinators. Our personnel also work closely with organic farmers and landscapers in Connecticut. The Office of the State Entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, created by the Connecticut General Assembly in 1901, is part of the Department of Entomology with responsibility, in part, to ensure our nursery industry is free of plant pests and certify their products for shipment to other states and outside the United States. The Connecticut Green Industry (i.e., nursery, greenhouse , floriculture, sod, Christmas trees) is the largest agricultural business in Connecticut. The industry estimates that environmental horticulture generates $1.022 billion gross income supporting 48,000 full and part-time jobs in Connecticut. In conjunction with regulatory activ ities, Department scientists and technicians conduct a surveillance program in Connecticut for a variety of established pests and for exotic plant pests, some of regulatory concern, that represent a threat to our green industry, forests, and urban ornamental trees and shrubs. Surveillance for plant pests is performed in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program and the U.S. Forest Service. Examples are Ramorum blight (aka Sudden Oak Death), a fungus-like pathogen that can affect many plants, but that can be particularly devastating to oaks, and two beetles, the Asian longhorned beetle and Emerald ash borer, that represent a threat to our maples (an d other trees) and ashes, respectively. In addition, we participated in a regional Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Program supported by the USDA. For plant diseases of regulatory concern, we work closely with the Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. We also conduct forest health surveys and a statewide aerial survey for gypsy moth defoliation and a gypsy moth egg mass survey. The results of our plant and forest surveys for 2010 may be found later in the Depa rtment's research activities along with summaries of our regulatory activities. The staff of the Department of Entomology also takes a lead in providing extensive outreach activities for the Experiment Station by providing information to both children and adults about the Experiment Station's research at public events, health and agricultural fairs, such as the Eastern States Exposition (Big E) in Springfield, MA, Celebrating Agriculture in Woodstock, CT, the Garden Expo in Fairfield, CT, the Yale Peabody Museum's Biodiversity Day, Norwalk -Wilton Tree Festival, and the Connecticut Flower and Garden Show. Honey bees, butterflies, wood-boring beetles and/or ticks continue to be popular exhibits at these events. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 105 SERVICE ACTIVITIES Insect Inquiry Office: Dr. Gale Ridge and Rose Hiskes , with the assistance of Katherine Dugas on Forest Health and CAPS , answered questions from the public. The insect inquiry office in its present form has provided services for over 40 years. Insect identification services date back to the earliest days of the institution starting with the first Annual Report of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station published in 1877. The station announced that was offering to \"identify useful or injurious insect.....and to give useful information on the various subjects of Agricultural Science for the use and advantage of the citi zens of Connecticut\". The insect inquiry office is located on the top floor of the Jenkins Laboratory and receives thousands of visitors each year. However, in contrast to previous years when most inquiries were from visitors (around 60%), most of the inquiries this past year were from phone/cellphone calls (75% of total) to the office followed by visitors (17%), mail (5%), and e- mail (3%). The office served private citizens, pest control operators, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medical professionals, housing authorities, museums, municipalities, libraries, state government, and the news media. Between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011 t he insect inquiry office handled at least 8,380 recorded inquiries. There were 658 categories of inquiry including insects, arachnids, animals, use of pesticides, insect damage, general entomology, and horticultural issues. Of these 2,682 (32%) were related to man and medical issues, 251 undetermined/general inquiries (3%), 5,112 (61%) as natural resources, and 335 (4%) food related. Bed bug/bat bug inquiries remain the leading inquiry for the office with 1,088 (13%) of the identifications performed by the office. The bed bug webpage additionally had a high level of activity. Between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, there were 13,466 viewings of bed bug material on the Station website. In order of numbers, the second highest query were ticks, followed by carpenter ants, hemlock woolly adelgid, white grubs, carpenter bees, Indian meal moths, carpet beetles, yellow jackets, squash vine borers, and cicada killers. Termite activity rose from 60 to 103 inquiries this past year. The insect inquiry office encourages the education and training of students in science and Entomology. During the Oberlin College (Ohio) winter break of 2010-2011, Rosie Eck visited the office for three weeks and trained in biological science illustration with Dr. Ridge. She is the niece of Dr. Number of inquiries from FY 2004/2005 to FY 2010/2011. Year2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011No. of inquiries 20003000400050006000700080009000 Drs. Claire E.

Numerous student groups also visit the office during the year. The office continues to lead in public outreach with numerous State and New England wide presentations and training programs for the E merald ash borer, Asian longhorn beetle, and bed bugs. The office serves private citizens, pest control professionals, the real estate industry, nurseries, land care businesses, arborists, health departments, other medica l professionals and institutions, housing authorities, municipalities, state government and the media. CAES has also worked closely with the Yale Peabody Museum on a number of their exhibits. Tick Testing: Ticks, primarily the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis , had the highest number of specimens submitted for identification. Ticks are processed in the Tick Testing Laboratory at the Experiment Station by Elizabeth Alves and Bonnie Hamid . A total of 2,593 ticks feeding on humans were submitted for identification in 2010, of which 2,302 were the blacklegged tick or \"deer\" tick, Ixodes scapularis. Beginning in 2006, the policy was changed to only test engorged ticks. Therefore, of the ticks received in 2010, 1,246 (54.1%) were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal organism for Lyme disease, and 399 (32%) were found to carry this organism. Sponsored Meetings and Conferences: On October 31, 2010, Dr. Kimberly Stoner co - hosted the 5 th annual Community Farming Conference with Bill Duesing, Executive Director of the Connecticut Chapter of the Northeast Organic Farming Associati on. Forty-two people attended from community farms all over the state. Featured speakers included Jiff Martin of the American Farmland Trust, speaking on \"Connecting with Farmland;\" Diane Wright Hirsch of University of Connecticut Cooperative Extension, speaking on \"Local is Not Equal to Safe: Why Even Small, Local Farms Need to Pay Attention to Food Safety.\" The rest of the speakers were from community farms, speaking from their own experience: Jon and Mary Gorham, of Massaro Community Farm, speaking about how to organize and good board and leadership; Jessica Cartagena, Amy Underwood, Chaurielle Robinson, and Debra Florez, teenagers and young adults from FRESH New London, speaking about engaging youth with the food system; and a panel of farm managers on community farms, including Daniel MacFee of the Yale Sustainable Food Project; Brenda Caldwell of Boulder Knoll Community Farm in Cheshire; and Anne Patrie, educational farmer from the Community Farm of Simsbury. The meeting concluded with a tour of Massaro Community Farm in Woodbridge on their annual Family Fun Day. A Forest Health Workshop, organized annually by Dr. Victoria Smith , was held March 3, 2011 at the Station. It consists of a variety of presentations by Station Staff on various aspects of research and findings of concern to foresters in the Department of Environmental Protection, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, and the forest health community. Drs. Gale E. Ridge and Ki rby Stafford at the Peabody Museum Bloodsuckers exhibit; Dr. Ridge contributed the bed bug colony and was featured in the information The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 107 Bird and Butterfly Garden: The Bird and Butterfly Garden is a partnership of the Federated Garden Club of Connecticut, the Spring Glen Garden Club of Hamden, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Many maintenance and improvements to the garden are done by farm manager Richard Cecarelli and his staff and members of the Spring Glen Garden Club. The garden is open to the public Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m.-4:00 p.m.; it is closed on the weekends and state holidays. The garden creates several favorable habitats for our native birds, butterflies, and pollinating insects and helps us determine which plants may work best in Southern Connecticut gardens. Plants are labeled for easy identification. The Bird & Butterfly Garden at Lockwood Farm is listed in the 'Nature Conservancy Open Days Directory for New England'. Jeffrey Fengler observed 18 different butterfly species, 2 species of moth, 21 species of birds, 5 species of dragonflies, and 8 other insects or other animals around the garden on Plant Science Day August 4, 2010. Butterflies, moths, birds and dragonflies observed on Plant Science Day, August 4, 2010.

Stafford III and postdoctoral scientist Dr. Anuja Bharadwaj began studies on the evaluation of natural products for tick control with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008. Experiments continued through 2011 with the assistance of Heidi Stuber and summer assistant Megan Haas . Here, we report the results of field application of two formulations of nootkatone and a garlic- based product completed in 2010 and additional trials with garlic in 2011. Nootkatone is a component of the essential oil from the heartwood of Alaska yellow cedar, and it is also available as a synthetic and an extract from grapefruit. To improve the efficacy of nootkatone in the field, Dr. Robert Behle at the US DA-Agricultural Research Service laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, a collaborator in this project, developed extended duration formulations of nootkatone. The formulations selected for field evaluation against nootkatone, and garlic-based product, Mosquito Barrier, was conducted at 5, 4 and 3 home sites in Salisbury, Canaan, and Cornwall on 9 and 11 June 2010. The garlic-based product, Mosquito Barrier, was also tested at 6 residential sites in Westport-Weston, CT. Filter paper disks caged in chicken wire mesh placed at the treatment sites were picked up periodically for the nootkatone residual analysis done in cooperation with the De partment of Analytical Chemistry to estimate the approximate persistence of the compound the environment. The repeat trial with the lignin formulation in 2010 provided 67% tick control for first two weeks, then declined to 33% for the third week post appl ication. By contrast, in 2009, the lignin formulation provided 100% control for over 6 weeks. The Maillard -encapsulated nootkatone formulation was not found to be as effective as lignin formulation; as only 62% control was obtained for the first week after application, which dropped down to 26 and 27% for the next The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 109 second and third, respectively after the application. The residue analysis of filter papers samples for lignin and maillard formulations showed 98 and 92% loss respectively, within a week after application. A similar trend of nootkatone loss was observed in the previous year's trial. Nevertheless, nootkatone (1.5 ug/g leaf litter) was detectable in the leaf litter 70 days post application in 2009 and the residue analysis of 2010's soil and vegetati on samples are in process. The single application of garlic in 2010 was effective in suppressing tick activity by 89% after first week of treatment and remained 89, and 100% for next two weeks and 67% by the end of fourth week posttreatment. A field trial with the garlic -based product (Mosquito Barrier) was repeated in 2011 at 6 residential sites in Redding and Westport-Weston, CT. As the product label suggests reapplication every two weeks, two applications were made; first on June 15 and second on July 7. Initial tick samples after treatment found 67% reduction in tick activity with the garlic product. Chemical residual analysis and tick sampling are under progress and all the data will be compiled at the end of tick season. Impact: Nootkatone and the ga rlic-based product were shown to reduce the abundance or activity of nymphal I. scapularis , the vector of the causal agents for Lyme disease, human anaplasmosis and human babesiosis. Work needs to continue to develop or improve the new extended-duration formulations of nootkatone so that formulation and persistence issues are addressed to improve efficacy. Natural products could provide an alternative to synthetic pesticides and an additional tool in an integrated tick management program to control I. scapularis . Ticks and Tick-Associated Diseases : Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli , Dr. Steven J. Norris (University of Texas), and Dr. Erol Fikrig (Yale University), assisted by Tia rabbit of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. The blood samples were collected from rabbits captured in New York, New York and Millbrook, New York in 1985 and 1986 and had been frozen at -60 o C. The sera were analyzed in a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with whole- cell antigens or the following newly prepared recombinant antigens of B. burgdorferi : VlsE, protein (p) 35, and p37. Sixty-one contained antibodies to whole- cell (titers of 1:2,560 or greater) for 52 sera indicate robust immune responses. Results for the recombinant antigens also revealed high specif icity (i.e., little or no cross-reactivity with different bacterial pathogens). The use of an ELISA containing one or more recombinant antigens of B. burgdorferi can be used in field studies to monitor the activity of this agent. Impact: Cottontail rabbi ts are parasitized by several different tick species and are exposed to a variety of disease organisms, such as B. burgdorferi , Rickettsia rickettsii (the agent of Rocky and Francisella tularensis (the agent of tul aremia). 110 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Therefore, cottontail rabbits should be included in epidemiological studies, and an ELISA for Lyme disease is an appropriate laboratory method to use. Pesticides in Pollen and Nectar of Treated Squash: There is great concern across the U.S. and around the world about annual heavy losses of honey bee colonies, the decrease in diversity of bumble bee species, and the more general decline of many other species of pollinators. Pesticide exposure is one of many factors that may play a role in honey bee, bumble bee, and pollinator decline. Systemic insecticides in the group called neonicotinoids have been a particular focus of concern for beekeepers in Connecticut and around the world. There is laboratory evidence that one widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, makes honey bees more susceptible to a devastating new pathogen, Nosema ceranae. While there have been studies of pesticide residues in the pollen and nectar of crop plants treated as seeds, there are no studies in the literature of pesticide residues in pollen and nectar of crop plants treated by application of the insecticide to the seed furrow or by application of the insecticide through drip irrigation. Dr. Kimberly Stoner with Dr. Brian Eitzer in the Department of Analytical Chemistry studied the movement of two neonicotinoid insecticides, applied at labeled rates, as they would be used by farners, The levels found in nectar (10 \u00b1 3 ppb for imidacloprid; 11 \u00b1 6 ppb for thiamethox am) were higher than any previously documented in nectar, and the concentrations in pollen (14 \u00b1 8 ppb for imidacloprid; 12 \u00b1 9 ppb for thiamethoxam) were at the high end of the previously documented range. These levels are in the range currently being s tudied for interactions with pathogens and other sublethal effects on honey bee colonies. Because squash is completely dependent on insect pollination in order to set fruit, these results are important to vegetable growers as well as beekeepers. Impact: The role of chronic low-level exposure to pesticides is not well documented. This study will provide critical data on transport of several neonicotinoid insecticides applied at label rates in order to evaluate the exposure and role of pesticides on our pol linators. Monitoring Abundance and Species Diversity of Wild Bees: In order to assess changes in diversity and abundance of wild bees and take action to protect them, we need to set up quantifiable, repeatable methods of monitoring the abundance and diversity of a wide range of wild bee species over the long term. Dr. Ki mberly Stoner , with assistance from Tracy Zarrillo and Morgan Lowry, has adopted a method of trapping bees in bowls painted fluorescent yellow, fluorescent blue, or white, using either soapy water alone or soap mixed with propylene glycol from Sam Droege o f the U.S. Geological Survey, who has used this method with many cooperators across the U.S. This method has the advantage of being sustainable over the long term, since it requires few materials and little labor in the field, and it yields a substantial number and diversity of bees. In preliminary studies in 2009 at Dr. Kimberly Stoner sampling flowers at DeFrancesco Farm. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 111 Boulder Knoll Farm, a town-owned farm in Cheshire, we collected 888 bees in 50 species, and in 2009 and early spring of 2010 at Lockwood Farm in Hamden, we collected 720 bees in 71 species. We have decided to set up long-term monitoring using a single standardized protocol at all four sites of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station: the New Haven campus, Lockwood Farm, the Valley Laboratory in Windsor, and the Griswold Research Center, and also at the Stewart B. McKinney Wildlife Refuge Salt Meadow site in Westbrook. Sampling Alternative Floral Resources on Vegetable Farms: One of the factors that determines the abundance and diversity of wild bees in an area and the suitability for managed honey bee colonies is the availability of flowering plants to provide nectar and pollen over the season of bee activity. Dr. Kimberly Stoner, with assistance from Tracy Zarrillo, Morgan Lowry, Ellen Bulger, and Krystian Madrid, has begun a projec t assessing \"alternative\" floral resources - flowering plants in addition to crops - such as cut flowers, herbs, flowering cover crops, and weeds, on ten Connecticut vegetable farms. They are recording time of flowering, area, flower density, taking 5- minute counts of bees, and then taking 5-minute net collections of bees for identification to species. This project is funded by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which has funding to pay farmers to plant pollinator habitat, and therefore has an interest in what pollinator habitat already exists on Connecticut farms, and in what plants have the greatest abundance and diversity of native bees in our environment. Surveys for Invasive Insects : In 2010, Dr. Chris Maier, assisted by Tracy Zarrillo , Morgan Lowry, and summer assistant s Ellen Bulger and Kaitlyn O'Donnell, continued to map the distribution of the lily leaf beetle ( Lilioceris lilii), the viburnum halys ). All of these invasive, non- native insects feed upon native and cultivated host plants in both their immature and adult stages. The lily leaf beetle infested lilies in many locations in all of the counties of Connecticut. It principally was a major pest of cultivated Asiatic lilies, but it also damaged the Canada lily ( Lilium canadense ) and the Turk's- cap lily (L. superbum ), which are native species. These wild lilies soon may be imperiled if the lily leaf beetle remains abundant. Dr. Maier and his assistants recorded the European viburnum le af beetle in every Connecticut county except New London. They have developed a database of sites with and without the invasive beetle; thus, they will be able to track its spread over time. This beetle poses a very serious threat not only to several cultivated viburnum species, but also to two native viburnum species ( Viburnum dentatum and V. opulus ). Adult of the brown ma rmorated stink bug, 5/8 inches in length. Photo by M. C. Thomas 112 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 During the past year, they detected the brown marmorated stink bug, an invasive species from eastern Asia, in many new towns in Connecticut. It was found in 36 towns and in all counties. Its increased distribution since its discovery in Connecticut in 2008 likely is due to its accidental transport from Mid- Atlantic States where it recently underwent an explosive increase in abundance. In late summer and early fall, adults of this agricultural pest often congregate in homes where they can become a nuisance. Dr. Maier and his staff are monitoring this potential pest to see if it causes injury in fruit orchards during 2011. Impact: Invasive insects can damage crops and threaten native species. The brown marmorated stink bug has caused extensive crop losses in several Mid- Atlantic States and poses a threat to Connecticut growers. Even though populations in Connecticut still are relatively low, monitoring for this pest and developing better monitoring methods will assist our growers in reducing the future impact of this invasive stink bug. Alternative Pollinators of Apple : Supported by a grant from the New England fruitgrowers, Dr. Chris Maier surveyed eight apple orchards in Connecticut and Rhode Island to determine if potential wild (non-honey bee) pollinators of apple in the genus Osmia occur naturally. By using trap-nests constructed of straws mounted in milk cartons, he reared four species of Osmia that are active when apples bloom. The most promising alternative pollinator, O. cornifrons , a foreign bee, nested at every site. T he absence of the native blue orchard bee, O. lignaria lignaria, in trap-nests supports the hypothesis that O. cornifrons is replacing this native species and perhaps others that use similar nesting sites, usually abandoned beetle burrows in wood. Other species of Osmia in trap-nests were less common \u2014O. bucephala and O. georgica at one site each and O. pumila at six sites. The potential value of these native Osmia species is being investigated. Improved Use of Lindgren Funnels : Dr. Chris Maier and his assistants continued his USDA- funded experiments on how baited Lindgren funnels, traps that imitate the form and sometimes the odor of a tree trunk, might be modified to increase their efficiency in capturing adults of wood-boring insects and their natural enemies. In 2010, experiments were conducted in northwestern Connecticut and central Massachusetts to determine how the design of Lindgren funnels and the killing agent in their collection cups affected the number of targeted insects captured. In a springtime experiment in coniferous forests at American Legion and Peoples State Forests, the number of captured beetles varied significantly among traps with different killing agents (vapona, soapy water, propylene glycol, and 70% ethyl alcohol). T he mean catch of longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae) was greater in traps with 70% ethyl alcohol than in those with other killing agents. As in 2009, the total catch of the ribbed pine borer ( Rhagium inquisitor ) was highest in traps with 70% ethyl alcohol, whereas the mean catch of another cerambycid ( Asemum striatum ) associated with pine was statistically similar among treatments. Traps with ethyl alcohol also had the highest number of bark and predatory checkered beetles. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 113 The use of alcohol in collection cups presumably increases the attractiveness of traps; thus, use of this killing agent may increase the catch of beetles, especially those that have low abundance. In a late-season experiment in which the same four killing agents were compared, the number of beetles and wood-wasps caught did not differ among treatments. The number of longhorned beetles, however, was 2- 7 times higher in traps with propylene glycol or 70% ethyl alcohol than in those with vapona soapy The number of checkered beetles, longhorned beetles, and wood-wasps was extremely low during the trapping period in 2010. An identical experiment conducted in 2009 yielded similar results. In an experiment run in a broad- leaved forest at American Legion State Forest, the design of lids (convex lid of 30- cm diameter, or flat lids of 30 -, 45-, or 60- cm diameter) of Lindgren funnels with propylene glycol as the killing agent had minimal effects on the catch of beetles in summer. The mean number captured per trap of the four designs ranged from 6.4 to 8.7 longhorned beetles, 5.2 to 8.4 checkered beetles, and 189.2 to 215.8 bark beetles. Although the number of trapped beetles varied among treatments, the differences were not significant. Based on these findings from a broad- leaved forest, increasing lid size to reduce the amount of debris and water that collects in traps would not negatively impact the catch of insects. In an experiment performed in an oak-pitch pine forest at Montague, Massachusetts, trap design once again did not affect the catch of checkered, longhorned, or bark beetles or that of wood-wasps. The Xylotrechus sagittatus , comprised 98.4% of the cerambycid catch in summer and early fall; but, statistically the number of this species also showed no relationship with trap design. Too few wood- wasps (total = 10) were captured to perform a meaningful analysis. Longhorned Beetles of Connecticut : Over the last few years, Dr. Chris Maier and his assistants have captured longhorned beetles in traps, reared them from wood, and collected them on flowers and trees to ascertain their distribution, host range, and period of adult activity. They have determined that approximately 220 species of longhorned beetles could potentially reside in Connecticut. By compiling data from research and from museum collections, they have found 195 species (89% of the potential total) in the state. In 2010, they discovered three species (Eupogonius subarmatus , Oplosia nubila, and Pogonocherus pencillatus ) reported from Connecticut. To date, they have reared 79 species from dead wood collected in New England, and they have examined the period of adult activity of over 100 species. They are generating a database, which now has over 7,800 entries. Biological information in their database should assist in the development of management plans for borers that are or may become pests. 114 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Future Outlook: The information from these surveys and the longhorned beetle database will document native and exotic invasive insects and wood-borers in Connecticut and assist in developing management plans for the wood- borers that are pests. Agrilus species -The genus Agrilus (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) contains several species of economic importance, both native and invasive. Dr. Claire E. Rutledge is pursuing several lines of r esearch with two members of this genus. The Bronze Birch Borer (BBB), Agrilus anxious Glory, a native insect, requires stressed, living trees to develop, and thus frequently attacks birches in landscape and nursery settings. The beetles cause considerable aesthetic and financial damage to homeowners and nurserymen in Connecticut. The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), A. planipennis Fairmaire, an invasive pest, is a native of Asia that was discovered in Detroit MI in 2002 and has spread widely. While not yet detected in Connecticut, a large infestation in Saugerties, NY was found in 2010 approximately 25 miles from the CT border. In collaboration with Dr. Melody Keena, US Forest Service, Dr. Rutledge is pursuing a multi- pronged approach to studying the reproductive behavior of BBB and EAB which encompasses mating behavior, mate choice, the kinetics of sperm transfer and storage, and the impact of mating frequency on fecundity. The results of this research are being used to improve laboratory rearing of EAB, as well as to understand the population dynamics of the species and how it compares to the native Agrilus. Finally, surveys continue on the natural enemies of BBB and other species in the Buprestidae. To date, we have seen nematodes in the reproductive systems of two species, BBB and anot her native species, Dicera lurida . sequenced for the small subunit rDNA and Cytochrome (COX) regions. Preliminary BLAST analysis of the ssrDNA in D. lurida shows closest relationships (95-96% range) from a mycophagous Drosophila sp. Analysis of the COX region of the nematode in BBB also showed the closest relationship (91%) to D. siricidicola . The DNA analysis was carried out in coope ration with Dr. Charles Vossbrinck of the Department of Environmental Science at CAES. Cerceris fumipennis : Dr. Claire E. Rutledge with the assistance of Mioara Scott has several studies on the buprestid hunter Cerceris fumipennis (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) underway. This native, solitary hunting wasp uses adult buprestid beetles to provision her nest for her larvae. The wasps nest in colonies of 1 - 500 holes and prefer hard-packed sandy soil. When colonies are located it is easy to monitor the wasps returning to their holes and identify the Dr. Rutledge works with EAB in the U.S. Forest Service Quarantine Facility in Ansonia, CT The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 115 beetles that they are carrying. In areas that are infested by EAB, the wasps will bring EAB adults to the nests. Thus, the wasp provides a highly efficient, effective and free 'bio- surveillance' system. With funding from the US Forest Service, we are surveying colonies throughout CT. Wasp Watcher Program : The wasp watcher program was begun in the spring of 2010. The program had several goals. The first was to increase our ability to monitor colonies of C. fumipennis for invasive buprestid beetles, in particular EAB. Secondly, we hoped to educate and involve citizens on the issues and science surrounding invasive species in general and wood boring insects in particular. In the summer of 2010, we had 23 watchers at 21 colonies. In the summer of 2011 many of the original watchers returned. We were also joined by volunteers at the White Memorial Conservation Center in Litchfield and the Bartlett Arboretum in Stamford. We concentrated on colonies with many nests, and 29 watchers monitored 21 colonies. The colonies were distributed throughout CT. No invasive buprestid beetles were found in 2010. We are still awaiting results from 2011. Two lines of research in addition to the 'bio-surveillance' efforts were continued t his past year. The first project is in collaboration with Philip Careless (Canada Food and Agriculture), Dr. Melissa Fierke SUNY and Colleen Teerling, Maine Forest Service. With funding from the Forest Service, we are collecting data to determine the degree-day requirements of C. fumipennis . This knowledge should help us to better use and manipulate C. fumipennis as a bio-surveillance tool. Captive wasp colonies can be used to provide 'surveillance services in areas where invasive buprestids are suspected in much the same way that honey bee colonies are used to provide pollination services in agriculture. The second regards the cues used by C. fumipennis to recognize their prey. This project is in collaboration with Dr. Peter Silk of the Canadian Forest Ser vice and Philip Careless (Canada Food and Agriculture). We are hoping to identify the chemical signature of Buprestidae used by C. fumipennis to recognize their prey. Wasps will grasp, and attempt to paralyze buprestid beetles, but not beetles in other families. The attractive elements can be removed by washing the beetles with solvents, and then restored by applying the extract. So far , we have shown that the wasps accept washed beetles coated with an extract from several different species of Buprestidae, and reject washed beetles coated with non - buprestid beetle extracts. We are testing currently a synthesized A. planipennis contact sex pheromone for attractiveness to the wasp. This could provide an accessible source of 'buprestid smell' to dose non-buprestid beetles to make them acceptable to wasps being reared in colonies. Dr. Rutledge trains \"wasp watchers\" at White Memorial Foundation in Litchfield, CT. 116 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 NURSERY AND PLANT INSPECTION ACTIVITIES Plant inspection and regulat ory services are coordinated and conducted by State Entomologist Dr. Kirby Stafford , Deputy State Entomologist Dr. Tia Blevins , and Apiary Inspector Ira Kettle. On March 9 and 10, 2011, approximately 60 personnel from The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, in cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, USDA- Forest Service, and USDA -APHIS-Plant Protection and Quarantine, participated in an Incident Command System (ICS) exercise, concerning a simulated detection of Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). The purpose of the exercise was to demonstrate and practice the ability of state and federal agencies to cooperate to address the detection of a potent ially- devastating, federally regulated insect pest. The exercise was held at Ft. Trumbull in New London, with simulated finds of EAB at locations in the surrounding area. Experiment Station personnel participating in the exercise were: Jeff Fengler, and St eve Sandrey (Survey Team Leaders), Peter Trenchard (Regulatory Group Leader), J. P. Barsky (Safety Officer), Tia Blevins (Ground Support Unit Leader), Carole Cheah , Diane Riddle , and Richard Cowles (Survey Team Members), Claire Rutledge (Scientific Suppo rt), Rose Hiskes (Assistant Information Officer), and Vicki Smith (Agency Administrator). The exercise received coverage in the New London Day and on television Channel WFSB. Nursery Inspection and Certification: Three-hundred eleven nurseries were certified to conduct intra- and interstate business. There were 719 nursery inspections during the growing season. Seven-thousand, nine-hundred and twenty five acres of nursery stock were examined. Nursery Insects : The most abundant pests found in nurseries were aphids on various trees and shrubs, mites on various trees and shrubs, black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus ) on Taxus, Arborvitae on Tsuga, and lacebug on Pieris, Rhododendron and Azalea. Japanese Beetle Certification : We observed treatments of 2,890 plants at two nurseries and issued phytosanitary certificates to comply with states that quarantine nursery stock from Connecticut because of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica. Two nurseries met ot her requirements of the United States Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan and shipped 1,954 plants to states that quarantine plants from Connecticut. Japanese Beetle Certification to Canada: Eleven Connecticut nurseries, which met the inspection requirements of the US/Canada Japanese Beetle Harmonization Plan, shipped 102,274 plants to Canada in 2010. Nursery Dealer Permits : Nursery dealer permits were issued to 168 firms. One-hundred forty five of these companies operate individual outlets. The remaining businesses have more than one outlet each. In total, there were 568 outlets. Phytosanitary Certificates : Three-hundred and forty seven phytosanitary inspection certificates were issued covering the shipment of the following plant materials to destinations outside the United States: The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 117 Product Number Apples (Cartons) 9,060 Bulbs & Tubers (Dahlia & Gladiolas)(Bags) 258 American Chestnut (unrooted cuttings, bags) 10 Chinese tree peonies (plants) 64 Greenhouse plants 445 Nursery stock (containers - B & B) 101,685 Orchids (plants) 4,885 Perennials (bare root plants) 1,866 (plants) (unrooted cuttings, bags) 100 10 Seeds (cartons & bags) 506 Tobacco (bales, boxes, bundles & cartons) 121,121 Tobacco (pounds) Cotton seed meal (bags) 10 1,600 Walnut shells (bags and drums) 86 Special Inspections : Six inspections were made for 147 individual plants and bulbs to assist homeowners moving out of state. One-hundred twelve inspections were made to assist nurseries moving the following plants interstate: Product Number Perennials (plants) 2,875 Nursery stock (containers) 686 (bare root plants) 1,954 Greenhouse plants 1,568 Orchids 284 Seed (Bags) 58 One tobacco grower had 130.5 acres inspected for the aerial application of pesticides. There was no Post-Entry Quarantine activity in CT in 2010. Biotechnology Regulatory Services Inspection Activity : In cooperation with officers from the Wallingford USDA- APHIS-PPQ office, eleven insp ections were conducted in 2010 at facilities or laboratories working with recombinant or regulated organisms. Permits to Move Live Plants, Noxious Weeds, and Soil : In 2010, there were fifty four PPQ 526 Permits (Permit to move live plant pests, noxious w eeds, and soil) approved in CT. There were five PPQ 330 Permits (permit to move soil) approved in CT. FOREST HEALTH SURVEY During the summer and autumn of 2009, we examined 51 permanent, one- acre forest plots that were established to monitor forest health in Connecticut. These plots are located on state, Nature Conservancy, and municipal water company properties. We considered 25 pathogens for 118 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 monitoring and determined which trees served as host plants. Within each plot, 20 to 30 trees were tagged for long -term studies. We evaluated signs of defoliation and disease, such as dead tree branches, limbs and crowns. Descriptions and determinations are designed to reflect increasing damage or tree decline. We measure the trees at Diameter at Breast Height (D BH) as an additional way to monitor their health. We will continue to use these plots to monitor the forests over several years to assess whether our state forests remain healthy or are declining. In general, our forests remain healthy. Plots containing a significant ash ( Fraxinus sp .) component will be sites for trapping for Emerald Ash Borer ( Agrilus paniplennis ), an invasive insect that was detected in July 2010 in Saugerties, NY. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS Single rain events in March contributed to a high spring rainfall level for most of CT in 2010; even though most of the year was abnormally dry. Rainfall totals in inches are as follows: Wind Damage : In March 2010, many areas of southeastern Fairfield County were affected by strong damaging winds. M ature trees in residential areas were toppled, resulting in landscape disturbance and structural damage. Via aerial survey, damage on 1,060.7 acres in Fairfield County were surveyed and mapped. Statewide, a total of 1,123.8 acres in Fairfield, Hartford, and Litchfield Counties were affected by this weather event. Ice Damage: Several locations in Litchfield County were severely affected by ice storms in the winter of 2009-2010. All species of trees were affected, with breakage of major branches and trunks occurring. Damage was primarily at higher elevations, such as hilltops and ridges. In total, 58.3 acres were affected by ice. Drought: Isolated pockets in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties were severely affected by dry conditions in spring and summer. In Fairfield County, 25.8 acres were impacted, and in Litchfield County, 27.6 acres were affected, for a total of 58.3 acres. INSECT AND DISEASE SURVEYS Gyspy Moth : For the first time in many years, there was no observable defoliation due to Gypsy Moth recorded in CT in 2010. During egg mass surveys in winter 2009-2010, very few viable egg masses were found. In November and December 2010, a gypsy moth egg mass survey was conducted in 80-95% favorable host sites on a 7-mile grid (102 sites) throughout Connecticut. No viable egg masses were found. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid : This pest has been present in CT for many years, and continues to cause patchy damage and decline among the remaining population of hemlocks. In 2010, a total of 1,772.7 acres were affected by HWA and elongate hemlock scale. In fact, many areas of hemlock are healthy, especially in the northwest corner of the state; in many areas hemlocks are recovering due to wet summers and reduction in HWA populations, especially where biocontrol was impleme nted. During 2010, we required all hemlock nursery stock that was being shipped out of Connecticut to be treated for Hemlock woolly adelgid. Three nurseries shipped hemlock trees out of state. Our plant inspectors observed treatments and issued phytosanitary c ertificates to cover 741 plants in these shipments. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 119 Asian Longhorned Beetle : The Asian Longhorned Beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis , first discovered to be attacking trees in August of 1996 in New York, has spread to within 25 miles of Greenwich in southwestern Connecticut. There is risk for beetle entry in ports because of the transportation of solid wood packing material on ships coming from areas of the world where this beetle is found. In addition, insects submitted by arborists and homeowners as poss ible ALB have been examined. We conducted inspections of 6,509 trees in all counties of CT for presence or signs of ALB infestation. All surveys and identifications, thus far, have been negative. White spotted sawyer and western conifer seed bug are most frequently accused of being ALB. Due to the recent detections of ALB in Worcester and Boston, Massachusetts, the Experiment Station has established a web site for fielding inquiries on ALB. The address is: CAES.StateEntomologist@ct.gov . The same address is also used for reporting possible Emerald ash borer. This site can be used for general inquiries as well. We have fielded over many inquiries concerning ALB and EAB to this site to date. We have found it useful to ask that a digital photograph be included with the inquiry. Outreach efforts to educate stakeholders about these two invasive insects, signs of infestation, ALB and EAB look-alikes, and impacts of infestation continue. To assist with public education and early detection efforts for both ALB and EAB, the Station participated in a Forest Pest Survey and Outreach Project funded by USDA- APHIS-PPQ, which was overseen by Rose Hiskes with the assistance of Katherine Dugas . We held multiple training sess ions, had displays at agricultural fairs and other venues, distributed information to garden centers and many other outlets, and presented talks to the Boy Scouts, garden clubs, schools, summer camps, and at public libraries. Ramorum Leaf Blight : Ramorum L eaf Blight (aka Sudden Oak Death) is a serious plant disease that attacks many types of plants and trees common to Connecticut. It is currently known to occur in the Pacific Northwest on oaks, azaleas, big leaf maples, huckleberry, California bay laurel, Pacific madrone, Douglas fir, rhododendrons, and viburnum. It does not affect humans and is not a food safety concern. Sudden oak death is caused by a pathogen called Phytophthora ramorum . The pathogen is not a fungus or a bacterium, but a member of a unique group of organisms called Oomycetes. Oomycetes share some characteristics of fungi but are biologically different. As part of the P. ramorum National Nursery Survey, we inspected 20 nurseries during 2010. During this survey so far, 40,000 plants have been inspected and 222 samples from symptomatic plants were submitted for lab analysis. All samples were cultured and tested by ELISA; DNA from ELISA -positive samples is tested by PCR and any PCR -positive samples would be sent to Beltsville for PCR confirmation. One hundred seventy-seven samples, about 80 %, were ELISA-positive, indicating the presence of Phytophthora sp. All samples from the nurseries were negative for P. ramorum . There was no trace- forward/trace -back activity involving P. ramorum in CT in 2010. An aquatic survey was done in conjunction with the US Forest Service. The stream selected for survey surrounds a 400-acre production nursery that has been implicated in P. ramorum trace-back activity. One location upstream of the nursery and one location downstream were baited with rhododendron leaves during April through September 2010; the baiting period was 120 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 about 2 weeks each month, with a hiatus during June and July when the water temperature exceeded 20o C. Leaf baits were submitted for testing to labs at the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and at Cornell University. While many leaf baits were positive for Phytophthora species, all leaf baits ve for by Puccinia hemerocallidis, was found on daylilies in a southeastern U.S. nursery for the first time in the summer of 2000, and in 2001 and 2002 on daylilies owned by private citizens. It is now confir med to occur in three counties. During 2010, we surveyed daylilies in nurseries and garden centers for signs of this rust. One hundred and two inspections were carried out; no signs of Puccinia hemerocallidis were found Chrysantheumum White Rust : In 2010, we inspected 20,421 plants for CWR. One Master Gardener reported CWR in her personal garden; the plants had been planted over 10 years ago. The plants were dug up, bagged in plastic trash bags, and disposed of in the municipal waste stream. Inspection of properties within 400 meters revealed no nearby sources of inoculum. Emerald Ash Borer : We found no emerald ash borers or any symptoms of them in our survey. However, we did find that overall the health of ash trees in the state is poor, with only 35% of trees examined classified as healthy by the observers. Thus, it seems likely that Connecticut's ash population will be highly vulnerable to the borer when it does arrive. Locust leafminer : Odontota dorsalis is primarily a pest of black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia, but other trees, such as apple, beech, birch, cherry, elm, and oak are occasionally attacked. Outbreaks of Locust leafminer are generally more spectacular than destructive. During outbreaks, trees appear brown or gray, suggesting premature fall color. In 2010, 652.5 acres in Fairfield County and 65.7 acres in Litchfield County were affected by Locust leafminer, for a total Larch casebearer, Coleophora laricella, a native of Europe, was first reported in Massachuse tts in 1886. Damage on larch is evident in spring and early summer. We recorded 25.2 acres in Litchfield County affected by this insect. Butternut Research : Butternut populations are declining throughout the native range, and efforts to find trees resista nt to the pathogens that kill them have been under way for some time. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has maintained a list of reported butternut trees in the state since 1994, and in the last two years we have been sampling the trees to determine what pathogens are present. Two pure butternut trees have been identified in the state using a DNA test, and all the rest of the trees sampled have been Japanese walnuts or hybrids. The butternut canker pathogen, Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum has been found twice in CT, and one of the isolates contains a dsRNA virus. Inoculations of small butternut, Japanese walnut, and hybrid trees at Lockwood Farm will be done this winter to compare the virulence of these strains.

The objectives of the surveillance program are to provide: 1) early evidence of local virus activity; 2) information on the abundance, distribution, identity and infection rates of potential mosquito vectors and; 3) information that is us ed to assess the threat of WN virus and EEE to the public and guide the implementation of mosquito control measures. The CAES is responsible for conducting all mosquito trapping and testing activities. The program is conducted by Dr. Theodore Andreadis and Dr. Philip Armstrong , assisted by John Shepard, Michael Thomas , and Shannon Finan. Mosquito trapping is conducted at 91 permanent trapping stations that are located in 72 municipalities throughout the state. In 2010, mosquito trapping was conducted from June 1 to October 21. Traps were set and attended by CAES staff every 10 days at each site on a regular rotation. Two trap types were used at all trapping stations - a CO2-baited CDC Light Trap, designed to trap host- seeking adult female mosquitoes ( all species), and a Gravid Mosquito Trap, designed to trap previously blood- fed adult female mosquitoes (principally Culex and container -breeding Ochlerotatus species). Mosquitoes were transported alive to the laboratory each morning where they were identified to species. Mosquitoes were grouped (pooled) according to species, collecting site, and date and frozen at -80 oC. A maximum of 50 female mosquitoes we re included in each pool. Aliquots of each mosquito pool were inoculated into Vero cell cultures for detection of WN virus and other mosquito-borne arboviruses of public health importance. Virus isolates from mosquito pools were tested for WN, EEE, James town Canyon (JC), Cache Valley (CV), Trivittatus (TVT), Highlands J (HJ), and LaCrosse (LAC), and Potosi (POTV) viruses. Isolated viruses were identified by Real Time (TaqMan) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or standard RT -PCR using virus-specific primers . All of the virus isolation work was conducted in a certified Bio- Safety Level 3 laboratory at the CAES. Weekly test results were reported to the CDC electronically via ArboNet and to the DPH for dissemination to other state agencies, local health depar tments, the media, and neighboring states. For the 2010 season, a total of 115,725 mosquitoes (10,654 pools) representing 37 species were trapped and tested. A total of 220 isolations of WN virus were made from 9 mosquito species: 170, = 1, and Uranotaenia sapphirina = 1 collected at 29 sites in 24 towns in 4 counties: Fairfield, (Bethel, Bridgeport, Darien, Fairfield, Greenwich, Monroe, New Canaan, Newtown, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 123 Norwalk, Stamford, Stratford, Trumbull, Westport), Hartford (Hartford, Manchester, New Britain, West Hartford, Wethersfield), New Haven (Meriden, Milford, New Haven, Orange, Wallingford, West Haven), and New London, (Stonington) (Figure 1) . The first positive mosquitoes were collected on June 14, and the last on October 7. As in prior years, the majority of WN virus activity was detected in densely populated urban and suburban regions in southwestern (Fairfield and New Haven counties) Connecticut. Nine locally acquired human cases of WN virus infection were reported to CTDPH from residents living in Bridgeport, Brookfield, Clinton, Greenwich, Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Trumbull, and Westport. Two additional human cases that were acquired out of state were also reported. Very little EEE virus activity was detected in 2010. A total of 4 isolations of EEE virus were made from Culiseta melanura mosquitoes collected at one location in North Stonington from August 20 to September 30. There were no human or horse cases of EEE reported. Other mosquito-borne viruses isolated included: Cache Valley (CV) = 6, Highlands J (HJ) = 1, and Jamestown Canyon (JC) = 22. 124 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Mosquito sp ecies trapped and tested for arboviruses in Connecticut, 2010 Mosquito Species # Mosquitoes # Pools Virus CV EEE HJ JC WN 1 1 Ochlerotatus aurifer 645 78 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 125 Ochlerotatus 115,725 10,654 6 4 1 22 220 CV = Cache Valley, HJ = Highlands J, JC = Jamestown Canyon, WN = West Nile Impact. Mosquitoes were collected at 91 trap sites, located in 72 municipalities, in Connecticut. Following identification, the insects were processed for virus isolations and identified using molecular methods to analyze RNA. During 2010, 115,725 mosquitoes were tested for virus. 126 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 There were 220 isolations of WN virus 4 isolations of EEE. There were 9 locally acquired human cases in the state linked to WN virus infection. News releases included information on how residents could protect themselves from mosquito bites, such as the use of repellents. The information contained in the news releases had an immediate impact because many residents did take the suggested precautions. The long-term benefits include a healthy human population and a well-informed public concerning the potential risks of mosquito bites. Participation in the statewide surveillance program provided timely information about levels of virus activity in the mosquito population which was used to assess risk of human infection, inform the public and health care providers of these risks, guide vector control efforts, and prevent disease outbreaks. Mosquito and Arbovirus Studies West Nile virus has become firmly established in northeastern United States, reemerging every summer since its introduction into North America in 1999. To determine whether WN virus overwinters locally or is reseeded annually, Drs. Philip Armstrong, Charl es Vossbrinck, Theodore Andreadis and John Anderson examined the patterns of viral lineage persistence and replacement in Connecticut over 10 consecutive transmission seasons by phylogenetic analysis. In addition, they compared the full protein coding sequence among WN virus isolates to search for evidence of convergent and adaptive evolution. Viruses sampled from Connecticut segregated into a number of well-supported subclades by year of isolation with few clades persisting 2 years. Similar viral strai ns were dispersed in different locations across the state and divergent strains appeared within a single location during a single transmission season, implying widespread movement and rapid colonization of virus. Numerous amino acid substitutions arose in the population but only one change, V A at position 159 of the envelope protein, became permanently fixed. Several instances of parallel evolution were identified in independent lineages, including one amino acid change in the NS4A protein that appears to be positively selected. Our results suggest that annual reemergence of WN virus is driven by both reintroduction and local-overwintering of virus. Despite ongoing diversification of WN virus, most amino acid variants occurred at low frequencies and were transient in the virus population. Impact. These investigations will allow scientists to monitor and tract local regional changes in WN virus that may be associated with changes in virulence and/or transmission efficiency as it evolves over the years. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 127 Mosquitoes transmit a number of distinct viruses including important human pathogens such as West Nile virus, dengue virus, and chickungunya virus. Many of these viruses have intensified in their endemic ranges and expanded to new territories, necessitat ing effective surveillance and control programs to respond to these threats. One strategy to monitor virus activity involves collecting large numbers of mosquitoes from endemic sites and testing them for viral infection. Drs. Philip Armstrong, Theodore A ndreadis, John Anderson and Shannon Finan, John Shepard and Michael Thomas produced a web -based audio-visual report describing how to handle, process, and screen field-collected mosquitoes for infectious virus by Vero cell culture assay. Mosquitoes are sorted by trap location and species, and grouped into pools containing 50 individuals. Pooled specimens are homogenized in buffered saline using a mixer phase is inoculated onto confluent Vero cell cultures. Cell cultures are monitore d for cytopathic effect from days 3 -7 post-inoculation and any viruses grown in cell culture are identified by the appropriate diagnostic assays. By utilizing this approach, they have isolated 9 different viruses from mosquitoes collected in Connecticut, and among these, 5 are known to cause human disease. Three of these viruses (West Nile virus, Potosi virus, and La Crosse virus) represent new records for North America or the New England region since 1999. Impact. The ability to detect a wide diversity of viruses is critical to monitoring both established and newly emerging viruses in the mosquito population. Mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex are important vectors of several disease -causing pathogens including West Nile virus. In North America , the complex consists their hybrids that exhibit substantial diversity in physiology, behavior and geographic range. Hybridization among these mosquitoes is of concern because of potential implications for disease transmission. Currently, several morphological and molecular markers exist for differentiating members of the Cx. pipiens complex; however, these markers have specific limitations. Dr. Shaoming Huang, Goudarz Molaei and Theodore 128 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Andreadis developed two highly reliable ribosomal CxpG2T and CxpA2d contain one allele that is present in all members of the Cx. pipiens complex and the other allele is specific to Cx. p. quinquefasciatus . Testing of field populations from the eastern United States demonstrated that these two SNP markers are capable of identifying a south -to-north gradient of Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and hybrids. The northern limit of detection of Cx . p. quinquefasciatus alleles in this study was in Fort Totten, NYC (40.79\u00b0 N), whereas the southern boundary was determined between Atlanta, GA (33.81\u00b0 N) and Gainesville, FL (29.64\u00b0 N ). CxpG2T and CxpA2d were more accurate than ACE-2 marker, and may conceivably provide comparable resolution to microsatellite markers for detecting Cx. p. quinquefasciatus alleles. The spread of exotic mosquito species into new environments can introduce shifts in mosquito populations and potentially alter public health risks to mosquito- borne diseases. The successful establishment of exotic species is believed to occur due to their competitive advantage over other cohabitating species. Drs. Melissa Hardstone and Theodore Andreadis hypothesized that the recently introduced exotic mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus would be a more effective competitor than Aedes atropalpus and Aedes triseriatus and an equal competitor to Culex pipiens based on abundance data within used tire habitats. Impacts of competition were measured using the development rate and survival of larvae as well as adult wing size, sex ratio, and mortality. They found that intraspecific competition does not act strongly on Ae. j. japonicus nor the other three resident mosquito species. Interspecific competition was generally weak and driven mostly by species and density effects, rather than interspecific treatment effects. Interspecific competition was not present between atropalpus , j. japonicus and positively impacted Ae. triseriatus . Overall, our results show that larval competition between Ae. j. japonicus and the three resident species was weak when present. Consequently, interspecific competition which could influence the invasion pattern of Ae. j. japonicus may manifest only under extreme environmental co nditions. Invasive Aquatic Plant Program Surveillance and Monitoring Program. Greg Bugbee and Dr. Mark June- Wells assisted by Jordan Gibbons, Michal Cavadini and Brian Hart are continuing to quantify the presence of invasive aquatic plants in Connecticut's lakes and ponds, determine their effects on native plant communities, establish baseline data to track their spread and provide information that is critical The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 129 for developing control strategies. During the 2010 field season, native and invasive aquatic vegetation was mapped in eight new and eleven previously surveyed water bodies. Complete aquatic vegetation surveys have now been completed on 170 Connecticut lakes and ponds. To begin to discern how invasive plants are affecting plant communities over time, four lakes originally surveyed in 2004 or 2005 were resurveyed In addition, Lake Candlewood, Connecticut's largest lake, was surveyed for the fourth consecutive year to de termine the effects of alternate year deep and shal low winter drawdown on invasive (curly leaf pondweed). Lake Zoar (another large lake) was surveyed for the second time to track the long-term population dynamics of the same invasive species. Global positioning system (GPS) derived transects were established within each water body to quantitatively track changes in native and invasive aquatic species abundance and distribution over time. Water samples were collected from all lakes and ponds and analyzed for pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, clarity, alkalinity, co nductivity and phosphorus. These data, along with watershed information, are being used to inves tigate the factors that influence the susceptibility of water bodies to certain invasive species. Dry specimens of all plant species in the CAES herbarium are archived for future reference and information is incorporated into the publicly accessible Conne cticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) Invasive Aquatic Plant website (http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). 130 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 More than 60 percent of the surveyed water bodies contain one or more invasive plant species and some lakes contained as many as four invasive species. The most common invasive plants are M. spicatum , M. heterophyllum , N. minor, P. crispus survey of Fence Rock Lake in 2009 discovered Connecticut's first infestation of Egeria densa ( Brazilian waterweed) and a resurvey in 2010 found it to successfully overwinter. Staff members at the CAES is working with the local lake association and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) to provide control options. Resurveys suggest C. caroliniana has the capability to out compete even tenacious invasive plants such as M. heterophyllum . Cedar Lake, Chester, CT was surveyed in 2004 and again in 2010 (Figure 1). In 2004, the coverage of M. heterophyllum and C. caroliniana was nearly the same (2.6 and 2.5 ha respectively). In 2010, the area of C. caroliniana increased to 5.9 ha while M. heterophyllum decreased to 1.9 ha. This trend also was evident in our resurvey of Lake Quonnipaug, Guilford, CT and agrees with anecdotal evidence from lake manager s that C. caroliniana is increasing statewide . Figure 2. Comparison of aquatic plant communities in Cedar Lake between 2004 and 2010. C. caroliniana is dark green and M. heterophyllum is medium blue. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 131 Investigations continue on using aerial imagery as a surveillance tool. In 2009, the United States Department of Agriculture National Agriculture Imagery Program provided good viewing of the Eurasian watermil foil beds in Candlewood Lake. A comparison of 2010 imagery with 2009 identified four areas that appeared to have milfoil that were missed. These areas tended to be small humps in the center part of the lake where surveyors would expect it to be too deep to support milfoil (Figure 2). A revisit to the areas found all but one to be Eurasian milfoil. More sophisticated software will be used this in the future for analyzing the imagery. These surveys provide one of the most complete aquatic plant and water chemistry databases available in any state. Using water chemistry and plant presence/absence data from 92 Connecticut lakes with invasive species, they developed risk assessment ranges for use by local resource managers and policy makers. Multivariate statistical approach elucidated strong correlations among our five most abundant non- native aquatic plant species and the lake water chemistry variables; alkalinity (buffering), conductivity (total ions), pH (hydrogen ion concentration), and phosphorus concentration (trophic level). Lakes were grouped by species presence. Two groups derived from the correlation technique (Principal Component Analysis) were: 1) Lakes with C. caroliniana and M. heterophyllum and 2) Lakes wi th P. crispus, N. Figure 2. Remote sensing imagery suggested area (arrow left) was M. spicatum . This was confirmed by our field survey and an invasive polygon was added to map (arrow right). The other polygons (right) were found without remote sensing but their visibility in the imagery is striking . 132 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 minor, and M. spicatum . This allowed for a multivariate regression technique to compare whether these groups were significantly different in regards to water chemistry. Analysis detected highly significant differences among groups (see Table below). The C. caroliniana and M. heterophyllum group exhibited significant preferences for lakes with lower conductivity, alkalinity, and pH than the P. crispus, N. minor, and M. spicatum group. Finally, we found Discriminant Function Analysis was able to predict the presence of our five species with nearly 80 percent accuracy . To prevent the spread of invasive species, Connecticut has enacted laws banning the sale and transport of invasive species. The States banned list contains 20 aquatic plants (Table 1). CAES Invasive Aquatic Plant Program ( IAPP) evaluated aquarium retailer compliance with invasive aquatic plant mandates. In 2008 and 2010 seventy- five aquatic plant dealers were visited. All plant species that exhibited similar morphology to the 20 banned species were purchase d and identified morphologically. Because many specimens could not be identified based on morphology, Dr. Charles Vossbrinck assisted by Kittyapong Prapayotin Riveros obtained genetic sequences for each specimen and compared them to known genetic sequences in the GENBANK NCBI database. It was found that 30% of the stores are selling banned aquatic species and that Cabomba caroliniana is the most common banned species being sold (Table 2). Moreover, the species Egeria densa (Brazilian waterweed) and species in the genus Myriophyllum were misidentified by the retailer more than 50% of the time. Noncompliance to State law appears to be primarily due to mislabeling, difficulties in identifying many aquatic plant species and ignorance of state statutes. CAES IAPP has begun educating retailers by offering workshops and distributing copies of the Invasive Aquatic Plant Identification Guide produced in 2010 as part of this program. This effort The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 133 has provided valuable information to the CT DEEP who is charged w ith inspecting aquarium retailers and enforcing the laws regarding the sale of the banned plants.

Connecticut pet stores selling banned invasive aquatic macrophytes in 2008 and 2010 Control efforts. The goal of this objective is 1) to investigate novel means of chemical control that minimizes herbicide usage and protect native vegetation and 2) find biological organisms that will provide long- term suppression of invasive species particularly Eurasian watermilfoil. Herbicides: Novel methods of chemical control with herbicides can rapidly remove invasive plants and begin to restore native plant c ommunities to aquatic ecosystems. # SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME 1 Butomus umbellatus L.

Bashan Lake, East Haddam, CT. CAES is in the 12th year of research involving the use of spot applications of the herbicide 2, 4-D to control M. heterophyllum in Bashan Lake. We have largely restored the lake to prein festation conditions; however, regrowth requires yearly surveys and modest retreatments. For a sixth consecutive year, we have shown the effectiveness of late summer herbicide applications thus limiting the exposure of those who use the lake to the herbicide. We have integrated underwater video equipment with GPS and geographic information system (GIS) technology to precisely locate and treat the patches of M. heterophyllum . 2. Crystal Lake, Middletown, CT . Crystal Lake has extensive growth of Potamogeton crispus and Myriophyllum spicatum . Chemical control efforts have been hampered due to the presence of the threatened plant species Potamogeton vaseyi. Limnobarriers were used to isolate the beds of P. vaseyi and treated the lake in late April with diquat dibromide to remove the invasive plants. After several weeks, the unwanted vegetation was controlled. By late summer, re-growth of curly leaf pondweed had begun but no Eurasian milfoil was observed. This trend continued in 2008 with re-growth of the P. crispus to pretreatment levels but virtually no re - growth of the M. spicatum . This near complete elimination of M. spicatum by the April diquat treatment may be a new tool for controlling this plant but further study is needed. In 2008, a survey for Potamogeton vaseyi by CT DEP found that the plant was growing well; however, none was located in 2009. Eight species of native plants were found the year after treatment compared to only four the year prior to treatment. This resurgence in native species suggests that the early season application of diquat, and associated reduction in invasive species pressure, may be beneficial to the plant community. Longer term control of the curly leaf pondweed probably requires reducing its bank of reproductive structures in the sediment called turions. Consecutive early season diquat applications were made in 2009 and 2010 to test theory. Again, limnobarriers were installed and plant populations were monitored. In 2010, in collaboration with the CAES Department of Analytical Chemistry, we monitored the movement and degradation of the diquat herbicide. We tested the water inside the limnobarriers, just outside the limnobarriers and in the central parts of the lake (surface and bottom), for diquat dibromide for 39 days to monitor its dissipation (Figure 3). The limnobarriers provided substantial reduction in diquat concentrations with levels reaching only near 50 ppb inside compared to 350 ppb outside. Interestingly, the diquat never reached the lake bottom (the herbicide was injected at a depth of 0.5 meters and mixed by the boat propeller) and this may protect native plants that are just starting their new season growth. Biological control. The CAES IAPP biological control program has now been in progress for four years.

This was the seventh year of study at Grannis Lake, which has the problematic populations of M. spicatum , P. crispus and N. minor . After many years of unsuccessful attempts to control the invasive species with herbicides a plant eating fish called grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella) was introduced. A total of 200 sterile (triploid) fish averaging 25 cm (10 inch) in length were introduced into the 20 acre lake in September of 2007. Over 200 georeferenced sites in the lake were monitored for the effects of the grass carp on both native and invasive plant species. After no decrease in vegetation in 2008 and 2009, our survey in May 2010 finally showed the fish were reducing the abundance (mass per point) of the invasive species (Figure 4). The frequency of occurrence has not yet been reduced and suggests that the fish are consuming the suspended vegetation without any appreciable reduction in basal plant parts. With continued feeding the frequency of occurrence should begin to decline. Grannis Lake will be restocked in 2011 or 2012, in conformance with CT DEEP guidelines. Candlewood Lake, Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Sherman, CT. The CAES IAPP has continued research on the milfoil controlled E urasian watermilfoil in other states and is native to most lakes with Eurasian watermilfoil in CT. Unfortunately, weevil populations in CT are rarely high enough to cause a significant reduction in milfoil. They are currently conducting two long- term investigations on augme nting milfoil weevil populations to determine if control of Eurasian watermilfoil will result. The first project is in Candlewood Lake. Although Candlewood Lake contains over 350 acres of Eurasian watermilfoil, our surveillance found the weevil to be near ly nonexistent. This offered an excellent opportunity to determine if weevil augmentation can increase the long -term population. CAES in collaboration with Western Connecticut State University (WSCU), the Candlewood Lake Authority and EnviroScience, Inc. introduced 10,000 weevils into three sites in 2008. In 2009, the weevil population in the sites changed little from pretreatment densities. In 2010, an additional 5000 weevils were stocked into an old site and Figure 4. The yearly effects of grass carp herbivory on the frequency of occurrence and the abundance of Potamogeton crispus in Grannis Lake, East Haven, CT. 136 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 11,000 weevils were stocked into a new site. Weevils and damage were monitored in old and new sites in 2010 and small increases were noted when compared to control sites (Figure 5). Figure 5. The effects of milfoil weevil augmentation on weevil abundanc e and stem damage in Candlewood Lake (courtesy of Mitch Wagner, WSCU) The second milfoil weevil investigation site is located at Indian Lake, in Sharon, CT. The Indian Lake Association initiated a weevil stocking program in 2008. We monitored milfoil and w eevil populations prior to augmentation and are currently following populations in a manner similar to that of Candlewood Lake. Unlike Candlewood Lake, Indian Lake already had an abundant weevil population prior to augmentation. Our preliminary data show t hat average weevil populations in the augmented areas were similar (1.25 weevils/stem) to the non- augmented areas. Molecular identification and population genetics. The goal of this objective is three fold; 1) to develop a molecular -based system for plant identification, 2) to utilize microsatellite markers for distinguishing among populations of the milfoil weevil and 3) to determine whether genetic differences in variable milfoil are present and if differences affect invasiveness. Dr. Charles Vossbrinck assisted by Kittyapong Prapayotin Riveros has developed a database of plant DNA sequences for molecular identification of the aquatic invasive and native species. They have positively identified and sequenced at least one gene from 56 different aquatic pl ant species and have sequenced all three genes (small ribosomal subunit, internal transcribed spacer The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 137 ribosomal DNA, atpB-rbcL spacer region) from 41 species. One hundred thirty sequences have been submitted to GenBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html ) where they are available to researchers worldwide. Novel methods using cesium chloride/ethidium bromide density gradients and ultracentrifugation have been developed to effectively isolate and purify DNA bands. The database and molecular sequencing technology was used to identify and distinguish species of banned plants being sold in Connecticut aquarium retailers. Genetic variation is increasingly recognized as an important factor influencing the establishment and spread of introduced species, and depends on both the introduction history and partitioning of genetic variation within and among potential source populations. Dr. Ch arles Vossbrinck collaborated with Dr. Ryan Thum at Grand Valley State University in Michigan and examined patterns of genetic variation in native and introduced populations of variable leaf watermilfoil, Myriophyllum heterophyllum , using chloroplast (trnL-F) and ribosomal (ITS) sequences, as well as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). They identified a strong phylogeographic break distinguishing populations located on the Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) versus other (''Continental'') portions of the native range. Within these distinct biogeographic regions, they also found genetic variation to be strongly partitioned among populations as analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) partitioned 91 and 75% of cpDNA and ITS diversity among populations, respectively. They demonstrated that the introduced ranges of variable leaf watermilfoil (northeastern and western US) result from multiple independent introductions from a variety of source populations, including lineages from both the ACP and Continental portions of the native range. In addition, they used molecular markers to demonstrate that variable leaf watermilfoil is genetically distinct from three closely related species that it is morphologically similar to. In particular, they demonstrated that M. heterophyllum is clearly distinct from a morphologically similar native species in the western US, M. hippuroides , whose distinctiveness from M. heterophyllum has been questioned, and therefore confirm the introduction of M. heterophyllum in the wes tern US. They also provided the first evidence for hybridization between these two species. Finally, their molecular markers identified previously unrecognized genetic variation in these four species, and therefore demonstrate the need for further taxono mic investigation. 138 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Fig. 4 Geographic distribution of M. heterophyllum ITS genotypes in native and introduced ranges (boxed areas) in the US and northeastern states.

Outreach. We strive to disseminate all information from our program to the public in a timely fashion and educate stakeholders in the identification, prevention and management of invasive aquatic species. Given the magnitude of invasion by non-native aquatic plants, we are making significant efforts to engage citizens, lake associations, and other stakeholders. CAES scientists have organized several workshops on the identification of invasive aquatic plants. We have assembled numerous publications that are freely available in hard copy or electronically via our website (http://www.ct.gov/caes/IAPP ). Included are all publications in downloadable formats, as well as the digitized interactive maps of all surveyed lakes and our complete herbarium. CAES scientists have also given presentations to professional organizations such as the Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society (NEAPMS), the Connect icut Conference on Natural Resources (CCNR), the New England Chapter of the North American Lake Management Society (NEC -NALMS), North American Lake Management Society (NALMS), the Northeast Arc User Group (NEARC) and students groups such as the Connecticut Envirothon. Parasite Research Microsporidia are a group of obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites with small genomes. They infect animals from a wide variety of phyla, including humans. Two manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) genes, designated NbMnSOD1 and NbMnSOD2, were found by Dr. Charles Vossbrinck and colleagues from China to be organized in a tandem array within the Nosema bombycis genome. The genes, both 678 bp in length, were found to be more similar to each other than they are to homologous genes of other Microsporidia, suggesting that the tandem duplication occurred subsequent to the development of this lineage. Reverse transcript PCR shows that mRNA for both genes is present in the spores. Analysis of the primary structure, hydrophobic cluster analysis, target signal analysis, and phylogenetic analysis all indicate that NbMn- SOD1 is dimeric and targeted to the cytosol. NbMnSOD2 seems to have changed more rapidly and is under less evolutionary constraint than NbMnSOD1 suggesting that NbMnSOD2 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 139 may function under different conditions or in different tissues of its host rather than simply resulting in an increase in expression. A phylogenetic analysis of MnSOD sequences from eukaryotes, Archaea, and bacteria shows the microsporidial MnSO Ds to be grouped with the bacteria suggesting a possible horizontal gene transfer. Environmental Chemistry Sorbic acid as a quantitative probe for the formation, scavenging and steady- state concentrations of the triplet-excited state of organic compounds . Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with William Mitch, Yale University. Sorbic acid ( trans,trans -hexadienoic acid) was developed as a probe for the quantification of the formation rate, overall solution scavenging rate and steady -state concentration s of triplet- excited states of organic compounds. The method was validated against literature data for the quenching rate constant of triplet benzophenone by tyrosine obtained by laser flash photolysis and by Stern- Volmer plots of phosphorescence quenching. In contrast to these methods, the probe method does not require knowledge of the optical properties of triplets to monitor their quenching. Moreover, the probe method permits simultaneous quantification of triplet formation, quenching and steady -state concentrations during illumination of complex chromophore mixtures, such as natural organic matter (NOM), with polychromatic light >315 nm. Application of the method to de-aerated Suwannee River NOM illuminated with polychromatic light (315-430 nm) yielded a triplet quantum yield of 0.074, and a self- quenching reaction rate constant between excited triplet SRNOM and SRNOM of 4.34 x 10 mg-C-1 s-1. Effect of Biochar Amendments on Mycorrhizal Associations and Fusarium Crown and Root Rot of Asparagus in Replant Soils. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Dr. Wade Elmer Plant Pathology and Ecology. Pyrolyzed biomass waste, commonly called biochar, has attracted interest as a soil amendment. A commercial prototype biochar produced by fast pyrolysis of hardwood dust was examined in soils to determine if it could reduce the damaging effect of allelopathy on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization and on Fusarium crown and root rot of asparagus. In greenhouse studies, biochar added at 1.5 and 3.0% (wt/wt) to asparagus field soil caused proportional increases in root weights and linear reductions in the percentage of root lesions caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi and F. proliferatum compared with a control . Concomitant with these effects was a 100% increase in root colonization by AM fungi at the 3.0% rate. Addition of aromatic acids (cinnamic, coumaric, and ferulic) that are known allelopathic agents affecting asparagus reduced AM colonization, but the deleterious effects were not observed following the application of biochar at the higher rate. When dried, ground, asparagus root and crown tissues infested with Fusarium spp. were added t o soilless potting mix at 0, 1, or 5 g/liter of potting mix and then planted with asparagus, there was a decrease in asparagus root weight and increase in disease at 1 g/liter of potting mix but results were inconsistent at the higher residue rate. 140 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 However, when biochar was added at 35 g/liter of potting mix (roughly 10%, vol/vol), these adverse effects on root weight and disease were equal to the nontreated controls. A small demonstration was conducted in field microplots. Those plots amended with biocha r (3.5% [wt/wt] soil) produced asparagus plants with more AM colonization in the first year of growth but, in the subsequent year, biochar-treated plants were reduced in size, possibly due to greater than average precipitation and the ability of biochar to retain moisture that, in turn, may have created conditions conducive to root rot. These studies provide evidence that biochar may be useful in overcoming the deleterious effects of allelopathic residues in replant soils on asparagus. Preparation and Characterization of Humic Acid Cross-linked with Organic Bridging Groups. Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Gabriele E. Schaumann, S\u00f6ren Thiele-Bruhn, and Jingdong Mao. Cross-linking of humic substances with organic bridging groups is hypothesized to contribute to the humification of soil organic matter. Model cross -linked humic substances were prepared by cross-linking Amherst soil humic acid by a diepoxide and a polycarboxylic acid in the solid state, applying procedures established for cross -linking of polymers and textile fabrics. Products of the cross-linking reactions were analyzed by FTIR and 13C CPMAS NMR. Physicochemical properties of the products were determined by solubility experiments and thermal analysis. The incorporation of the cross- linker into the matrix of the humic acid by covalent linkages was confirmed by both the disappearance of bands of the reactive functional groups of the cross- linker in the FTIR spectrum and the increase of signals related to the incorporation of the cross-linker into the matrix of the humic acid in the FTIR and 13C-CPMAS-NMR spectra. The formation of covalent ester and ether linkages by the cross- linking reaction was indicated. Water solubilities at pH 6.2 of the cross-linked samples as de termined by UV/Vis spectrometry were reduced compared to controls. Fewer water molecule bridges were formed in the cross-linked samples, which was attributed to a lower number of available functional groups and increased distances between humic acid stran ds caused by the cross-linking molecules. Reduced reactivities of humic acid strands in the cross -linked samples further indicated successful cross- linking. The reactions investigated in this study can be regarded as models for reactions occurring in nat ural soils to test the significance of cross -linking reactions in the humification process of soil organic matter. Speciation of Ionizable Compounds Sorbed on Charcoal Black Carbon: The examples of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids and the Antibiotic, Sulfamethazine . Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Jinzhi Xing, Merc\u00e8 Granados, Jose Beltran, and Jordan Peccia. Charcoal is a form of black carbon from the pyrolysis of biomass. It is a ubiquitous component of soils as a result of natural or deliberate fires, and a number of researchers have suggesting The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 141 adding manufactured charcoal (\"biochar\") to soil to improve soil fertility. Charcoal and black carbon materials in general are t ypically powerful adsorbents of hydrophobic compounds. Adsorption of ionizable compounds by charcoal black carbon poorly understood mechanistically, however. Sulfamethazine [SMT; 4-amino-N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin -2-yl) benzenesulfonamide] is one of the most heavily used antibiotics in animal agriculture. Adsorption of SMT (pK a1 2.28, pK a2 7.42) on a charcoal was determined as a function of concentration, pH, inorganic ions, and organic ions and molecules. SMT displayed unconventional adsorption behavior . Despite its hydrophilic nature (log K OW = 0.27), the distribution ratio Kd at pH 5, where SMT0 prevails, was as high as 106 L/kg, up to 104 times greater than K OC. The Kd decreases at high and low pH, but not commensurate with the decline in KOW of the ionized forms. At pH 1, where SMT+ is predominant and the surface is positive, a major driving force is - electron donor- acceptor interaction of the protonated aniline ring with the -electron rich graphene surface, referred to as +- EDA, rathe r than ordinary electrostatic cation exchange. In the alkaline region, where SMT prevails and the surface is negative, adsorption is accompanied by near-stoichiometric proton exchange with water, leading to the release of OH and formation of an exceptionally strong H-bond between SMT0 and a surface carboxylate or phenolate, classified as a negative charge- assisted H -bond, (-)CAHB. At pH 5, SMT0 adsorption is accompanied by partial proton release and is competitive with trimethylphenylammonium ion, signif ying contributions from SMT+ and/or the zwitterion, SMT\u00b1, which take advantage of +- EDA interaction and coulombic attraction to deprotonated surface groups. In essence, both pK a1 and pK a2 increase, and SMT\u00b1 is stabilized, in the adsorbed relative to the solution state. Allelochemicals are natural compounds exuded by plant roots to act on other plant species, usually for its own benefit. Many allelopathic agents are aromatic carboxylic acids or phenolic acids, which typically have acid dissociation constants (pK a) between 4 and 5, and therefore can exist in the neutral or anion forms in soil depending on pH. We examined the adsorption of the allelochemicals, cinnamic acid and coumaric acid, to different charcoals (biochars ) as part of a study on bioavailability of natural signaling chemicals in soil. Adsorption isotherms in pH 7 buffer, where the AAs are >99% dissociated, are highly nonlinear, give distribution ratios as high as 10 4.8 L/kg, and are insensitive to Ca2+ or Mg2+. In unbuffered media adsorption becomes progressively suppressed with loading and is accompanied by release of OH with a stoichiometry approaching 1 at low concentrations, declining to about 0.4 - 0.5 as the pH rises. Adsorption of cinnamate on graphit e as a model for charcoal was roughly comparable on a surface area basis, but released negligible OH. A novel scheme is proposed that explains the pH dependence of adsorption and OH stoichiometry and the graphite results. In a key step, AA undergoes proton exchange with water. To overcome the unfavorable proton exchange free energy, AA engages in a hydrogen bond recognized to be of unusual strength with a surface carboxylate or phenolate group, [RCO 2...H...O-surf], having a comparable pK a. The same is p ossible for AA, but results in increased surface charge. The proton exchange pathway appears open to other weak acid adsorbates, including humic substances, on carbonaceous materials. 142 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Probing sorption selectivity of neutral organic compounds to organic matter solids through the use of nitroxyl paramagnetic NMR relaxation probes . Dr. Joseph Pignatello in collaboration with Jingdong Mao and Mark A. Chappell. Soil organic matter is composed of lipid, carbohydrate-like, protein- like, lignin -like and black carbon-like functional units. A number of researchers have proposed that environmental contaminants show preferential sorption in soil organic matter depending on the similarity of their structure to the functional unit. For example, an aromatic compound ma y preferentially interact with the lignin -like or black carbon- like units because such units are rich in aromatic functional groups. However, incorrect approaches were used to test this hypothesis and the results have been conflicting. The main objective of this study was to probe at the molecular level the question of whether or not there are preferred sites of sorption of organic compounds to SOM. A novel approach was employed, which involved the use of Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques and nuclear paramagnetic relaxation probes as sorbates. It takes advantage of the spectral changes caused by the highly efficient relaxation afforded by these relaxation probes near the site of sorption. As a result, line-broadening and reduction of spin- lattice relaxation rate are expected. Stable organic nitroxyl free radical relaxation probes of different polarities namely, HTEMPO ( 1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxypiperidine) and TEMPO (2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine -1-oxyl) were used as models for organic compounds. A high organic soil Pahokee Peat and a high organic soft coal Beulah Zap lignite were used as sorbents. In addition, a polystyrene- poly(vinylmethylether), PS -PVME, polymer blend was synthesized and used as an example of an intimate blend of aromatic and aliphatic microdomains. Sorption kinetics revealed that pseudo-equilibrium was for all sorbate -sorbent combination. Sorption isotherms were then constructed with an equilibration time of at least 6 days, and with concentrations spanning at least two orders of magnitude. The isotherms were corrected with respect to probe recovery in order to account for the physisorbed molecules only. After equilibration, samples were freeze dried and analyzed using 13C Cross Polarization/Total Sideband Suppression (CP/TOSS) Solid State NMR and T2 filter. Peak suppression in terms of percent peak area or peak intensity reduction for TEMPO and HTEMPO in Pahokee Peat and Beulah Zap reveals little to no selectivity with the differ ent SOM functional groups based on 13C chemical shift. Electron paramagnetic resonance as well as partition coefficients of TEMPO and HTEMPO between water and different organic compounds (i.e., n-octanol, anisole, toluene, hexadecane, cellulose) was also determined in order to help explain this phenomenon. In conclusion, there is little to no selectivity of probes to SOM on the basis of functional group chemistry. This contradicts previous findings on preferential sorption, which were based on functional group correlations with sorption coefficients, i.e., macroscopic data. Furthermore, there seems to be no preference to the small amount of black carbon present in these SOM samples represented by aromatic region centered at 128 ppm. Thus, the implication of these results is that site selectivity may be due to factors other than functional group composition. This work demonstrates for the first time the use of molecular probes to study sorption specificity. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 143 Soil Testing Testing soil samples for fertility an d suggesting methods for growing better plants are a continuing service for citizens of Connecticut. At the laboratory in New Haven, Greg Bugbee tested 6,100 samples and answered 1,862 related inquiries Impact. The soil testing services and recommendati ons made by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station reduce unnecessary fertilizer treatments to lawns and nursery stock throughout the state. This provides direct economic and environmental benefit to the suburban community by reducing nitrogen runoff into soil and water. 144 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND HORTICULTURE Connecticut's landscape is a quilt of forests, farms, towns, and cities. Scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are studying the factors that influence both forest and farm productivity, including novel specialty crops, grapes, and the effect of the growing deer population on natural and managed landscapes. NEW CROPS PROGRAM Investigation of new crops is essential to provide new opportunities for farmers during a t ime of changing agriculture in Connecticut. Today, about 11,000 acres on 733 farms in Connecticut are devoted to vegetable production with a cash value of 30.2 million dollars. This compares to 19.1 million dollars from 582 farms in 2002. Seventy-nine perc ent of these farms are less than 100 acres in size; sixty- three percent are less than 50 acres in size. With numerous small farms, there is a need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops. In addition, small farm sizes in Connecticut have resulted in marketing shifts from wholesale contracts with local supermarkets to direct retail sales. Approximately 313 farms offer direct sales through roadside stands and sales rooms where a variety of fruit, vegetables, nursery stock, and Christmas tree s are offered. About 36 of these are open all year. Nearly 20% of these farms offer pick-your-own fruit and vegetables to reduce the cost of harvest labor with savings passed on to the consumer. The development of a network of farmers' markets in Connect icut's major urban centers and densely populated suburbs is an important segment of direct sales of vegetables to consumers. All produce sold at farmers' markets must be \"Connecticut Grown\". Farm fresh produce is offered at reasonable prices to urbanites w ho cannot travel to the farms. Niche crops valued by diverse ethnic groups are generally sold at these markets. According to the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, there were 115 farmers' markets in 2010, attended by over 400 farmers compared to 87 mar kets in 2007, a 32% increase. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 145 As the popularity of farmers' markets in Connecticut have surged, so too has the need for growers to find a diversity of high value niche crops. Consumers used to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in large supermarkets are seeking a greater diversity of ethnic and specialty crops at farmers' markets and roadside stands. A recent survey of vegetable growers by The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station showed that over 70 vegetable crops are currently being grown in Connecticut. Since 1982, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has been investigating specialty crops to provide new opportunities for Connecticut's farmers. Over 40 fruits and vegetables have been studied resulting in over 50 public ations. Results are also communicated to growers at meetings and farm visits. Some of the crops studied in the New Crops Program include globe artichoke, Belgian endive, radicchio, heirloom tomatoes, sweet potatoes, specialty melons, okra, and tomatillos. Research included variety trials and experiments to determine the best cultural methods for growing each specific crop in Connecticut. Crops that were chosen have a high market value and an existing or expanding market that would readily accommodate these commodities. Pak Choi Trials : From 2000 to 2006, the Asian population in Connecticut grew 42%. This and other ethnic groups wish to continue consumption of vegetables that are customarily in their diets, thereby giving farmers opportunities for production of crops with a ready market. Ethnic vegetables also appeal to high-end buyers for whom ethnic vegetables are not every day fare, but who enjoy gourmet produce and culinary variety. Many farmers wish to diversify their operations by growing ethnic vege tables, but there is little information on the culture of these vegetables in Connecticut. It is important that cultural techniques for these vegetables be adapted to Connecticut's soils and climate. In 2010, Dr. Abigail Maynard evaluated 12 different varieties of pak choi on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. The average yield at Windsor (sandy terrace soil) was 20.2 T/A compared to 16.7 T/A at Lockwood Farm (loamy upland soil). IMPACT : In spring, Joi Choi (27.8 T/A) and Canton Long (17.6 T/A ) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $0.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of $55,044/acre. Many cultivars (All 146 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Seasons, Canton Short, Dwarf Green Petiole, Green Boy, Mei Qing Choi, Summer Boy, and Summer Flavor) bolted at both sites in the spring and were unmarketable. A farmer growing these cultivars in the spring would have had a crop failure resulting in no income. Most Connecticut farmers are now growing the cultivar Joi Choi. In fall, Win Win Choi (20.3 T/A) and Joi Choi (17.2 T/A) had the greatest yields with a potential crop value of $40,194/acre. The long- term benefits include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. Thirty-five percent of Connecticut's vegetable growers answering our su rvey are currently growing pak choi. Vegetable Amaranth Trials: Vegetable Amaranth (Callaloo) is an annual that is native to central Mexico. In Asia and the West Indies, amaranth is widely used in soup. Although it is relatively unknown as a vegetable crop in the United States, it has traditionally been cultivated throughout the humid tropics and is consumed extensively in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. The greens are of considerable nutritional value being high in calcium, magnesium, iron, vitamins A and C as well as protein. In 2010, Dr. Maynard evaluated 8 vegetable amaranth cultivars at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. IMPACT: All Red (3.5 lbs/plant), Red Stripe Leaf (3.4 lbs/plant), Green Round Leaf (3.2 lbs/plant), and Green Pointed Leaf (3.2 lbs/plant) averaged the greatest yields. At a retail price of $0.99/lb, there is a potential crop value of $33,541/acre. High yields of a quality product will benefit local growers and consumers by providing revenue for farmers, a nutritious food for consumers, and preservation of farmland. A grower in Bloomfield now supplies a local school system with his crop of vegetable amaranth. Personal- sized Watermelons Trials: The newest melons on the marketplace are seedless miniature \"personal\" watermelons, weighing 3 -7 pounds each. Personal- sized watermelons offer an at tractive alternative for small families or for consumers that have limited refrigerator space. Beside a smaller size, they also have a thinner rind, which reduces waste. In addition, researchers have found that lycopene and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 147 beta-carotene contents are abund ant in personal-sized watermelons. Lycopene, an antioxidant, has been linked to the possible prevention of cancer and heart disease. In 2010, Dr. Maynard evaluated for yield and quality seven cultivars of personal sized seedless watermelon at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. Unlike larger watermelons, personal- sized watermelons are sold by the melon, not by the pound. Therefore, estimated yields were measured in number of personal sized fruit per acre. Bravo (16,498 fruit/acre and Mielhart (14,236 fruit/acre) ave raged the greatest yields at both sites. Bravo (11.6) averaged the highest Brix values (sugar content). IMPACT : Twenty-four percent of vegetable growers responding to our survey grow personal- sized watermelons. By growing the cultivar Bravo instead of the standard cultivar Vanessa, a grower can produce over 10,100 more personal- sized watermelons per acre. At $4.99 retail price/fruit, the grower would potentially gross almost $50,400 more per acre by growing Bravo instead Vanessa. If the oversized (>7 lbs) p umpkins are sold for $0.49/lb, the grower can potentially gross over $103,600/acre by growing Bravo compared to $45,000/A by growing Vanessa. The long -term benefits of growing personal- sized watermelon include additional revenue for farmers and providing a product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume watermelon. Sweet Potato Trials: A 1998 Connecticut Department of Agriculture survey showed that sweet potato is one of the most popular specialty vegetables. Sweet potatoes are called yam in the south, but both are identical species. North Carolina and Louisiana are the leading producers in the United States, but we have found that they can easily be grown in Connecticut. This crop has both a high market value and an expanding market. In addition, it is very nutritious, with high values of beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamin C. In 2010, Dr. Maynard evaluated several cultivars that have short maturities (90 days) at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. IMPAC T: Beauregard and Covington averaged the greatest yields (3.3 lbs/plant) with both O'Henry and Jewels averaging 3.0 lbs/plant. At a retail price of $0.79/lb, there is a potential crop value of $37,854/acre. Beauregard is the most popular cultivar grown in Connecticut with forty- one percent of the surveyed vegetable growers including sweet potatoes at their farms. The long- term benefits of growing sweet potatoes include additional revenue for farmers and providing a 148 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 product that has growing consumer demand. In addition, there may be health benefits for those who consume sweet potatoes. Edamame Trials: Edamame are specialty varieties of soybeans that are harvested in the green stage. The word \"edamame\" means \"beans on branches\" and it grows in clusters on bushy branches. Edamame is consumed as a snack, a vegetable dish, used in soups or processed into sweets. As a snack, the pods are lightly boiled in salted water, and then the seeds are squeezed directly from the pods into the mouth with the fingers. Outside East Asia, edamame is most often found in Japanese restaurants and some Chinese restaurants, but it has also found popularity elsewhere as a health food. In 2010, Dr. Maynard evaluated ten cultivars of edamame for yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. IMPACT : The cultivar Sunrise had the greatest yield (0.71 lbs pods/plant). At a retail pric e of $2.49/lb, there is potential crop value of over $38,500/acre. By growing the cultivar Sunrise instead of the cultivar Beer Friend, the grower can potentially produce almost 12,000 more pounds per acre or gross almost $9,000 more per acre. The long- term benefits include additional revenue for farmers, especially those who attend farmers markets in urban areas. Five percent of the Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now growing edamame. Specialty Pumpkin Trials: The predominant market for pumpkins is for jack-o'- lantern types (12 - 20 lbs). However, small pumpkins are often needed for operations specializing in school tours where each child receives a pumpkin to take home. Smooth pumpkins are preferred for painting or coloring. Specialty pumpkins come in a wide range of colors and color combinations including white, pale green, tan, burnt orange, and yellow. Shape also varies from the ideal round, to squatty with a flattened or concave top, to oval, to tall and elongated. In 2010, Dr. Maynard evaluated the yield and quality of 12 varieties of specialty pumpkins at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. IMPACT : Moonshine (12.2 fruit/plant), Gooligan (8.7 fruit/plant), Hooligan (8.0 fruit/plant), and Apprentis (6.8 fruit/plant) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $1.00/pumpkin, there is a potential crop value of $35,429/acre. Sixty- eight percent of Connecticut vegetable farmers responding to our survey are now including some of these cultivars in addition to growing Jack- The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 149 O-Lanterns. The long-term benefits of growing specialty pumpkins include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farmers markets or have their own roadside stands. Specialty Eggplant Trials: Eggplants are a botanically diverse group that can be divided into two types based on fruit shape and color. The first, more traditional type, is the teardrop-shaped, large-fruited eggplant. Fruit of these eggplants are typically oval or long, and tapered in shape with a black, purplish-black, or purple skin color, often with a green calyx. The second type is collectively referred to as the \"specialty\" eggplants, some of which are referred to as \"Asian\" eggplants. Asian eggplants generally have a purple calyx. Fruit shapes of specialty eggplants vary, but are often long and smooth, ball- or bell-shaped. In 2010, Dr. Maynard evaluated 10 varieties of specialty eggplants on yield and quality at Windsor and Lockwood Farm. IMPACT : Hansel (18 lbs/plant), Ichiban (13 lbs/plant), and Fairy Tale (13 lbs/plant) had the greatest yields. At a retail price of $1.49/lb, there is a potential crop value of $97,357/acre. The cost of producing ethnic eggplant varieties at the UMass Research Farm was estimated to be $6,000/acre. Based on this information, the total net receipts for Hansel grown at the UMass Research Farm would have exceeded $90,000/acre. The long- term benefits of growing specialty eggplant include an additional product and revenue for growers who attend farme rs markets or have their own roadside stands. SHEET COMPOSTING OF OAK AND MAPLE LEAVES Many municipalities in Connecticut with leaf collection programs in the fall are turning to farmers to dispose of their leaves. However, not all farmers have extra land to set aside for a standard composting operation. Instead, they layer undecomposed leaves on their fields and simply plow them under. This is called sheet composting. Nitrogen deficiency can be a problem in these soils because microorganisms involved in leaf decomposition use nitrogen more efficiently than plants. There is some question whether the differences in the rates of decomposition between oak and maple leaves would lead to differences in plant response when these leaves are used in a sheet compost ing operation. This is also a situation that confronts many home gardeners who have a predominance of oaks in their backyards. To help answer this question, Dr. Maynard conducted a sheet composting experiment in which plots were amended with either all oak or all maple leaves. Undecomposed leaves were layered about 6 inches thick in the falls of 1994-2009 and incorporated into the soil by rototilling. Last year, lettuce, eggplant, and onions were grown with all plots receiving the same amount (1300 lb/A) of 10-10-10 fertilizer. Yields from plots amended with oak leaves were compared to plots amended with maple leaves and the unamended controls. In 2010, lettuce yields from plots amended with oak or maple leaves were slightly greater (1.2 lbs/head) compared to yields from 150 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 the unamended control plots (1.0 lbs/head). The greatest eggplant yields were from the unamended control plots (11.6 lbs/plant) followed by plots amended with oak leaves (10.8 lbs/plant) and maple leaves (10.6 lbs/plant). The greatest onion y ields were from the plots amended with oak leaves (9.0 lbs/10 ft row) followed by the control plots (8.7 lbs/10 ft row) and plots amended with maple leaves (6.2 lbs/10 ft row). IMPACT : Many Connecticut homeowners are now disposing of their oak and maple le aves in their gardens without worrying about any deleterious effects on yields in their vegetable gardens. Incorporating tree leaves into gardens improves the environment by storing carbon in the soil and reducing the volume of material in the solid waste collection and disposal system. VITICULTURE Winegrape growers and Farm Wineries in Connecticut face many challenges. Farm Wineries are required to grow a minimum of 25% of the fruit used in their total output, but are having trouble meeting this standard . Consecutive very cold winters in 2003 and 2004, as well as in 2009 and 2011 resulted in significant plant loss on less cold hardy cultivars. These losses drove up prices for Connecticut grown fruit. Little information has been available to growers regarding cultural information for growing more cold hardy and disease resistant cultivars in the state. Growers of traditional cultivars require more information on crop regulation and fruit quality. Disease management is critical during the growing season due to Connecticut's warm, humid summers. The industry requires increased productivity via better management practices in existing vineyards and improved cultivar selection in newly planted vineyards. Innovative practices need to be tested in Connecticut to assess their viticultural and economic appropriateness. Winegrapes: Studies initiated by Dr. William R. Nail from 2004-2011 are helping determine profitable cultural practices for growing high quality winegrapes in Connecticut. The winegrape industry in Connecticut is one of the most rapidly expanding categories of agriculture in the state. The first Farm Winery opened in 1979, and there are currently over 30 wineries with a Farm Winery license, with two or three more scheduled to open each year in the foreseeable future. The existence of these wineries adds substantially to local economies, as local restaurants, hotels, bed and breakfasts, and other establishments receive increased business due to their proximity. The Connecticut The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 151 Wine Trail brochure, published by the Connecticut Vineyard and Winery Association, is the most popular brochure in Department of Touris m travel offices. Effects of graft union height: Freeze damage to grafted grapevines frequently occurs at the graft union, which is typically very close (one to two inches) to the ground. Crown gall, caused by Agrobactium vitis , is a devastating and often lethal disease of grapevines, and frequently occurs on severely freeze-damaged vines, although symptoms may not appear for one or two years after the freeze event. Elevating the height of the graft union may result in less injury. Chardonnay clone 96 budwood was grafted onto 3309C rootstock at standard height and 26 inches higher in 2006, and vines were transplanted in spring 2007 to vineyards at Lockwood Farm and Westport, Massachusetts. Temperature data loggers have been installed at both graft union heights to monitor differences in temperature at the graft unions. Vines have been evaluated for bud fruitfulness, winter freeze damage, and crown gall incidence and severity beginning in 2008. Yield and fruit quality were evaluated beginning in 2009. In the absence of snow cover, daily minimum temperatures averaged 0.5 to1.5 \u00baC higher at the higher graft union level. While no significant differences in crown gall incidence or severity have been observed in the experimental vineyards, the high grafted vines have been more economical to manage, as their single straight trunks are less susceptible to inadvertent tractor and herbicide damage. High grafted vines had a high potential to yield high quality fruit during their second year after transplanting, while low grafted vines would traditionally have had no yield. This potential yield of fruit, estimated at $2,000 per ton, would offset the increased cost production of the high grafted vines. IMPACT : Vines with crown gall typically require replacement. High -grafted vines may result in significant reduction in such losses, which would be approximately $2,150 per acre plus labor for each 10% of vine mortality. Cultural practices in Vitis vinifera: Dr. Nail established a planting of 288 Pinot Gris vines at Lockwood Farm in summer, 2004. Two different rootstocks were used: 3309C, the most commonly planted rootstock in the state, and 101-14, which may tend to ripen fruit earlier and have better tolerance to severe winter freezes. Vines grafted to 101 -14 had 32% less mortality caused by winter freeze damage than those grafted to 3309C following their first winter. Crown gall in subsequent years has been slightly higher in 3309C vines. There were no significant differences in productivity or fruit quality between rootstocks without crown gall through the 2010 growing season. 152 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 IMPACT: Planting on rootstocks more resistant to winter damage can result in savings of $7.60 for each year of lost production per vine, plus $3.75 replacement cost per vine plus labor involved in removing diseased vines and replanting Training and pruning effects on vine performance of hybrid cultivars: Grapevines in most older vineyards in Connecticut were planted on six foot spacing and trained to a vertically shoot positioned system. This has generally worked well for most vinifera cultivars and some hybrids. Many recently released hybrid cultivars that are rapidly finding favor have different growth habits that make them unsuitable for this traditional spacing and training. Within-row spacing of grapevines in the vineyard is one of the most critical decisions to be made at planting. Too close spacing results in excessive competition and excessive vegetative growth, leading to reduced yields of poor quality fruit. Spacing that is too far apart resul ts in unproductive utilization of valuable vineyard space. The choice of spacing is permanent. However, errors made at planting can sometimes be partially remedied by dividing the canopy to accommodate vine growth. Divided canopies can increase yield per u nit of linear row length, but are more difficult and labor -intensive to establish and maintain. To evaluate spacing and training systems for new cultivars, Dr. Nail established a new planting of the hybrid cultivars St. Croix and Cayuga White in May, 2005 at a private commercial vineyard in Wallingford. These cultivars are among the most popular hybrids for new plantings. They have different growth habits and management issues than vinifera cultivars, which involve fundamental issues both before and after planting. Plants of both cultivars were planted at six and eight foot spacings, and were trained to four different training systems beginning in 2009: Vertically Shoot Positioned (VSP), Hudson River Umbrella (HRU), Geneva Double Curtain (GDC), and Scott Henry. Those on six foot spacing will also be pruned to both cane and cordon systems in future years. The data collected to date suggest that the vertically divided Scott Henry system was most productive in the first year of full production, while the horizontally divided Geneva Double Curtain was the most productive in the second and third years. However, divided canopies require more intensive management than single canopies. Data were collected beginning in 2010 to determine the relative cost of maintaining these different training systems. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 153 IMPACT : The results of this study will allow both new and existing growers to help maximize their production, as well as possibly demonstrating that some systems are not efficient in Connecticut. This will assist growers in determining if the increased yields per linear unit of row will justify the additional labor and supply costs of divided canopy systems. Pruning systems: Most grapevines in Connecticut have traditionally been cane pruned. Cane pruning requires skilled labor, which is increasingly in short supply. Spur pruning to a cordon system requires less skilled labor and lends itself to mechanization. A planting of the hybrid cultivars Cayuga White and St. Croix, both trained to four different training systems, was established in 2005. Beginning in 2011, vines on six-foot spacing were pruned to either cane or cordon (spur) pruning to compare the relative efficiencies of these pruning methods. Yield and fruit quality parameters will be determined beginning in the 201 1 harvest season, and will continue for at least three more years. IMPACT : Cordon pruning is a viable alternative to the cane pruning method used in most Connecticut vineyards. Skilled labor costs, essential to cane pruning, are approximately 30% higher than unskilled labor costs. Of equal importance is the increasing unavailability of skilled labor. Over the course of a previous experiment on hybrid grapevines, there were no differences in yield, fruit quality, or any measured vegetative parameters measu red between cane and cordon pruned vines. Therefore, cordon pruning can reduce pruning costs by approximately 30% for growers. Cultivar and clonal evaluation: Beginning in 2004, Dr. Nail evaluated previously established experimental plots at Lockwood Farm and a private grower's vineyard in Shelton. The results of these trials have been published in station bulletins. New cultivar trials were established at Lockwood Farm and the Valley Laboratory in spring, 2008, in conjunction with the national project \"NE -1020: Multistate Evaluation of Winegrape Cultivars and Clones\". This project involves over 50 scientists from over 30 states, allowing for evaluation of regional comparisons of vegetative and fruit qualities. The planting at Lockwood Farm is the third largest planting in the Eastern United States. Both plantings contain established cultivars with documented characteristics, as well as unreleased and untested cultivars whose performance in Connecticut are unknown. Data collection on these vines began with pruning data in spring 2010, and will continue for several years. Experimental wines will be made from selected cultivars at the Enology laboratory at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station at Geneva and evaluated for wine chemistry and sensory qualities beginning in 2011. IMPACT: The NE -1020 plots will provide Connecticut growers with valuable information on the suitability of new cultivars if and when they are released. Viticultural and fruit quality characteristics are important when a new cultivar is introduced into a region. The results of these 154 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 trials will allow growers to make informed decisions as to the selection of appropriate new cultivars and their cultural requirements. Rootstock effects on red Bordeaux winegrapes : The effects of the roots tocks C.3309 and SO4 on vegetative and fruit quality parameters were evaluated on the red Bordeaux cultivars Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot from 2004-2010 at a commercial vineyard in Shelton, CT. IMPACT: Vines grafted to SO4 had higher yields in 2004 and 2007 due to more clusters per vine, and had slightly better fruit quality in 2005 and 2006. There were no subsequent differences between the two rootstocks, suggesting that, except for slightly increased yield and possible fruit quality earl y in the life of a vine, the differences between the two rootstocks were negligible . The value of the forest to Connecticut is much more than the timber and other forest products. First and foremost, forests protect watersheds, aquifers and groundwater supplies that provide the bulk of our clean drinking water. Trees can also provide air pollution control, acting as giant filters to remove dust, particulates, and some airborne chemicals. In addition, trees cool our environment in the summer by recycling water and reflecting sunlight. Forests contribute to the character of Connecticut add to our enjoyment throughout the year. CROP -TREE MANAGEMENT The unbalanced age class distribution of the oak-hickory forest, and most individual forest stands, presents a challenge to both private and public forest landowners wishing to implement sustainable forest management. Three factors are driving the necessity of developing innovative alternatives to \"high -grading\" or initiating regeneration harvests in these stands: obtaining a more balanced age- structure, increased public desire for partial cutting, and increased parcelization of ownership. Crop-tree management has been proven successful in younger oak stands and could be a viable alternative in older oak sawtimber stands where maintaining high forest cover and non- commodity attributes are important considerations. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 155 In 2003, Dr. Jeffrey Ward began a study to determine if crop tree management would increase growth of large, mature oak sawtimber (> 18 inches diameter) w ithout a loss in bole quality and stand growth rates in cooperation with CT DEEP- Division of Forestry, Metropolitan District Commission, and Torrington Water Company. The four oak management study areas were in Hartland, Hamden, West Hartford, and Winchest er. Each study area had three 0.62 -acre treatment plots: B -level thinning (traditional forest thinning), crop tree, and unmanaged. Each plot was located within a 3 - to 5-acre area with similar treatment. The mature red oak sawtimber stands had no prior management and were 80 to 112 years old; upper canopy oaks averaged 17.2 inches in diameter at breast height. All trees larger than 4 inches were permanently numbered and measured annually for 5 years. Basal area was reduced from 138 ft 2/acre prior to harvest to 77 and 72 ft2/acre on the B -level and crop tree management plots, respectively. For all size classes combined, basal area growth over the next 5 years was greatest in the crop tree plots, followed by B-level thinning, and finally unmanaged controls. Concurrently, sawtimber basal area growth did not differ among treatments and averaged 1.3 ft 2/acre/year, suggesting management can maintain stand volume growth rates. Relative to 5 -yr diameter growth of upper canopy oaks on unmanaged plots (0.9 inches), diameter growth increased by 29 percent on B-level thinning and 54 percent on crop tree management plots to 1.1 and 1.3 inches, respectively. Diameter growth increase was related to degree of crown release. Completely released trees grew more than partially r eleased trees, which in turn grew more than trees that were not released. IMPACT: Crop -tree release provides a management tool to develop stands with a balanced age structure in public forests and for private forest owners for whom high forest cover and non- commodities attributes are important considerations. Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Forestry Division incorporated this research in the 96 acres of TSI treatment during 2009-2010. Ninety percent of 120 attendees to a crop tree management webinar who collectively manage 1.3 million acres reported a moderate or significant knowledge change. Sixty- five of the attendees indicated that they will increase or implement components of crop tree management on stands within over 630,000 acres from Maine to Montana and from Mississippi to Maryland. In addition, they will take the following actions [annotated list]: \"promote oak tree crop tree release, increase acreage under crop tree management (agency personnel); include Jeff's research in my s ilviculture class, emphasize crop tree management more in workshops (educators); apply crop tree release to more acres, modify recommendations I make to landowners, release on 4 sides in crop tree release (foresters); implement the crop tree concept on my acreages, actively manage my black birch, more aggressive (e.g. 4 sided) crop tree release (woodland owners).\" 156 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 FOREST DYNAMICS Disturbances to different canopy strata can have both short (<10 years) and long term (>20 years) effects on stand composition and structure. Most research has focused on short-term responses to disturbances, including forest management, as there are few published studies spanning more than a decade on the hardwood forest dynamics. Studying the trajectory of species composition and stand structure for periods longer than a decade is important because predictions based on short-term observations may, or may not, be accurate. The Old-Series plots, established in 1926-27, provided a unique opportunity to document the effect of how d ifferent types of disturbance influence forest composition. Originally established to study the relationship between species and soil characteristics; these plots have chronicled slow, inexorable natural dynamics of Connecticut's second- growth forests. During the summer of 2007 Dr. Ward completed the eighth inventory of The Old-Series plots. The four plots were located in stands typical of Connecticut's forests, i.e., stands which originated around the turn of the century, partly on land abandoned from agriculture and partly on land repeatedly cut for timber or fuelwood. The location, species, diameter, and crown classes of all woody stems > 0.5 inches dbh (diameter at 4.5 feet) were recorded on 13 acres of strip transects. Transects were measured at 10-yr intervals between 1927 and 2007, except for 1947, and includes records of 35,953 stems. The objective of this research was to compare the effects of three distinct disturbance regimes (wildfire, repeated multi-year defoliations, and single- year defoli ations) on forest composition and regeneration. Disturbances included a wildfire in 1932, single-year defoliations (1964, 1972, 1981), and multi-year defoliation episodes (1961-1963, 1971-1972, 1981). Wildfire reduced basal area by 46 percent. During the f irst defoliation period, oak basal area mortality averaged 36 (multi-year) and 12 percent (single-year). In 2007, oak density (stems per acre) on burned transects in 2007 was twice that observed on unburned transects, 90 and 42; while maple density was hig her on transects that had had only single-year defoliations (190) compared with multi- year defoliation (119). In contrast, birch density was lower on transects with single-year defoliations (97) compared to multi-year defoliation (198). Oak ingrowth was highest following wildfire, 244 stems per acre per decade (SA 10), and was negligible during subsequent decades, 6 SA 10. Transects with multi-year defoliations averaged 80 birch SA10 compared with 44 maple SA 10 between 1967-1997. During that same period, maple ingrowth averaged 35 SA 10 and birch The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 157 ingrowth 14 SA 10 following single -year defoliations. Disturbance type has a long -term impact on forest composition. Our observations indicate that maintaining oak will require active management, such as prescribed burning, mowing, or herbicide to allow development of oak regeneration competitive with maple, beech, and birch prior to a disturbance that removes the upper canopy. Partial cutting and other disturbance similar to multi-year defoliation episodes benefit non-oak species and should be minimalized in stands where management objectives include maintaining an oak component. Until there is change towards more active management and less partial cutting, oak will continue to decline and these forests will become incre asingly dominated by more mesophytic species. As with the shift from chestnut to oak forests in the early 1900's, the emergence of a forest dominated by mesophytic hardwoods will alter the economic, ecological, and esthetic values of the forest. The consequences of these changes will last well into the 21st century. Historically, oak has been more economically valuable than maple and birch for its higher price, lower cull rates, and higher per acre volume growth. The shift from oak will also affect many wildlife and insect populations - discriminating against those species dependent on oak and favoring those species associated with maple and birch. Changes in esthetic values are important because of increased public utilization of the forested landscape for both home sites and recreation. The leaves and flowers of maple and birch are more colorful than oak. However, faster growing oaks and pines are more likely to have the \"big tree\" characteristics that the public associates with mature forests. POTENTIAL IM PACT: The quality and variety of forest resources available to future generations depend on the dynamics of forest composition. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, in cooperation with CT DEP-Division of Forestry and local non- profit organizations, is examining forest dynamics in four unmanaged forests. This research will allow managers of forest preserves to make more precise predictions of compositional change. Findings from the research on natural change have been disseminated via thirteen media interviews and over talks and field tours. JAPANESE BARBERRY CONTROL Two major threats to natural preserves and managed forests are exotic plant species and browsing by overabundant white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). Therefore, scientists in the Department of Forestry and Horticulture are examining both effects of these two threats, and possible strategies to minimize their impacts and thereby enhance forest ecosystem services. Japanese barberry is listed as invasive in 20 states and 4 Canadian provinces and is associated with enhanced population densities of blacklegged ticks that can transmit the causal agent of Lyme disease. Drs. Jeffrey Ward and Scott Williams continued their studies of alternative methods to control Japanese barberry, which began in 2006. This research both evaluated the effectiveness and relative costs 158 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 among treatment combinations to control Japanese barberry, and by monitoring individual clumps across a range of size classes, assessed whether treatment prescriptions are dependent on clump size. The barberry control study now includes 149 plots at 28 study areas that has examined 55 treatment/timing options. This year we will highlight two studies: one that examined treating barberry with directed heating using propane torches and another that examined barberry control during the dormant season with herbicides. Propane study : In 2008, we began a study to examine effectiveness of directed heating using 400,000 BTU backpack propane torches to control Japanese barberry infestations at study areas in Redding and North Branford. This was a collaborative study with the Propane Education and Research Council, South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority, Aquari on Water Company, The Nature Conservancy, and CT-DEP, Division of Forestry. Each study area had eight 0.62 acre plots. Treatment combinations included a pre-leafout or post-leafout initial treatment with propane torches to reduce the size of established clumps and an early (late June), mid (early July), or late (late July) follow -up treatment to kill sprouts that developed from surviving root crowns. All treatment combinations were equally effective and reduced barberry abundance (a surrogate for cover) fr om 31% prior to treatment to only 0.5% the following autumn, i.e., a 98% reduction. All treatment combinations were also equally effective in reducing the size of surviving barberry to an average of only 4 inches compared with 29 inches for untreated clumps. Estimated labor costs using propane torches for both initial and follow-up treatment was 1.0 hour/acre for every 1% pretreatment abundance; e.g., 10 hours for a 1-acre stand with 10% abundance. Because timing of initial treatments (pre-leafout vs. post-leafout) and follow- up treatment (early, mid, late) were equally effective in reducing Japanese barberry abundance and height of surviving stems, initial treatments can be completed from March-June and follow- up treatments can be completed from June- August in southern New England. For habitat restoration projects on properties where herbicide use is restricted, directed heating with propane torches provides a non- chemical alternative that can effectively control invasive Japanese barberry Dormant season treatments : In 2008, we began a study in Mansfield to examine the efficacy of treating barberry infestations during the dormant season (Oct- Mar). Our earlier research has shown that effective barberry control can be accomplished from late spring through early autumn by a variety of chemical methods. This was a collaborative study with the Town of Mansfield and USDA-NRCS. Dormant season techniques included basal spray (triclopyr in oil) and clearing saw cutting with a 'wetblade' application of triclopyr. Dorma nt season techniques were compared with a glyphosate foliar spray during the growing season (Sept). Foliar application resulted in a greater reduction of barberry cover than basal spray and wetblade treatments during The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 159 the dormant season, 94, 84, and 74 perc ent reductions, respectively. Treatment effectiveness did not differ among months for either of the dormant season techniques. Labor costs did not differ among techniques - averaging 0.13 hours/acre/percent cover; i.e., 3.9 hours for a 1- acre stand with 30% barberry abundance. There was a large difference among treatments in amount of herbicide applied: 0.6, 1.4, and 2.8 ounces/acre/percent cover for wetblade clearing saw, foliar spray, and basal spray applications, respectively. While not as effective as f oliar spraying, wetblade clearing saw and basal spray applications provide an opportunity to control barberry during the dormant season. Additionally, the wetblade clearing saw technique can reduce the amount of applied herbicide. IMPACT: To improve drinking water quality and reduce the risk of exposure to Lyme disease, water companies in Connecticut (Aquarion), Rhode Island (Providence Water), and Massachusetts (MDC) initiated or expanded their invasive control management efforts during the past year on nearly 150 acres. CT -DEEP, Forestry has expanded their efforts to control invasives by treating 6.5 acres in 2011. Land trusts that have continued or initiated barberry control include Aspetuck, Guilford, Haddam, Joshua, Lyme, and Salem. Over 96% of 128 at tendees to a barberry control webinar who collectively managed 2.2 million acres reported a moderate or significant knowledge change. In addition, they will take the following actions [annotated list]: educate public, promote more invasive species control (agency personnel); discuss issue in management seminars, share information with landowners (educators); start barberry eradication program for several clients, work at reducing more exotics, modify approach and techniques used to manage exotic (foresters) ; step up barberry control, kill all barberry on 40 acres, burn barberry as opposed to mechanically pulling it out, press adjoining neighbors to control their invasives (woodland owners). THE LINK BETWEEN INVASIVES AND LYME DISEASE Refuge for Blacklegged Ticks: In many Connecticut forests with an overabundance the dominant understory shrub. This exotic invasive shrub provides habitat favorable to blacklegged tick determine mouse and larval tick abundances at six replicate sites, Dr. Williams has been trapping mice since 2007 in unmanipulated dense barberry infestations, areas where b arberry was controlled, and areas where barberry was minimal or absent. The number of feeding larval ticks/mouse was recorded. Adult and nymphal ticks were sampled along permanent draglines within each 160 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 treatment area, retained, and were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi , the causal agent of Lyme disease in humans and pets. To date, there have been 1,225 captured white-footed mice. The number of captured mice did not differ between treatments. However, the average number of feeding larval ticks per mouse was highest on mice captured in dense barberry (6.3 larvae/mouse). Adult tick densities in dense barberry (125/acre) were higher than in both controlled barberry (64/acre) and no barberry (21/acre) areas. barberry infes tations and controlled barberry areas had similar infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi , 52 and 53% respectively. Adult tick infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi varied widely between treatments and study areas, but was lowest in areas where barberry was absent and generally lower where barberry was controlled. This in concert with the overall reduction in the adult tick cohort in areas where barberry was controlled resulted in 113 B. burgdorferi - infected ticks/acre in dense barberry, 49/acre where b arberry was controlled, and 12/acre where barberry was absent. Results indicate that managing Japanese barberry will have a positive effect on public health by reducing the number of B. burgdorferi infected blacklegged ticks that can develop into motile life stages that commonly feed on humans. Mouse trapping and tick sampling efforts will continue for several more years to monitor long terms effects of controlling Japanese barberry. Impact: This research is not only of interest from an ecological perspective, but also serves to scientifically document the potential negative impacts an invasive plant can have on human health. This research has been featured on gardening websites and multiple forest land managers have used it to strengthen their argument for the increased need to control invasive plants. Results from this research will lead to improved interest in the control of invasives, and ultimately, a reduction in the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme disease in humans and domesticated animals. Various entities within the towns of Redding, Weston, Easton, Guilford, Greenwich, Hampton, Mansfield, and Coventry and in the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York have used these results in part to justify equipment purchase and initiate or reinvigorate invasive plant control programs. Additionally, numerous towns in Connecticut as well as the states of Delaware The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 161 and Maryland and the Province of British Columbia have used our research linking deer and invasive plants to scientifically justify their respective deer management programs. The Japanese Barberry Infestation Microclimate : In spring 2008, two additional Japanese barberry management plots were established in Redding and North Branford, CT. Each plot was approximately 5 acres in size an d Japanese barberry was controlled by Drs. Williams and Ward and J. P. Barsky using 400,000 BTU propane torches. This control strategy differs from previous efforts in that dead Japanese barberry plants remained standing instead of being removed altogether. We hypothesized that dense Japanese barberry infestations may retain humidity, resulting in increased abundances of blacklegged ticks, which require stable and humid conditions to survive. Therefore, temperature/relative humidity sensors were deployed from June-December 2008, 2009, 2010, again in 2011 in areas where barberry was controlled, areas where barberry was not controlled, and areas where barberry was virtually absent. In addition, blacklegged ticks and white-footed mice have been continually sampled during sensor deployment. Sensor data analysis from 2008-2010 has revealed that unmanaged Japanese barberry infestations provide excellent habitat for blacklegged tick survival because, due to their closed canopy -like growth form, they retain more of the humidity from the previous night throughout the following day than do areas where barberry was controlled or absent. Additionally, the Japanese barberry canopy buffers temperature and relative humidity swings throughout the day, providing a more stabl e microclimate than areas where barberry was controlled or absent. Because blacklegged ticks have a high surface area to volume ratio, they are prone to desiccation, and as a result, need a continually humid and stable microclimate to survive, which the ex otic invasive Japanese barberry appears to provide. Sensors will be retrieved at the end of 2011 and ticks and mice will continue to be sampled. Impact: This research investigates the causal mechanism behind the increased abundances of blacklegged ticks found in Japanese barberry 162 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 infestations. By understanding this relationship, land managers can better target problem areas where Japanese barberry is most prevalent, which will ultimately lead to a reduction in the number of ticks capable of causing Lyme dis ease in humans and domesticated animals. DEER DAMAGE STUDIES Deer Browse Exclosure Study : One method to study the impact of deer on natural ecosystems is to compare growth rates and species diversity of vegetation protected from white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ) browse to unprotected plots. Drs. Williams and Ward are collecting vegetation data within sixteen deer exclosures and sixteen adjacent control plots throughout the state. Deer exclosures prevent deer from accessing vegetation within. Growth rates and species diversity of enclosed vegetation are compared with that of an adjacent control plot, where deer have access to vegetation. The project is a collaborative effort with The Nature Conservancy to maintain and sample twelve deer exclo sures (and adjacent control plots), at Burnham Brook Preserve in East Haddam, the Bingham Easement in Salem, and Devil's Den Preserve in Weston. We are also including four of our own exclosures on South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority property in North Branford. Plots have been sampled for herbaceous species cover in spring of 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Late summer sampling was conducted in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 and included all woody and herbaceous plants. Preliminary data analyses indicate that herbaceous cover within exclosures is greater than control plots. Density of tree seedlings at least two feet tall is twice as high within exclosures compared to control plots. All locations will be resampled for both woody and herbaceous vegetation in late summer 2011. Results from this study will reveal plant species composition and growth rates in the absence of browsing deer. Impact: Overabundant herds of white- tailed deer negatively affect forest regeneration by repeated browsing. This in turn will negatively affect the future of the timber industry and other wildlife populations in Connecticut. The Nature Conservancy in Connecticut uses these data to scientifically justify and document the results of their deer management program by educating their constituency on the negative impacts of overabundant white-tailed deer on the very forest flora and fauna they are charged with protecting. The Nature Conservancy also uses these data as a benchmark with which to monitor and compare noticeable browse damage on other properties which may require deer reduction. Deer Repellent Trial on Hosta: A deer repellent trial conducted on Japanese yews ( Taxus cuspidata 'Densiformis') by Drs. Ward and Williams in 2007 revealed that some commercially available deer repellents were more effective than others. In general, repellents that were applied more The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 163 frequently performed better. However, because more product is used during such an application schedule, efforts can get expensive for homeowners. In 2011, Dr. Williams launched a deer repellent study on Hosta (Hosta hosta 'Francee') that initially was intended to investigate the effectiveness of repellent formulations that could be made relatively inexpensively in a homeowners kitchen. However, two Connecticut- based commercial deer repellent manufacturers sponsored research efforts to test their products as well. As a result, Dr. Williams is testing 10 different commercially available products and 6 homemade formulations, a physical fence, and no protection each on 12 Hosta at two locations (432 Hosta total). Results should be available at the end of the 2011 growing season. Impact: Browse damage from overabundant herds of white- tailed deer cause the Connecticut nursery and landscape industry $1.5- $2 million in direct damages to plants prior to sale at nurseries and garden centers as well as $1 million in lost sales to homeowners discouraged by repeated deer damage annually. Effective repellents can cost homeowners u p to $7.00/plant/growing season. If a homemade repellent formulation was 75% effective, it would save homeowners nearly $700/100 plants treated and could limit nursery loses by $1.1-$1.5 million and could improve sales by $750,000 annually. Rehabilitated Fawn Survival and Behavior: Working collaboratively with Mr. Michael Gregonis of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, Dr. Williams is researching survival and dispersal of pen- raised white -tailed deer fawns. Every year, a numb er of fawns are removed from the wild by well-intentioned, but misinformed members of the public and are raised by licensed wildlife rehabilitators. In the past, fawns were released back into the wild and their fate was unknown. Last year, Mr. Gregonis and Dr. Williams radio-collared 19 fawns at three locations. Thirteen fawns were subjected to a hard release, in which fawns were transported to state forests and released. The remaining 6 fawns were subjected to a soft release, in which the pen door was opened and some food and water were provided. After 36 days, all 13 hard release fawns had died from various causes. After 85 days, all soft release fawns were dead. A similar study will occur in fall 2011. It is likely that the majority of fawns entered into this program are not orphaned at all, rather plucked from the wild while waiting for the doe to return. Impact: Pen -raising wild white -tailed deer fawns by hand domesticates them. Releasing them into the wild as domesticated stock incurs a survival rate o f zero. This research will be used to inform members of the Connecticut public to leave fawns in the wild as removing them will likely result in death. 164 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 165 DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY The mission of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology is to manage plant health problems using innovative methods to protect the environment, ensure a safe food supply, and maintain a healthy landscape for Connecticut. Our diverse basic and applied research programs seek a better understanding of the biology and ecology of plant pathogens and interactions between plants, pathogens, and the environment. Our services focus on the diagnosis of plant health problems for all Connecticut residents, including homeowners, plant care professiona ls, and commercial growers. The Department also has an active outreach program, which offers numerous fact sheets, disease management guides, web-based information, workshops, and presentations for grower groups, garden and horticultural clubs, special in terest groups, and students. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Bacterial spot of stone fruits Dr. Robert E. Marra's project on bacterial spot of stone fruits is focused on the development of a biological control method against bacterial spot, caused by the bacterium, Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Xap), one of the prominent diseases in southern New England, particularly of peach and nectarine. The strategy being tested is whether we can use a bacteriophage, a natural viral enemy of the pathogen, to protect plants f rom infection and reduce the severity of the disease. We demonstrated last year that all of 43 phage strains isolated from peach orchards in Connecticut, New York, and Massachusetts are genetically identical. This absence of phage diversity may pose prob lems for long- term sustainability as a biocontrol, as the bacterium can become resistant fairly rapidly. Nonetheless, we have been attempting to perform inoculations with the Xap bacteria on greenhouse peach trees (variety O' -Henry, highly susceptible) i n pots. This year, we experimented with a \"detached branch\" assay, in which branches from the potted O' -Henry peaches were excised and immediately placed in water in flasks, then sustained in the growth chamber, inside humidity tents, under a regime of 27 C and 12/12 hours day/night. Using 3-5 such flasks for one treatment, and another 3-5 flasks as negative controls, we attempted inoculations of the branchlets with suspensions of the Xap bacteria. We have had intermittent success with this assay, but can not reliably produce symptoms. In spring 2010, three orchards of 49 peach trees, variety, Sweet Dream, were planted at the Station's three research farms, Lockwood, Windsor, and Griswold. This variety is considered desirable in southern New England, bu t is too susceptible to Xap to be economically feasible. The trees were pruned in spring 2011 using an open center training technique, and any dead trees were replaced. Once they become established, these trees will be used for field tests on control of Xap. Bacterial Spot continues to be a significant economic problem for peach growers in Connecticut, which results in losses in quality and quantity of fruit. Multiple sprays are applied for control of this 166 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 disease every year, which are costly and potenti ally phytotoxic to the trees. Research to develop biological control using a naturally occurring bacteriophage would qualify as organic disease control, making it a very desirable option for orchardists and lead to increased profits for Connecticut grower s. Genetic variation and dispersal dynamics in Fusarium palustre, associated with Sudden Vegetation Dieback in salt marshes of eastern United States In order to elucidate patterns of dispersal of the newly described Spartina pathogen associated with wetland dieback, Fusarium palustre , Dr. Robert E. Marra initiated a genetic analysis of a collection of 90 isolates ranging from Louisiana to Maine (collection of Dr. Wade H. Elmer ). Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), Dr. Marra has discovered an unexpected amount of genetic variability. This procedure exploits the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in scanning the entire genome for polymorphic restriction- enzyme sites; i.e., those that may be present in some isolates but absent in others, manifesting as the presence or absence of a DNA fragment. The DNA fragments generated by the PCR are fluorescently labeled, then separated, based on size, using equipment at Yale University's DNA Facility. Data are then analyzed with software developed for this purpose. The figure below presents AFLP data for one set of selective primers used on a subset of 12 isolates ranging in origin from Louisiana to Maine. This figure represents only a portion of the entire AFLP profile extending from 75bp to 500bp. Polymorphic fragments are indicated by the green arrows; monomorphic fragments serve an important function in \"anchoring\" the data. While not pictured here, it is important to note that fragment patterns are identical among replications on the same isolates, confirming the reproducibility and robustness of the assay. Polymorphic markers identified using subsets of isolates such as these will be used to analyze genetic variation within and among sites, and to test hypotheses on the dispersal dynamics of t his important pathogen. Fusarium palustre AFLP loci (polymorphic fragments indicated by green arrows). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 167 Neonectria canker caused by Neonectria ditissima (prev. N. galligena) Dr. Robert E. Marra 's research on Perennial Canker (also known as Neonectria canker) continues to focus on the ecology and genetics of the fungal pathogen, Neonectria ditissima, with the goal of gaining a fuller understanding of the life history, evolution, and population dy namics of the organism, principally the mating structure and the ecology of spore dispersal, and its interactions with its hosts, particularly black birch ( Betula lenta ). DNA from cultures obtained from infected bark and wood from various parts of Connect icut and the eastern United States are being analyzed using genetic markers in order to determine (1) if fruiting bodies are the result of outcrossing or self-fertilization, and (2) if outcrossed, the extent to which they are inbred or outbred. This research utilizes a set of 13 microsatellite markers that were shown in earlier work to be highly polymorphic within and among sites in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The microsatellite markers are now being used to study a metapopulation consisting of two noncontiguous research sites in West Rock Ridge State Park. Microsatellites are chains of repeating DNA motifs (e.g., acgacgacgacgacg) found throughout the genomes of most eukaryotes; variation in the number of motif repeats at a microsatellite locus underl ies the length differences among alleles. The data acquisition phase of this research is nearly complete, and the analysis has just begun. The results confirm an earlier hypothesis that N. ditissima has a mixed mating system, albeit one in which selfing, not outcrossing, is the predominant mating mode. A predominance of selfing was unexpected, given that our previous work showed that there is a high degree of genetic variability among cankers (each maternal canker has a unique 13-locus genotype), from which one would reasonably hypothesize that the population exhibits a high degree of outcrossing. Our previous analysis of the maternal cankers resulted in an inability to reject a null hypothesis of random mating; the current analysis refutes this. This seeming contradiction suggests that dispersal dynamics of this fungus are complex, and require further study. Due to its increasing abundance in Connecticut, black birch is a tree of growing importance and concern. Although trees infected with Perennial Canker can persist for decades, the extensive scarring caused by the cankers renders them of little value for l umber or veneer. Our efforts to more fully understand the mating system will shed light on the fungus' dispersal patterns, a critical precedent to the development of a biocontrol program. Biochar, earthworms, and disease suppression Dr. Wade H. Elmer has shown that biochar, a fine- grained, charcoal -like product, will suppress Fusarium crown and root rot of asparagus when added to soil. He conducted a series of greenhouse studies that demonstrated that when biochar was incorporated in soil naturally infested with the pathogenic Fusarium spp., it resulted in increased asparagus plant weights and suppressed disease. The effect was linearly proportional to the biochar rate. When toxic allelochemicals were added to the soil, colonization by mycorrhizae was reduced, but the effect was reversed when biochar was added. Biochar may suppress disease by absorbing toxins in the soil, increasing mycorrhizal colonization in the roots and 168 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 allowing the densities of fluorescent pseudomonads to proliferate in the rhizosphere. These beneficial microbes help to suppress disease. Since biochars can vary depending on the feed stock, temperature, speed of pyrolysis, and age, Dr. Elmer initiated another series of experiments comparing different types of biochar for their effect on asparagus growth. CQuest , Agrichar (Best Energies, Inc., Madison, WI), Soil Reef (EcoTechnologies Group, LLC, Berwyn, PA), and Pure Black, and three diffe rent biochars (Encendia Inc., New Haven, CT), were compared in greenhouse experiments for their effect on Fusarium crown and root rot of asparagus. All biochar behaved similarly and reduced colonization and the number of root lesions. Dr. Elmer's previ ous research demonstrated that vegetables grew better and had less root diseases when the soils were augmented with adult earthworms. Based on these data, he proposed that earthworms might be used to provide delivery of beneficial products, like biochar, to the lower soil horizons, particularly in perennial plantings, where root systems cannot be easily manipulated after planting. Experimental field plots of asparagus were established in 2010 at Lockwood Farm, the Valley Laboratory, and the Griswold Research Center, and designed to examine the individual and combined effects of earthworms and biochar. Earthworms were reapplied to all plots in 2011. Although yield will not be taken until 2012, Dr. Elmer has observed that the vigor of asparagus fern growth is enhanced when biochar and earthworms were combined. Additional plots were established at Lockwood Farm in June 2011 to examine the combined effects of earthworms and biochar on another host pathogen system, Verticillium wilt of eggplant. The experiment is in progress, but Dr. Elmer has observed that plants are generally larger in plots treated with earthworms and biochar than in control plots. Earthworm being applied to asparagus soil (left) and asparagus plot after biochar was applied (right). The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 169 A toddler watches as Peter Thiel applies earthworms to an asparagus plot at the Griswold Research Farm (left); the toddler proudly shows his earthworm (right). Dr. Elmer also conducted experiments to determine whether or not earthworms discriminated against the different types of biochar. Earthworms were placed in bins and fed eight different sources of biochar. Results demonstrated that the oldest, most weathe red biochar was the most palatable to the earthworms and the CQuest biochar was the least palatable. Growth in an asparagus plot without earthworms or biochar (left) compared to growth in an asparagus plot treated with earthworms and biochar (right). Impact. These studies may provide evidence that earthworm activity can redistribute surface biochar applications to improve soil health and suppress soilborne diseases of annual and perennial crops, and may provide environmentally-friendly and sustainable suppression of foliar pathogens. It also highlights the many factors affecting the successful implementation of this technology. 170 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Suppressing Pythium root rot with partial soil saturation and silicon nutrition in a flooded floor greenhouse Use of ebb & flow recycled watering systems is increasing in Connecticut greenhouses to conserve water and fertilizer and to minimize run-off into the environment. However, a major disadvantage of recycled watering is the potential for disease outbreaks and the development of fungicide - resistant pathogens. A joint project with Drs. Wade H. Elmer, Martin P. N. Gent , Rich McAvoy (University of Connecticut), and Joe Geremia (Geremia Greenhouse, Yalesville, CT) previously found that disease was significantly reduced when plants received partial saturation as compared to standard saturation in a flooded floor greenhouse. In 2010, additional experiments were initiated to determine if combining silicon nutrition, which had previously been demonstrated to influence resistance to disease, with partial saturation could increase resistance to Pythium root rot of poinsettias. Our first year of data showed that applying silicon reduced Pythium root rot in the standard (wetter) irrigation treatment, but did not affect disease in plants in the partial saturation treatment. Experiments with zinnias are planned for fall 2011. Impact: Partial saturation, combined with nutrition, offers great value to growers who use ebb & flow irrigation systems. These findings should encourage growers to adopt partial saturation and new fertilization regimes when using ebb & flow irrigation in order to reduce damage from disease once Pythium inoculum is present. Sudden Vegetation Dieback continues to occur along Connecti cut's shoreline and most new sites appear to be proximal to established SVD sites. Results from a three-year survey (2007-2009) led Dr. Elmer to conclude that the incidence of Fusarium spp. colonizing Spartina plants was greater in sites where SVD had occurred. Although most isolates of a newly described species, F. palustre, were virulent, there is little evidence that Fusarium alone could cause SVD. Laboratory studies have shown that F. palustre is more tolerant to salinity than morphologically simila r species that occur on corn, indicating that F. palustre may have co -evolved with salt marsh plants and adapted to saline environments. Grazing pressure by the purple marsh crab, Sesarma reticulatum, may be affecting recovery from SVD sites. Using pitfall traps, we found that crab densities were not statistically significant from sites where plants were recovering from SVD. We hypothesized that another stressor may be enhancing the palatability or a ttractiveness of Spartina plants to the marsh crabs. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 171 Sudden Vegetation Dieback along a tidal creek in Madison, CT. The purple marsh crab ( Sesarma reticulatum ). To determine if these crabs were more attracted to stressed Spartina plants than healthy ones, we reared adult crabs in captivity and gave them a choice of a stressed or non -stressed plant. Plants were stressed by imposing drought and inoculating with F. palustre. Crabs subsequently fed on stressed, diseased plants more than on healthy plants. Greenhouse experiments were then designed to examine drought-stressed, flood -stressed, and healthy (control) plants that were either inoculated with F. palustre or left uninoculated. In each bin, five crabs were allowed to choose between one or two plants. Crabs preferred, in declining order, drought-stressed (either inoculated or uninoculated), inoculated plants with no drought stress, uninoculated plants with no drought stress, or flooded plants (either inoculated or uninoculated). These findings suggest that a temporary drought and/or infection by Fusarium may predispose Spartina plants to be more palatable to the crabs. In situ experiments are currently in place to study if crabs in naturally -occurring SVD sites prefer drought stress and/or inoculated plants to healthy plants. Impact : This research is providing insights into the critical factors associated with marsh grass recovery in SVD sites and will lay the framework for understanding the relevant contribution of herbivores and plant pathogens to an ecosystem -based approach for restoration and management. 172 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Photo of an experiment in which purple marsh crabs (not visible) were given a choice of feeding on a healthy plant (control) or a plant inoculated with Fusarium palustre. Crabs clearly preferred feeding on inoculated plants. Integrated Pest Management for winegrapes in New England Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino is continuing his work on diseases of winegrapes. This involves both an extension and a research component and is being accomplished through a collaboration of scientists and technicians at CAES, UMA SS, UCONN, and URI. Between December 2008 and April 2009, 7 cell phone-based, remote- access weather stations have been deployed in vineyards throughout southern New England (Hamden, CT; Windsor, CT; Griswold, Newport, RI; and Deerfield, MA). These weather stations measure temperature, relative humidity, sunlight, wind speed and direction, rainfall, leaf wetness, and soil temperature every 15 minutes. The data are sent back to a central location once per hour where it is accessible via the Internet. The resultant data are used to calculate disease risk assessment reports, which are made available to growers via Internet postings and direct Email alerts. Onsite weather station data are used to calculate disease risk assessments, which are delivered to the winegrape growers on a weekly basis. Dr. Ferrandino also communicates information about his research with diseases of grapevines to winegrape growers. These events provide much -needed feedback so that Dr. Ferrandino can adjust his research program to more efficiently address the growers' needs. He also regularly scouts experimental vineyards and makes frequent site visits to commercial vineyards in order to train growers to detect the first signs of disease. This i nformation is passed on to growers, who are then better able to spot the onset of disease. Impact: Disease-risk information alerts the growers to possible disease problems to look for in the vineyard. Using information about local weather events and inoculum levels to predict conditions that are The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 173 favorable for infections, winegrape growers are able to eliminate unneeded fungicide applications, while maintaining the economic value of the crop. The short -term benefits of eliminating one fungicide application can save a winegrape grower approximately $55.00 per acre (~$40.00 in cost of fungicide + ~$3.00 in cost of fuel + ~$12.00 in cost of labor per acre). When these savings are multiplied over the season, they factor into substantial saving for the wineg rape grower. The long- term benefits associated with fewer fungicide applications include minimizing the potential for fungicide resistance to develop in the powdery mildew fungus, more responsible environmental stewardship, and protecting the health of both the vineyard worker and the consumer. Dr. Ferrandino changes a battery for a weather station deployed within a Chardonnay vineyard located in Newport, RI. Dr. Ferrandino gives presentations about his research to winegrape growers in CT, MA, and RI. Early symptoms of downy mildew on grapevine are subtle yellow spots on the upper surface of the leaf (arrow). When the leaf is turned over, however, white sporulating areas are clearly visible (arrow). 174 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Mathematical models of plant disease epidemics Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino is continuing his theoretical investigations on the relation between the form of mathematical models describing plant disease development in time and plant disease spread in space. This work involves detailed i nvestigations of the connections between sporulation progress curves and the temporal development of the resultant plant disease epidemic, as well as how the shape of the inoculum dispersal distribution affects the resultant spatial distribution of plant d isease. The confirmation of theoretical models depends on detailed temporal and spatial sampling of plant disease. Dr. Ferrandino is continuing his spatio- temporal assays of grape powdery mildew and other pathogens in vineyards, powdery mildew in ornamental and vegetable crops, as well as detailed examination of the spread of foliar blights in tomato, pepper, eggplant, muskmelon, and pumpkin plantings. Impact: Mathematical models of plant disease with parameters, which are directly determined using field data, are essential in evaluating the efficacy and economic and environmental sustainability of IPM programs. Environmentally -friendly control of powdery mildew on landscape plants and general fruit and foliar pathogens on vegetable crops. Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino is extending his work on environmentally- friendly controls of powdery mildew on common home monarda, phlox, peony, rudbeckia, and zinnia) planted in the home garden (tomato, pepper, eggplant, muskmelon, and pumpkin). All foliar and fruit pathogens are being monitored on the vegetable plants. The alternatives to conventional chemical controls include sprays of cow's milk, compost tea, horticultural oil, and potassium bicarbonate products. The results from 2008 and 2009 suggest that stylet oil offered the best protection for lilac --it delayed the time when 50% of the lilac leaves were infested by three weeks. In 2010, powdery mildew was observed on monarda, phlox, and lilac by 22 July; however, disease levels were too low to evaluate the efficacy of the various sprays. In 2010, milk -based sprays were shown to reduce the incidence of anthracnose on plum tomato fruit and the severity of powdery mildew on muskmelon. This year, so far, disease levels are too low to evaluate the efficacy of the various sprays. Spray trials on muskmelon at Lockwood Farm (30 August 2010). The best powdery mildew control was obtained with milk -based sprays (blue) and conventional chemical fungicide (black) . The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 175 Impact: The use of efficacious, environmentally -friendly foliar sprays to control plant pathogens will reduce the chemical load on the environment. This is especially valuable around the home. Chestnut breeding for orchard and timber trees Dr. Sandra L. Anagnostakis is working with Dr. Scott Schlarbaum at the University of Tennessee to compare chestnut tree growth and survival after starting seeds under two systems. Over 8,000 seeds were collected from eleven chestnut trees, including 1,125 that were the results of hand pollination. These were divided between the Univ. of Tennessee nursery beds and a Root Production Method\u00ae planting at the Forrest Keeling Nursery in Elsberry, MO. The resulting trees will be planted in \"comparison plots\" in three Connecticut locations (northwest, central, and southeast), two in Pennsylvania, and one at West Point in New York. A preliminary experiment in the CAES greenhouse showed that air -pruning the roots (growing with an open screen bottom) produced trees with much healthier root systems. The trees will be examined yearly for three years, and growth and disease resistance recorded. Precocity in nut production will also be noted. This project will further progress toward restoration of American chestnut as a usable timber tree in North American forests and will support the utilization of chestnut as a specialty nut crop for the American marketplace. Chestnut seedlings produced in a greenhouse bench with a solid bottom (left) and in a box with an open screen bottom exposed to the air (right).

CAES chestnuts in the Univ. of Tennessee's nursery bed. Butternut Canker Research Trees reported to be butternuts ( Juglans cinerea ) have been examined by Dr. Sandra L. Anagnostakis over the past few years in a search for butternut canker disease caused by Ophiognomonia clavigignenti -juglandacearum (formerly Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum ). So far, 180 trees have been visited and only five true butternuts found (four in one location). At Lockwood Farm, we have planted 150 seedling butternuts, Japanese walnuts, and hybrids for our tests of virulence, and the inoculation done last winter showed that some of the Japanese walnuts were just as susceptible to this pathogen as the butternuts. This suggests that planting random hybrids between the two species is not the solution to restoring butternuts to the forest. A multi-state project on this disease problem has involved scientists in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Vermont, Indiana, and Connecticut on a State and Private Forestry grant. Stem samples from 26 trees in Pennsylvania and 26 trees in Iowa were sent to us under quarantine, and tested in the lab for their resistance to O. clavigignenti -juglandacearum. We found that there were significant differences between them, with the Iowa stems being much more susceptible to pathogen growth than the Pennsylvania stems. Some of the stems received had obvious cankers, and isolations revealed one Melanconis juglandis and one O. clavigignenti -juglandacearum on the stems from PA, and one Melanconis juglandis and five O. clavigignenti -juglandacearum on the stems from Iowa. The goals of the project are to further progress toward restoration of butternut as a usable timber tree in North American fo rests and to support the utilization of butternuts as a specialty nut crop for the American marketplace. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 177 Stems from three Pennsylvania butternut trees inoculated in the CAES lab with five strains of Ophiognomonia clavigignenti - juglandacearum , showing d ifferences in the growth of the pathogen on different source stems. Ramorum Blight/Phytophthora ramorum Dr. Marra has been working with Dr. Douglas in supervising the implementation of USDA - mandated assays for detection of P. ramorum on nursery material shipped from California, Oregon, and Washington. Nursery surveys, trace forwards, and trace backs are conducted in cooperation with Dr. Victoria L. Smith and state inspectors. The screening process begins with a serological test call ed ELISA (enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay), which detects all Phytophthora species. The assays are performed by summer research assistants under the supervision of Drs. Marra and Douglas. If a sample tests positive by ELISA, Dr. Marra extracts DNA from it and then analyzes for P. ramorum -specific nucleotide sequences using two real- time PCR assays. The Molecular Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory was given Provisional Approval Status as part of the National Plant Protection Laboratory Accreditation Pr ogram (NPPLAP) for P. ramorum by APHIS-PPQ and, in March of 2011, Drs. Marra and Li were certified in the 2011 Proficiency Testing Program for two real- time PCR assays. Impact : P. ramorum is a pathogen of growing concern in Connecticut because of the numerous species of plants and trees common in Connecticut that are known or suspected hosts. Much of this concern centers on Connecticut's significant horticulture industry, which at over $1 billion in annual production ranks Connecticut among the ten largest in the country and contributes to more than half of the total agriculture in the state. Nurseries found to have plants infected with P. ramorum are effectively quarantined until rigorously demonstrated to be clear of the pathogen, a process that can take several months. Therefore, Ramorum Blight, independent of its impact on our forests and landscapes, can have a significant impact on the state's economy. Many of the most susceptible hosts\u2014eastern red oak, 178 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 northern white oak, rhododendron, lilac, mountain laurel, and viburnum, to name a few\u2014 are significant parts of the nursery industry as well as Connecticut forests and landscapes. Given that the eastern United States, including Connecticut, is considered at high risk for P. ramorum , based on host distribution and climate, concern over the possible release of the pathogen into the environment is warranted. Through the Molecular Plant Diagnostics Laboratory (MPDL), Dr. Marra's goal is to accelerate and refin e our ability to identify P. ramorum in infected plants from the nursery, garden center, forest, and landscape, greatly increasing our chances of averting a Ramorum Blight epidemic. Additionally, the molecular diagnostic techniques being used and under development in the MPDL will continue to enhance the disease diagnostics services provided to Connecticut's stakeholders. Noteworthy diseases Noteworthy plant health problems: Environmental stress associated with weather extremes contributed to significant health problems on woody ornamental trees and shrubs in the landscape, on forest trees, and on herbaceous plants. Dr. Sharon M. Douglas reported that drought and heat were of primary concern in summer 2010. By the end of the growing season, Growing Degr ee Days (GDD) for 2010 were approximately 3 weeks ahead of the 30-year average; in contrast, precipitation was well below the 30 -year average. Records were set with several heat waves during July as temperatures reached well over 90 \u00baF, and these condition s were complicated by drying surface winds. Heat and drought stress resulted in symptoms on many woody ornamentals including drought -sensitive species such as dogwood, maple, ash, and hemlock, as well as species that are normally considered drought- tolerant such as pine, juniper, and Prunus. New transplants were particularly hard -hit, but established trees and shrubs were also affected. Symptoms began to appear by mid to late summer. These included marginal scorch, tip and branch dieback, premature leaf and needle drop, and, in extreme cases, plant death. In many cases, damage from drought was exacerbated by poor planting practices, soil and site conditions, and poor cultural care. Drought also appeared to affect leaf drop, as evidenced by two extremes: many woody ornamentals defoliated prematurely and dropped both green and brown leaves (particularly white ash), whereas others (crabapple and Japanese maple) held onto their leaves well beyond the \"normal\" drop period. Herbaceous ornamentals were also a ffected as were fruits and vegetables. Plantings without irrigation showed reduced size and quality. Where irrigation was used, many ponds were pumped dry. The second weather extreme occurred in the winter of 2010- 2011. Records were set for snowfall and the impact of this harsh weather was evident in most ornamental plantings. The extent and severity of the injuries observed this year were greater than usual since most of the woody ornamentals were substantially weakened by drought stress from the previous summer. Winter injury and desiccation were evident on many broadleaved and needled evergreens, particularly hemlock and rhododendron, although juniper, pine, and mountain laurel were also affected. Symptoms varied from leaf/needle discoloration and drop to tip dieback and branch death. Physical cracking and damage from the weight of accumulated snow and ice was also evident throughout the state, especially on arborvitae and juniper. Damage from de -icing salts and vole activity were significant secondary effects of the harsh winter and began to show up in early spring. De- icing salts injured plants in two ways: through direct contact of foliage with salt solutions in the \"spray zone\" along roadways and through the The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 179 accumulation of salts in the soil and subsequent uptake of these salts by plant roots. Conifers are very sensitive to de-icing salts and hemlocks, pines, and junipers planted along roadways began to exhibit symptoms once growth resumed in early spring. Among these symptoms were needle bronzing and browning, needle drop, and tip and branch dieback. Symptoms on salt- sensitive deciduous trees near roadways were also diagnosed on many species including sugar maple, beech, and crabapple. The extended snow cover also provided conditions favor able for vole activity, primarily the meadow vole. Once the snow began to melt in spring, the after -effects of this pest were evident in lawns and landscapes. This pest caused damage in orchards, Christmas tree plantations, forests, landscapes, and nurseries by girdling seedlings, ornamentals, and mature trees. Damage occurred as the voles fed and gnawed on stems close to the ground. When this gnawing completely girdles the stem, the plant dies. As a consequence, symptoms can vary from sudden, \"unexplained\" dying to a general, slow decline. Voles were also pests during the growing season as they consumed a variety of annual flowers, flower bulbs, and vegetables. Disease survey Dr. Yonghao Li, Dr. Sharon M. Douglas, and Ms. Mary K. Inman diagnosed a w ide range of plant health problems for homeowners, commercial growers, plant care professionals, and government and cooperative extension personnel during the past year. Fungal, bacterial, and abiotic diseases were prevalent on many trees, shrubs, flowers, lawn grasses, fruits, and vegetables. Diseases caused by viruses and nematodes were also identified on some hosts. Weather, including dry conditions in summer 2010, record- breaking snowfall in winter 2010- 2011, and cool and rainy weather conditions in early spring 2011, all contributed to plant health issues. Herbaceous and Woody Ornamentals: A wide range of diseases was identified on perennials and annual flowers this season. Common diseases and hosts were downy mildew on alyssum, powdery mildew on chelone, goldenrod, and peony; rust on chrysanthemum (brown rust), goldenrod, and violet. The virus diseases on herbaceous plants were hosta infected with tobacco rattle virus and hosta X virus, and begonia infected with impatiens necrotic spot virus. Some other fungal diseases were Heterosporium leaf spot on columbine and iris; Ascochyta leaf spot on actaea; F usarium anthracnose and Southern leaf spot hosta; Southern leaf spot and Southern blight on rudbeckia; Cercospora leaf spot on statice; Septoria leaf spot and smut on trillium. 180 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Botrytis blight of tulip Botrytis blight of lily Brown rot and fungal leaf spot were the most prevalent diseases on cherry trees because of the wet, cool weather conditions in spring 2011. Other c ommon diseases that were identified on broadleaf woody ornamentals were anthracnose on maple, oak, beech, and lilac; Botryosphaeria canker disease on dogwood, lil ac, rhododendron, mountain laurel, cherry, rose, crabapple, and holly; wetwood on maple and horsechestnut; Armillaria root rot on holly, boxwood, and rhododendron; bacterial leaf spot on forsythia, cherry, maple, hydrangea, philadelphus, and willow. Funga l leaf spot diseases that were identified on woody ornamentals were Entomosporium leaf spot of amelanchier, Septoria leaf spot of birch, scab and frogeye leaf spot of crabapple, spot anthracnose of dogwood, Entomosporium leaf spot of hawthorn, Cercospora leaf spot of hydrangea, Phyllosticta leaf spot of maple, fungal leaf spot of honeylocust, fungal leaf spot of inkberry, Cercospora leaf spot of privet, Cercospora leaf spot of leucothoe, black spot of rose, Cercospora leaf spot of mountain laurel, Tubakia leaf spot of oak, Phyllosticta leaf spot of hickory, and Macrophoma leaf spot of lilac. Some other diseases were ash with ash yellows and Phytophthora canker, azalea with leaf gall, Volutella blight, ch erry with black knot, dogwood with slime flux, elm with black spot and Dutch elm disease, filbert with eastern filbert blight, and Phomopsis canker, and wisteria with w ood rot. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 181 Downy mildew of rose Phyllosticta leaf spot of maple On conifer species, canker, dieback, and needlecasts were prevalent diseases in this season. The hosts and diseases included arborvitae with Botryosphaeria Rhizosphaera nee dlecast of spruce Vegetables: Among the vegetable diseases that were identified were Septoria leaf spot, early blight, bacterial leaf spot, Phoma leaf spot, anthracnose, powdery mildew, bacterial wilt, gray leaf mold, blossom-end rot, leaf roll, 182 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 catface, and tobacco mosaic virus on tomato. Some other common vegetables and their diseases were basil with bacterial leaf spot, bean with Cercospora leaf spot and Rhizoctonia blight, cabbage with bacterial black rot, carrot with powdery mildew, collard greens with powdery mildew,; cauliflower with bacterial black rot and bacterial leaf spot; cucumber with downy mildew, bacterial soft rot, and anthracnose; eggplant with Verticillium wilt; garlic with rust, bacterial soft rot, and Penicillium soft rot; pepper with Xanthomonas leaf spot, damping-off, and Phytophthora blight; potato with scab, and squash with powdery mildew and Fusarium fruit rot. Penicillium bulb rot of garlic Septoria leaf spot of tomato Tree and Small Fruit: Common tree and small fruit species and diseases were apple with scab, powdery mildew, frogeye spot, fire blight, rust, and bitter pit; peach with X-disease, pear with fungal leaf spot; plum with brown rot and black knot; apricot with black knot, brown rot, fungal leaf spot, and bacterial leaf spot; and grape with black rot. Turf: The unusually hot, humid, dry summer of 2010 caused significant drought stress and dieback of many lawns throughout the state. Damage began in June and continued into early September, as cool-season turfgrasses went beyond their normal summer dormancy to dead. As a consequence of these stressful condit ions of prolonged heat and high humidity, many weed and disease problems plagued lawns and golf greens. Common infectious diseases that were identified on lawn grasses were summer patch, red thread, yellow patch, Rhizoctonia brown patch, Pythium blight, leaf blight, and anthracnose. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 183 Weeds: Poison ivy remained a key plant of public concern. Identification and control of true, running bamboos and Japanese knotweed continued to be significant problems for many Connecticut landowners. Predominant weed problems in turf were crabgrass, annual blue grass, wild violet, chickweed, clover, and wild garlic. Some other weeds that were identified for Connecticut residents were bentgrass, bindweed, bitterswee Impact: Information on the diseases that occur on plants in Connecticut landscapes, natural woodlots, and forests each year helps to monitor and assess the impact of these problems on the overall health of plants in the state. This information also assists in det ecting new diseases or in identifying potentially important emerging diseases on specific plants, which can then be monitored in the years that follow. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology are involved in a wide range of service and public outreach activities. Some of these services involve presentations, publications, displays at meetings and other outreach events, tours of facilities, and interviews, in addition to being conducted in cooperation with other state agencies. Seed Testing: In cooperation with the Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Regulation and Inspection Every year, inspectors from the Bureau of Regul ation and Inspection of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture collect official samples of vegetable, crop, and lawn seeds for analysis. Samples are submitted to The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station since it is the official seed testing labo ratory for Connecticut. The Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology performs the germination and purity analyses that are required for compliance with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. In 2011, 320 vegetable, 8 lawn, and 10 crop seed samples were submitted to Dr. Douglas for testing. Ms. Inman tests all seeds following strict protocols designated by the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA). Seedlings are carefully examined, since they must appear \"normal\" (i.e., fr ee from decay, have well- developed primary root systems, have well-developed and intact hypocotyls and/or epicotyls, and have healthy cotyledons). Vegetable seeds are tested for germination, and of the 320 vegetable seed samples tested, 21 failed label cl aims for germination. Failures were not retested because of insufficient amounts of seed. None of the vegetable samples contained noxious weed contaminants in 2011. Lawn seeds are tested for both germination and purity. One component of purity analysis involves conducting a fluorescence test on all samples of ryegrass to determine the percentage of perennial ryegrass ). This test is necessary because the seeds of annual and perennial rye are too simi lar to be sorted. Roots of 184 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 the annual ryegrass fluoresce as white lines when placed under an ultraviolet light, in contrast to lack of fluorescence in the roots of perennial ryegrass. Germinating annual and perennial ryegrass seeds. Fluorescing roots of annual ryegrass under ultraviolet light. Of the 8 lawn seed samples tested, 6 met label claims for both purity and germination. One sample failed purity analysis because it contained less ryegrass and more fine fescue than stated on the label, despite meeting the level of total pure seed on the label. One sample passed label claims for germination, but failed its claim for purity. No lawn samples contained noxious weed seeds. Of the 10 crop seed samples tested, 8 samples met label claims for purity and germination and 2 samples failed both purity and germination. Several noxious weeds were identified in 2 samples, including chess, corn cockle, and brome grass. A Station Technical Bulletin will be written to report the findings of this year' s results. Impact: Results of seed tests conducted by Station staff are reported to the Seed Control Official of the CT Department of Agriculture who has the authority to stop the sale of products that do not meet label claims or contain noxious weeds. In the short term, this program protects state residents from purchasing inferior seed and ensures that seeds comply with the Connecticut Seed Law Regulations and the Federal Seed Act. The long -term benefit of the seed testing program is to minimize the i nadvertent introduction of noxious weed seeds that could potentially impact crops of economic importance and the state's ecosystem. Samples for Analytical Chemistry and the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection During the year, Dr. Li and Ms. Inman examined 43 samples from the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection at the request of the Department of Analytical Chemistry of the Experiment Station. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 185 Samples for 2011 National Nursery Survey and Trace -Forward and Trace -Back Surveys for Phytophthora ramorum Connecticut continued to participate in a national survey of nurseries to assess the presence of the Ramorum Blight (Sudden Oak Death) pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum , in our state for 2011. The objective is to survey nurseries at risk of harboring or distributing P. ramorum- infected plants. Drs. Douglas and Marra supervise the USDA -mandated assays for testing. During the past year, Dr. Victoria L. Smith (Deputy State Entomologist) supervised the collection of 236 samples by CAES nursery inspectors. After the ELISA pre -screen for all Phytophthora species, 83% of the samples tested positive. This represented the highest number of Phytophthora- species positive samples we have encountered after many years of conducting national surveys. DNA was extracted from ELISA- positive samples and tested for P. ramorum . At the time of this publication, no samples tested positive for P. ramorum in the 2011 nursery survey. In June 2011, there was, unfortunately, a positive find of Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of Ramorum Blight (or Sudden Oak Death) in a residential property in Connecticut. This was detected through the Station's participation in a \"trace-forward\" survey initiated by the USDA- APHIS-PPQ on plants sent by mail to private residences throughout the U.S., including Connecticut. Plants were from a nursery in Oregon that had tested positive for P. ramorum . Samples were collected by Dr. Victoria Smith and nursery inspectors, and brought to the lab for testing by Drs. Douglas and Marra. Samples from Rhododendron sp. 'Pronum' tested positive for P. ramorum using real -time PCR and by culture. The residential property was in New Haven County. Follow-up surveys of host material and soil on the property are in progress. Symptoms of P. ramorum- infected Rhododendron sp.'Pronum.' Citizen Inquiries Plant Disease Info rmation Office Drs. Li and Douglas, assisted by Department Scientists and Ms. Inman , answered 4652 inquiries about plant health from Connecticut citizens. Although the majority of inquiries were on ornamentals, trees, and shrubs (61%), other categories, such as food crops (21 %) and turfgrasses (5%), were also well represented. The number of inquiries on turfgrass represents a 2% increase from the previous year, possibly due to stress from the heat and drought of the 2010 growing season. A moderate 186 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 percentage of inquiries fell into the miscellaneous category (13%), which included identification of plants and poison ivy control and identification. Although the majority of inquiries were from Connecticut homeowners (69%), there were many inquiries from com mercial growers and plant care professionals (24%). Inquiries from cooperative extension, health, news, and agricultural personnel (7%) remained consistent with previous years. A further breakdown of inquiries showed that 42% of the samples came in by phone, 10% came in by mail, 5% came as email, and 43% were brought in person. The number of physical samples handled by the PDIO (53%) continued to exceed the number of phone calls (42%)\u2014 this is a trend that has been observed for the past 3 years. Six hund red thirty-eight letters and email messages with attached files of fact sheets were sent from the PDIO. Many citizens opted to download fact sheets posted on the CAES website in lieu of letters since this gave them instant access to the information of concern. Most of the miscellaneous questions were concerned with identification, human toxicity, and control of poison ivy and other poisonous plants, identification of various plants and weeds, mushroom identification for health officials, and information about pesticides and their relationships to health and environmental concerns. Additional inquiries Dr. Anagnostakis answered 246 questions, tested 147 samples, and made 18 site visits. Dr. Elmer made 14 site visits, answered 13 questions, and tested 17 samples. Dr. Ferrandino made 16 site visits, tested 35 samples, and answered 25 questions, and Dr. Marra tested 1 sample and answered 2 questions from stakeholders. Impact: During the period covered by this report, over 5788 Connecticut residents had plant disease problems accurately diagnosed by members of the Department of Plant Pathology and Ecology. In many cases, the plant health problems diagnosed did not require fungicides for control, contrary to the initial perception that fungicides would be required. Staff worked closely to educate professionals and homeowners to develop disease management programs that were compatible with the environment that incorporated cultural practices, sanitat ion, and genetic resistance prior to pesticide use. Accurate diagnosis of plant health problems, educated citizenry, and implementation of integrated disease management strategies reduce pesticides introduced into the environment and water of Connecticut. MEETINGS ORGANIZED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANT PATHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY Meetings and Workshops Dr. Sharon M. Douglas organized and hosted the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Northeast Plant Diagnostic Network (NEPDN), from 23 -25 February 2011, in Jones Auditorium, with assistance from Ms. Mary Inman and Dr. Yonghao Li . Twenty- six plant disease diagnosticians, from West Virg inia to Maine, were greeted by Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, Director. Attendees discussed topics of interest, which included surge capacities of diagnostic laboratories, significant diseases of the region, lab accreditation, The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 187 and state reports on unusual or significant diseases. Dr. Douglas organized a tour of CAES, during which the group heard about the variety of research programs at the Station, visited the USDA Forest Service Quarantine Facility in Ansonia, and Geremia Greenhouses in Wallingford. Dr. Wade H. Elmer organized a special Lunch Club Seminar about \"Salt marsh change and biotic responses\" by Dr. Roman Zajac, The University of New Haven (11 March 2011) Dr. Wade H. Elmer co-sponsored two Bedding Plant Meetings with Ms. Leanne Pundt and Dr. Richard McAvoy of the University of Connecticut. Topics covered included: Update on Managing Insects and Mites on Spring Crops, Update on Nutrition, Chemical Growth Regulators, and other Production Tips, Update on Emerging Diseases, Nutrition and New Fungicides for Spring Crops, and Update on Pesticide Safety. On 8 February 2010, the meeting was held at the Tolland Cooperative Extension Center in Vernon, CT and on 22 February 2010 the meeting was held at the University of Connecticut, Torrington campus, in Torrington, CT. Lockwood Lectures Dr. Francis J. Ferrandino organized a Lockwood Lecture by Dr. Odile Carisse, plant pathologist, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Horticulture Research and Development Centre, Quebec, Canada. The title of the lecture was Molecular tracking of airborne inoculum: impact on grape disease management (25 October 2010). Dr. Sandra L Anagnostakis organized a Lockwood Lecture by Dr. Jeanne Romero -Severson , Associate Professor , Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notr e Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana. The title of the lecture was Seeing the Forest and the Trees (6 May 2011). Conference Organizing Dr. Robert E. Marra served on a Steering Committee for the Connecticut Conference on Natural Resources from 2005 to present. The Conference was held this year on Monday, 7 March 2011, at the University of Connecticut, Storrs. The conference was attended by 243 people, including seven scientists from CAES who presented seven talks and one poster. 188 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 VALL EY LABORATORY Scientists at the Valley Laboratory conduct multidisciplinary research on insects, diseases, soil nutrition, mycology, integrated pest management and weeds of concern to commercial agriculture and homeowners in Connecticut. The Valley Labora tory, located in Windsor Connecticut, was originally established by the Board of Control in Windsor in 1921 to conduct tobacco research. While research on shade and broadleaf tobacco continues today, the mission of the research unit has greatly expanded t o reflect the diverse agriculture present in the State. In addition to research, scientists and staff diagnose insect and plant health problems, test soils for fertility and structural analyses, conduct outreach to growers and homeowners by speaking to professional and community groups, host informational meetings, and assist students. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES Activities on the farm: There were a total of 56 experimental plots at the Windsor farm during the past year. Five Windsor -based scientists had 28 of these plots; six New Haven -based scientists and a University of Connecticut graduate student were using 16 plots. The remaining plots were maintained by the Farm Manager as rotation crops or for seed collection. Valley Laboratory scientists also conducted experiments in many plots off site, such as in growers' fields and State forests. Farm Manager James Preste kept the farm and his equipment ready and in excellent shape. He expertly maintained the many The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 189 field plots and addressed the specific needs of each scientist. He and his summer research assistants did an outstanding job maintaining the extensive ornamental garden in cooper ation with the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Mr. Preste and Dr. LaMondia coordinated the Valley Laboratory effort to comply with EPA Worker Protection Standards for Agricultural Pesticides and organized and conducted training sessions for the staff. Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Research Eastern hemlock, Tsuga canadensis, is an impor tant native conifer climax species which provides essential wildlife habitat and cover, especially in winter. Hemlocks also protect watersheds and maintain critical cool stream temperatures for native trout species. In the garden landscape, it is a popul ar tree and a common component in Connecticut's state parks and forests. Since 1985, eastern hemlocks in Connecticut have been under attack by the non -native hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae, an accidental introduction from southern Japan. Biological control using imported predators of the adelgid is a major long-term national strategy for reducing the impact and spread of HWA in our eastern forests. Sasajiscymnus tsugae (Coleoptera:Coccinellidae), inating from the Pacific Northw est are the primary biological control agents released for HWA management. Projects 1 -3 are conducted by Dr. Carole Cheah and funded by the USDA Forest Service and project 4 is funded by USDA APHIS PPQ. 1) Project: Development of artificial diets for predators of hemlock woolly adelgid Dr. Carole Cheah maintains an experimental S. tsugae colony with lines originating from the first imported shipments from Osaka, Japan in 1994 and 1995 and a more recent line from Kobe, Japan, obtained in 2006. Current laboratory studies, in collaboration with Dr. Allen Cohen of North Carolina State University, Insect Rearing Program, are aimed at the development of an artificial diet and/or supplement to augment and improve the mass-rearing and production of adelgid predators for biological control. Currently all mass rearing of predators requires healthy HWA -infested foliage. Supplies can be unpredictable and of variable quality and affected by drought, winter extremes and accessible collection areas. Artificial egg diets developed by Dr. Cohen have resulted in equal or superior results to existing diets used for emergency feeds for HWA adult predators, when abundant, high quality live adelgids are not available. S. tsugae feeding on Cohen diet L. nigrinus feeding on Cohen diet (photos by Cheah) 190 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Impact: For large scale mass rearing of HWA predators, artificial diets should result in significant economic savings in production, and enhanced survival of adult predators during holding periods prior to release. The optimal formulations are being provided to 5 federally supported rearing programs and insectaries in 5 states rearing predator species for hemlock woolly adelgid biological control. 2) Evaluation of Herbivore Induced Plant Volatiles as Possible Attractants for Predators of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Plants under herbivore attack have been shown to produce volatiles that in turn attract natural enemy predator and parasitoid species of the herbivores in question. Many coccinellids exhibit positive olfactory responses to odors of their prey and/or host plant systems. S. tsugae is a highly dispersive species with excellent flight capabilities but this has obscured results from recovery sampling techniques which are mostly concentrated in the extreme lower canopy. Olfaction capabilities of S. tsugae have been questioned previously but did not investigate optimal environmental and physiological conditions for testing and validating insect responses to odor sources, such as preconditioning treatments of test subjects, reproductive states of individual test insects, appropriate airflow rates, humidity, ambient temperature, light intensity and balance. In thi s project, Dr. Carole Cheah investigated these factors in addition to the influence of biotic factors such as the insect's age and physiological state and level of foraging experience on the potential response to natural plant odors and synthetic test chem icals. Both S. tsugae and L. nigrinus were tested in a custom -designed 2- way air-flow olfactometer for odor detection and discriminating response to HWA-infested, non- infested eastern hemlock and artificial volatiles, with the objective of identifying volatiles for potential use in predator m onitoring or trapping systems. Five synthetic volatiles known be attractive to other predatory species were tested. Sasajiscymnus tsugae demonstrated significant odor perception of eastern hemlock (infested or not) seedlings over blanks. The responsiven ess and detection of HWA-infested hemlock odors was also found to be influenced by the reproductive state of the individual. Older, reproductive females and males of S. tsugae were able to significantly discriminate between non -infested and infested hemlock seedling odors. Reproductive S. tsugae females were also significantly attracted to methyl salicylate odors. Neither insectary -reared nor wild-collected L. nigrinus were attracted to HWA -infested seedlings. The percentage of responsive L. nigrinus adults was also much lower than for S. tsugae. L. nigrinus , laboratory reared or wild- collected from Seattle , did not respond to methyl salicylate. Impact: Methyl salicylate -based attractants appear to be suitable for further development into a field monitoring system for the HWA biocontrol predator S. tsugae. This could result in significant improvement in techniques for field sampling and detection of predator establishment for biological control of HWA. 3) Quality and Process Control for production of HWA predators Several laboratories (university, state, federal, and private businesses) mass rear predators of HWA. Often these predator releases have failed to provide the expected levels of HWA control and mortality of predators produced has been high during the rearing process. It is not known if these failures The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 191 are because of 1) inadequate numbers of predators being released, 2) problems in release techniques, 3) the quality of the predators themselves or 4) questionable quality of the adelgid prey used for rearing. The QC system consists of several tiers of observation and decision -making: 1) behavioral, 2) biomass and linear measurements, 3) biochemical assessments, and 4) internal morphology. This project is led by Dr. Allen Cohen of North Carol ina State University in collaboration with Dr. Carole Cheah and has developed unique product quality control assessment techniques as a basis for improvement of production and process control for mass- rearing of HWA predators. Impact: Important paramete rs which influence the production quality of predators such as protein content of predators and prey, free- radical scavenging capacity in predators and prey, lipid content, storage carbohydrate content, predator biomass, and predators' internal condition have been defined. These parameters are currently being tested and integrated into a Quality Control system which will enable early detection and correction of production and quality problems with the objective of optimizing the efficiency of predator pro duction and biological control of HWA. 4) Project: Establishment of a HWA predator field insectary A field insectary at the Lockwood Farm was established by Dr. Carole Cheah , with the help of Lockwood Farm staff, with plantings of HWA-tolerant species of western, mountain and northern and southern Japanese hemlocks in May 2009. The objective is to develop a novel procedure for eventually field-rearing S. tsugae acclimated to the northeast climate for biological control releases. This second full year of planting has yielded valuable data on the adaptation and survival of each species during highly variable Connecticut winters and summers. After the harsh and snowy winter of 2011, northern Japanese hemlock, Tsuga diversifolia, again proved to be the most hardy and adaptive of the 4 species to the Connecticut climate. No top -kill of foliage was recorded for T. diversifolia exposed above the snowline, while both western and mountain hemlocks had high levels of defoliation and tip dieback. Southern Japanese hemlock seedlings, planted as much smaller plugs, was totally protected by snow cover and survived well. Tsuga diversifolia has also produced the most vigorous new growth i n 2011 and is the most adapted and established of the 4 species. Attempts to infest T. diversifolia with HWA were made in March, May and June 2011. Hemlock field insectary at Lockwood Farm Tsuga diversifoli a, northern Japanese hemlock (photos by Cheah) 192 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Impact: Northern Japanese hemlock would be a suitable landscape/garden alternative to the threatened native eastern hemlock which is susceptible to HWA, and should be of commercial interest to specialty nurseries. MILE -A-MINUTE WEED 1) Diet development for biological controls of invasive weeds Mile-a-minute weed, Polygonum perfoliatum, (MAM) originates from Asia, was first discovered in the eastern U.S. in the 1930s and is classified as a noxious invasive weed in Connecticut. It currently infests 9 eastern states and was first recorded in Connecticut in 1997. In Connecticut, 19 towns are currently infested. This rapidly growing prickly and prolific vine is annual in its northern range but quickly forms dense thickets which displace native vegetation and reduces plant diversity. An introduced weevil, Rhinoncomimus latipes (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), imported from central China, has been successfully reared and released for biological control of this invasive species in the Mid -Atlantic and southern New England states. However, weevil rearing is dependent on intensive greenhouse propagation of the vine and the development of an artificial diet for mass rearing would be beneficial in improving efficiency, space required for mass production and enhancing survival during shipments. Dr. Carole Cheah is collaborating with Dr. Allen Cohen, North Carolina State University, on the development of an artificial d iet for R. latipes in cooperation with the Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory (PABIL), New Jersey Department of Agriculture, Trenton, NJ, with funding support from the USDA Forest Service. In 2010-2011, adult R. latipes was attracted to feed robu stly on a breakthrough artificial diet developed by Dr. Cohen. In experiments, Dr. Cheah recorded survival of >80% over three weeks on diet alone. At the end of the experimental period, survival was 66% after 37 days on diet alone and weevils were able t o feed and oviposit normally on return to MAM foliage. In 2011, this diet was used by Dr. Cheah to maintain 5,000 weevils prior to release for up to a week with negligible mortality in the absence of MAM. This project is funded by the USDA Forest Service FHTET program. Adult R. latipes feeding on Cohen artificial diet (photo by Cheah) Impact: A suitable artificial diet for R. latipes would enhance mass rearing for the expanding biological control program of mile-a-minute weed which is currently based on live plant cultures. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 193 2) Implementation of Biological Control of Mile -a-Minute Weed in Connecticut This project is funded by USDA Forest Service and USDA APHIS PPQ in cooperation with the University of Delaware and NJDA Phillip Alampi Beneficial Insect Laboratory. Dr. Carole Cheah , in collaboration with Dr. Todd Mervosh of the Valley Laboratory and Donna Ellis from the University of Connecticut, released 5,000 R. latipes in Connecticut in June 2011, with releases in 2 new towns: Sprague and Norwalk. T he weevils have been released to control MAM in North Haven, Greenwich, Newtown, New Milford and Bridgewater (2009), Stamford, Westport and Fairfield (2010) and Sprague and Norwalk (2011). Since the 2009 first release, weevils have survived two Connecticut winters, intense spring flooding, and reproduced with multiple generations and feeding impact recorded at most sites. Dispersal has also been recorded to at least 0.5 mile from initial release sites. Releasing weevils on MAM in Sprague in June 2011 (photo by Cheah) Impact: Establishment of biocontrols for mile-a-minute weed would provide a natural control to limit spread and range expansion of a noxious and prolific invasive weed, and reduce the need for chemical control, especially in watershed areas, in utility right -of ways etc. Insect Management Dr. Richard Cowles conducted an experiment to investigate absorption of systemic insecticides applied to the trunks of four species of trees. The insecticides tested were imidacloprid, dinotefuran, and clothianidin; the tree species were red maple, flowering cherry, green ash and river birch. The effects of surfactants were inconsistent, but there were great differences in foliar residues, and interactions between tree species and insecticides. Flower ing cherry, in general, had the greatest absorption, followed by maple, ash, and birch. Clothianidin was absorbed the poorest of the three insecticides, but all three insecticides were readily detected in foliage. Both imidacloprid and dinotefuran are r eadily absorbed 194 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 through maple bark, suggesting that this application method may be suitable for use in Asian longhorned beetles quarantine areas. Dr. Richard Cowles continued pyrethroid resistance studies in bed bugs in collaborations with Drs. Anderson, Krol , and Ridge. Direct analysis of permethrin residues demonstrated that 90% of a one-microgram dose was degraded in 24 hours. Experiments will continue to compare metabolism of Type 1 and Type 2 pyrethroids. The pyrethroid- resistant bed bugs collected in Connecticut are extremely resistant to Type 1 materials and only susceptible to extreme dosages of most Type 2 compounds - dosages they are unlikely to encounter from field applications of these insecticides. Investigation of alternatives to pyrethroids demonstrated that certain botanicals, silica aerogel dust, and an EPA Section 25b Exempt Product (TechDust, manufactured by Paragon Professional Products) are highly effective against bed bugs in laboratory trials. Another exempt product, EcoExempt D, was inferior to the other tested dusts. Impact: Valent BioSciences Corporation has obtained U.S. EPA registration approval for basal bark spray use of the insecticide Safari (dinotefuran) to hemlock trees, nursery crops, and Christmas trees for control of scales, adelgids, and other sucking insect pests. New York State Dept. of Environmental Conservation approved the use of dinotefuran in a basal trunk spray for eastern hemlocks, which is the only use currently approved in that state outside of enclosed structures. Both uses are largely based on Dr. Cowles' research. Golf course superintendents continue to reduce their reliance on pyrethroid insecticides, and are increasingly using the biorational insecticide spinosad to target larvae of the annual bluegr ass weevil. Strawberry sap beetle research Field experiments initiated by Dr. Hugh Smith to study strawberry sap beetle were continued by Dr. Cowles . Strawberry sap beetle adults were found to be capable of escaping from most adhesives used in traps. A trap was designed for live capture of sap beetles in field tests. We have found it very difficult to improve upon the standard whole wheat bread dough, which previous researchers had determined to be highly attractive to the adults. Larvae of strawberry sap beetle were also trapped, surprisingly at times and locations where we did not anticipate them to be active. A laboratory rearing procedure for strawberry sap beetle was developed. Larvae from that colony were then exposed to insect pathogenic nematodes, demonstrating that they are susceptible to infection by Steinernema Strawberries are an important component of Connecticut's agricultural economy. Improved monitoring and least toxic approaches will help strawberry growers reduce insecticide use. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 195 Strawberry breeding Strawberry root-feeding insects and root diseases such as black root rot can limit the productivity of perennial matted row strawberries in Connecticut. Dr. Richard Cowles initiated a strawberry breeding program and after years of selection from several thousand progeny of several crosses, a line was chosen for patenting because of its tolerance to root diseases, black vine weevil, and exceptional fruit qualities. This year a plant patent was submitted for a new cultivar, 'Rubicon' strawberry. This cultivar originated from a cross by Dr. Cowles in 2000 between 'Idea' and 'Primetime' strawberries. Impact: Extending the productivity of strawberry plantings with tolerance to root diseases and black vine weevil will help growers increase profitability while reducing insecticide use. Rubicon strawberry fruit. Mycology Research Dr. DeWei Li conducts research on indoor molds of human health concern, fungal succession on water-damaged building materials, and infiltration of mushroom spores from outdoors into residences. Toxic indoor mold - Stachybotrys and Memnoniella biosystematics study: Stachybotrys thaxteri Li was described as a species new to science. The nomenclatural status of Stachybotrys cannae , \"Stachybotrys pallida\", and \" striatispora \" has been studied and clarified. This stud y showed that Stachybotrys cannae is not a species of Stachybotrys. It belongs to a different genus and its true identity is Periconiella portoricensis. \"Stachybotrys pallida\", and \"Stachybotrys striatispora\" are invalid names which subsequently have no taxonomic values. 196 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Impact: Controversies concerning three species of Stachybotrys were settled. These results provide significant information to mycologists and biologists about the nomenclatural status of these species which will help with identificatio n and assist in research. New fungal taxa: Specimens were collected throughout the year indoors and outdoors. Dr. DeWei Li described two species new to science (Stachybotrys thaxteri and Rhexodenticula zhengii .). A key to the species of Rhexodenticula was developed so that mycologists, biologists, and the public can use it to identify the species of Rhexodenticula. Descriptions of t hree more new species have been submitted for publication. Impact: The identification and publication of new species are important additions to fungal biodiversity and biosystematics. The roles of these new species in the ecosystem and different environments remain to be studied. Calvatia gigantea ( Giant puffball) basidiospore production study Dr. DeWei Li determined that this common fungus is able to produce five trillion basidiospores in a single fruiting body. Impact: Giant puffball is an important allergen in the air, the information of C. gigantea with such a high potential of releasing a very large number of spores i nto the air is very important to the public, allergic patients and medical practitioners for allergy diagnosis, management, and treatment. Dr. Li with a giant puffball. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 197 The effect of rotation crops on root rot of Common Bean Rotation and cover crops have been increasingly used by vegetable farmers in the Northeast to improve soil quality, prevent erosion, increase organic matter, and to suppress nematodes, root diseases and other pests. Many studies have documented the various benefits of cover crops including preventing erosion, increasing organic matter, recycling of nutrients and improving soil quality in general. However, few studies have focused on the effect of specific cover crops on the common soilborne root pathogens of vegetables , Pratylenchus and Meloidogyne of eight cover crops in managing root rot diseases of vegetables was evaluated by Dr. James LaMondia as a part of a NE -IPM grant-supported project conducted in New York, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Dr. LaMondia determined that beans grown in pathogen-infested plots had the highest shoot and root weights and lowest levels of disease following tillage radish and rapeseed. The effects of these cover crops on soil health parameters are being evaluated in New York State. Impact: The identification of rotation and cover crops that reduce disease and increase soil health parameters may protect farm sustainability by adding non- chemical integrated pest management tools. 198 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 Management of foliar nematodes on ornamentals The plant parasitic nematode Aphelenchoides fragariae can infect foliage and cause leaf death and plant defoliation. As part of an IR-4 funded grant, Dr. Jame s LaMondia conducted experiments to determine the efficacy of (abamectin), Proclaim applied to foliage of Anemone sylvestris 'Serenade' and A. sylvestris drench. Aphelenchoides fragariae were inoculated and leaves sampled over to time to monitor nematode populations. Numbers of A. fragariae extracted from Serenade were low and there were no significant differences between treatments. Foliar nematode populations increased over time in Pamila. The lowest nematode numbers in foliage were observed in the Pylon, Neemix, Kontos drench and Avid treatments. The untreated controls had nearly one thousand times more A. fragariae per plant. None of the treatmen ts were completely free of infection after 2 to 3 months, so plant protection chemicals will not stand-alone for foliar nematode management. For practical management of A. fragariae , multiple applications of the more efficacious materials may be required in combination with sanitation. Impact: The identification of labeled insecticides with activity against foliar nematodes will greatly reduce losses due to this pathogen. Foliar nematode symptoms on Anemone and Salvia. The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 199 Tobacco disease research The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Valley Laboratory was established in 1921 (as the Tobacco Substation), to combat tobacco problems and diseases such as wildfire, a devastating disease caused by a bacterial plant pathogen. Wildfire was eventuall y eliminated by the development of plant resistance, and ever since, tobacco breeding to incorporate genetic plant resistance to plant pathogens has been ongoing. Plant resistance to major pathogens is the most economical, environmentally responsible, and often most effective way to control plant diseases. The development of plant resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in the 1950's, to ozone damage (weather fleck) in the 1960's, black shank in the 1970's, and Fusarium wilt in the 1980's and early 1990' s effectively controlled serious diseases which each threatened to seriously impact or even wipe out cigar wrapper tobacco production in the Connecticut River Valley. There are currently a number of pathogens that threaten the crop. Dr. James LaMondia conducts a breeding program to develop resistance to the tobacco pathogens: Fusarium mosaic virus, and Peronospora tabacina (blue mold) for both shade and broadleaf type s. Initial crosses for cyst nematode resistance were made in 1987 between two flue- cured tobacco lines which each carried resistance to the Tobacco cyst nematode but were unmarketable and Connecticut broadleaf inbreds. The initial hybrids between CT and flue-cured types were backcrossed twice to CT broadleaf to restore broadleaf characteristics, and then inbred over 10 generations. Plants were selected for wilt resistance and agronomic type under field conditions and for TMV and TCN resistance in greenhouse screens. The resulting inbred (F10 generation) was not of suitable quality, so it was backcrossed again to the broadleaf cultivar 'Scantic' and again selfed to an inbred using pedigree selection with field and greenhouse selection for resistance and agronomic broadleaf tobacco characteristics. The resulting inbreds were progeny tested to select plants with stable homozygous resistance to TMV and the TCN and were evaluated for Fusarium wilt and blue mold resistance. The result of this breeding program was 27 generations of selection for broadleaf agronomic characteristics with 8 cycles of selection each for Fusarium wilt, TMV and TCN resistance. The male-sterile F1 hybrid 'B2' is highly resistant to Fusarium wilt, TMV and the TCN. An unexpected benefit that Dr. LaMondia discovered was that the TCN -resistant inbred parent used to make the B2 hybrid was fairly resistant to blue mold and the B2 hybrid itself was also moderately resistant to the disease. Blue mold leaf spot, caused by the downy mildew pat hogen Peronospora tabacina, has been a recurring problem in Connecticut from 1997 through 2010, causing losses up to the tens of millions of dollars annually. As a result, growers must apply fungicides on a regular basis to protect against the disease. When compared to the highly resistant tobacco varieties NC 2000 and NC 2002 developed in North Carolina, the moderately resistant varieties KT 200 and KT 206 developed in Kentucky and Tennessee, and susceptible C9 broadleaf in the same experiment, B2 was in termediate to the highly resistant NC lines and moderately resistant KT lines. Plant resistance is the only practical means of control for Fusarium wilt and TMV. The effects of TCN resistance are more economical and actually better than preplant soil fumigation (which costs approximately $500 per acre) as tobacco cyst nematode populations that have been reduced by the 200 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 fumigation subsequently increase as a result of growing a susceptible tobacco variety. TCN resistant B2 causes cyst nematodes to hatch, enter roots, and then die as a result of resistance, effectively reducing cyst nematode populations by more than 60% while still producing a tobacco crop. Blue mold resistance would act to reduce the number of fungicide applications required to control the disease and increase crop quality. Over several years at the CAES Valley Laboratory Research Farm and in small plots with cooperating growers, B2 wrapper leaf quality was consistently as good as or better than the current broadleaf standard inbred variety C9. The use of an inbred with growers saving seed from year to year often results in genetic drift and the loss of resistance to pathogens over time. The use of a male sterile hybrid that does not produce seed will result in a stable, uniform variety wit h no genetic drift over time. Impact: The development of a male -sterile hybrid broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco with resistance to most of the major pathogens, including Fusarium wilt, TMV, the TCN and blue mold, should allow sustainable crop production w ith reduced losses to disease and much reduced pesticide inputs. B2 is being released as a new cultivar and seed production has been licensed to a local company. Proceeds will support further research on plant resistance. Potato Virus Y Disease in Tobacco In late June 2009, stunted shade and broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco plants in Massachusetts were observed with veinbanding, mosaic, and leaf mottle symptoms. Dr. LaMondia determined that symptoms were the result of infection by Potato Virus Y (PVY) and other related aphid- transmitted poty viruses. Symptoms in tobacco were initially widespread and severe in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts and eventually spread to northern Connecticut. At least 3,000 acres of potatoes were present ne ar the earliest affected area in Massachusetts and volunteer potato plants were found in high incidence in fields rotated from potato in 2008 to tobacco in 2009. Growers indicated that volunteer potato tubers survived over winter in both 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. Early symptom development was greatest for tobacco in close proximity to potato crops. It is known that many species of aphids transmit these viruses in a nonpersistent manner. Soil temperatures recorded at 20 cm deep in Windsor CT were as low as -4.7 C in 2007, and only as low as -1.85 C in 2008 and 2009. Critical temperatures for potato tuber death were reported to be -2.8 C or lower, so temperatures were consistent with observations of volunteer tuber survival in 2008 and 2009. Potato can serve as a virus reservoir, and volunteer tubers likely increased virus incidence for early -season aphid transmission. Severely affected tobacco crops were unmarketable as cigar wrapper tobacco and destroyed. Insurance estimates concluded that over 600 acres of shade and broadleaf tobacco in Massachusetts and Connecticut were destroyed as a result of infection by one or more poty viruses. Total indemnity was over $4,750,000 for crops that would have had a value of approximately $10,000,000 if harvested and sold at typical crop values. Additional quality losses in harvested and cured tobacco further increased the impact of the disease on the 2009 crop. Dr. LaMondia monitored winter soil temperatures at different depths in Connecticut and Massachusetts over the winters of 2009 and 2010 and concluded that potato tuber overwinter survival would only occur in protected areas and not in large open fields as in the past two years. Little or no PVY occurred in 2010, but symptoms were seen in potato in 2011 and sampling of potato crops indicated that The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 201 PVY levels were higher than normal for a year with little or no volunteer survival. Severe symptomatic potato plants were almost all (94%) positive; mildly symptomatic plants were about 25% positive; and randomly drawn potato plants had 19% infection. Virus infection of seed tubers can be an important source of an epidemic. Tobacco, tomatoes and pepper were initially free of PVY but incidence increased over the season as aphids moved the virus from nearby potatoes into the other crops. Impact: Information associating severe crop losses with PVY and the source of virus inoculum as well as the prediction of potato tuber survival based on soil temperatures and the magnitude of virus inoculum reservoirs for the 2010 and 2011 seasons allowed growers to make informed decisions on planting and early season aphid management options. Necrotic strain of PVY in tobacco. Weed research Dr John F. Ahrens , Emeritus Plant Scientist, conducts research primarily on weeds in nurser y production and Christmas trees and answers grower and other citizen requests for information. Although he officially retired in 1992, he continues to conduct and publish research results and works with growers to help them achieve success in controlling their many problem weeds. His advice on vegetation control is sought by growers and scientists throughout the northeastern United States, Canada and beyond. Dr. Ahrens has been a long -time advisor to the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers Association and chairs 202 The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 their Fire Safety and Tree Improvement Committees. He visits growers of all crops who request his assistance and is active in the New York and the New Hampshire/Vermont Christmas Tree Associations. He takes the lead in annually updating the New England Guide to Chemical Weed and Brush control in Christmas Trees. Dr . Ahrens has, for many years, cooperated in the Interregional IR -4 program that sets priorities and produces data to support the federal registration of herbicides that could be valuab le tools for growers of ornamental crops. In January, 2011, the IR- 4 Project awarded him their first\" Soar\" Award for his 'Service, Outreach, Altruism and Research'. SERVICE ACTIVITIES Requests for information A total of 5,956 inquiries were answered at the Valley Laboratory during the past year. The majority of these queries (81%) were answered by Dr. LaMondia (1,875 - 90% commercial), and by Dr. Mervosh (1,610), and Ms. Rose Hiskes (1,355) in the inquiry office. About 55% of the information requests to the inquiry office were from the public sector; the remainder was from commercial growers and pest control operators. Valley Lab scientists made 112 presentations to grower, professional and citizen groups, (approximately 6,158 people), were interviewed 19 times and made 200 visits to commercial and municipal fields, nurseries, greenhouses, Christmas tree farms, forests and private landscapes to diagnose complex problems or conduct research projects. Dr. LaMondia initiated and maintained the Connecticu t River Valley Blue Mold Web Site to keep tobacco growers current with the progress of this devastating disease in North America, and the potential exposure to the pathogen and management options in the Valley. He worked with the CT DEE P to obtain a Section 18 registration for Revus fungicide for control of Phytophthora blight in snap beans in CT. Thomas Rathier, emeritus soil scientist, visited more than 15 different specific urban sites where community gardens either already existed or were planned by community organizers. At each site, Mr. Rathier made an assessment of the horticultural capabilities of the site as well as the likeliness of metal contamination being found in soils on the site. Samples were taken at each site and analyzed by Mr. Rathier and Mr. Musante (Analytical Chemistry Department). Mr. Rathier subsequently relayed results to appropriate stakeholders along with suggestions for remediation and/or avoidance of soils whose metal concentrations exceed the Connecticut standards for remedi ation. Soil testing A total of 4,090 soil tests were expertly performed by Ms. Diane Riddle during the past year. About 59% were performed for commercial growers, 38% for homeowners, 2% for municipalities, and the remainder for Station research. Of the c ommercial samples submitted, 45% were for landscapers; The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station - Record of the Year 2010- 2011 203 26% for tobacco growers; 11% for vegetable growers, 8% for nursery growers; 6% for golf course superintendents; 2% for fruit growers, 2and % for Christmas tree growers. Gordon S. Taylor Conference Room Many agricultural organizations used the conference room at the Valley Laboratory regularly for their meetings. During the past year, 20 different groups used the room on 50 occasions. Our most frequent users were the Connecticut Department of Agricultu re, Connecticut Rhododendron Society, Connecticut Invasive Plants Working Group, Connecticut Farmland Trust, , Connecticut Chapter of the National Organic Farmers Association, Connecticut Invasive Plants Council, and the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association. Ms. Jane Canepa -Morrison scheduled the appointments and James Preste arranged the furniture for scheduled meetings and ensured that the room was available after hours. Tobacco Shed and Equipment This winter's record snowfall took its toll on many of Connecticut's agricultural structures. The Valley Laboratory tobacco shed, constructed in 1923, buckled under the strain and partially collapsed. Farm manager Jim Preste worked hard to remove and clear snow to pull out and secure equipment before it could have been damaged. Three bents of the shed were saved and reconstructed to allow tobacco research in the future and a new equipment shed is being constructed on the site of the demolished portion to store and work on equipment and tractors.
