Flores and Hosbein. At the basis of this approach is a process designed by Dr. Al-Bayati PhD, known as differential diagnosis. Differential diagnosis involves a detailed evaluation of all the medical evidence and medical records concerning each patient. Using this process, the specific and unique cause(s) of immune depression and other illness are identified in each patient allowing each patient to receive individualized care based on scientific protocols that focus on reversing their particular illnesses [ ](https://t.me/wellnesscafe) The objectives of this study are to resolve AIDS-defining illnesses, and to return to optimal health, the HIV positive-diagnosed patients involved in the study by providing objective, individualized diagnosis and supportive medical care based on sound scientific facts rather than on hypothesis and assumption. As the medical evidence presented below and in the published literature demonstrates, treatment protocols based on the HIV hypothesis fail to successfully resolve AIDS illnesses or to restore normal immune function. Moreover, this collection of data shows that the antiviral drugs and corticosteroids currently used in the [treatment of HIV positive and AIDS](Aids) diagnosed patients may compromise immunity; exacerbate or provoke AIDS-defining illness; inflict serious, irreparable harm; and even cause death. AIDS may be managed like any other chronic, degenerative illness. Related: [ Covid-19: Uncensored Medical Information](https://tinyurl.com/c-v-d-truth) Treating and Preventing HIV/AIDS By Boosting Immunity Clinically, there is direct evidence that HIV infection is associated, with a [glutathione GSH deficiency](../NaturalHealth/Glutathione#symptoms) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (18). The depletion of intracellular GSH suggests an association between oxidative stress and HIV infection. Oxidative stress may be one of the mechanisms that contribute to disease progression and the wasting syndrome through mediators of inflammation such as TNF-. and IL-6. During this period of progression, glutathione is consumed owing to an increase in oxidative stress. GSH depletion, a consequence of chronic oxidative stress, is part of the [spectrum of HIV infection.](Aids#inquiry) GSH has, in addition, a crucial role in lymphocyte function and cell survival. Whey Proteins As A Food Supplement In HIV-Seropositive Individuals [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8365048) G. Bounous, S. Baruchel, J. Falutz, P. Gold, Departments of Surgery and Medicine, The Montreal General Hospital and McGill University, Montreal On the basis of numerous animal experiments, a pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of in 3 HIV-seropositive individuals over a period of 3 months. Whey protein concentrate was prepared so that the most thermo-sensitive proteins, such as serum albumin which contains 6 glutamylcysteine groups, would be in non denatured form. Whey protein powder dissolved in a drink of the patient's choice was drunk cold in quantities that were increased progressively from 8.4 to 39.2 g per day. Patients took whey proteins without adverse side effects. In the 3 patients whose body weight had been stable in the preceding 2 months, weight gain increased progressively between 2 and 7 kg, with 2 of the patients reaching ideal body weight. Serum proteins, including albumin, remained unchanged and within normal range, indicating that protein replenishment per se was not likely the cause of increased body weight. The glutathione content of the blood mononuclear cells was, as expected, below normal values in all patients at the beginning of the study. Over the 3-month period, glutathione GSH levels increased and in one case rose by 70% to reach normal value. The increase in body weight observed in these patients did not correlate with increase in energy or protein intake. [A unique natural glutathione booster supplement](../NaturalHealth/Glutathione#importance) functioning as a cysteine delivery system can enhance GSH synthesis in vitro and inhibits HIV replication on a cord mononuclear cell system infected by HTL V-IIIB (Figure 3). also inhibits the formation of syncitium between infected and non infected cells. The inhibition of syncitium formation occurred at the same concentration as inhibition of HIV replication. This viral inhibition was not associated with any cytotoxicity. This glutathione booster, via its GSH-promoting activity, educes apoptosis in HIV-infected cells. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry on PBMC from HIV-infected individuals (Dr. R. Olivier, AIDS and Retrovirus., Department, Pasteur Institute). HIV-infected PBMC cultured at concentrations of this supplement' of I 00 ug/ml or higher were less prone to die of apoptosis than untreated cells: 15% \u00b1 p<0.001 (Figure 4). Low Glutathione Levels Correspond to poor Survival in AIDS Patients Glutathione deficiency is associated with impaired survival in HIV disease. Glutathione (GSH), a cysteine-containing tripeptide, is essential for the viability and function of virtually all cells. In vitro studies showing that low GSH levels both promote HIV expression and impair T cell function suggested a link between GSH depletion and HIV disease progression. Clinical studies presented here directly demonstrate that low GSH levels predict poor survival in otherwise indistinguishable HIV-infected subjects. Boosting the Immune System's Natural Killer Cell AIDS is defined as a breakdown in the body's immune system; its victims die of diseases and infections the body can no longer fight, such as cancer or pneumonia. Since 1984, the most widely accepted theory is that the HIV virus is the agent that causes the immune system's disintegration. In 1949, Dr. H. Sherwood Lawrence, a pioneering in research on cell-mediated immunity and an expert in infectious diseases, made a revolutionary discovery while studying tuberculosis. He determined that an [immune response](../ImmuneSystem/Immune) could be transferred from a donor to a recipient by injecting an extract of white blood cells (leukocytes) from a previously infected, now healthy person which had developed antibodies secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system, into a newly infected patient. The discovery of unique natural killer cells or NK cells molecules which are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the education of the innate immune system. These molecules contains a factor capable of transferring immunity and thus modulating or boosting the immune system. Dr. Lawrence discovered that blood cells could 'transfer' antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity even after the cells had undergone lysis. This lymphocyte product is sometimes referred to as \"dialyzable leukocyte extract\" in the scientific literature due to being an extract from white blood cells. To communicate between cells, the immune system employs hormone-like signal substances. These unique nano molecules are one class of such immune system communication substances. An early success with Immune Boosting naturally in a young man with HIV. KG is a 20 year old with Hemophilia who contracted HIV many years ago from \"dirty\" clotting factors used to treat his Hemophilia. KG has been on many regimens for his HIV, including most recently (within the past year), an experimental regimen with no positive response. If anything, he suffered from many of the side effects of retro-viral therapy. Five months ago, KG started a high dose regimen of an immune support formula. He has remained infectious disease free throughout his immune boosting. He also came to us with very exciting news in 9/99: he has a ZERO viral count and an increasing, now close to normal CD4 count of 475!!! Is Kenny out of the woods completely? No, but he is now well on his way to possibly being disease free. Kenny is a peer counselor and educator for HIV/AIDS and he is now spreading the word about this immune support formula to members of the AIDS community. He is also a 4LR distributor and hopes to build a huge sales organization of persons challenged with HIV and Hepatitis C. As such, he said that he would not have to deal with the prejudices against those infected with HIV: seems that 4LR may just give Kenny a NEW LIFE, on many different levels. Update (Winter 2000): As many of you will remember, we introduced Kenny, a hemophiliac young man who was diagnosed as HIV positive ten years ago. After many years of experimental meds, Kenny started taking this immune support formula in high doses some 9 months ago. We announced his first ZERO viral count and almost normalized CD4 (white blood count) in our last QV newsletter. Now three months later, he has had repeated counts of ZERO HIV viral counts and a normal CD4 count. And continues to be infection-free! You may have seen Kenny's story in the November issue of Teen People Magazine. Now Kenny is sharing his extraordinary experience with others who suffer with HIV disease. Amazing what the immune-boosting power of this formula can do! As for Kim, our father our 37-year-old, father of four with Hepatitis C, he continues to very well, feeling stronger every day with virtually no GI problems whatsoever. We await his last set of liver function tests. ID, our 11-year-old with [leukemia, continues in full remission](../Testimonials/ChildAcuteLymphoblasticLeukemia), taking this immune support formula daily, and again, with no infectious insults along the way. He attends school daily and lives the life of a normal, healthy school-aged child. Magnesium Deficiency and HIV Several clinical studies suggest that between 30 - 65% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have [low levels of magnesium.](../NaturalHealth/Magnesium#deficiency) Those with low levels may be more likely to complain of fatigue (excessive tiredness), diminished energy, and confusion. Whether magnesium supplements would improve these symptoms in people with HIV, however, has not been evaluated. Intravenous magnesium is sometimes used by doctors to lower high blood pressure in a hypertensive crisis. Using magnesium supplements (even oral ones) for high blood pressure should only be done under the supervision of a competent health care provider. HIV Positive Journey into Healing - Man Recovered his Health and his Life After He Stopped Taking the Meds \"I was found to be positive in 2002. I have always been a healthy person and very intuitive about my health. In the couple of years before the positive diagnosis I had been not only neglecting my health (living an unhealthy lifestyle drinking, eating poorly, occasionally using recreational drugs, etc), but I had come under an enormous amount of financial and emotional stress. Suddenly I was also given one of the most devastating diagnosis; HIV positive. It was only then that I began to get sick. At initial diagnosis I was told, that judging from my \"numbers\" I'd probably been infected for many years (though as recently as 4 years before I'd tested negative and my girlfriend of 6 years at that time was negative despite the fact that up to my diagnosis we had been having unprotected sex and (often unprotected anal sex). Within 6 months my numbers worsened. The stress was brutal. The doctors were now practically insisting I begin medication. I had begun to clean-up my lifestyle, but I acquiesced to the meds. Then I REALLY began to get sick. I got so weak and sick I could not even get up to answer the telephone, no less work. 3 months later, at my insistence, my meds were changed. Another combination of drugs (still including AZT in some form). This was no help. I continued to be so sick that I could not function in any sort of daily life. At this point, after having always lived a life that I loved, I began to pray for death. I was so sick that this for me was not life any more. I decided I had to do something myself or die, as conventional medicine was failing me. I took the time to to take a \"vision quest\" out in the wilderness and, as my head became clearer, there was a clear message that the medical community was wrong about this and I should stop the meds and seek alternate therapies. To make a much longer story shorter; I followed my heart and instincts, stopped the meds and began to heal, get stronger and live again. At the same time some wonderful material found it's way into my hands; I was blown away when I read some of this stuff! I realized that so much of what we're being \"fed\" is unfounded CRAP. This led me even more energetically on my search for some truth and to continue doing the best I could to care for myself and to seek out and try any alternatives that might help. But I truly felt like a pioneer as the only available information out there was limited, spotty and often outdated. I began to build my own protocol; testing my own theories and those of the so-called \"dissidents\", and consequently, in the last 2 years, though my so-called numbers have fluctuated somewhat, I remain healthy, vibrant and symptom free. I have re-claimed my life. My beautiful woman is still by my side and continues to test HIV negative (though still, we never have unprotected sex any more). I have compiled a list of alternative therapies, herbs, foods, and spiritual practices that I believe is has had a major affect in my good health. I still have a difficult time dealing with the shame and loneliness that accompanies this \"label\". All the misinformation in the name of making money has caused so much fear that it is still very difficult to find many people that can discuss this unbiased. To find your website is a great gift. I want to thank you so much for your work. You are the ones who are really attempting to save lives and speak the truth, as opposed to being some entity that is only really interested in having a $40,000-$50,000 a year pharmaceutical client. I so support your work. I don't know if there is anything I can do to help you (and consequently to help others like me who, like me, feel lost, alone and scared shitless and feel they are all out there on their own if they don't buy-into conventional thinking on this topic), but I would welcome any opportunity to help. Please feel free to contact me, use me as a reference, ask me to help, ask me to work and/or show me what I can do to help my brothers and sisters in this so they are not lead down the path of sickness, despair, isolation and hopelessness. I believe with all my heart there are other answers to this. I am (so far) living proof. Tell me: what can I do to help dismantle this awful machine that's been put in place in the name of money and politics; this machine that's actually killing people? And what can I do to help forge a new, better, healing path for those who so need it? Low Cholesterol and HIV/AIDS Young, unmarried men with a previous sexually transmitted disease or liver disease run a much greater risk of becoming infected with HIV virus than other people. The Minnesota researchers, now led by Dr. Ami Claxton, followed such individuals for 7-8 years. After having excluded those who became HIV-positive during the first four years, they ended up with a group of 2446 men. At the end of the study, 140 of these people tested positive for HIV; those who had [low cholesterol](../NaturalHealth/Cholesterol#cholesterol) at the beginning of the study were twice as likely to test positive for HIV compared with those with the highest cholesterol. Similar results come from a study of the MRFIT screenees, including more than 300,000 young and middle-aged men, which found that 16 years after the first cholesterol analysis the number of men whose cholesterol was lower than 160 and who had died from AIDS was four times higher than the number of men who had died from AIDS with a cholesterol above 240. AIDS: A Second Opinion argues that the AIDS drama has exposed problematic issues having to do with the functioning of U.S. medical institutions. Null explores a new type of health care, grounded in patients' own choices and dispositions, that poses a challenge to the top-down, expert-controlled medical systems favored by the establishment. Drawing from Dr. Null's many years of study of alternative, traditional, and orthodox medicine as well as from interviews with many long-term survivors, the book dissects the claims of the AZT and drug-cocktail approach to treating AIDS and offers a trilogy of treatment strategies based on wide views of how to enhance the immune system and improve overall functioning. Dr. Douglas Willen - \"I first heard of this new field of science and nutrition in February or March of 2003. As open minded as I like to think I am, I was not very open to the information at the time. I thought I had the field of nutrition and supplementation down. After all, I used hundreds of products in my office and was getting great results with most of my cases. How could there be something out there I'd never heard of?\" I began doing the research and the reading on this subject and was incredibly impressed with the science backing these products. Four out of the last eight Nobel Prize winners won their prizes because of their [research in this area called glycobiology,](../NaturalHealth/GlycoNutrients#gluconutrients) and thousands of new research papers are published each year in the field. Needless to say, I have continued to use this type of nutrition in my practice since.\" \"The reason I am telling you this is because many health care practitioners, conventional allopathic doctors as well as alternative ones, can become stagnant in their practices, convinced that they know all there is to know. Sometimes it's not ignorance we deal with when it comes to our practitioners, but an \"assumption of knowledge\"...king of like, \"the world is flat and everyone knows that...\" mentality. This kind of pride-full arrogance can be annoying in a health care professional, but more importantly, it can be tragic. Knowing what I know now about this incredible nutritional technology, my only regret is that I didn't open my mind to them 9 months sooner. You see, during that time three of my patients passed away, from complications surrounding HIV, Hepatitis C and cancer, that I believe could have been helped with the super immune building properties of these nutrients.\" HIV+ Long Time Survivors: Drug free approach Edward Sherbey's personal experience of being diagnosed as HIV+ and being a long-time survivor -- by not taking any of the anti-virus drugs. Ed is sharing his amazing success story because he want people to stop taking drugs TO SAVE THEIR LIVES! He firmly believes the drugs are killing them. He says that there is not one shred of evidence that supports that the drugs are doing anything other than killing people. People must learn for themselves how to take responsibility for their own lives. \"...As I write this it has been eleven years since I first got tested....I take no medications, no medical treatments, no vitamins or herbal supplements, just good food and ten minutes a day of the exercise for the immune system. Had I listened to the doctors in 1988 I wouldn't be here today. Now in my mid-fifties I have a better body than I've ever had in my life. I thank God that I was smart enough to \"just say no\" to the doctors, so it didn't cost me my health. If anything, as a result of what I learned, I'm healthier today than I've ever been. Toxicologist saves patients life From Larry J. Boyd On a personal level, I developed medication induced AIDS from being treated with \"Prednisone\" at 60 mg per day for two Months, additionally, and at the same time \"Azathioprine\" was being administered at 50-150 mg per day for two weeks. Being treated with these medications for a chronic lung fibrosis, mysteriously my CD4 T cells count reached 255/ul of blood and CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.6. These are the hallmarks for AIDS. I was tested for the HIV three times and the results were always the same, \"negative\" I also developed fungal infections and pneumonia, additionally; these are also hallmarks of Big \"Aids.\" My immune system returned to normal following four weeks prednisone cessation. Additionally, The CD4 T cell count reached 657 per ul. I was cured from pneumonia and fungal infection following treatment with a short Course of antibiotic and antifungal cream. In late Dec 1997, I was given only a Few months to live. Taking daily doses of \"Alpha Lipoic Acid\" over-all my general health condition has improved. Furthermore, I can honestly state that Dr. Al-Bayati's intervention and recommendations saved my life. This wonderful book is for all peoples to read. Especially individuals with AIDS, or are HIV positive, as well as persons who are suffering from chronic illnesses and are being treated with immunosuppressive medications. The information presented can save your life, furthermore, your vital resources. This book absolutely contains the most valuable information ever written.\" Larry J. Boyd A Homeopathic Perspective on AIDS Dana Ullman, M.P.H.; As horrific as the AIDS epidemic is, it has had one silver lining: it has implanted into the awareness of the medical community and the general public the importance of the body's immune system. Prior to the emergence of AIDS, few people were familiar with or cared about the immune system.; Now more than ever, the general public is interested in exploring ways to bolster immune response to prevent the progression of AIDS, as well as to reduce the number and intensity of opportunistic infections and to improve the overall state of their health. The medical community, however, has focused its AIDS resources on creating antiviral medications, which despite great hope and expectation have not achieved the results anticipated. In fact, the leading AIDS drug, AZT, has been found to prolong the lives of people with AIDS by only seven or eight months,1 but due to its side effects, the quality of life during this time is not high. What is yet to be understood by the medical community is that they need to direct more attention and research to ways to augment immune response, rather than ways to inhibit viral replication. By strengthening a person's own defenses, the body is best enabled to defend itself. Homeopathy is one way to do this. Although no therapy can or will help every HIV+ person or everyone with AIDS, [homeopathy is beginning to develop a reputation for helping people](../Homeopathy/Homeopathy) at varying stages of this disease. To understand what homeopathy has to offer, it is necessary to learn something about a different approach to infectious disease than simply attacking a pathogen. Vitamin A reduced HIV transmission to offspring excerpt from Positive Health News) Vitamin A: In a study in Africa (Lancet, June 25, 1994, page 1593), pregnant women with the highest serum levels of Vitamin A reduced HIV transmission to their offspring to 7% compared to those with the lowest blood levels of Vitamin A who had a HIV transmission rate of 32% to their offspring. The authors of the article, Semba, Miotti, Saah at al, wrote: The underlying biological mechanisms concerning vitamin A in mother-to-child transmission may include the essential role vitamin A plays in immunity and maintenance of mucosal surfaces...Lack of vitamin A is associated with compromised T-cell and B-cell function which may contribute to higher viral loads...In contrast, a study with AZT(Zidovudine), in HIV+ pregnant women showed that the group receiving the AZT reduced the rate of HIV transmission to 8.3% compared to 25.5% in the control; group. Vitamin A certainly was as effective as AZT in reducing the rate of HIV transmission. The unasked question is whether vitamin A reduced the rate of HIV transmission because it activated the immune system to produce more white blood cells which in; turn produced antibodies to inactivate the HIV virus. On a side note, one person I spoke with recently told me that several years ago, when he had low white blood cells, his physician prescribed vitamin A supplementation to build up the white blood cells. He told me his white blood cells returned to normal values. Increasing white blood cell counts through vitamin A supplementation, suntanning or through the use of the drug, Neupogen, available from your Physician, increases White Blood Cells, the foundation of most immune system cells. Shark Liver Oil increases the production of gamma interferon, which increases CD4 counts. Dr. Richard Schulze - \"To cure AIDS, its a total life style change --- not a drug or a pill. Natural healing can cure AIDS. But if you are looking for one special anti-viral herb to solve this disease, you're as nuts as the doctors. How stupid can these experts be (and the patients, too), to believe that a single drug, a chemical on its lonesome, can cure a total body breakdown? We don't need any more research money to cure AIDS. In case you are groggy or dense and didn't get my point, I will repeat it: AIDS can be cured. Right now. Forget the DNA research. Forget the emotional fund-raisers. They're not necessary. It can also save those who are skin and bone and sores and diarrhea. If you follow all this information, you can end up cured and HIV-negative. Sympathy and understanding cannot cure AIDS. This information will cure but, only if you use it with all your heart and soul. If people would live right, eat right, think right, [use natural self healing,](../Testimonials/MailBag) and stop taking all drugs, the AIDS epidemic would end.\" Healing AIDS by Strengthening the Immune System Dana Ullman, M.P.H.; \"Now more than ever, the general public is interested in exploring ways to bolster immune response to prevent the progression of AIDS, as well as to reduce the number and intensity of opportunistic infections and to improve the overall state of their health.

Bitter Melon useful for Treating HIV Infection and Tumors Common names and their associated cultures are: - [Bitter melon: Oriental immigrants to the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_melon) - Bitterweed: Southeastern US - Cajun \"traeteur\" of Louisiana, USA - Serasee: Carribean islands - Carillon: Latin America - Kukakaya: India - Ampalayo -- Phillipines - Kho Qua: Vietnam Also: BalsamPear, Boston Apple, Bitter Gourd, Bitter Cucumber, Concombre Amer The bitter melon plant has been used in China as a treatment for diabetes, tumors, and immune disorders. In Asia and in the U.S., there has been community interest in the use of the plant as an alternative therapy for AIDS. The Bitter Melon Therapy Group, based in Los Angeles, has been organizing tests on AIDS patients and recently claimed encouraging results.; In 1990, a research team led by Sylvia Le-Huang of New York University School of Medicine, Hao-Chia Chen at the National Institutes of Health, and Hsiang-Fu Kung at National Cancer Institute isolated a protein, MAP 30, from bitter melon and found it has multiple functions that are responsible for its anti-HIV activity. Last year, they reported the finding that the MAP protein is able to inhibit HIV-1 integrase, an enzyme essential for gene expression of the virus. Bitter Melon (Momordica charantia) is a plant/fruit that belongings to the family cucurbitacea. Chinese cucumber, the plant/fruit from which compound Q (a.k.a. GLQ 223 and tricosanthin) is extracted, also belongs to this family. Bitter melon, also known as bitter gourd, bitter pear melon, karela, ampalaya, balsam pear, bitter cucumber, cindeamor, carilla plant, African cucumber, margose, concombre African, and the herbs Kuguazi (China) and Karela (Pakistan), is common in Asia as well as in Southern California and southern Florida. This leafy plant bears fruit which looks like a bumpy cucumber. The fruit, seed,leaves, flowers, stems, and roots of this plant have been used in Chinese medicine for treating gastrointestinal infections, as an appetite stimulant, to decrease blood sugar in diabetics, and to induce abortion in mid-term pregnancy. More recently, research has shown that bitter melon may be [useful as treatment against cancer](../ImmuneSystem/Cancer) and HIV/AIDS. MECHANISM OF ACTION Researchers at the University of Hong Kong discovered alpha- and beta-momarchorin, two proteins that inhibit HIV. A researcher at the University of New York discovered another HIV-inhibitory protein, MAP 30, which has been shown to inhibit reverse transcriptase and p24 expression, with very little effect on uninfected cells. A recent report on MAP 30 has shown that it may also inhibit HIV through destroying viral DNA. All three of these proteins have been extracted from the seeds of the fruit. These and other proteins that have been extracted have been categorized as Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins (RIPs). (Ribosomes are proteins necessary for the replication of viruses.) Ribosome-Inactivating Proteins, which are also present in Compound Q (GLQ 223), have been shown to inhibit the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV-l) and polio virus. Therefore, bitter melon may have similar HIV-inhibitory properties to GLQ 223 but with much less toxicity. The abortion-inducing properties of bitter melon and GLQ 223 work by preventing the interaction of syncytial cells in the placenta This same mechanism may prevent cell-to-cell infection, known as the syncytium formation. Extracts from the whole fruit have been shown to have anti-cancer properties in mice. The authors of this study suggest that the anti-cancer properties may be due in part to an enhancement of immune function induced by the bitter melon. Another study has shown that bitter melon extracts suppressed lymphocyte proliferation and macrophage and lymphocyte activity in mice. Caution: A pregnant woman should not use momordica, as it has been used as an ingredient in some abortifacent mixtures. Be careful in a case of active diabetes, as serasee (bitter melon) masks the sugar output in the urine.; Watch the diabetic's condition some other way. Serasee is believed to work in a holistic manner.; It is believed to work best if your food and water are clean and natural, and your heart and mind are pure.; If you eat foods with a lot of chemicals it won't work so well.; If you are full of toxins, use sparingly at first, as purification reactions may be strong. Mormodica works from the subtlest levels to adjust you toward health, and works best with your total cooperation in the way of diet, attitude, etc.; This is why no chemical extracts or synthetics should be made from momordica. The Emergence of Bitter Melon in the Western World Being Alive Newsletter, Being Alive/Los Angeles - June 1992; Lori Levine First introduced to the HIV community by Stanley Rebultan at a Town Hall Meeting in West Hollywood in the spring of 1991, bitter melon's reputation and usage in Los Angeles has grown considerably. Since then, many HIV+ individuals have reported success with their lab tests and heightened general well being as a result of using this alternative home remedy.

HIV does not have DNA, it is a piece of RNA and these particles are all over the universe. No one knows what being HIV+ means, specially after the HIV test was declared invalid in June of 1993, therefore no one knows for sure what is the relationship between HIV and AIDS. This information was front page news in THE SUNDAY TIMES of London, however it was not newsworthy in the United States.\" \"... Another blow to this absurd hypothesis is the appearance of individuals who have AIDS-related opportunistic infections, but don't have the HIV virus or the HIV antibodies. Back in 1994, there were 6,000 documented cases in the United States of individuals who were sick or had been sick with AIDS-related opportunistic infections, but they were HIV negative. Initially, doctors had no explanation for them, but during the Amsterdam Worldwide AIDS Conference they created a whole new hypothesis claiming that the virus had mutated and detecting it was even more difficult. \" I hope you will take the time to read the rest of this incredibly revealing article Cocktail Hangover by Frank Green Many grass-roots groups, many of which are led by healthy HIV-positive people, emphasize three things: They point out that HIV tests are non-specific and can cross-react with other viruses and physical conditions, including pregnancy, so a positive test result doesn't necessarily mean that a person harbors HIV. They endorse the notion that HIV has not been proven to cause AIDS. And they question the wisdom of taking AZT, protease inhibitors and other AIDS drugs, insisting that they're not only unnecessary, but dangerous. A growing number of scientists world-wide have publicly denounced the total failure of the HIV/AIDS hypothesis, questioned the meaning of the \"AIDS test\", and criticized the use of AZT which has been proven to be a toxic poison that makes the patient sicker and is actually the cause of AIDS deaths. The group includes scientists such as Kary Mullis, who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1993 for inventing the polymerase chain reaction used to test for HIV. A theory has been floating around for several years that AIDS and other diseases were created and spread by scientists, and some versions even suggest that this was done intentionally to eradicate certain segments of the population. A recent study published in the prestigious medical journal Lancet provides some evidence to support at least part of that theory. After ten months on AZT, I was sick all the time \"I was required by law to take an HIV test in June 1995. The test is mandatory in Colorado for pregnant women, and I was expecting my second child. I was shocked when the result came back positive, because I'd been married and monogamous for nine years. I started taking AZT in my fifth month. After ten months on AZT, I was sick all the time. I had constant diarrhea, nausea, fever, night sweats and was totally exhausted. I was crawling to the bathroom and vomiting for hours. My doctor told me the HIV was making me ill, and that the virus had mutated into a form that was resistant to AZT. Further drugs turned my skin yellow with jaundice. Since it was clear that the drugs weren't keeping me from getting AIDS and were actually destroying my liver, I let my prescription run out. I figured I'd rather die from AIDS than liver failure. Almost immediately after I stopped taking my medicines, within a matter of days I started to feel much better.... My daughter is considered a success by medical standards because she tests negative, but I don't care about HIV anymore. I am concerned about the effects of the AZT she was poisoned with while I was pregnant. Rachel has an enlarged cranium, seizures and a strange deformity near the base of her spine. At age three she still does not speak. I went to this conference on HIV and pregnancy at The Children's Hospital here in Denver. A lot of mothers there had taken AZT during pregnancy and had their kids with them. Every single one of those kids had enlarged craniums. Their heads looked exactly like Rachel's. They're all AZT babies. I'm working now to repeal Colorado's mandatory [HIV] testing law.\" Shirley - Often, when there are controversial subjects, wherein so called experts disagree, I will give information about and links to opposing points of view. In this way I feel that you can then make your own decision and choices. A problem with corporate controlled mainstream media is that stifle information; they present one point of view which becomes propaganda. They seem to be afraid of allowing the public equal access to other points of view. I have no fear of this because I believe that the truth will win out. "}
