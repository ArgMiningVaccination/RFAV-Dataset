For topics & registration, Barrett MMaMa krkrkBBBararreretttttt fatty acids (PUFAs) provides key health benefits to horses, such as anti-inflammatory protection, gastrointestinal health, and reproductive support. ReSolvin EQ features a blend of three PUFAs, acid GLA and DHA. ReSolvin EQ provides potent body-wide anti-inflammatory protection to horses, including those predisposed to gastric ulcers. A recent study showed severe squamous ulceration resolved in horses supplemented with ReSolvin EQ. EO-3 is a palatable, marine-derived source of EPA and DHA. Studies have shown that horses fed EO-3 incorporate EPA and DHA into cell membranes rapidly, conferring health benefits more quickly than plant-based sources of omega-3s.Research-Proven Sources of Powerful Omega Fatty Acids 394 | Equine Vet Educ. 2023;35:394-395. \u00a9 2023 EVJ Ltd.

Case records and gastroscopy images of horses with ESGD or EGGD treated with ERIO were reviewed. Images were anonymised and graded by one researcher masked to treatment group. Treatment responses were compared between the two treatment schedules using univariable ordered logistic regression. Forty- three horses were treated with ERIO at 5- day intervals and 39 horses at 7- day intervals. Signalment and presenting signs did not differ between groups. The proportions of horses with EGGD healing (to grade 0 or 1) in association with ERIO used at 5- day in- tervals (93%) were higher than those associated with treatment at 7- day intervals (69%; OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.23- 4.74). For ESGD, there was no significant difference in the proportion of horses healing in association with treatment at 5- day intervals (97%) compared with 7- day intervals (82%; OR 2.75, 95% CI 0.91- 8.31). Four of 328 injec- tions (1%) were associated with an injection- site reaction (1%). The authors concluded that the use of ERIO at 5- day intervals might be more appropriate than the 7- day interval that is used cur- rently for EGGD. FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION used to treat intestinal dysbi- osis. This in vitro study by Cl\u00e9mence Loublier and co- workers in Belgium aimed to assess the effect of a commonly used pre- FMT processing method on the bacterial composition and viability of the faecal filtrate . Three samples of fresh equine manure ) were processed iden- tically. The initial manure was mixed with 1 L of lukewarm water and chopped using an immersion blender to obtain a mixture (T 1 ), which was left uncovered for 30 min (T 2 ) and percolated through a sieve to obtain a faecal filtrate (T 3 ). Samples were taken throughout the procedure (Tn) and immediately stored at 4\u00b0C until processing. The 16S rDNA amplicon profiling associated with propidium monoazide treatment was performed on each sample to select live bacteria. Analyses of and diversity and main bacterial populations and quantitative (qPCR) analysis were performed and compared between time points (T 0 - T 3 ). No significant differences in ecological indices or mean estimated total living bacteria were found in the final faecal filtrate (T 3 ) compared with the original manure (T 0 ); however, different in the final filtrate. These results support the viability of the major bacterial popula- tions in equine faeces when using the described pre- FMT protocol. RECURRENCE OF SARCOIDS In this study, Ben Curnow and co- workers at the University of Liverpool, UK, investigated clinical and histopathological features of excised equine sarcoids and evaluated their association with recurrence at the original surgical site and at new sites . Clinical records and excisional biopsies from 106 equine sarcoids from 64 horses were retrieved. Biopsies were re- evaluated histolog- ically. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records, and owner- reported follow- up data were obtained by telephone questionnaire. Associations between clinical and histopathological features of sar-coids and their recurrence at the surgical site were determined using uni- and multivariable mixed effects logistic regression. Recurrence of sarcoids at the surgical site occurred in 30 horses (46.9%). Sarcoids developed at a distant site in 21 horses (32.8%). In the final mixed effects logistic regression model, only superficial inflammation was associated with reduced odds of recurrence at the surgical site (adjusted OR 0.32; 95% CI 0.10- 0.96). This suggests that the inflammatory process may play a role in protecting horses against the recurrence of sarcoids. EQUINE ASTHMA BIOMARKER This study by Sanni Hansen and co- workers in Denmark investigated the ability of neutrophil gelatinase- associated lipocalin distinguish be-tween control horses, horses with mild- moderate equine asthma (MEA) and horses with severe equine asthma (SEA) . Details of endoscopic examination including tracheal mucus score (TMS, scale 0- 5) and BAL cytology performed on 227 horses were extracted from records and NGAL concentrations were mea- sured on stored serum and BAL fluid samples. The horses were divided into three groups (control group n =73, MEA n =98, SEA n =56) based on clinical signs and BAL cytology results. Differences aaep.org/wiley-redirect |395 RE SEARCH HIGHLIGHTS between groups and correlations between BAL NGAL, serum NGAL and BAL cytology were evaluated. BAL NGAL concentrations were higher in equine asthma (EA) than in control horses (median 25.6 and 13.3 g/L, respectively). Concentrations of NGAL in BAL differed between groups, with higher concentrations in MEA than in control horses (median 18.5 and 13.3 g/L, respectively), and higher concentrations in SEA than in MEA horses (median 54.1 and 18.5 g/L, respectively). BAL NGAL concentration differed between horses with TMS 2 and > 2 (me- dian 15.6 and 21.1 g/L, respectively). No differences were found in serum NGAL concentration between any of the groups. BAL NGAL concentration differed between control and EA and reflected severity of disease. These results justify further research into the potential of NGAL as a biomarker of EA. CAUDAL LUMBAR REGION In this study, Nicola Scilimati and co- workers in Italy investigated the computed tomographic (CT) appearance of anatomical variations and pathological changes of the equine caudal lumbar region through a post- mortem examination . The 40 horses in this study had died or were submitted for eu- thanasia for reasons unrelated to the study. From all the specimens, the modified vertebral system was adopted to evaluate and describe the four most caudal lumbar vertebrae, which were numbered from a caudal reference point (lumbosacral junction), with the segment number designated within parentheses (i.e. L(i)- L(iv)). Contact of the spinous processes was detected in 21 specimens (54%) and fusion in six specimens (15%). Lumbar spondylosis was seen in 17 specimens (42.5%), more commonly on the lateral aspect or on both ventral and lateral aspects in 12 specimens (71%). The presence of spondylosis was found more commonly in older horses. There was no difference in bony density in specimens with spondylosis or spinous processes contact compared with specimens without. The highest prevalence of bony changes was found at L(ii)- L(i) intertransverse joints in 28 specimens (97%) on the left and in 22 specimens (96%) on the right side. Spondylolisthesis and partial fusion of the L(ii)- L(i) vertebral disc were found in association with degenerative pathologies. This study showed a high frequency of several anatomical varia- tions and acquired osseous pathological changes in the most caudal lumbar vertebrae via a CT examination. ACUTE COLITIS SURVIVAL This study by Kira Runge and co- workers in Denmark aimed to determine the prognostic value of serum amyloid A (SAA) and other clinicopatho- logical and clinical variables in adult horses with acute colitis . Clinical variables, SAA and other blood biomarkers, including plasma L- lactate (lactate), were assessed in 176 horses with acute colitis. A multivariate model for the prediction of nonsurvival was constructed. Icelandic horses were analysed separately. Admission SAA was similar in survivors (median 548 range 0- 5453mg/L) model for nonsurvival included year of admission, lactate, heart rate, age and colic duration of more than 24 h. Icelandic horses had a rela- tive risk of 2.9 (95% CI 2.2- 3.8) for acute colitis compared with other breeds. Lactate in Icelandic horses was higher than that in other breeds in both survivors (4.0 SAA did not predict nonsurvival. The breed needs to be considered when lactate is evaluated as a predictor for nonsur- vival in horses with colitis. Sue Wright EVE Editorial Office Email: sue@evj.co.uk ORCID Sue D. et al.

INTRODUCTION General anaesthesia of horses is associated with a mortality rate of 0.6%- 0.9% in healthy horses anaesthetised for elective procedures, but substantially higher for horses undergoing emergency abdom-inal surgery (Gozalo- Marcilla et al., 2021 ; Johnston et al., 1995 , 2002 ). Catastrophic orthopaedic trauma sustained during recovery from anaesthesia remains the greatest cause of mortality (Bidwell et al., 2007 ; Dugdale et al., 2016 ). Interventional systems, includ- ing the use of head and tail ropes, have been developed in order to reduce this risk. They are not, however, without risk of complica-tions (Arndt et al., 2020 ; Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ; Niimura del Barrio et al., 2018 ; R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). To the authors ' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a mare sustaining coccygeal vertebral fracture and secondary neurop- athy following use of a head and tail rope recovery system.

A right dorsal displacement of the large colon with a retroflexion of the pelvic flexure was corrected under general anaesthesia and interventional recov-ery using head and tail ropes was performed. The mare made multiple attempts to stand, using the ropes for support before achieving and maintaining a standing position. The fol-lowing day, marked swelling around the perineal and vulval region was noted, combined with reduced tail tone. Urination, but not defaecation, had been observed following sur-gery. Transrectal ultrasonography indicated formation of a haematoma adjacent and ven-tral to the caudal sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae. Initial radiographic evaluation was suggestive of an oblique fracture of the caudal endplate of the first coccygeal vertebra, which was confirmed on repeat radiography 7 days later. Treatment included cold com- presses to reduce swelling, multimodal analge sia, dietary modification to soften faecal consistency and regular manual evacuation of the rectum to avoid impaction. The mare was discharged after 19days hospitalisation, gradually recovered the ability to defaecate and produced a viable foal the following year without assistance. K E Y W O R D S horse , anaesthesia DAMAGE FOLLOWING ROPE ASSISTED RECOVERY laparotomy. Clinical variables on presentation are summarised in Table 1 . Pre- anaesthetic medication consisted of romifidine (Sedivet, Boehringer Ingelheim been administered previously, on admission. Procaine penicillin (Depocillin, MSD Animal Henry Schein) vaporised in 100% oxygen. Total anaesthesia time was 125 min with one episode of hypotension lasting less than 5 min, during which mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased to 54 mmHg and an infusion of dobutamine (Dobutamine concentrate (12.5 mg/mL), Hameln) at 1 g/kg/min IV was initiated. MAP remained between 62- 88mmHg for the remainder of the anaesthetic period. Arterial blood samples were taken intermittently during surgery and identified mild hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia which were treated by the addition of supplementary potassium chloride 20 mmol/L (Potassium Chloride to commercially available Hartmann ' s solution (Aqupharm 11, Animalcare) administered IV (Borer & Corley, 2010a , 2010b ). Supplemented fluids were then approximately 4 mL/kg/h. Arterial blood results are summarised in Table 2 . Exploratory laparotomy confirmed right dorsal displacement of the large colon with a retroflexion of the pelvic flexure, which was corrected and then the contents evacuated via a pelvic flexure enterotomy. Following completion of surgery, the horse was placed in right lat- eral recumbency in a padded recovery box. Romifidine 20 g/kg bwt IV was administered and oxygen supplementation was provided. Recovery was assisted using a head and tail rope system employing a static, pre- tensioned tail rope and manually controlled head rope, requiring only one operator (Niimura del Barrio et al., 2018 ; Wilderjans, 2008 ). Forty minutes after being placed in the recovery box, the horse attained ster-nal recumbency, followed by a first attempt to stand 1 min later. During attempts to stand, the mare lost her hindlimb footing several times and fell awkwardly, resulting in a number of instances of sudden increased tension on the tail rope. Following four attempts, the mare was able to maintain a standing position, 45 min after moving to the recovery box, and was weightbearing on all four limbs. Recovery quality was assessed as 3/5 based on a descriptive scale modified from that de-scribed by Young and Taylor ( 1993 ) (Table 3 ). Head and tail ropes were removed approximately 15 min after the horse achieved a standing position when it was judged to be sufficiently co- ordinated and stable that they were no longer required. The foal was re- introduced to the mare once deemed safe to do so. TABLE 1 Summary of presenting signs.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Following return to the stable, the mare remained comfortable with no evidence of overt lameness. However, within 24 h of recovery, the mare was noted to have extensive soft tissue swelling associ-ated with the semimembranosus, semitendinosus and caudal gluteal muscles, the perineal and vulva region (Figure 1a ). The mare had reduced tail tone, but was reported to be urinating nor-mally (although without elevating her tail when doing so) and had not defaecated since surgery. Neurological evaluation revealed no evidence of gait deficits but did reveal reduced anal tone. Manual palpation and transrectal ultrasonography identified a firm to fluctu-ant painful swelling immediately adjacent and ventral to the caudal sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae, consistent with haematoma for-mation. Radiographic evaluation of the sacrococcygeal region was suggestive of an oblique fracture of the caudal endplate of the first coccygeal vertebra (Figure 1b ). The mare was unable to defaecate unaided and manual evacuation of her rectum twice daily was initi-ated to avoid impaction. TREATMENT Cold compresses were applied to the vulva and Pain Management Kit, MILA) was placed aseptically 18 h after recovery Once this was initiated, systemic adminis-tration of morphine was discontinued. Post- operative antimicrobial IV q24h was continued for 3 days. Manual rectal evacuation was continued twice daily. Dietary modifications to sof-ten faecal consistency included enteral fluid supplementation with 5 L water with added electrolyte powder (EQUIVET Electrolytes, Kruuse) mixed with 1 L of liquid paraffin, administered via nasogas-tric tube twice daily. Epidural morphine was discontinued after 48 h, paracetamol and flunixin were discontinued after 7 days and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory medication continued using phenylbutazone (Equipalazone, Animal Health) 0.044 mg/kg bwt PO SID was administered whilst the mare was hospitalised. One week following surgery, radiography of the sacro- coccygeal region was repeated, and evaluation confirmed an oblique frac- ture on the caudal endplate of the first coccygeal vertebra (Cd1) with slight displacement of the fracture fragment. Fracture mar-gins were smoothly marginated with no sclerosis, compatible with acute fracture. Chronic degenerative changes between the fifth sacral vertebra (S5) and Cd1 including endplate sclerosis, facet osteoarthrosis and collapse of the disc space were also identified (Figure 1c ). The mare was discharged into the referring veterinarian ' s care 19days post- operatively. Ultrasonography confirmed the mare was in foal, although viability could not be confirmed at this early stage.

OUTCOME The mare was discharged with instructions to be grazed on lush pas- ture to promote soft faeces. Long fibre, such as hay or haylage, was to be omitted from the diet but sh ort fibre, preferably soaked, was encouraged. Manual rectal evacuation was continued by the refer-ring veterinarian, initially twice daily, reducing in frequency and fi-nally discontinued as the mare regained ability to defaecate unaided. The owners reported the mare produced a viable, full- term foal by unassisted delivery. DISCUSSION This report discusses a previously unreported complication directly associated with the use of an interventional system designed to re-duce the risk of injury during recovery from general anaesthesia in a high- risk case. General anaesthesia of horses remains a hazard- ous undertaking. Mortality rate in healthy horses undergoing elec-tive procedures is reported to be close to 0.9%, rising to 7.8% for emergency abdominal surgery (Johnston et al., 1995 , 2002 ). Despite recently published data indicating that this situation is improving, the mortality rate of colic cases remains substantially higher (3.4%) than for elective procedures (0.6%) (Gozalo- Marcilla et al., 2021 ). Recovery from anaesthesia is the most critical period, with over-all recovery- associated mortality reported to be 1.1%, increasing to 1.6% for horses undergoing emergency colic surgery (Dugdale et al., 2016 ). Mortality related to catastrophic orthopaedic trauma (defined as sustaining a fracture necessitating euthanasia of the horse on humane grounds), accounts for 38% to 72.4% of cases depending on study design and sample size (Bidwell et al., 2007 ; Dugdale et al., 2016 ; Sun et al., 2019 ). Brood mares are reported to be at increased risk of cata- strophic orthopaedic injury during recovery from anaesthesia due to decreased bone strength (Glade, 1993 ). Pregnancy and lactation result in enhanced calcium mobilisation from maternal skeletal re-sorption in addition to increased absorption from dietary sources (Kovacs, 2001 , 2014 ; Lebel et al., 2014 ). Pregnancy and lactation- associated osteoporosis (PLO) is a rare condition in women, at-tributed to increased bone turnover and decreased bone mass density. Typically, PLO is characterised by the occurrence of ver-tebral body fractures during late pregnancy or the first 6 weeks post- partum (Kovacs & Ralston, 2015 ; M\u00f8ller et al., 2012 ; Phillips et al., 2000 ; Yun et al., 2017 ). A similar phenomenon may have con- tributed to the injury sustained in this case. Metacarpal breaking strength (MBS) in lactating mares has been found to decrease during the first 12 weeks post- partum, even if dietary calcium was supple- mented. From 12 weeks onwards, MBS gradually increases, but is not fully restored until up to 24 weeks post- partum. In mares fed a calcium- deficient diet, it can take up to 40 weeks post- partum before MBS is fully restored (Glade, 1993 ). Additionally, older mares are re- ported to be at even greater risk (Bidwell et al., 2007 ). More gener- ally, increasing age has also been identified independently as a risk factor for peri- anaesthetic mortality in horses (Hector et al., 2020 ; Johnston, 2005 ). In light of the above factors, the case described was consid- ered to present a significant risk of sustaining injury during re- covery. The decision to utilise head and tail ropes was therefore taken to attempt to mitigate this risk by intervening in the recov-ery process. In endeavouring to reduce recovery- associated injury, several interventional strategies have been described, including post- anaesthetic sedation (typically using alpha- 2 adrenergic agonists), manual restraint with hand- assisted recovery (mainly reserved for small ponies and foals), sling systems, tilt tables, water tanks, pool- raft recovery systems and head and tail rope assistance (Clark- Price 2013 ; Elmas et al., 2007 ; Sullivan et al., 2002 ; Taylor et al., 2005 ; Tidwell et al., 2002 ; Wilderjans, 2008 ). Although sedation has been associated with a positive impact on recovery quality from inhalant anaesthesia (Bienert et al., 2003 ; Matthews et al., 1998 ; Santos et al., 2003 ), none of these techniques are reported to be devoid of complications and there is conflicting evidence and opinion as to whether they do improve recovery quality and reduce recovery risk overall (Arndt et al., 2020 ; Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). Recovery systems such as slings, and hydropools vary in expense and com-plexity, and require a team of experienced personnel (Elmas et al., 2007 ; Taylor et al., 2005 ; Tidwell et al., 2002 ). Conversely, rope recovery systems are relatively affordable, low maintenance, can be installed in pre- existing facilities and are adaptable to varying patient size. Whilst these factors do not negate the need for training, or benefit of experience, in the correct use of rope- recovery systems, their relative simplicity likely makes these goals more easily achievable and head and tail rope systems are the most commonly used method of assisting recovery in equine hospitals (K\u00e4stner, 2010 ). This technique consists of two ropes, one attached to a purpose- made halter which aids control of direction of horses standing attempts whilst the other, attached to the tail, acts to stabilise attempts to stand (Arndt et al., 2020 ; Wilderjans, 2008 ). Each rope runs independently through metal rings or pulleys an-chored into the recovery box walls 2.35- 2.5 m above floor level, which direct the ropes outside the recovery box where they can be managed by one or two operators (Arndt et al., 2020 ; Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). A modification to this system, known as the one- man rope recovery system, consists of the tail rope being fixed under tension using a rope braking device positioned outside the recov-ery box, requiring only one operator to manage the head rope (Niimura del Barrio et al., 2018 ; Wilderjans, 2008 ). At our insti- tution, recovery boxes are equipped to permit a one- man rope- assisted recovery, the decision on whether or not to employ this 400 | JONES ET AL. being at the discretion of the anaesthetist. Factors influencing this decision include patient size, temperament, whether the horse is unbroken or unhandled, degree and duration of pre- operative de- bility, duration of anaesthesia and location of surgical site which may be disrupted by the presence of a head collar or tail rope. The horse described in this case was an aged, multiparous, lactating brood mare undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, of calm de-meanour (when in the company of her foal), broken in and well handled. Therefore, a rope- assisted recovery was the considered the most appropriate choice. In elective cases, use of a head and tail rope system reduced standing attempts, shortened recovery duration and improved re- covery quality in a prospective study of 305 healthy horses (Arndt et al., 2020 ). However, mortality rates were the same in both rope- assisted and control groups and the use of ropes did not prevent the occurrence of fracture or recovery- associated fatalities (Arndt et al., 2020 ). Two operators were required to use this system with the more experienced operator managing the head rope and giving direction to the less experienced operator managing the tail rope (Arndt et al., 2020 ). Using a similar system, application of head and tail ropes reduced incidence of fatal complications, especially if pa-tients had undergone emergency abdominal surgery in a prospective study of 1252 horses (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). The mortality rate in the assisted group was 0.6% compared with 2.2% in the non- assisted group (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). Similarly, inconsistent results are reported in retrospective analyses of single- operator head and tail rope recovery systems where a pre- tensioned tail rope was used. Louro et al. ( 2022 ) re- ported better recovery quality with rope assistance in a study of 502 horses recovering from general anaesthesia for surgical man-agement of colic. Conversely, R\u00fcegg et al. ( 2016 ) did not demon- strate head and tail ropes to be of benefit in a smaller cohort of 200 horses following emergency abdominal surgery. However, these authors state limitations included recovery box design not being ideal for rope recoveries and colic surgeries frequently being performed out of hours when less experienced personnel were in attendance (R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). These authors suggest that re- covery quality may be improved if a recovery box is designed spe-cifically for use with rope recovery, and when ropes are managed by experienced personnel with a good understanding of assisting horses (R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). Complications associated with rope recoveries are reported to be between 0.08% and 15% (Niimura del Barrio et al., 2018 ; R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). These include failure of equipment such as loose or bro- ken head collars, tail knot slippage, tail hair breakage as well as facial nerve paralysis and corneal ulceration (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ; R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). Caudal vertebral body fracture associated with rope recov- ery has previously been reported. Bird et al. ( 2019 ) described se- vere hindlimb weakness and ataxia in an aged gelding, administration of xylazine and mepivacaine, necessitat-ing induction of anaesthesia on safety grounds and transfer of the horse to a recovery box. During subsequent rope- assisted recovery, the horse became suspended for several seconds from a locked tail rope, when it is believed the injury occurred (Bird et al., 2019 ). Unlike the case reported here, however, physiological status, anaes-thetic and recovery management were very different. Indeed, the horse sustained multiple injuries during recovery (several unrelated to the use of ropes) and was re- anaesthetised during the recovery phase. Mepivacaine is a local anaesthetic and xylazine has local anaesthetic- like properties, documented to abolish action potential conduction in the sciatic nerve of frogs (Aziz & Martin, 1978 ). It is likely that these drugs, administered epidurally, were a significant contributory factor to the injuries described by Bird et al. ( 2019 ), by affecting hindlimb motor function. Failure of equipment can have a major impact, with one re- port of the failure of a halter ring leading to a sudden backward fall resulting in cervical dislocation and death (R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). Technical difficulties include ropes twisting around each other re-quiring release and re- fixing (9/100 cases), rope becoming tangled around horses ' legs (1/100 cases) and the head rope becoming locked due to a carabiner locking into a wall ring (1/154 cases) (Arndt et al., 2020 ; R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ). Human error has addi- tionally been cited as a cause of negative outcomes, with a head rope becoming detached due to an unlocked carabiner (Arndt et al., 2020 ). CONCLUSION To the authors ' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a mare sustaining coccygeal vertebral fracture and secondary neuropathy following use of a head and tail rope recovery system. Given the evi-dence that lactating mares have reduced MBS, therefore, increasing their risk of long bone fracture, that the risk is exacerbated following emergency abdominal surgery, and suggestion that rope recovery may positively influence recovery quality, the authors believe this remains the most appropriate method of recovering this patient. In review, although calm when with her foal, the mare did get dis-tressed when separated, which may have led to premature attempts to stand during the recovery period, when visual and olfactory sig-nals from her foal were absent. Coccygeal vertebral body fracture and secondary neuropathy is a rare complication of rope recovery but should be an added consideration in cases recovered with the assistance of head and tail ropes.

The product insert may be obtained from your veterinarian or by visiting www.gastrogard.com. Caution Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. How Supplied GASTROGARD (omeprazole) Paste for horses contains 37% w/w omeprazole and available in syringe contains 2.28g of omeprazole. Syringes are calibrated according to body weight. Indications For treatment and prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcers in horses and foals 4 weeks of age and older. Dosage Regimen For treatment of gastric ulcers, GASTROGARD should be administered orally once-a day for 4 weeks at the recommended dosage of 1.8 mg omeprazole/lb body weight (4 mg/kg). For the prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcers, continue treatment for at least an additional 4 weeks by administering GASTROGARD at the recommended daily maintenance dose of 0.9 mg/lb (2 mg/kg). Directions For Use GASTROGARD for horses is recommended for use in horses and foals 4 weeks of age and older. The contents of one syringe will dose a 1250 lb (568 kg) horse at the rate of 1.8 mg omeprazole/lb body weight (4 mg/kg). For treatment of gastric ulcers, each weight marking on the syringe plunger will deliver sufcient omeprazole to treat 250 lb (114 kg) body weight. For prevention of recurrence of gastric ulcers, each weight marking will deliver sufcient omeprazole to dose 500 lb (227 kg) body weight. To deliver GASTROGARD at the treatment dose rate of 1.8 mg omeprazole/lb body weight (4 mg/kg), set the syringe plunger to the appropriate weight marking according to the horse's weight in pounds. To deliver GASTROGARD at the dose rate of 0.9 mg/lb (2 mg/kg) to prevent recurrence of ulcers, set the syringe plunger to the weight marking corresponding to half of the horse's weight in pounds. If, after dosing, the syringe is not completely empty, it may be reused on following days until emptied. Replace the cap after each use. Warning Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. In case of ingestion, contact a physician. Physicians may contact a poison control center for advice concerning accidental ingestion. The safety of GASTROGARD has not been determined in pregnant or lactating mares. Adverse Reactions In efcacy trials, when the drug was administered at 1.8 mg omeprazole/lb (4 mg/kg) body weight daily for 28 days and 0.9 mg omeprazole/lb (2 mg/kg) body weight daily for 30 additional days, no adverse reactions were observed.

Efcacy Dose Conrmation: GASTROGARD, administered to provide omeprazole at 1.8 mg/lb (4 mg/kg) daily for 28 days, effectively healed or reduced the severity of gastric ulcers in 92% of omeprazole-treated horses. In comparison, 32% of controls exhibited healed or less severe ulcers. Horses enrolled in this study were healthy animals conrmed to have gastric ulcers by gastroscopy. Subsequent daily administration of GASTROGARD to provide omeprazole at 0.9 mg/lb (2 mg/kg) for 30 days prevented recurrence of gastric ulcers in 84% of treated horses, whereas ulcers recurred or became more severe in horses removed from omeprazole treatment. Clinical Field Trials: GASTROGARD administered at 1.8 mg/lb (4 mg/kg) daily for 28 days healed or reduced the severity of gastric ulcers in 99% of omeprazole-treated horses. In comparison, 32.4% of control horses had healed ulcers or ulcers which were reduced in severity. These trials included horses of various breeds and under different management conditions, and included horses in race or show training, pleasure horses, and foals as young as one month. Horses enrolled in the efcacy trials were healthy animals conrmed to have gastric ulcers by gastroscopy. In these eld trials, horses readily accepted GASTROGARD. There were no drug related adverse reactions. In the clinical trials, GASTROGARD was used concomitantly with other therapies, which included: anthelmintics, antibiotics, non-steroidal and steroidal vaccines. Management Considerations: Safety GASTROGARD was well tolerated in the following controlled efcacy and safety studies. In eld trials involving 139 horses, including foals as young as one month of age, no adverse reactions attributable to omeprazole treatment were noted. In a placebo controlled adult horse safety study, horses received 20 mg/kg/day omeprazole (5x the recommended dose) for 90 days. No treatment related adverse effects were observed. In a placebo controlled tolerance study, adult horses were treated with GASTROGARD at a dosage of 40 mg/kg/day (10x the recommended dose) for 21 days. No treatment related adverse effects were observed. A placebo controlled foal safety study evaluated the safety of omeprazole at doses of 4, 12 or 20 mg/kg (1, 3 or 5x) once daily for 91 days. Foals ranged in age from 66 to 110 days at study initiation. Gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were signicantly elevated in horses treated at exaggerated doses of 20 mg/kg (5x the recommended dose). Reproductive Safety In a male reproductive safety study, 10 stallions received GASTROGARD at 12 mg/ kg/ day (3x the recommended dose) for 70 days. No treatment related adverse effects on semen quality or breeding behavior were observed. A safety study in breeding mares has not been conducted. For More Information Please call 1-888-637-4251.

However, when complications do occur, they may vary from minor morbidities with good outcomes to catastrophic events resulting in fatalities. The case report by Jones et al. ( 2023 ) describes an oblique fracture of the caudal endplate of the first coccygeal vertebra and secondary neuropathy in an 18- year- old multiparous Thoroughbred mare thought to have been sustained during head and tail rope- assisted recovery after colic surgery. It has been well established that recovery from general an- aesthesia is a time of high risk (Laurenza et al., 2020 ), and several factors have been associated with poor recovery quality and sub- sequent complications (Gozalo- by Jones et al. ( 2023 ), the horse represented a higher- risk patient for anaesthesia- related mortality and recovery complications due to the presence of sev-eral of these risk factors. There is certainly evidence to support the use of head and tail rope- assisted recovery in horses after colic surgery (Louro et al., 2022 ; Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). In one single- centre retrospective study, horses assisted with head and tail ropes were more than twice as likely to have a good- quality recovery compared to those unassisted (Louro et al., 2022 ). Another single- centre retrospective study reported that head and tail rope assistance significantly reduced the risk of fatal complications after emergency abdominal surgery (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). However, R\u00fcegg et al. ( 2016 ) found no such associ- ation in their study and in fact, felt that technical problems with the ropes were partially responsible for the unexpectedly high number of dangerous and fatal recoveries observed in one group. So, the decision to use head and tail rope assistance continues to divide opinion (Lloyd & Murison, 2021 ) but the authors are in agreement with Jones et al. ( 2023 ) in their opinion that employing head and tail rope assistance should have been beneficial in their case. Equipment or technical failures associated with head and tail rope systems are reported. Equipment- associated problems reported in- clude tail hair breakage, tail knot slippage or loosening when pull- ing, rope detachment, head- collar loosening, loss or breakage, facial nerve paralysis from the head- collar and rope tangling with an inci- dence ranging 0.08% to Nicolaisen et 2022 ; Niimura Del Barrio et al., 2018 ). In those studies, the equipment- related problems did not result in serious injury, how- ever, in 100 horses recovering from colic surgery, R\u00fcegg et al. ( 2016 ) reported a fatal cervical dislocation injury when the head- collar ring failed, causing the horse to abruptly impact the wall. These findings imply that, while the majority of equipment failures do not result in serious injury, there is certainly potential for equipment- related ca- tastrophe. This emphasises the importance of operator experience, optimal system design, sound equipment quality and component integrity. The introduction of head and tail rope systems into equine hospitals seems to have been gradual and, in some cases, mod- ifications may have been made on a 'trial and error' basis. The head and tail rope assistance system in the case report by Jones et al. ( 2023 ) is based on a system described in the literature. The tail rope is fixed under tension using a rope braking device (wall- mounted sailing rope clutch) positioned outside the recovery box while the head rope is manually controlled, enabling operation by one person. The nature of the rope material used in their case is not described by Jones et al. ( 2023 ) but other authors describe using inelastic marine rope (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ; Niimura Del Barrio et al., 2018 ) and the current authors have experience of using elasticated climbing rope. Fixing the tail rope under tension in preparation for recovery is described by a group of authors (Niimura Del Barrio et al., 2018 ) while other authors describe man- ual tightening of both the head and tail rope as the horse stands aaep.org/wiley-redirect 404 | LOOMES and LOURO using one or two operators (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ). Del Castillo and Matthews ( 2005 ) suggest that the person operating the tail rope should balance the tension applied to the rope between pull- ing too hard (causing the horse to spook or lean on the rope) and not pulling hard enough to provide stability of the rear part of the horse. The ropes should be pulled only when necessary and only as hard as necessary to prevent hard falling should the patient become unsteady (Del Castillo & Matthews, 2005 ). In one study, the ropes were managed by two individuals; the head rope was always managed by the same experienced person and the tail rope was managed by a less- experienced person who was instructed by the more experienced person allowing manual adjustment of both ropes until the horse was standing. As soon as the horse made an attempt to stand, first the head rope and then the tail rope were tightened to lead direction with the head rope and control stability with the tail rope (Arndt et al., 2020 ). A 3- point rope system has also been described where the tail rope is manually adjusted by a second operator (da Silva et al., 2018 ). The horse described by Jones et al. ( 2023 ) 'lost her hindlimb footing several times and fell awkwardly, resulting in a number of instances of sudden increased tension on the tail rope'. As discussed by Jones et al. ( 2023 ), similar events occurred in another horse during head and tail rope- assisted recovery after suf- fering hindlimb weakness associated with epidural anaesthesia (Bird et al., 2019 ). In this case, the tail rope was locked into a rope clutch once the horse was standing successfully but when the horse fell again, there was a period of several seconds of suspension via the tail rope before the mechanism could be freed. This horse suffered a displaced caudal vertebral body fracture of the first coccygeal ver-tebra (Bird et al., 2019 ). After reviewing the literature, it is apparent that a variety of rope systems exist which vary both in their design and the materials employed, however, avoidance of the sudden ex-ertion of pressure on the tail (or neck) when a horse falls from stand-ing, appears difficult to achieve. HEAD AND TAIL ROPE SYSTEM MECHANICS There is a need for an objective safety assessment of these 'home- made' head and tail rope recovery systems. Currently, no studies have been published regarding the optimum design of these systems and therefore a lot of questions remain unanswered. Head and tail rope recovery systems utilise the principles of physics and engineering to aid horses in recovering from general anaesthesia using sailing and mountaineering equipment. These sys-tems are typically adapted to an existing recovery box and designed by veterinary surgeons without the assistance of engineers or other professional experts in the climbing, sailing and industrial lifting sec-tors. The equipment used to operate these systems is sourced from climbing and sailing equipment suppliers, that have been tested and designed for applications other than the recovery of horses from general anaesthesia. Furthermore, this equipment is applied in a way that is different from its original purpose, and no additional safety testing has been conducted. To date, there is still no consensus on the optimal design, materi- als, and equipment to be utilised for head and tail rope recovery sys- tems, nor on the associated safety implications of their use. Various types of climbing and sailing ropes, wall- mounted rings, pulleys and belay devices, carabiners and wall- mounted sailing rope clutches are commonly used for sailing and climbing/mountaineering activities in different settings. However, the efficacy and safety of these sys-tems applied to recover horses from general anaesthesia remains unclear. Further research is needed to establish the most appropri-ate materials and equipment for this purpose and to ensure that their use is safe and effective. The tension in a rope is a result of the forces pulling on it at each end. According to Newton ' s second law of motion, the rate of change of the momentum of a body is equal in both magnitude and direction to the force applied to it (Williams, 2014 ). This law states that the force (F) applied to a body with a constant mass (m) is directly propor-tional to the acceleration (a) of the body (Williams, 2014 ). Likewise, Newton ' s third law of motion states that any force exerted by one body on another is accompanied by an equal and opposite force ex-erted by the second body on the first (Williams, 2014 ). If the rope is stretched tightly, as seen in the case report by Jones et al. ( 2023 ), wherein a sailing rope clutch was utilised to fix the tail rope, any ac-celeration forward made by the horse while trying to stand will result in an increase in the tension of the rope and therefore the tail. Based on Bolormaa et al. ( 2008 ), the mean breaking load of a single horsetail fibre can range from 3.63 to 6.77 Newtons and is de- pendent on the fibre ' s diameter. A linear relationship is established between the mean breaking load and the diameter of the fibre, thus suggesting that thicker hair fibres are stronger than those that are finer. The diameter of a single horsetail fibre can decrease signifi-cantly, from 133 to 226 m along its length. Therefore, when making the knot with the tail rope, it is recommended that this knot should be placed nearer the tip of the dock, where the hair fibres are thicker and able to handle a greater load, as opposed to placing it at the tip of the horse ' s tail. Considering the injuries and technical issues reported ranging from tail knot slippage and tail hair breakage (Nicolaisen et al., 2022 ; R\u00fcegg et al., 2016 ) to coccygeal vertebral fracture and secondary neuropathy (Jones et al., 2023 ), the exact load that can be supported by the entire anatomical structure of a horse ' s tail remains unknown. There is a lack of studies evaluating the mean breaking load of a horse ' s tail (including both bone and soft tissue components as well as hair fibres), which could provide insight into the safety of rope recovery systems, particularly when using a pre- tensioned tail rope system. An important part of a pre- tensioned tail rope system, like the one used by Jones et al. ( 2023 ), is the use of a sailing wall- mounted rope clutch to keep tension on the tail rope. A rope clutch is designed with a toothed cam and a handle to control it. When the handle is in the down position, the cam is engaged and the toothed plate keeps the rope in |405 EQUIPMENT RELATED INJURY DURING ROPE ASSISTED RECOVERY place. To release the rope, the operator just needs to open the handle. The rope clutch offers convenience in trimming and adjusting (ropes can be pulled in with the clutch closed) and, in an emergency, the rope can be quickly released by opening the handle. All sailing clutches are designed to sustain medium loads which are distinct from the loads generated by a horse accelerating and attempting to stand during re-covery. In an emergency, the operator may not be able to release the rope at the right moment as reported by Bird et al. ( 2019 ) or may not recognise when tension on the tail has exceeded the breaking load of the tail structures, potentially resulting in a fracture of the coccygeal vertebra. To prevent such an injury, it would be beneficial to know the breaking load of the tail structures, as this would allow us to create a rope clutch system that would automatically release the tail when the tension reaches that threshold. It is essential to position the wall- mounted clutch at an appropri- ate height for the operator. The height should be high enough for the operator to pull the rope down comfortably, while providing them with an unobstructed view of the horse, but not too high to allow them to lift the handle of the clutch in an emergency. If the wall- mounted clutch is positioned too low, the operator may be forced to pull the rope horizontally rather than vertically, reducing their ability to apply tension to the rope and potentially creating a dangerous situation in the event of an emergency. A pulley system can be used to increase the magnitude of an ef- fort force during head and tail rope recovery. In the case of a single fixed pulley, the effort force is similar to the load and the benefit is that the direction of force is changed, allowing for pulling down rather than lifting up (Bird & Ross, 2015a ). These single pulley sys- tems are commonly seen in head and tail rope recovery systems. However, by utilising multiple pulleys to create a system, the op-erator ' s effort can be greatly reduced (Bird & Ross, 2015a ). These systems can be designed to maximise mechanical efficiency, making the task more manageable for the operator. Recovery box design is another important aspect of head and tail rope recovery systems. This can vary significantly according to the facilities available, surgical theatre layout, average size of the horses to be recovered, height of the hoist beam, among other factors. The height of the wall- mounted ring affects the angle of the rope and the amount of force applied to the horse ' s tail (Bird & Ross, 2015b ) (Figure 1 ). If the wall- mounted ring is placed higher, the angle be- tween the rope and the wall will be more acute and the force on the tail will be less (Bird & Ross, 2015b ) (Figure 2a ). Moreover, the distance between the horse ' s tail and the wall (depth) will af- fect the angle of the rope and the force applied to the tail (Bird & Ross, 2015b ). When the horse ' s hindquarters are closer to the wall, the angle between the rope and the wall will be more acute, result-ing in a decreased amount of force on the tail (Bird & Ross, 2015b ; Figure 2b ). Although, it is important to note that the rope angle is not constant as the position of the horse is continuously shifting during the recovery process. Thus, further investigation is necessary to as-certain the effect of the height of the wall- mounted ring and the position of the horse during the recovery on the tension applied to the tail. The positioning of the horse during recovery is of great importance. Some anaesthetists prefer to place the horse in the recovery box with the limbs facing the wall, while others opt to position the horse such that its back is to the wall and the limbs are directed inwards towards the centre of the box. There are pros and cons to both approaches. The first option, positioning the horse with its limbs facing the wall, allows the horse to use the wall as support when attempting to stand up while limiting the available space for acceleration and momentum build- up. One of the drawbacks of this approach is that the tail rope is positioned further away from the wall- mounted ring, causing an in- crease in the depth (distance between the tail and the wall- mounted ring) and consequently a greater angle between the tail rope and the wall, leading to increased tension on the tail. Consequently, when the horse attempts to stand, the operator needs to quickly tighten the rope to provide sufficient tension on the tail rope. When positioning the horse with its limbs directed inward towards the centre of the box, the tail is closer to the wall- mounted ring, reducing the angle and FIGURE 1 The angle ( ) formed by the wall and the tail rope is dependent on the height of the wall- mounted ring and the position of the horse inside the recovery box. If the wall- mounted ring is placed higher, the angle produced will be more acute, and if the horse is closer to the wall- mounted ring, the angle will be even more acute, reducing the tension on the tail rope.

However, in this position, the horse has less sup- port from the parallel wall and has increased space in front of it, which could result in greater acceleration and momentum while the horse attempts to stand. This could increase the risk of stumbling and make it more difficult for the horse to stand. Ultimately, head and tail rope recovery systems are widely used in equine hospitals to assist horses in recovering from general an- aesthesia. However, the efficacy and safety of these systems are still not fully understood. Equipment- related injuries associated with head and tail rope recovery systems are infrequently reported, yet when they do occur, they can range from minor morbidities to cat-astrophic events resulting in fatalities. There is a need to further in-vestigate the optimal design, materials and equipment to be used for head and tail rope systems, and to create safety standards to ensure that their use is safe and effective.

Pratt | Mark Bowen | Adam Redpath School of Veterinary Medicine and Science , University of Nottingham , Nottingham , UK Correspondence : Stefanie L. Pratt Email: svxsp6@nottingham.ac.uk SUMMARY There are few published reports demonstrating a return to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) from sustained ventricular tach-ycardia (VT) in horses. VT is uncommon in horses but can be life threatening and has been reported in horses with primary gastrointestinal disease. Lidocaine or magnesium sulfate is the first- line medication. In this case, a 19- year- old Warmblood gelding with a history of exploratory laparotomy presented with an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm and heart rate of 80 beats/min. At the time the irregular rhythm was detected the horse was showing signs of abdominal pain and had gastric reflux (net volume 40 L in 12h). The horse was being treated with a continuous rate infusion of lido-caine at 0.05 mg/kg/min following 1.3 mg/kg bwt as a bolus (Bova Specials Ltd.) when he developed the VT. A base apex ECG showed runs of wide and bizarre QRS complexes at a regular fast rhythm at a rate of 76 beats/min. This rhythm was infrequently interspersed with normal smaller QRS com-plexes at a rate of 52 beats/min creating an irregular rhythm (Figure 1). Serum Magniject; Norbrook Laboratories) were administered slowly intrave-nously to effect (total dose 20 g) with continuous ECG moni- toring. VT converted to NSR with a rate of 44 beats/min within 20 min. Following conversion, a second exploratory laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia due to the ongoing signs of abdominal pain and increasing vol-ume of gastric reflux. Shortly after induction, a relapse of VT was detected which was abolished by a further bolus of magnesium sulfate. The horse stayed in NSR until the ECG was removed for recovery. The horse remained in NSR until discharge 8 days later. K E Y W O R D S horse , arrhythmia , colic , magnesium sulfate , ventricular tachycardia Key points In a horse demonstrating signs of colic, unexplained tach- ycardia and irregular rhythms should be assessed with an ECG. If general anaesthesia is required in a horse with VT, con- version to NSR, is recommended prior to induction. Magnesium sulfate is a safe and effective treatment for VT in the horse especially where hypomagnesaemia is present.

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of EVJ Vet are less common but increasingly recognised arrhythmias of ventricular origin observed in horses, often presenting with signs of systemic disease (e.g. post colic surgery as reported by Pratt et al., 2023 ; in this issue of EVE). In comparison with other species, a clear definition of AIVR in horses has not been established but is most commonly described as the electrical activity of ventricular origin, with a rate that is more rapid than sinus rhythm but fails to meet the criteria for ventricular tachy-cardia (VT) (Karrasch et al., 2013 ; van Loon, 2019 ). Well described in other species, AIVR in small animal cardiology is defined as greater than four complexes of ventricular origin with a rate that is faster than a patient ' s spontaneous Purkinje fibre depolarisation rate but within 10% of the current sinus rhythm rate (Santilli et al., 2018 ). Similarly, in human medicine, it is defined as greater than three consecutive beats of ventricular origin that are faster than ventric-ular intrinsic escape rhythms (e.g. above 40 beats/min) but slower than VT (less than 100- 120beats/min) (Perez Riera et al., 2010 ; Rothfeld et al., 1968 ; Zeppenfeld et al., 2022 ). In horses, there is no standard heart rate associated with AIVR, but it is generally ac-cepted that rhythms of four or more complexes of ventricular ori-gin, with a rate between 50 and 100 beats/min are considered AIVR and a ventricular rate >100beats/min is considered VT (Karrasch et al., 2013 ; Mitchell, 2017 ; Schwarzwald, 2018 ; van Loon, 2019 ). Horses with AIVR can present for a variety of causes, most often associated with underlying systemic illness (Navas de Solis, 2020 ; Schwarzwald, 2015 , 2018 ). Gastrointestinal or origin toxicities, inhala-tion anaesthesia imbalances have all been implicated in causing AIVR in horses (Navas de Solis, 2020 ; Schwarzwald, 2018 ) but investigative studies into specific aetiologic mechanisms are lack-ing. In humans, these rhythms are most commonly associated with post- ischaemia re- perfusion injury to the ventricular myocardium (Perez Riera et al., 2010 ; Santilli et al., 2018 ; Zeppenfeld et al., 2022 ). Additionally, cardiac glycosides, such as digitalis have been known to cause AIVR (Santilli et al., 2018 ), and toxins, such as ionophores or hypoglycin A, should be considered in equine cases. Horses typically present with signs of systemic disease, often without any obvious evidence of cardiovascular compromise besides persistent or inter-mittent tachycardia. Without ECG analysis, AIVR diagnoses can be missed as the rhythms can be quite regular and are often mistaken for sinus tachycardia. Because auscultation is insensitive, horses found to have sustained or intermittent tachycardia should have a thorough cardiac evaluation including an ECG recording.

Mitchell 2 1 Department of Biomedical and Biological Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , USA 2 Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , Email: km424@cornell.edu Summary Accelerated idioventricular rhythms (AIVR) are increasingly diagnosed in horses, particu- larly in those with underlying systemic disease. Recognition of these abnormal rhythms is important but specific treatment is often not necessary unless the rhythms become haemodynamically relevant, with AIVR often resolving as the systemic disease improves. The goals of treatment, when indicated, include improving cardiac output, decreasing systemic and myocardial inflammation (if present) and controlling the ventricular rate and rhythm. Identification of any persistent myocardial damage or arrhythmia burden will be important for the prognosis and risk assessment of these patients in the longer term. K E Y W O R D S horse , RY MECHANISM Accelerated idioventricular rhythms are often referred to as 'slow ventricular tachycardias' with the slower rate used as the main distinguishing feature separating them from VT. The mechanism responsible for AIVR is likely increased automaticity from a single focus within the Purkinje fibre network but a re- entry mechanism or triggered activity within the ventricular myocardium is also possible (Santilli et al., 2018 ). In contrast, in humans and small animals, VT is most associated with re- entry circuits or triggered activity (Santilli et al., 2018 ); the exact electrophysiological mechanisms for AIVR and VT in horses remain unknown but are likely similar. An AIVR can compete with the sinus rhythm so depending on the period of relative relaxation or stress, either sinus or idioventricular rhythms can predominate. In contrast to VT, AIVR often abates at exercise or with sympathetic stimulation, due to over- drive suppres- sion of the region of increased automaticity within the ventricle by the sinus rhythm. ECG APPEARANCE Accelerated idioventricular rhythms can be seen in short clusters of as few as four complexes that terminate spontaneously or can be sustained for longer periods. The QRS complexes will generally have different morphology to those of sinus origin, with evidence of AV dissociation (e.g. no clear P- QRS association) and are typically monomorphic (Figure 1 ), but pleomorphism (often accompanied by varying intrinsic ventricular rates) can occur depending on the underlying aetiology (Figure 2 ). As described earlier, AIVR is typi- cally distinguished from VT based on rate, with AIVR ranging from 50 to 100 beats/min while VT will have instantaneous heart rates >10 0- 120beats/min (Mitchell, 2020 ; Navas de Solis, 2020 ; Reef & Marr, 2010 ; Schwarzwald, 2015 , 2018 ). Some idioventricular rhythms may originate from high in the bundle of His, near the atrioventricular (AV) node and are consid- ered 'junctional rhythms'. They often have a QRS morphology similar to sinus complexes (relatively narrow with a similar electrical axis to sinus complexes), but they still maintain AV dissociation indicat-ing their ventricular origin. In contrast, an idioventricular rhythm originating from elsewhere within the ventricular myocardium will often have wide QRS complexes with electrical axis and T wave changes due to slow conduction and varying repolarisation patterns (Mitchell, 2017 ; Navas de Solis, 2020 ; Schwarzwald, 2018 ). There can also be periods of isorhythmic dissociation, where the P wave and QRS complexes appear to have similar rates, but without obvi-ous association. Careful ECG analysis is important in these cases, as there can be subtle variability particularly in the PR interval. In dogs and cats, AIVR is often associated with the right bun- dle branch block and typically initiates and terminates with a fusion beat (Santilli et al., 2018 ), however, more investigation is needed into these phenomena in horses as 12- lead ECG recordings remain un- derutilised in equine patients. TREATMENT Based on the experience and recommendations of human and small animal cardiologists, AIVR does not often require treatment and resolves in conjunction with the resolution of the underlying incit-ing cause (i.e. endotoxaemia or electrolyte abnormalities) (Gildea & Levis, 2018 ; Terkelsen et al., 2009 ). While the rhythm often abates without targeted therapy, thorough investigation and monitoring for resolution remain important in these cases. Unfortunately, due to the limited investigation of AIVR in horses, benefits and indications for trea tment are extrapolated from our experiences with the treatment of VT and evaluation of the litera- ture from other species. Present indications for treatment of AIVR include concurrent runs of VT, malignant ECG findings (e.g. R- on- T phenomena), evidence of poor systemic perfusion, and cardiac dam-age on echocardiography or bloodwork (Mitchell, 2017 ; Navas de Solis, 2020 ; Santilli et al., 2018 ; Schwarzwald, 2018 ). Evidence of myocardial dysfunction on echocardiogram, changes in blood pres-sure or elevation of cardiac troponins can be helpful in determining FIGURE 1 Sustained accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) in an adult pony with extensive myocardial injury (highest measured cardiac troponin: 39 ng/mL) and fibrosis secondary to suspected toxin ingestion. Two periods of AIVR are noted in this modified base- apex ECG recording with a short period of sinus rhythm between. The first period of AIVR ends with a suspected fusion beat (sinus fused with ventricular beat), indicated by the bolded arrow. Ventricular- origin QRS complexes have a similar but slightly larger morphology to sinus- origin complexes. Note the low beat- to- beat variation of the AIVR at a similar rate to the sinus rhythm. P waves are dissociated from the QRS complexes during periods of AIVR and are denoted with red arrows. As the atrial rate increases, the sinus rhythm is captured, w hile when the atrial rate drops, the AIVR takes over. Lead II displayed. speed: 25 mm/s Gain: 10 mm/mV. |411 2018 ). In human med- icine, treatment of AIVR is not typically pursued unless evidence of ischaemia is identified (Perez Riera et al., 2010 ). Primary manage- ment should be focused on resolving the underlying conditions. If resolution of concurrent disease does not improve AIVR, additional investigation for other causes such as toxin exposure or ongoing myocardial injury should be considered. When therapy is indicated, recommendations for AIVR are sim- ilar to the treatment of VT (Mitchell, 2017 ; Navas de Solis, 2020 ), aimed at improving cardiac output, decreasing systemic and myo- cardial inflammation (if present) and controlling the ventricular rate and the underlying rhythm. Medications such as sodium and calcium channel blockers (mostly commonly: lidocaine/lignocaine hydrochloride and magnesium (Mitchell, 2017 ; Navas de Solis, 2020 ; Pratt et al., 2023 ), as a first line of therapy but there is little evidence supporting which of these two medications is most efficacious. In most cases, one medication (e.g. magnesium sulphate) is tried and if unsuccessful at improving the rhythm, then the second medication (e.g. lido-caine) is added if the patient is not already receiving lidocaine for another reason (e.g. post- operative ileus). Other anti- arrhythmic medications such as procainamide or sotalol could be considered in cases refractory to initial therapy but should be used with cau-tion as there is a limited investigation into their use, and side ef-fects have been reported in the literature (Mitchell, 2017 ; Navas de Solis, 2020 ). FOLLOW- UP Little is known about the need for follow- up or long- term man- agement of horses that have had AIVR. Horses treated for VT are typically recommended to have a period of rest, to allow for myocardial recovery and in an attempt to limit cardiac fibrosis (Navas de Solis, 2020 ; van Loon, 2019 ). While there is no published literature about long- term follow- up in horses with AIVR, a period of rest is recommended similar to VT cases. An exercising ECG and echocardiography should then be performed to ensure complete resolution of signs, evaluate for evidence of persistent injury and/or fibrosis and ensure the absence of exercise or rate- induced ventricu- lar arrhythmias prior to return to exercise. Horses with persistent or sustained AIVR may over- drive suppress the rhythm with exer-cise and increases in autonomic tone; however, even if the abnor-mal rhythm is suppressed at elevated heart rates, caution should be taken in these cases as myocardial or electrical remodelling could predispose them to ad ditional arrhythmias, collapse or death (Reef et al., 2014 ; Schwarzwald, 2018 ). CONCLUSIONS Accelerated idioventricular rhythms are increasingly identified ar- rhythmias in horses and should be differentiated from ventricular premature complexes and VT. Any horse with persistent or inter-mittent tachycardia should have an ECG performed to rule out AIVR or other arrhythmia. Specific treatment of AIVR is often not necessary and this arrhythmia is generally expected to resolve in parallel with the inciting disease process but monitoring for reso-lution and investigation into the origin should be performed, and specific treatment provided when indicated. Anecdotally, the prog-nosis is usually reasonable for return to performance except for cases involving sustained AIVR with evidence of extensive myocar-dial damage or fibrosis. Further investigation is needed in horses to better classify the mechanism, origin, risk factors and the need for treatment in AIVR as is often discussed in human and small animal medicine. FIGURE 2 A modified base- apex ECG recording of accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) in an adult miniature horse that presented for evaluation of a haemoabdomen of unknown origin (cardiac troponin 0.27 ng/mL). Treatment of the primary condition was successful and the AIVR resolved completely as the patient improved. Note that there are two QRS complex morphologies indicating two possible locations within the ventricular myocardium of suspected automaticity, each with a different intrinsic ventricular rate.

Haemangiosarcoma is a rare tumour in horses, usually originating from blood vessel endothelial cells. We present the case of an 8- day- old foal, referred for an atypical large subcutaneous mass on the left side since birth (Figure 1). Ultrasonographically it showed multiple cavities with hypoechoic content, marked vas-cularisation and fluid movement between cavities. As the nature of the mass suggested surgery would result in profuse bleeding, an initial arteriography was performed to identify the pattern and calibre of the main vessels and plan the embolisation of this vascu-lar supply. Under general anaesthesia, percutaneous puncture of the median artery was performed using a 5Fr introducer sheath. Embolisation was performed with distal occlusion of the smaller vessels with polyvinyl alcohol particles and deploying a coil in the main two supplying vessels. After 21 days, the foal was again anaesthetised for surgical excision, performing a new control angiography at the same in- tervention showing a significant decrease in blood supply, which allowed a very easy surgical excision with less bleeding than ex-pected. Histopathology showed oval, spindle- shaped, tumour- like cells, attempting to form vascular lumina by grouping together to form solid septa, giving rise to cavities with coagu-lated blood, causing degeneration and atrophy. Their nuclei were large and vesicular with a moderate mitotic index. These findings permitted the diagnosis of the resected mass as a congenital cu-taneous haemangiosarcoma. During 1- year post- surgery, clinical and ultrasound examina- tions were carried out without any signs of recurrence or me- tastasis. One year later, the foal was euthanised due to a limb fracture. No macroscopic signs of metastasis were observed at necropsy. Histology showed no signs of recurrence. Cutaneous haemangiosarcomas, although rare, should be in- cluded in the differential diagnosis of masses and growths with compatible ultrasound or cytological findings. Transcatheter ar-terial embolisation of highly vascularised neoplasms can reduce bleeding and facilitate subsequent surgical resection. K E Y W O R D S horse although rare in horses, should be included in the differential diagnosis of masses and growths with compatible ultrasound or cytological findings. Not all cutaneous haemangiosarcomas recur or metastasise, especially if they are congenital or affect very young animals. Even though it is an approach that is rarely used in horses, presurgical transcatheter arteri al embolisation of highly vascularised large tumour masses may reduce bleeding and facilitate subsequent surgical resection.

The system was utilised in three ventral midline celiotomy incisions that had dehisced secondary to superficial incisional infections; one horse that had left flank incisional dehiscence with retroperitoneal fasciitis and internal abscessation; one horse with septic jugular vein thrombophle-bitis and one horse with right neck and pectoral region chronic, extensive and subcutaneous abscessation. All wounds cultured positive for polymicrobial infections, and all were also positive for multi- drug- resistant pathogens (either methicillin- resistant beta- lactamase Klebsiella or Enterobacteriaceae ). Importantly, all wounds were managed without systemic or topical antimicrobials during the application of NPWT; and all horses were discharged from the hospital. Long- term follow- up revealed satisfactory outcomes according to owner questionnaires. Duration of NPWT ranged from 4 to 15 days in five horses, but one horse required NPWT for 70days. This study describes a technique for treating con- taminated wounds on the upper body of the horse using a relatively simple NPWT system that was effective in managing cases that involved multi- drug- resistant pathogens. This tech- nique used materials readily available in most equine hospitals and avoided the use of antimicrobials. Furthermore, by con-taining wound exudate and reducing daily wound care, it im-proved hospital biosecurity and reduced exposure to hospital personnel. The NPWT system was easy to use, well- tolerated by patients even over prolonged periods and produced ac-ceptable functional and cosmetic outcomes for the clients. K E Y W O R D S horse , contaminated wounds , NPWT , surgical site infection , vacuum- assisted closure Key points NPWT can be employed using relatively inexpensive materials, most of which (other than the open- cell foam dressing) are typically available in equine hospitals. The NPWT system reduces the number of bandage changes on highly exudative wounds and reduces personnel contact with infectious material, thus improving hospital biosecurity. NPWT was effective in resolving polymicrobial wound in- fections containing multi- drug- resistant pathogens without the use of systemic or topical antimicrobials, and clients were satisfied with the long- term cosmetic and functional outcomes of the wounds.

The foal had been healthy with no veterinary intervention required before this episode. On presentation he was tachycardic, tachypnoeic and pyrexic. Blood work showed marked leucocytosis, se-vere azotaemia and electrolyte abnormalities. Ultrasound ex-amination of the abdomen revealed a reduced bladder lumen and a large volume of free peritoneal fluid. Abdominocentesis confirmed uroperitoneum. The foal underwent a general an-aesthetic to repair the bladder: the bladder wall had a circular area of devitalisation of 5 cm in diameter centred at the apex (Figure 1) with a 1- cm diameter full thickness perforation in the centre of the necrotic area. Unfortunately, the following day the uroperitoneum re- curred, so a revision surgery was performed. The bladder wall was repaired and a large impaction of the terminal small colon and rectum was diagnosed at this point. Rectal examination post- operatively revealed a spherical mass compressing the dorsal aspect of the rectum, which reduced its diameter by approximately 75%. Ultrasound examination, cytology and culture of a fine needle aspirate of the mass revealed it to be a perirectal abscess, this was drained per rectum and lav-aged several times. The foal recovered well, regained the ability to micturate and remained healthy at subsequent post- operative checks. It is suspected that the perirectal ab- scess led to overdistention of the bladder, causing ischaemic damage and necrosis of the bladder wall at the apex, which subsequently ruptured. FIGURE 1 Intra- operative image showing cross section of devitalised bladder wall, held in forceps. K E Y W O R D S points Due to the history and clinical presentation, it is probable the foal suffered from anorectal lymphadenopathy that subsequently became infected and formed an abscess. The foal was suspected to have dysuria due to a neuritis caused by regional inflammation of the perirectal abscess. If a foal between 3 and 15 months of age presents with dysuria or a ruptured bladder with no obvious cause, a peri- rectal mass, especially anorectal lymphadenopathy, should be considered and steps to rule it out should be performed. aaep.org/wiley-redirect 416 | Equine Vet Educ. 2023;35:416.

The diagnosis is easily made with imaging, especially ultrasonography. Reported prognosis is good after a period of rest and a progressive return to exercise. This case report describes a third trochanter fracture in a 5- year- old trot- ter mare, which is atypical in terms of both its clinical presentation and management. At dynamic examination, a left hind lameness was only observed when harnessed at the track, more pronounced on the left rein and at high speed. Eventually, the mare broke stride into the 'traquenard' (trotting with the forelimbs and cantering with the hindlimbs). Nuclear scintigraphic examination revealed a marked in-crease in radiopharmaceutical uptake on the third trochanter of the left femur. Radiographic and ultrasonographic findings confirmed an old complete fracture of the third trochanter of the left femur, with a cranially bent and displaced fragment, peripheral bone remodel-ling along the fracture margins and a distal enthesopathy of the tendon of the gluteus superficialis muscle. The mare was referred to the Clinique de Grosbois for surgical treatment. Under general an- aesthesia, the fractured third trochanter was resected after transec-tion of the muscle attachments on it. At the follow- up examination 2 months after surgery, the mare was sound in hand. Imaging revealed successful resection of the main fractured fragment, despite a small fragment remaining embedded in the distal tendon of the gluteus superficialis muscle. After a period of stall rest, the mare progres- sively resumed training and then raced 7.5 months after the surgery, performing at its expected level. Surgical removal of the fractured fragment may be an option for the treatment of chronic fractures of the third trochanter responsible for lameness. K E Y W O R S horse , hindlimb , lameness , scintigraphy , trotter of the third trochanter of the femur are an un- common cause of hindlimb lameness in the horse at high speed or during work. These fractures are easily diagnosed with ultrasonogra- phy. This technique is indicated as part of the routine im- aging work- up for hindlimb lameness investigation. Surgical treatment can be an option for chronic fractures of the third trochanter responsible for gait alteration.

S. Barnes Email: hattieb@liverpool.ac.uk Summary Background : The digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) is a common site of pathology in the UK equine population, often necessitating tenoscopic exploration. Common intrathecal to fetlock canal constriction. The palmar/plantar annular ligament (PAL) is often surgically transected to relieve constriction or to facilitate surgical access and instrumentation. Objectives : The objectives of this study were (1) to establish whether diagnostic quality needle tenoscopy can be achieved in the proximal DFTS in cadaver limbs; (2) to determine if needle tenoscopy can be used to safely guide PAL transection; and (3) to evaluate iatro-genic damage when undertaking needle tenoscopy and PAL transection. Study design : Ex vivo experimental. Methods : Six cadaveric limbs were used and needle tenoscopy of the DFTS was per- formed via biaxial approach at the base of the sesamoids. Access to and diagnostic as- sessment of the proximal DFTS, as well as the completeness of needle tenoscopically guided transection of the PAL was recorded. Limbs were dissected and examined for iatrogenic damage and completion of PAL transection. Results : Positioning of the cannula/obturator unit was achieved on the first attempt 11/12 times. Laterally 16/24 and medially 18/24 proximal DFTS channels were accessed. Images were of diagnostic quality in 12/24 and 11/24 channels following lateral and me-dial approach, respectively. The PAL was completely transected in 4/6 limbs with partial transection in 1/6 limbs. The superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) was longitudinally lacerated instead of the PAL in one limb, with other iatrogenic damage limited to mild fibrillation to the intersesamoidean ligament. Main limitations : Ex vivo and sample size. Conclusions : The findings in this pilot study suggest that needle tenoscopically guided PAL transection in the live horse is not recommended currently. While diagnostic needle tenoscopy offered partial assessment of most of the proximal DFTS, further refinement is necessary before needle tenoscopy could be considered a viable alternative to traditional tenoscopy.

INTRODUCTION The digital flexor tendon sheath (DFTS) is a common site of pathol- ogy in horses (Arensburg et al., 2011 ; Findley et al., 2012 ) often ne- cessitating tenoscopic evaluation . Common pathologies identified tenoscopically include longitudinal of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), manica flexoria (MF) tears, and constriction of the fetlock canal; some of which are not detected with pre- operative imaging (Arensburg et al., 2011 ; Kent et al., 2020 ; Wright & McMahon, 1999 ). Traditionally, exploration of the DFTS is per- formed with a rigid 4 mm 25- 30\u00b0 oblique tenoscope under general anaesthesia, via a uniaxial approach at the base of the proximal ses-amoid bone at the outpouching between the palmar/plantar annu-lar ligament (PAL) and proximal digital annular ligament (McIlwraith et al., 2015 ; Nixon et al., 1993 ). The tenoscope is passed through the fetlock canal into the proximal DFTS to firstly explore, and secondly to optimise instrument portals and to guide surgical interventions (McIlwraith, 2002 ; Schramme & Smith, 2011 ). Constriction of the fetlock canal, due to enlargement of the PAL or its periligamentous tissues, can restrict passage of the tenoscope into the proximal DFTS, thereby increasing risk of iatrogenic damage from the can-nula/tenoscope, as greater force is required for surgical instrument manipulation within the sheath (McIlwraith et al., 2015 ). Tenoscopically guided PAL transection is indicated in horses with fetlock canal constriction and also in cases where the teno- scope and instruments cannot be safely manipulated within the fet-lock canal. This technique is typically performed with a hook knife, curved blade, electrosurgical device or slotted cannula with 90 de-gree blade, via an instrumental portal created into or proximal to the fetlock canal (Espinosa et al., 2017 ; Fortier, 2005 ; Hawkins & Moulton, 2002 ; Nixon, 1990 ; Schramme & Smith, 2011 ; Wilderjans et al., 2003 ). Alternative techniques include open, extra- synovial, ultrasound- guided or blind approaches (Chan et al., 2000 ; Espinosa et al., 2017 ; Gerring & Webbon, 1984 ; McIlwraith et al., 2015 ). Needle endoscopy, performed with a small diameter (1.2- 1.3mm) semi- rigid disposable endoscope placed through a 2- 2.5mm diame- ter cannula, has been described in horses for exploration of the sca- pulohumeral joint and bicipital bursa et al., 2014 ), and caudal cervical articular process joints (Perez- Nogues et al., 2020 ). Reported benefits of needle en- doscopy include gaining additional diagnostic information over that obtained through traditional diagnostic imaging, such as assessment of hyaline cartilage and identification of osteochondral fragments within the medial femorotibial joint (Frisbie et al., 2014 ); to guide osteochondral fragment removal from the metacarpo/metatar-sophalangeal joints (Bonilla, 2019 ); and the ability to perform the surgery in standing horses on an outpatient basis (Bonilla, 2019 ; Perez- Nogues et al., poten- tial benefits of needle tenoscopy of the DFTS, if feasible, would be to allow the smaller diameter needle tenoscope to pass through a constricted fetlock canal with reduced risk of iatrogenic damage and to guide PAL transection. The objectives of this study were (1) to establish if a commer- cially available needle tenoscope could be utilised to gain access to all parts of the proximal DFTS in cadaver limbs, and to determine if visualisation of the intrathecal anatomy was of diagnostic qual-ity; (2) to determine if needle tenoscopy could be used to safely guide PAL transection; and (3) to evaluate any iatrogenic damage to the intrathecal structures following the needle tenoscopy and PAL transection. We hypothesised that (1) needle tenoscopy would allow access to all parts of the proximal DFTS and that visualisation of the ana- tomical structures would be of diagnostic quality; (2) needle tenos-copy could be used to safely guide PAL transection; and (3) needle tenoscopy and PAL transection would not result in significant iatro-genic damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six equine cadaveric forelimbs obtained from an abattoir, were tran- sected at the carpometacarpal joints and frozen at 20\u00b0C for 1 week. The limbs were selected by lay- staff to prevent bias in case selec- tion. The limbs were from different horses and included three cob- types, two ponies, and a Thoroughbred, otherwise, the signalment and case histories were unknown. Before the procedure, the limbs were thawed for 12 h at room temperature, clipped and washed. They were transferred to a clinical skills facility and fixed to a sur-gical table with adhesive tape in a lateral position, allowing flexion and extension and simulating a routine tenoscopic procedure under general anaesthetic. Physical examination of the limbs did not reveal any significant effusion of the DFTS, or palpable abnormalities of the associated soft tissue structures. There was no evidence of scarring or change in hair growth to indicate previous surgical procedures in the distal limb. Ultrasound of the limbs was not performed either prior to, during or after the procedure. Tenoscopic evaluation of the DFTS was carried out with a com- mercially available 1.2- mm- diameter, 10\u00b0 working angle 100 mm long needle tenoscope (Biovision Veterinary Endoscopy) using a lateral and then medial traditional basisesamoid approach via the synovial outpouching between the PAL and the proximal digital an-nular ligament. Procedures were performed by the same surgical team with extensive experience in traditional tenoscopy; an ECVS diplomat (JDS), and a final year ECVS surgical resident (MS). Each K E Y W O R D S horse , minimally invasive surgery , EVALUATING DIGITAL FLEXOR TENDON SHEATH NEEDLE TENOSCOPY surgeon operated on three limbs with the other surgeon assisting. Following distention of the DFTS with 40 mL saline via the synovial outpouching on the palmarodistal aspect of the DFTS at the level of the pastern, between the proximal and distal digital annular liga-ments, a 3- mm stab incision was made with a No. 11 blade 3- 6- mm palmar to the neurovascular bundle between the PAL and proximal digital annular ligament on the lateral aspect of the limb, distal to the lateral proximal sesamoid bone. The tenoscopic cannula was introduced using a blunt conical obturator and directed proximally through the fetlock canal into the proximal DFTS. The conical obtu-rator was then replaced by the needle tenoscope and a fluid ingress line connected. Saline was infused via a pressure infusion bag (C- FUSOR\u00ae pressure infusor- 1000mL, Smith Medical ASD Inc.) set to 300mmHg and a 38 mm 18- gauge needle was placed in the proximal sheath to provide fluid egress. For both medial and lateral approaches, the following were re- corded: number of attempts to gain access to the DFTS, whether or not access to each channel in the proximal DFTS was achieved, and the quality of visualisation in each channel of the proximal DFTS (diagnostic/non- diagnostic). A grading system was used based on Baldwin et al. ( 2022 ) to report the visualisation based on consensus agreement between operators: failure to access a channel scored 0 for that channel, access to a channel but non- diagnostic visualisa- tion scored 1, and access to a channel with diagnostic visualisation scored 2. The proximal DFTS was divided into four channels (Table 1 ) and access to all four was attempted. The channels were approached se- quentially using manipulation of the scope alone, without manual sepa-ration of the tendons. Where channels were successfully accessed, the diagnostic quality of the images was graded. This included identifica-tion and assessment of the following structures on the ipsilateral side of the limb: superficial digital flexor DDFT within the fetlock canal and proximal to plica, and border, and the MF distal edge and medial and lateral margins. Non- diagnostic images subjectively did not allow a thorough assessment of integrity and position of these structures. Following the lateral approach, the limb was rotated 180 degrees in a longitudinal orientation and re- taped to the table to allow access to the medial side. The procedure was then repeated on the medial aspect of the limb. Following medial and lateral tenoscopic exploration, the needle tenoscope was repositioned through the lateral basisesamoid portal and into channel one (between the palmar sheath wall and SDFT). A new 38mm 18- gauge needle was used to optimise the position of a proximal instrument portal, proximal to the PAL and palmar to the neurovascular bundle. A No.11 blade was used to make a 10- 12mm stab incision into the DFTS. A blunt hook probe was then inserted into the DFTS and advanced distally through channel 1 under needle tenoscopic guidance to evaluate accessibility. The probe was then removed and a curved hook knife (Reiter Leibinger) inserted in its place. Once the hook knife was located at the distal border of the PAL, it was rotated to engage the distal edge of the PAL before being retracted proximally, transecting the PAL (Video S1 ). The total time taken for the procedure (exploration and PAL transection) from the first skin incision for the lateral tenoscopy portal to completion of the PAL transection was recorded in all limbs. Following all procedures, anatomical dissection of the DFTS was performed by the same two operators (JDS and MS) to establish the completeness of the PAL transection (not transected, partially transected, fully transected) and to determine the location, length, and depth of any iatrogenic injuries to the DFTS or intrathecal struc-tures. Iatrogenic damage was measured using a modified (curved tip removed) orthopaedic depth gauge and graded as none, mild if fewer than 3 shallow ( <2mm) injuries were identified, moderate if 3- 5 in- juries were identified or any injuries deeper than 2 mm but less than 4mm were identified, and severe if over 5 injuries or lesions deeper than 4mm were identified. RESULTS Insertion of the needle tenoscope and confirmation of correct po- sitioning within the DFTS was possible in all limbs with success-ful introduction on the first attempt in 11/12 approaches. Two attempts were necessary for the lateral approach in limb 4. The length of time for the procedure ranged from 17.5- 62 min (mean 35.5 min; STD 15.1 min). The visualisation scores for the ipsilateral segment of each channel in each limb are listed in Table 2 . Failure to access channels resulted from the horse ' s ipsilateral heel obstruct- ing movement of the handpiece, and/or excessive bending of the needle tenoscope owing to its reduced stiffness. Non- diagnostic visualisation following access to a given channel resulted from a combination of low manoeuvrability owing to excessive bending of the tenoscope, and the limited field of view afforded by the 10\u00b0 working angle of the was achieved in 12/24 (50%) and 11/24 (46%) channels following a lateral and medial approach, re-spectively (Figure 1 ).

In two limbs, the instrument portal was created blindly as the needle used for portal positioning could not be visualised enter- ing through the palmarolateral wall of the DFTS (limbs 4 and 5). Complete PAL transection was performed successfully in 4/6 limbs based on dissections following the tenoscopic procedures (Figure 2 ). One limb (limb 5) had a partially transected PAL (only the distal half of the ligament was transected), and in one limb (limb 2) the SDFT was mistaken for the PAL and had a 3 cm long full thickness inci-sion; the PAL had not been transected in this limb. Iatrogenic injury was classified as mild in five limbs and severe in the limb in which the SDFT was incised. All iatrogenic injuries in the five limbs with mild iatrogenic injury were <1mm in length and <1mm deep and appeared to have been caused by manipulations of the needle teno-scope within the DFTS. An association between visibility score and iatrogenic injury could not be made due to the low overall numbers in the study. DISCUSSION This cadaveric study highlights some of the limitations of needle tenoscopy for diagnostic exploration of the proximal DFTS, and for guiding PAL transection. Complete diagnostic needle tenoscopy of all four channels of the proximal DFTS was not possible in any limb either from a medial or lateral basisesamoid approach. Overall, ex-ploration with diagnostic quality visualisation was achieved in only 23/48 (48%) channels. In one limb, the SDFT was mistaken for the PAL and was severely injured during attempted PAL transection. Our findings led to the rejection of our a priori hypotheses. There are numerous key differences between traditional teno- scopes used for DFTS tenoscopy and the needle tenoscope used in this study. First, the needle tenoscope is not rigid like a traditional tenoscope and due to the thin metal, it did not offer the requisite resistance to the blunt forces necessary to guide the tenoscope into and between channels. This lack of rigidity of the needle te-noscope prevented completeness of the DFTS exploration due to concerns of the tenoscope breaking. A study investigating needle bursoscopy of the bicipital bursa also noted that the 'fragility' of the needle tenoscope contributed to reduced visibility and led the au-thors to conclude that needle tenoscopy of the bicipital bursa was not feasible (Canola et al., 2021 ). Access to the intertendinous recess of the carpal sheath with a needle tenoscope was only partially suc-cessful in 4/6 standing horses due to tension on the flexor tendons (Bonilla, 2019 ; Miagkoff & Bonilla, 2020 ). In this latter study, the regular 2.2 mm cannula provided with the tenoscope was replaced by a thicker cannula (2.4 mm) due to excessive bending noted in the early cases (Miagkoff & Bonilla, 2020 ). It is possible that this may be of benefit in the DFTS. Conversely, needle endoscope flexibility has been noted to be advantageous when performing needle en-doscopy in other synovial structures, including the navicular bursa (M\u00e4hlmann et al., 2015 ). The flexibility of the needle endoscope in the navicular bursa compensated for the smaller field of view com-pared with traditional endoscopes (M\u00e4hlmann et al., 2015 ).

Owing to the unique anatomy and confined nature of the DFTS, use of the complete field of view is often necessary in traditional tenoscopy (McIlwraith et al., 2015 ). A small field of view coupled with the lack of manoeuvrability of the needle tenoscope prohibited visualisation of the wall of the DFTS for creation of the instrument portal in two limbs, and directly led to failure to access channels and poor visuali-sation within the channels. The anatomy of the DFTS requires rigidity of the tenoscope to apply blunt force to move between channels as the tendons are elas- tic and resist displacement. Iatrogenic damage resulting from the needle tenoscope itself was mild and it is likely that the non- rigid nature of the tenoscope provided some protection to the intrathecal structures. It is possible that having the cadaver limbs transected at the carpometacarpal joint may have affected the tension in the tendons\u2014 most notably the SDFT due to the absence of its acces- sory ligament in these cadavers when compared in vivo tenoscopy. This reduced tension in the SDFT in this study may have resulted in artificially low levels of iatrogenic damage compared with potential clinical cases. Limited manoeuvrability of the needle tenoscope in the DFTS confirmed the need for biaxial approach, an unnecessary requirement of a traditional tenoscopy. Needle tenoscopy as a tool to guide transection of the PAL has not been previously reported. PAL desmotomy is often performed to alleviate constriction of the fetlock canal (McIlwraith et al., 2015 ; Nixon et al., 1993 ; Wright & McMahon, 1999 ) and during resection of torn manica flexorias to facilitate manipulations of the instruments and tenoscope (Findley et al., 2012 ). Several alternatives to tradi- tional tenoscopically guided PAL transection such as open (Gerring & Webbon, 1984 ), blind (Chan et al., 2000 ; McGhee et al., 2005 ), and ultrasound- guided transection (Espinosa et al., 2017 ) have been described; however, these techniques carry risk of incomplete PAL transection, iatrogenic damage to intrathecal structures and are as-sociated with increased risk of infection and other post- operative morbidities, such as synovial fistulation and infection al., ; Fortier, 2005 ). Needle tenoscopically guided PAL tran- section was successful in 4/6 limbs, and it is likely that with refined techniques the success rate could be improved, but further research FIGURE 1 Needle tenoscope images from limb 5 showing channel one (a) and channel four with the intact manica flexoria (b).

The palmar surface of the superficial digital flexor tendon is labelled (SDFT). DL Pa SDFT M422 | BARNES ET AL. is necessary before utilising the technique described herein in clini- cal cases. Furthermore, as none of the limbs had evidence of fetlock canal constriction or PAL thickening, translation of the technique described here to clinical cases with fetlock canal constriction is unknown. Creation of instrument portals under visualisation is preferred as inadvertent injury to the tendons can be avoided. Due to a lack of adequate visualisation, the creation of two instrument portals was performed blindly. Despite this, there was mild iatrogenic trauma in 5/6 limbs and none of the damage was associated with instrument portal creation. Lack of adequate visualisation in one limb resulted in incomplete transection of the PAL proximally. In other studies where needle endoscopy was used to guide surgical interventions, instrument portal locations did not lie at the periphery of the field of view (Bonilla, 2019 ) and therefore this problem was not encoun- tered. A needle endoscope with an oblique facing camera similar to conventional endoscopes used for arthroscopy and tenoscopy may improve visualisation within the DFTS and allow visualisation of por-tal creation. In one limb, the SDFT was mistaken for the PAL and was lac- erated longitudinally. This type of iatrogenic injury in a live horse would likely prevent a future career as an athlete. In this limb, channel 1 was accessed but visualisation was non- diagnostic. Channel 2 was deemed not to be accessible. However, it is likely that the tenoscope was positioned in channel 2 rather than chan- nel 1 during creation of the instrument portal and subsequent at-tempted PAL transection resulting in SDFT injury. Undoubtedly, reduced manoeuvrability and a small field of view contributed to this error. The PAL should only be transected when there is clear anatomical visualisation of the palmar sheath wall and the flexor tendons. The duration of the procedures varied widely between limbs. Due to the low number of limbs used, statistical analysis was not performed however subjectively an association between visualisa-tion scores and length of procedure could be appreciated with the lowest visibility score having the longest duration of procedure (limb 4). However, the highest visibility score was not the quickest proce-dure. It is possible that several factors may have contributed includ-ing operator experience with needle tenoscopy, the lack of rigidity of the tenoscope, poor visualisation, unidentified limb pathology, and/or anatomical variations associated with breed or type. The results from this investigation suggest that there may be reduced accessibil-ity in some breeds such as cobs. Several previous studies have recommended the use of nee- dle endoscopy as a diagnostic tool for use in standing horses (Bonilla, 2019 ; Canola et al., 2021 ; Frisbie et al., 2014 ; Kadic & Bonilla, 2020 ; Miagkoff & Bonilla, 2020 ; Pouyet & Bonilla, 2021 ). Our cadaveric study did not investigate whether the procedure could be performed in standing horses, but the techniques described here would present challenges in the standing horse: the requirement to perform the procedure with the limb in a non- weight bearing position, the requirement for a biaxial approach, and the insertion of the tenoscope in a distal to proximal direction where the handle of the tenoscope may contact the ground surface. To mitigate the effect of an unfamiliar limb position on surgical performance in this pilot study, limbs were positioned in lateral recumbency. This also allowed us to test the performance of the tenoscope against previous clinical experience with traditional tenoscopy. Further studies are warranted to in-vestigate DFTS tenoscopy techniques that are translatable to clin-ical use in standing horses. There are several limitations of this study. Only six limbs under- went needle tenoscopy in this study which limits the weight of our conclusions and prevents the application of statistical evaluations. We had limited knowledge of patient signalment and limbs appeared to be from horses without DFTS pathology and PAL constriction. It remains unclear if assessment of the proximal DFTS would be affected by intrathecal pathology or fetlock canal constriction. Furthermore, the assessment of intrathecal structures in this case was subjective whereas objective measurement of the visualisation of each anatomical structure may have provided further objective data. CONCLUSIONS Needle tenoscopy of the DFTS requires further refinement prior to recommending its use in clinical cases. Diagnostic needle tenos-copy of the DFTS resulted in only mild iatrogenic trauma but nee-dle tenoscopically guided PAL transection resulted in severe injury to the SDFT in one limb. Needle tenoscopically guided transection of the PAL cannot therefore be recommended currently. Improving manoeuvrability by stiffening the cannula may facilitate access to all proximal DFTS channels although there may be a corresponding increase in the risk of iatrogenic damage. Investigation of alterna-tive needle tenoscopic portals to optimise exploration of the DFTS, particularly in standing horses, and to control instrument portal cre-ation may be necessary. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of nee-dle tenoscopy in diagnosing common intrathecal pathologies needs to be compared with traditional tenoscopy before recommending the technique as a diagnostic tool in clinical cases.

Lawson Email: aprillilylawson@gmail.com Summary Background : There is limited evidence regarding the treatment and outcomes of larval cyathostominosis. Objectives : To describe the presentation, treatment and outcomes of horses with larval cyathostominosis in two equine hospitals. Study design : Retrospective, multicentred cohort study. Methods : Clinical records were reviewed (2009- 2020). Inclusion criteria included a diag- nosis of larval cyathostominosis (determined by faecal assessment and/or post- mortem examination). Data were assessed for normality. Descriptive analysis was performed for frequency results and central tendencies. Statistical analysis between survivors and non-survivors was determined by Chi- square/Fisher ' s exact test for categorical variables, and Student ' s t - test/Mann- Whitney for continuous variables. Results : Of 38 cases, 21 (55%) were nonsurvivors (3/38 dead on arrival). Nonsurvivors died by days\u00b12.4. 61 beats/min shedding of Salmonella spp. occurred in four cases. The mean last recorded albumin was 18.6 g/L \u00b14.5 and 5/35 and plasma in 17/35 cases. Anthelmintic treatment was administered in 25/35 cases, of which 22 also received corticosteroids. Recumbency prior to admission ( p = 0.037) and administration of isotonic fluid therapy ( p = 0.027) were associated with nonsurvival. From peripheral blood analysis, lower TP ( p = 0.006) and higher SAA ( p = 0.050) concentrations at admission as well as lower last recorded TP ( p = 0.002) and lower last recorded albumin concentrations ( p = 0.028) were associated with nonsurvival. Main limitations : Results may not be applicable to other populations. Conclusions : Referred cases of larval cyathostominosis have a low survival rate. Several variables are associated with reduced survival: history of recumbency, isotonic fluid ther- apy, elevated SAA at admission, low TP at admission, low last recorded TP and low last recorded albumin. aaep.org/wiley-redirect |425 OUTCOMES OF HOSPITALISED HORSES WITH LARVAL CYATHOSTOMINOSIS INTRODUCTION Cyathostomin parasites, often referred to as small strongyles, re- main prevalent in the horse population and, in many studies have been reported in close to 100% of horses examined (Collobert- Laugier et al., 2002 ; Morariu et al., 2016 ). Heavy cyathostomin bur- dens may lead to encysted stages of the parasite developing in the colon and caecal mucosa. Severe disease may ensue upon the mass emergence of these encysted stages from the mucosa, termed larval cyathostominosis. Over the last 20- 30years there has been a shift in the commonest groups of parasites causing fatal infections from Strongylus vulgaris Anoplocephala perfoliata to (Sall\u00e9 et al., 2020 ). Despite the high prevalence of these parasites in the horse pop- ulation and the potential to cause severe disease, there has been little information published in recent years detailing treatment out-comes of larval cyathostominosis cases. Many of the published clin-ical studies of larval cyathostominosis are from the 1980- 90s and include retrospective studies of small numbers (1- 15 horses) of clini-cal cases (Giles et al., 1985 ; Mair, 1993 , 1994 ; Mair & Pearson, 1995 ; Murphy et al., 1997 ; Reilly et al., 1993 ), with one study of experimen- tal infection of nine ponies (Murphy & Love, 1997 ). More recently, a retrospective study of 24 horses diagnosed with larval cyatho-stominosis by post- mortem examination in Canada indicated that the cyathostomin infestation was the primary cause of the horses ' clinical disease in 19 (79%) cases (Peregrine et al., 2006 ). Further recent publications include a retrospective study of 12 clinical cases (Bodecek et al., 2010 ) and an assessment of an outbreak with a study population of 23 horses, 14 of which displayed clinical signs of overt larval cyathostominosis (Walshe et al., 2021 ). Once horses are affected by the clinical syndrome of larval cy- athostominosis, this can lead to life- threatening disease with re- ported nonsurvival of 60% (Giles et al., 1985 ). To date, no study of this syndrome has assessed any association between clinicopatho- logical data and treatment with survival outcomes of hospitalised cases. Studies of larval cyathostominosis cases with specific assess-ment of the efficacy of supportive treatments are sparse. The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological data and treatment outcomes of horses affected by larval cyatho- stominosis that were referred to two UK equine hospitals. The study tested the hypothesis that the clinicopathological data would be sig-nificantly associated with outcome in the hospitalised horses with larval cyathostominosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study. Clinical records were reviewed (January 2009- January 2020) of horses that were admitted to two UK equine hospitals. The primary inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of larval cyathostominosis determined by the presence of multiple cyathos-tomins within the faeces and/or based on evidence of larval cyathos-tominosis on post- mortem examination. Statistical analysis Data were assessed for normality using Skewness, Kurtosis and his- togram analysis. Descriptive analysis was performed with frequency for categorical variables and central tendencies for continuous variables. Central tendencies were described for variables normally distributed utilising the mean (and standard deviation [SD]), and for those not normally distributed with the median (and interquartile range [IQR]). Percentages for frequency results have been given to the closest whole number. The denominator varied due to a small number of missing data for each variable measured; this was de-noted for each variable measured. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 26 (IBM Corporation) for assessment between survivors and nonsurvivors with a Chi- square/Fisher ' s exact for categorical variables. Normally distributed continuous variables were analysed using parametric analysis of Student ' s t - test and data that were non- normally distrib- uted were analysed using nonparametric analysis of Mann- Whitney U . Significance was set at p 0.05. RESULTS A summary of signalment, clinical findings, laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes can be found in Tables 1 and 2 . Signalment The horses presented in this study had a median age of 2 years (IQR 1.9- 3.0). There was a predominance of Cob (17/38) breeds, ac- counting for 45% of the cases, and a smaller number of other breeds grouped as Warmbloods (4/38), other horse breeds (11/38) and other pony breeds (6/38). There were 20 mares, 8 geldings and 10 stallions/colts. Season The horses were selected if they met the inclusion criteria over the 11- year period between January 2009 and January 2020 ( n = 1 from the year 2009, n = 5 from 2010, n = 4 from 2011, n = 3 from 2012, n = 5 from 2013, n = 1 from 2014, n = 2 from 2015, n = 1 from K E Y W O R D S horse , cyathostomin , diarrhoea , small red worms , small strongyles , survival 426 | LAWSON ET AL. 2016, n = 5 from 2017, n = 2 from 2018, n = 7 from 2019, n = 2 from January of 2020). The majority (34/38; 89%) of the horses were presented in the winter and spring months of December- May ( n = 1 October, n = 2 November, n = 6 December, n = 16 January, n = 4 February, n = 5 March, n = 2 April, n = 1 May and n = 1 July). History Most horses that presented to the referral hospital for larval cyathos- tominosis treatment had of recumbency was reported in 16/38 horses (42%). Most horses had a known anthelmintic history and 14/38 (37%) had been proportion 10/38 (26%) of horses had an unknown anthelmintic treatment history. Many horses (16/38; 42%) had received anthelmintic treatment within 2weeks of arrival to the hospital. Admission clinical findings Of 38 cases, three were dead on arrival, meaning the de- nominator for clinical parameters was 35 horses at maximum.

Intestinal borborygmi were present in most (33/34; 97%) horses when recorded. Ventral oedema was not a common fea- ture, with only 9% (3/35 horses) presenting with this clinical sign. Many (26/34; 76%) horses presented with abnormal mucous membranes, with abnormal colour such as pale, congested, tacky, injected and hyperaemic, and/or prolonged capillary refill time (defined as >2s). Diarrhoea was recorded on presentation to the hospital in 33/36 (92%) (including those that were dead on arrival). The me- dian number of days of diarrhoea prior to referral was 3 (IQR 1- 7; range 0- 42days). Eight horses had an unknown duration of diar- rhoea, and three horses did not have the duration recorded in the clinical notes. Thirty- six horses had their faeces cultured and 4 (11%) horses re- turned with positive Salmonella spp. culture results. Faecal worm egg count counts were performed in 21/38 (55%) horses and the median count was 50 strongyle eggs per gram (epg) (IQR 0- 113). Tapeworm were obtained for 11/38 (29%) horses and of these, they had a median value of 0.42 O.D. (IQR 0.18- 0.84). Most horses (5/11; 45%) tape- worm infection intensity (defined between 0.2- 0.7 O.D.), whereas 3/11 (27%) had a result ( <0.2 3/11 (27%) had a high >0.7 O.D.). Nineteen horses had a recorded transabdominal ultrasound ex- amination performed on admission. Liquid content of the large colon was noted in a small number of horses (5/19; 26%). A more common ultrasound finding was a thickened large colon wall (normal <5mm) which was observed in 11/19 (58%) horses. Haematology and biochemistry Clinical pathology reference values stated below have been ob- tained from Rossdales Laboratories for adult non- Thoroughbred horses (Rossdales Laboratories Reference Ranges, 2016 ). Leucocytosis (mean 17.1 \u00d710 9 /L\u00b19.1\u00d710 9 /L, n = 38 horses) and neutrophilia (mean 14.1 \u00d710 9 /L\u00b18.5\u00d710 9 = 33) was identified in 89%, neutropenia ( n = 2) in 5% and normal neutrophil counts ( n = 2) in 5%. The packed cell volume (PCV) was for the majority ( n = 23, 61%) within the normal reference range (PCV 31% to 43%), and a smaller proportion of horses were anaemic ( n = 7, 18%) or haemoconcentrated ( 21%). The mean PCV was 38.4% \u00b111.4 ( n = 38) with a range from 10% to 75%. Common biochemistry features were hypoalbuminaemia ( n = 33, 89%) and only four (11%) horses had a normal albumin concentra- tion on admission (reference range 29- 41g/L). albumin on admission was 21.6 g/L \u00b16.0 ( n = 37). Hyperfibrinogenaemia (reference range 0.3- 3.9 g/L) was identified in 15/18 (83%) horses (mean 7.4 g/L\u00b12.6, n = 18) and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA) concentration (reference range 0- 20mg/L) was IQR 117.0- 1460.0, n = 15). The total protein concentration (TP) was measured in all horses and had a mean value of 57.9 g/L \u00b112.9 (reference range 53- 73g/L). Most had TP (hypoproteinaemia n = 14 [37%], normal TP n = 18 [47%], hyperproteinaemia n = 6 [16%]). The globulins were recorded for 30 horses and the mean was 35.0 g/L \u00b18.8 (reference range 18- 38g/L), the majority were within reference range ( n = 21; 70%) and only 9 (30%) horses had a hyperglobulinaemia. Measures of kidney function were predominantly within the normal reference ranges. Urea concentration had a median value of 7.7mmoL/L (IQR 5.2- 14.3, n = 28) and creatinine had a median Variable Categories stated for categorical data or where applicable continuous data denoted Frequency Chi- square or Fisher ' s exact test Student ' s t - test or Mann- Whitney U test Total Survivor Nonsurvivor Colic following No 21 13 8 0.288 Yes 4 1 3 Outcomes Last recorded TP Continuous 34 N/A 0.002* Last recorded albumin Continuous 27 N/A 0.028* Note : The horses have been divided into survivors and nonsurvivors to discharge.

However, an elevated urea concentration was noted in 10/28 (36%) horses and an elevated creatinine concentration in 3/29 (10%) horses. The cre-atine kinase (CK) concentration was mildly elevated in all cases with a mean value of 416.6 iu/L ( \u00b1116.4, n = 7). Treatment 31/35 (89%) horses, nonsteroi- dal 5/35 (14%) (4/5 and plasma in 17/35 (49%) cases. Anthelmintic treatment was administered in 25/35 (71%) cases, of which 22 (88%) also received corticosteroids. Colic signs were noted in 4/25 (16%) horses shortly following anthelmintic treat-ment. Most horses were administered a moxidectin product (14/25; 56%) and a smaller number 24%) as anthelmintic treatment hospitalisation. Of the six horses who received an ivermectin product, one horse received a repeat anthelmintic treatment with moxidectin 4 days later and survived to discharge home, two horses died shortly (1- 3days) following anthelmintic treatment, one horse received moxidectin 3 days beforehand and survived to discharge home, one horse was euthanised due to persistent colic signs since admission and one horse was euthanised due to continued clinical deterioration 6 days later. Outcomes Overall, horses continued to be hypoproteinaemic (59%; 20/34) (mean 52.3 g/L\u00b113.6, hypoalbuminaemic (mean 18.6 g/L\u00b14.5, n = 27) during hospitalisation. The period of time between the admission and last recorded measurement (albu-min and TP) varied between cases (albumin median 3 days [IQR 1- 5] and TP median 3 days [IQR 1- 6]) due to differing lengths of hospi- talisation. The timeframe between the last recorded measurement was very close to the discharge or euthanasia date (albumin median 0days [IQR 38 cases, 21 (55%) were nonsurvivors (including 3/38 dead on arrival). Nonsurvivors died by a mean of 2.9 days\u00b12.4. Post- mortem examination was performed on 12/21 (57%) nonsurvivors and identified pathology supportive of cyathostominosis (typhlo-colitis/colitis with evidence of multiple encysted and emerging cyathostomins grossly, and a number [7/12; 58%] of cases were also supported by histopathology findings). Cyathostomins were identified in the faeces of 30 horses at ante- mortem. The survivors (17/38; 45%) were hospitalised for a median of 7 days (IQR 4.5- 10.0) until discharge home. Association with nonsurvival Recumbency prior to admission ( p = 0.037) and administration of isotonic fluid therapy ( p = 0.027) were associated with nonsurvival. At admission, lower TP ( p = 0.006) and higher SAA concentrations ( p = 0.050) were associated with nonsurvival. While following the progression of the cases at the hospitals, a lower last recorded TP ( p = 0.002) and lower last recorded albumin concentration ( p = 0.028) were also associated with nonsurvival (Table 2 ). For data variables associated with nonsurvival, the central tendencies and frequency data for the variables when divided into the survivor and nonsurvivor groups are outlined in Table 3 . Association between colon wall thickness and protein measurements No association could be found between whether the colon wall was thickened (ultrasonographically) or not, and any of the protein meas-urements (albumin, globulin or TP). DISCUSSION In line with previous publications, the horses affected by larval cy- athostominosis captured in this study were predominantly young adult horses (median age of 2 years old) that were mainly presented during winter and spring months (Bodecek et al., 2010 ; Peregrine et al., 2006 ; Reid et al., 1995 ). The overrepresentation of Cob breeds in this study could be attributed to inadequate parasitic control strategies in this sub- population. A recent publication assessing parasite burdens at post- mortem examination from Normandy, France categorised the breeds affected into three groups (1. French trotter, 2. Thoroughbred, 3. miscellaneous [which included, French saddlebreds, draught horses, Arabians, ponies and other sports horses]) 2020 ). In the miscellaneous breeds, cyathostominosis represented 76% of total deaths due to parasite infections; however, this syndrome less fre-quently affected racehorses (Thoroughbreds 16% and French trotters 11%). The higher prevalence reported in specific breeds may be due to poor management of this sub- population of horses and/or inadequate anthelmintic treatment and/or diagnosis. Sall\u00e9 et al. ( 2017 ) identified that the premises that seek veterinary advice are more likely to be stud farms compared to riding schools (Sall\u00e9 et al., 2017 ). The types of sta- bles that implement evidence- based recommendations may contribute to the breed difference in those afflicted by larval cyathostominosis. It is unlikely to be attributed to the caseload seen at the hospitals, as the admission data for the period of investigation between January 2009 and January 2020 was assessed for the University of Liverpool and Cob breeds only accounted for 10.7% of the breeds admitted to the hospital. At Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic, the last 2 years ' admissions data between January 2021 and November 2022 was assessed and Cobs account for 10.4%. |431 OUTCOMES OF HOSPITALISED HORSES WITH LARVAL CYATHOSTOMINOSIS Diarrhoea was a consistent feature in the clinical history (92%) and the small number of horses without diarrhoea recorded could have been due to early referral, owner not recognising this clinical sign or inaccurate clinical records. Alternatively, horses with lar-val cyathostominosis may occasionally present without diarrhoea (Mair, 1994 ). We were unable to establish in all cases the longevity or if the diarrhoea was recurrent; most horses had a history of acute diarrhoea. A retrospective review of 51 referred cases with chronic diarrhoea, revealed that the most common causative condition was \"larval cyathostomiasis\" (27% of horses) (Love et al., 1992 ). Most of the horses in our population had an onset of diarrhoea within a few days of admission and only a small number reported a history of weeks. Those with a protracted history of diarrhoea were not as-sociated with a reduced survival in this study. However, other stud-ies of acute colitis cases (not limited to a specific cause) indicated a reduced likelihood of survival for horses with prolonged diarrhoea (Cohen & Woods, 1999 ). It is, however, unlikely that the horses in- cluded in the study were affected with recurrent episodes of diar-rhoea and the published articles describing such cases associated with larval cyathostominosis tended to afflict aged ponies 18years of age (Mair, 1993 ). A history of weight loss was documented in most horses (87%); it is presumed this is an earlier feature of the disease, however obtaining an accurate time frame for these clinical signs prior to admission is more challenging from retrospective data. In a retrospective assessment of 60 horses with chronic weight loss syn-drome in France, 18 cases were attributed to larval cyathostomino-sis (Tamzali, 2006 ). Recumbency prior to admission ( p = 0.037) was associated with nonsurvival and this may be attributed to weakness and severity of the disease process. Faecal culture was performed in most cases and 11% returned with a positive Salmonella spp. culture. This is a smaller propor- tion compared to other published articles of larval cyathostom- inosis cases that report 20%- 25% positive cultures (Deprez & Vercruysse, 2003 ; Giles et al., 1985 ). As expected in cases of larval hypobiosis, horses that had a faecal egg count performed often re-turned with a negative/low result (median 50 epg). This result may have been also low due to the timing of faecal analysis relative to the onset of disease and prior treatment (e.g. if the sample was obtained prior to larvicidal challenge). Many studies of this clinical disease may have been limited by case inclusion due to the inability in many diarrhoea cases to reach an ante- mortem diagnosis (Mair et al., 1990 ). Furthermore, there is no definitive test, particularly no reliable ante- mortem test, to de- termine if a horse ' s clinical signs are attributed to cyathostominosis. This ability is likely to have improved with the recent development of the serological ELISA that analyses IgG(T) response to recombi-nant proteins derived from individual cyathostomin species (Tzelos et al., 2020 ). This test became commercially available in the UK in September 2019 (Austin Davis Biologics Ltd, 2022 ). The laboratory provides information on factors to consider when faced with a horse with clinical signs; one main factor is that severe hypoproteinae-mia may lead to false negative results (due to the possibility of low antigen- specific IgG(T) levels). Furthermore, a high result indicates the horse has a high level of cyathostomin infection however this may be historical and not reflect current infection. Data on this has not been published, however, if extrapolated from the tapeworm ELISA research based on declining serum antigen- specific IgG(T), then the results may remain high for 4 months following treatment and there- fore, in the case of cyathostomin infection re- testing should not be performed within 4 months of the last moxidectin treatment (Austin Davis Biologics Ltd, 2022 ). Research in clinical cases will be neces- sary to determine its utility in this setting. The challenges in reaching a definitive ante- mortem diagnosis mean that epidemiological studies of larval cyathostominosis as a cause of diarrhoea will contain an inevitable bias, such as misclassifi-cation (Reid et al., 1995 ). Furthermore, studies which aim to include TABLE 3 Central tendency and frequency data have been determined between survivors and nonsurvivors for continuous and categorical variables (respectively) that were significantly associated with survival.

On the contrary, there may be an over- estimation in some cases where we have presumed that the subjec-tive assessment adult cyathostomins and/or larvae (and the number present) are abnormal, therefore alluding to the definitive diagnosis, which may not be the case. The clinical picture of most horses appeared to reflect a system- ically compromised animal with clinical signs such as tachycardia, pyrexia and abnormal mucous membranes. The mucous membranes with refill described abnormal ap-pearance were suggestive of inadequate perfusion in many cases. The mean PCV was within the reference range (38.4% \u00b111.4) and most (61%) horses were within this range (reference range 31%- 43%). A large proportion of cases were Cobs, therefore is it possible that the reference range is inaccurate, since we have referenced a non- Thoroughbred reference range. The PCV range encompassed horses that appeared haemoconcentrated to anaemic (range of PCV from 10% to 75%) but these extremes were less commonly identi-fied. Anaemia has been identified in some reports of larval cyatho-stominosis (Walshe et al., 2021 ) but not in others (Giles et al., 1985 ). A perceived common feature in many colitis cases is haemoconcen-tration reflecting dehydration but this was not seen in this study of larval cyathostominosis. It is worth noting that lactate was not consistently recorded. Leucocytosis and neutrophilia were frequently present and were identified as features in the first key publications of this syn- drome (Giles et al., 1985 ). More interestingly, elevations in the acute phase proteins (fibrinogen and SAA) were a consistent feature. Hyperfibrinogenaemia was also reported in a small case series of an outbreak of acute larval cyathostominosis (Walshe et al., 2021 ). Elevated SAA was associated with nonsurvival in this present study. Monitoring trends in inflammatory markers, although nonspecific, have received much interest over the most recent years and many have established their importance as predictors of mortality and/or morbidity for gastrointestinal conditions (De Cozar et al., 2020 ; Dondi et al., 2015 ; Vandenplas et al., 2005 ). In this current study, SAA and fibrinogen however were not consistently measured se-quentially and this would have provided greater information regard-ing their potential use in assessing the effectiveness of treatments and outcomes. Typhlocolitis/colitis caused by larval cyathostominosis is a well- documented protein- enteropathy, with 58% of our cases hav- ing thickened large colon walls identified by ultrasonography. It is of note that clinical signs of ventral subcutaneous oedema at ad-mission were not a common feature in the cases seen in this study. The resulting hypoproteinaemia was associated with nonsurvival when measured at admission. Hypoalbuminaemia was a consistent feature identified at admission but was not significantly different be-tween survivors and nonsurvivors. It was considered plausible that a contributing factor could have been an associated lower globulin fraction, however, there was no statistically significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors for this variable. Studies have looked to assess the globulin fractions at several timepoints follow-ing cyathostomin infection. Results have shown alterations in the various globulin fractions during the infection, but also showed variations among individuals afflicted (Abbott et al., 2007 ; Mair et al., 1993 ). Importantly, as the cases progressed during hospitalisa- tion, lower last recorded measurement of TP ( p = 0.002) and albumin ( p associated with nonsurvival, suggestive of an uncon- trolled, progressive disease process. The effect of hypoproteinaemia, added to the increased vas- cular permeability which is known to occur in colitis (Naylor & Dunkel, 2009 ), would offset resuscitation efforts with isotonic fluid therapy (typically Hartmann ' s) in cases that may require them and lead to worsening diarrhoea and the aforementioned clinical signs. Isotonic fluid therapy may worsen the already low oncotic pressure and judicious administrati on is necessary. The treatment with isotonic fluid therapy was negatively associated with survival ( p = 0.027); it is uncertain whether this is due to its association with inadvertently reducing the peripheral protein levels or linked to the severity of the clinical disease that necessitated the fluid therapy. However, factors that may be associated with the requirement for fluid therapy such as hypovolaemia (abnormal mucous membranes, heart rate, PCV, renal parameters) were not associated with survival. Theoretically, treatment with colloids in addition to isotonic fluid therapy may be appropriate to improve the oncotic pressure. Further advantages may be possible with fresh plasma, which would also be able to supplement immunoregulatory factors and coagulation fac-tors (Durham, 1996 ). In human medicine, the benefits of colloids vs. isotonic fluids have not been established (Lewis et al., 2018 ) and im- proved outcomes in critical care medicine have not been found to be associated with increased oncotic pressure (Blunt et al., 1998 ). In this study, there was no association found between the ad- ministration of plasma or synthetic colloids and survival. This lack of association may be due to an inadequate sample size. Arroyo et al. ( 2019 ) assessed the efficacy of intravenous plasma transfu- sions in patients affected by typhlocolitis/colitis and identified a minimal association with survival between horses treated with or without plasma (horses that received a plasma transfusion were 1.77 times more likely to die compared to those who did not receive a plasma transfusion), however, there were many confounding factors, such as the volume transfused and severity of disease that were not established (Arroyo et al., 2019 ). Although more horses were non- survivors in the transfused group in both Arroyo et al. ( 2019 ) and our study, this likely reflects treatment bias, whereby potentially the horses with a more severe presentation received plasma. Although, limited evidence exists to support a positive association between increased oncotic pressure and survival, it has been demonstrated in horses following exploratory laparotomy for gastrointestinal con-ditions (Raftery et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, these authors identified that a more marked reduction in oncotic pressure was observed in horses receiving isotonic fluid therapy and in nonsurvivors (Raftery et al., 2016 ). Synthetic colloids (e.g. hydroxyethyl starch) have been |433 OUTCOMES OF HOSPITALISED HORSES WITH LARVAL CYATHOSTOMINOSIS used to treat hypoproteinaemia due to gastrointestinal disease in horses and have been shown to increase the oncotic pressure (Bellezzo et al., 2014 ). The benefits of colloids in horses with colic or acute colitis have been suggested in one paper to improve hy-dration and reduced the incidence of post- operative ileus (Schusser et al., 2007 ). mg/kg bwt or 10 mg/kg bwt per os once daily for five consecutive days have been described) and moxidectin (0.4 mg/kg bwt per os as a single dose). However, resistance is well documented against fen-bendazole (Garcia et al., 2013 ; Reinemeyer et al., 2015 ; Rossano et al., 2010 ; Traversa et al., 2011 ) and there are growing concerns for moxidectin (Nielsen et al., 2020 ). In this present study, 37% of horses were treated with moxidectin prior to admission as their last known anthelmintic, this may suggest a degree of resistance; however, the horses could have acquired infection after treatment. Anthelmintic treatment had been administered to 42% of horses within 2 weeks of arrival to the hospital. This may suggest anthel- mintic treatment is a trigger for emergence, and recent deworming has also previously been identified as an epidemiological risk fac-tor associated with a diagnosis of clinical cyathostominosis (Reid et al., 1995 ). Property level information to assess if the cases (previ- ous, concurrent or subsequent) were from the same premises would be useful to assess and to also identify if the premises practiced anthelmintic resistance monitoring. Frequently, corticosteroids are administered to cases clinically affected by larval cyathostom-inosis and this has been traditionally administered to counteract the sequential inflammatory response following administration of anthelmintic treatment. Steinbach et al. ( 2006 ) first documented a larger inflammatory response to fenbendazole treatment com-pared to moxidectin treatment (Steinbach et al., 2006 ), whereas other studies have not found such inflammatory responses to be associated with fenbendazole and to a lesser extent moxidectin (Nielsen et al., 2015 ; Steuer et al., 2018 , 2020 ). This may be due to a declining efficacy of this anthelmintic since there is nearly a decade between the earlier study and the later studies. It is, how-ever, common practice for corticosteroids to be administered to cases of larval cyathostominosis, and 89% received this medication in this study of hospitalised horses. Although profound inflamma-tion is not seen following anthelmintic treatment for natural cy-athostomin infection, there may be a more profound inflammatory response in cases hospitalised with larval cyathostominosis (as suggested by the thickened large colon wall found on ultrasound assessment in many cases) like the cases presented in this study. For this reason, treatment with corticosteroids is potentially ap-propriate and indicated. There is a low power of study to allow us to confidently deter- mine associations between survival and the individual variables measured. It would be necessary to determine a power calculation for the variables of interest. If we take plasma transfusions, for ex-ample, based on our results (out of the transfused 65% were non-survivors and out of the nontransfused 39% were nonsurvivors), assuming 80% power and p = 0.05, we deduced that 57 horses per group would be necessary to determine its associations to survival. However, based on the results in Arroyo et al. ( 2019 ) which assessed plasma transfusions in horses with typhlocolitis/colitis, 199 horses per group (out of the transfused 38% were nonsurvivors and out of the nontransfused 25% were nonsurvivors) would be necessary to determine significant associations between survival and plasma transfusions. Even so this would not negate the variable volume administered, nor the treatment bias (whereby horses with more severe clinical presentations are potentially more likely to received plasma). The only way to circumvent this in a robust manner would be to perform a prospective, randomised control trial. Considering the number of horses collected retrospectively from the clinical records over an 11- year period (meeting the inclusion criteria) it is unlikely that this number of cases would be easily accrued. It is for this reason that the authors felt it was most appropriate to perform predominantly descriptive statistical analysis to ensure the results would not be over interpreted and by using this method less as-sumptions are made. In addition, this study contains the inherent limitations of a retrospective study, whereby missing data may have affected a small number of variables recorded. There were certain variables that we could not measure such as types of management practice on the premises where they were kept. We were unable to establish more complex associations such as changes in treat-ment over time and multivariable analysis. The small sample size may have precluded further associations with treatment outcome to be established. Also, the treatment administered was determined by the clinical decisions of the veterinarians tending the cases and, therefore, will be a source of selection bias. Also, the decision mak-ing would have been considered in light of many variables which were assessed. The current study may not reflect the broader re-ferral population and cannot be generalised to cases seen in first opinion practice. A proportion of cases may be treated effectively in an ambulatory setting or alternatively euthanised due to severity of disease, or there may be cases without a referral option. Although this study has implemented robust inclusion criteria, a definitive ante- mortem diagnosis of larval cyathostominosis cases was limited (prior to the commercially available cyathostomin ELISA), and there may be misclassification bias and missing cases for inclusion during the period of study. CONCLUSIONS This study is the largest retrospective study of hospitalised cases of larval cyathostominosis but is still likely under- powered to deter- mine robust associations with survival. The cases presented at the referral hospitals had a low survival rate (55%). There are several variables that we identified to be associated with survival at a uni-variable level of statistical analysis. These factors for nonsurvival include a history of recumbency, administration of isotonic fluids, elevated SAA at admission, low TP at admission, low last recorded TP and low last recorded albumin. 434 | LAWSON ET AL.

Berg Email: lcb@sund.ku.dk SUMMARY Background : Muscle mass influences performance and health in horses. It is important to be able to easily evaluate muscle mass in horses. Objectives : To develop an equine muscle condition score (MCS) to be used by veterinarians, horse owners, trainers, and other people involved in horse management and training. Study design : Observational, cross- sectional study. Methods : Twenty- five Thoroughbred horses at different training levels were included. Initial assessment included body condition score, height, and bodyweight. Seven mus-cles ( m. and measured. Repeatability of ultrasonographic measurements was tested in advance by measuring each muscle ten times in two horses. Muscle sizes were compared between two groups, trained and untrained, to determine difference in muscle mass. Horses were subsequently ranked according to measured muscle mass, and palpable and visual differences between horses at different ranks were identified. A 5- point MCS was developed. The MCS was tested by an independ-ent, blinded operator in all 25 horses. Results : Ultrasonographic measurement of all muscles had a coefficient of variation under 5%. All muscle sizes were sig- nificantly correlated to each other except for m. brachioce- phalicus , which was not correlated to m. semitendinosus and m. multifidus . All muscles were significantly larger in trained horses than untrained horses except for m. brachiocephalicus and m. splenius . After testing, minor adjustments were made to optimise usability of the score. Main limitations : The study population consisted of very sim- ilar horses. Further studies are needed to test the reliability of the MCS in horses of different breeds, disciplines, body condition scores, and health. Conclusion : This study resulted in an equine MCS that could identify differences in muscle mass between horses. The re- sulting MCS was similar to other muscle assessment systems developed independently from our study, thus strengthening the findings.

Sepsis of synovial structures including joints, tendon sheaths and bursae; osteomyelitis; infections of orthopaedic implants; and septic ten-donitis and desmitis occur with varying frequency and often require aggressive and prolonged therapy. Orthopaedic infections can be caused by haematogenous spread of infectious agents, trauma (in-cluding penetrating injuries), iatrogenic secondary to intrasynovial injections or orthopaedic surgery. Infections caused by haematog-enous spread are most commonly observed in the neonate, while trauma and iatrogenic causes are most common in the adult horse. Prevention and treatment of orthopaedic infections should be mul-timodal. A comprehensive approach including judicious prophylaxis, targeted antimicrobial therapy, surgical debridement, lavage and adequate drainage are paramount to successful prevention and treatment. This review aims to outline current treatments for ortho-paedic infections in the horse. AETIOLOGY Haematogenous spread of bacteria to synovial structures and bones is the most common cause of orthopaedic infections in neonates (Meijer et al., 2000 ). Foals with a history of partial or complete fail- ure of transfer of passive immunity resulting in neonatal septicaemia are known to be particularly at risk (Meijer et al., 2000 ). Bacteraemia can result from an infection of umbilical remnants and/or translo-cation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal or pulmonary systems. In neonates, multiple joints are commonly affected.

Ortved Department of Clinical Studies , University of Pennsylvania, New Bolton Center , Kennett Square , Pennsylvania , USA Correspondence : Summary osteomyelitis infection of ortho- paedic implants are common in equine medicine. Infections can be caused by haematog-enous spread of pathogens, trauma or penetrating injuries, extension of local infections and iatrogenic causes such as surgery and synovial injections. Horses with orthopae-dic infections are generally markedly lame and often require aggressive and prolonged therapy. Early diagnosis can greatly impact treatment outcomes and can be facilitated by careful physical examinations, haematology, diagnostic imaging and timely synovial fluid sampling. Concerted efforts should always be made to obtain a positive bacterial culture and sensitivity. Treatment is focused on antimicrobial therapy with local therapy, including intravenous regional limb perfusion and intrasynovial injections, being em-ployed whenever possible; lavage and debridement; and analgesia and supportive care. Responsible use of antimicrobials and antimicrobial stewardship are critical when treating orthopaedic infections. Prognosis will depend on the source and severity of the infection, the causative agent and the time to intervention. Foals and horses can respond well to treatment and return to soundness with early, aggressive and targeted treatment. K E Y W O R D S horse CROSBY ET AL. foals; however, gram positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are not uncommon (Hepworth- Warren et al., 2015 ; Marsh & Palmer, 2001 ; Neil et al., 2010 ; Vos & Ducharme, 2008 ). Foals exhibit a greater susceptibility to haematogenous spread to synovial structures and bones, in part due to the presence of tortu-ous transphyseal vessels that can become seeded with bacteria or transport bacteria into joints (Firth, 1983 ; Lindegaard et al., 2022 ). While orthopaedic infections caused by hematogenous spread of bacteria in adult horses are much less common, they can occur and should be considered when other causes have been ruled out (Bertone, 1996 ). Trauma and penetrating injuries are by far the most common cause of septic synovial structures in adult horses, with the distal limb being particularly at risk due to limited muscle and soft tissue coverage. Due to environmental contamination of the cavity, mixed infections involving a variety of bacteria (aerobic and anaerobic) are commonplace. Devitalised tissue, foreign bodies, and other debris present in the wound or synovial structure can lead to accelerated bacterial colonisation of the area (Dart et al., 2016 ). Infrequently, de- layed contamination of a synovial structure can occur due to necro-sis of the synovial lining in the days following the trauma, leading to septic tenosynovitis, arthritis or desmitis (Lugo & Gaughan, 2006 ). Additionally, prolonged exposure of cortical bone secondary to a traumatic wound can lead to osseous infection and/or sequestrum formation. Cellulitis, or infection of the dermis and subcutis, occurs com- monly in the hindlimbs of horses and is thought to be caused by penetration of the skin barrier and proliferation of bacteria within the dermis and subcutis. In more severe cases, local extension of in-fection into synovial structures, bone and/or tendons and ligaments can occur. Staphylococcus aureus , and to a lesser extent Streptococcus spp., are the most commonly isolated bacteria in such cases (Adam & Southwood, 2007 ; Cooper et al., 2021 ; Vyetrogon & Dubois, 2019 ). Finally, iatrogenic infections following intrasynovial injections or surgical treatment are well documented (Morton, 2005 ; Richardson & Stewart, 2019 ). Staphylococcus spp infections occur more com- monly as a result of intrasynovial injection or endoscopic surgery (Meijer et al., 2000 ; Schneider et al., 1992 ), while orthopaedic im- plant infections tend to be caused by mixed populations of bac-teria (Ahern et al., 2010 ; Curtiss et al., 2019 ; Moore et al., 1992 ; Snyder et al., 1987 ). Enterococcus , Streptococcus zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus epidermidis whereas, Enterobacter cloacae , Proteus mirabilus and Morganella are among the most common gram- negative isolates (Ahern et al., 2010 ; Curtiss et al., 2019 ; Moore et al., 1992 ; Snyder et al., 1987 ). PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Under physiological conditions, the synovial membrane is capable of eliminating a small number of microorganisms. However, infection results when the burden of microorganisms exceeds this threshold (Bertone, 1996 ). A typical host response consists of the release of inflammatory enzymes, free radicals, antigens and inflammatory me-diators. Consequently, neutrophilic phagocytosis of the microorgan-isms induces the release of collagenases, lysozymes, and cytokines kinin, coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways are activated this cascade, resulting in high intrasyn-ovial pressure. Elevated intrasynovial pressure is characterised by fluid accumulation and pain, with decreased blood flow to the syn-ovium and joint capsule (Bertone, 1996 ). The robust inflammatory response that occurs in association with infection can itself cause significant and long- lasting damage to articular cartilage and soft tissue. Osteomyelitis caused by trauma, haematogenous spread or iat- rogenic causes involves colonisation of all layers of the bone, includ- ing the periosteum, cortex, trabecular bone and bone marrow. In some cases, the infection is localised to a segment of necrotic bone that becomes sequestered, with the sequestrum being isolated from the surrounding bone by an involucrum (Goodrich, 2006 ). Bones are particularly susceptible to bacterial colonisation due to low cellu-larity and provides an ideal surface for bacterial proliferation and biofilm production (Goodrich, 2006 ; Gristina et al., 1985 ). Because biofilm is largely impenetrable by immune cells and antimicrobials, its formation represents a serious challenge for successful treatment. Orthopaedic implants are also particularly susceptible to biofilm formation. Infection of orthopaedic implants can lead to osteolysis, implant loosening and instability, which can cause delayed- union or non- union of fracture planes and arthrodesis and can ultimately lead to failure of the repair. DIAGNOSIS Clinical signs of orthopaedic infections generally include moderate to severe lameness. Foals that exhibit lameness and/or joint effu-sion should be considered to have infectious orthopaedic disease until proven otherwise (Hepworth- Warren et al., 2015 ). It should be noted that horses with septic synovial structures that are actively draining may be less lame than expected due to lower intrasynovial pressure. Horses may also present with swelling, heat and focal pain. Discharge is often present in horses with surgical site infections or osteomyelitis. The presence of fever is variable in adult horses, and its absence should never be used to rule out orthopaedic infection; neonates however do tend to present with a fever. Horses being treated with non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAID) may have only a mildly elevated body temperature. Foals with septic synovitis will commonly have mild to moder- leukocytosis characterised by neutrophilia and hyperfibrino- genemia, while foals with concurrent systemic illness usually have moderate to marked elevations in white blood count and fibrinogen (Morton, 2005 ). Mature horses with septic arthritis typically pres- ent with unremarkable haematology, with the exception of mild hyperfibrinogenemia (Morton, 2005 ). Foals and adult horses with osteomyelitis tend to have markedly elevated fibrinogen (Newquist |439 CURRENT TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF ORTHOPAEDIC INFECTIONS IN THE HORSE et al., 2009 ). More recently, serum amyloid A (SAA) concentration in blood has been shown to be elevated in the presence of septic arthritis within 24- 48 h of infection (Jacobsen et al., 2006 ). Serial monitoring of blood SAA can be used to effectively monitor re-sponse to treatment (Haltmayer et al., 2017 ). Thurston et al. ( 2022 ) also found that serial monitoring of fibrinogen and SAA can be suc-cessfully used to monitor horses for development of infection fol-lowing internal fixation of long bones. Synovial fluid analysis is used to confirm a diagnosis of septic sy- novitis. There exists a range of criteria for the definition of synovial sepsis. The most commonly utilised criteria for synovial sepsis in-clude: nucleated cell count greater than 30,000 cells/ l (30.0 x 10 9 /l) with total (Tulamo et al., 1989 ). Synovial fluid will also have decreased viscosity and can appear grossly turbid and opaque. Synovial fluid SAA can be used for diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment; however, it should be noted that low synovial fluid SAA does not rule out infection due to only moderate specificity (73%) (Robinson et al., 2017 ). Synovial fluid should always be submitted for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing. Traditional culture methods have been reported to have low yield of positive culture results, with only 37.5% of samples yield-ing bacterial growth in one study (Pille et al., 2007 ). Placement of the synovial fluid in blood culture bottles (BD BACTEC, BD) is rec-ommended as it increases positive culture results to 79% relative to other methods (Dumoulin et al., 2010 ). Enrichment of the broth prior to incubation can also improve the likelihood of positive culture re-sults (Taylor et al., 2010 ). Interestingly, biopsy of the synovial mem- brane does not increase the likelihood of a positive culture result when compared to synovial fluid alone (Montgomery et al., 1989 ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays may be beneficial when bacterial cultures are negative in the face of a clinical picture consistent with septic synovitis or when antimicrobial therapy has already been initiated (Pille et al., 2004 ). Once antimicrobial ther- apy has commenced, synovial fluid aspirates often become culture negative within 2- 3days, whereas broad range 16 S PCR can demon- strate bacterial DNA for up to 22 days (Pille et al., 2004 ). Blood cul- ture in systemically ill neonates can also be used to help determine causative agents of orthopaedic sepsis. An accurate bacterial culture can be critical in the successful and responsible antimicrobial treat-ment of orthopaedic infections, as empirical antimicrobial treatment has been shown to be incorrect in 45% of cases (Boothe, 2011 ). Diagnostic imaging is critical during the investigation of sus- pected orthopaedic infections. Although radiographic evidence of osseous infection can lag an active infection for up to 21 days, baseline radiographs should be obtained to determine if osteomy-elitis is present and for serial monitoring of affected sites regard-less of age (Paradis, 2010 ). Repeat radiography is recommended 2- 3weeks after initial diagnosis or sooner if there is a lack of clinical to treatment or an acute change in the horse ' s comfort. Because concurrent osteomyelitis is common in foals with septic arthritis, radiographs should always be obtained and carefully evaluated for signs of infection (Martens et al., 1986 ). Comparison to the contra- lateral limb can be used to determine if radiographic irregularities are consistent with infection or incomplete ossification. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of orthopaedic infections can provide su-perior image quality and detail when compared with radiographs and should be considered in horses without definitive radiographic lesions or in locations with complex anatomy and superimposition of structures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also capable of detecting more subtle infections in bones, synovial structures, ten-dons and ligaments. Nuclear scintigraphy is very useful for evaluat-ing the proximal limbs and the axial skeleton for areas of markedly increased radiopharmaceutical uptake consistent with infection. Ultrasonography is beneficial for assessment of communication of wounds with synovial structures and to evaluate the echogenicity of synovial fluid (Morton, 2005 ). Ultrasound- guided synoviocente- sis can be performed if needed. Ultrasonography is also very useful for evaluating soft tissue swelling and detecting fluid accumulation around orthopaedic implants. Importantly, ultrasonography can be used to guide fluid aspiration from deeper tissues or from around implants for bacterial culture. PRE VENTION Practices including aseptic technique, careful surgical planning, and time to diagnosis are paramount to preventing and treating ortho-paedic infections. Endogenous skin flora has been demonstrated to be responsible for 34% of surgical site infections in people by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) (Digison, 2007 ). Reduction in the bacterial load during surgical preparation of endogenous skin flora support this, as the risk for surgical site infection (SSI) is significantly increased with greater than 10 5 microorganisms per gram of tis- sue present at the region of interest (Digison, 2007 ). Antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated in orthopaedic procedures with risk factors for infection such as implant placement and fixation of open frac-tures. Broad spectrum systemic intravenous antimicrobial therapy, such as penicillin and gentamicin, is generally employed with the ad-dition of local delivery of antimicrobials when indicated. Timing of antimicrobial administration has be en demonstrated as a key factor in infection prophylaxis such that intravenous antimicrobials should be administered 30- 60 min prior to the surgical incision to maximise tissue concentration when the surgical site is most likely to be inocu-lated (Steinberg et al., 2009 ). Time- dependent antimicrobials should be re- dosed intraoperatively after 1- 2 half- lives or every 2 h to en- sure adequate tissue concentrations (Bratzler et al., 2013 ; Kasatpibal et al., 2017 ). Local delivery of antimicrobials can be achieved via intrave- nous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) and/or use of antimicrobial- impregnated materials at the surgical site. Intravenous RLP is often used prophylactically when internal fixation with implants con-sidered to be at higher risk of infection (i.e. fetlock arthrodesis or distal phalangeal fractures) are being placed. Surgeons perform IVRLP immediately prior to incision or at the conclusion of sur-gery. Interestingly, Curtiss et al. ( 2019 ) found that prophylactic use of IVRLP in horses undergoing internal fixation was not protective 440 | CROSBY ET AL. against SSI. The authors found that 16/88 (18%) of cases that re- ceived prophylactic IVRLP developed a SSI, while only 6/66 (9%) of cases that did not receive IVRLP developed a SSI. However, the authors noted that selection bias likely played a role in these out-comes, as horses with more complex orthopaedic repairs necessitat-ing more implants, longer surgical times and open reduction internal fixation were more likely to be treated prophylactically with IVRLP. Antimicrobial- impregnated polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is a commonly used technique that provides high local concentra- tions of antimicrobials for prolonged periods due to a slow elution profile (Figure 1 ). PMMA has been shown to drastically reduce the risk of SSI in humans (Calhoun & Mader, 1989 ; Goodrich, 2006 ) with early studies demonstrating that local antimicrobial concen-trations can remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for up to 80 days (Eckman et al., 1988 ; Klemm, 1993 ; Wahlig et al., 1978 ). Elution rates from antimicrobial- impregnated PMMA are directly proportional to surface area; therefore, placement of rough cylinders instead of smooth spheres is recommended. Antimicrobial- impregnated PMMA can also be applied around and under orthopaedic implants immediately prior to incisional closure (Figure 1 ). Suitable antimicrobials are broad- spectrum, water solu- ble, stable at temperatures up to 100\u00b0C, and have low tissue toxicity (Popham et al., 1991 ). Appropriate antimicrobials Worth noting is the preservation of the use of 3rd generation ceph-alosporins, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems unless necessary to minimise antimicrobial resistance. In contrast, ceftiofur, polymyxin B, tetracycline and chloramphenicol are not suitable as they elute from PMMA poorly (Goodrich, 2006 ). Generally speaking, the amount of antimicrobial added to PMMA is 5%- 10% the weight of PMMA used. Antimicrobial- impregnated PMMA can be prepared before surgery or at the time of surgery immediately before use. Additionally, beads can be re- sterilised and used to treat infections if local implanta- tion is possible. Alternatively, plate luting, a technique that uses polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) interposed between bone plates and the bone to strengthen the repair, may also be utilised to elute antimicrobials (Nunamaker et al., 1991 ). Polymethylmethacrylate is not bioabsorbable and may need to be removed if infection occurs. Bioabsorbable materials, including plaster of paris (calcium sulfate hemihydrate), collagen, hydroxyapatite, - tricalcium phosphate, polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycyolic acid (PGA) and polylactide- co- glycolic acid (PLGA), have been investigated with some promise (Cook et al., 1999 ; Gorvetzian et al., 2019 ; Poynton et al., 2002 ). However, these materials have more rapid elution profiles, and some can be cost- prohibitive. Future advances in biomaterials will likely offer superior options for equine surgeons. Other considerations for decreasing SSI include the use of min- imally invasive techniques (James & Richardson, 2006 ), adequate sterile lavage during surgery, and insertion of closed suction drains in incisions with significant dead space. Finally, longer surgical times are significantly associated with SSI; therefore, accurate surgical planning and preparedness are important to facilitate timely and ef-ficient surgical procedures (Ahern et al., 2010 ). TREATMENT The treatment of orthopaedic infections largely rests on three main principles: (1) administration of antimicrobials; (2) reduction of bacterial load, inflammatory cells and proteins through drain-age, lavage and/or debridement; (3) analgesia and supportive care. Empirical treatment with broad spectrum antimicrobials is indi-cated ideally after sample collection for culture and sensitivity or PCR assay. Parenteral antimicrobials are recommended for treat-ment in the early phase of infection and in more critical patients due to more reliable bioavailability and tissue concentrations. Empirical treatment for gram- positive bacterial infections may include penicillins or cephalosporins (ceftiofur, cefazolin, or ce-fotaxime), while treatment for negative could include aminoglycosides (gentamicin or amikacin) or fluo-roquinolones (enrofloxacin). Regional variation and susceptibility should also inform the selection of antimicrobial and avoidance of protected antimicrobials with 3rd generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones excluded from the first line of defence in most re-gions.When Bacteroides spp. or other anaerobes are involved, met- ronidazole can be added to the treatment regimen (Morton, 2005 ). FIGURE 1 Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) can be used for long- term local elution of antimicrobials.

(a) (b) (c) |441 CURRENT TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF ORTHOPAEDIC INFECTIONS IN THE HORSE Familiarity with regional resistance patterns is important when selecting antimicrobials. For example, Durham recently demon-strated that 90% of isolates from ambulatory practice, but only 36% of isolates from hospitalised patients, were sensitive to gen-tamicin. Marked differences in minimum inhibitory concentra-tions were also noted (Durham, 2018 ). Antimicrobials should be changed to reflect sensitivity patterns if and when they become available. If a positive culture is not obtained and the horse ' s clini- cal signs do not respond in a reasonable amount of time (72- 96 h), antimicrobials may need to be changed and other interventions (e.g. surgical debridement) may need to be considered. Consideration of the antimicrobial mechanism of action is bene- ficial when selecting treatment therapy (Boothe, 2011 ). For example, because beta- lactams are dependent upon osmotic lysis for efficacy, they are less likely to be effective in the hypertonic environment of soft tissue abscessation (Boothe, 2011 ). Natural antimicrobials such as beta- lactams are also more susceptible to enzymatic inactivation than their synthetic counterparts. Each subsequent generation of cephalosporin is increasingly resistant to beta- lactamase, making them well suited for Staphylococcal infections (Boothe, 2011 ). There is no strict rule on how long antimicrobials should be ad- ministered. Many clinicians will transition the horse to oral antimi- crobials after 5- 10days of parenteral administration provided the horse ' s clinical signs, most importantly lameness, are improving. Oral antimicrobials are then administered for up to 1 month or 2 weeks past resolution of clinical signs (Goodrich, 2006 ). When faced with Staphylococcus , exhibit desirable in vivo efficacy and should be considered in the treatment plan (Muntwyler et al., 2020 ). Minocycline should be considered for treatment of synovial infections due to accumulation of the drug in synovial fluid (Schnabel et al., 2012 ). Recent investigations indicate the reliability of serial serum amyloid A (SAA) monitoring as a predic-tor for surgical site infection in cases of fracture, arthrodesis or os-teotomy (Thurston et al., 2022 ). Observance of a decreasing SAA by 1week post operatively has been correlated with a lower likelihood for developing a surgical site infection and an indication to cease systemic antimicrobial therapy (Thurston et al., 2022 ). Perhaps more important than systemic administration of anti- microbials is local administration via IVRLP, intrasynovial injection or intraosseous injection. Intravenous RLP can be performed in the standing, sedated horse following proper tourniquet application proximal to the site of infection (Figure 2 ). This technique has been shown to be effective in achieving a maximum concentration ( C max ) of antimicrobial that is greater than 10 times above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the bacteria of interest in tissues and synovial fluid distal to the tourniquet (Freeland et al., 2017 ). A recent meta- analysis of IVRLP in the horse found that the use of wide rubber tourniquets (over pneumatic tourniquets) and con-current use of local anaesthetic perineurally or within the perfu-sate increased the likelihood of achieving Cmax:MIC >10 (Redding et al., 2022 ). The concurrent use of local anaesthetics is presumed to decrease tourniquet- induced pain thereby limiting horse movement and improving the efficacy of tourniquets. Suitable antimicrobials and doses for IVRLP can be found in Table 1 (Fontenot et al., 2018 ; Rubio- Mart\u00ednez et al., 2005 ). Concentration- dependent antimicrobials are ideal for use in IVRLP, as the treatment can be performed once daily; however, some time- dependent antimicrobials have been shown to remain above the MIC in tissues for >24 h enabling once daily administra- tion (Cox et al., 2017 ). Although studies evaluating use of gly- copeptide antimicrobials (vancomycin) and carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) have been reported, these antimicrobials should be strictly reserved for treatment of bacterial infections that are resis-tant to other antimicrobials and have documented sensitivity to van-comycin or imipenem/meropenem. Glycopeptides and carbapenems are both considered to be critically important classes of drugs for human medicine (WHO, 2018 ). Combinations of synergistic antimi- crobials may be utilised sequentially or in the same perfusate to ad-dress mixed infections while preserving critically important classes of drugs. Combination perfusates such as amikacin and penicillin in regional limb perfusions have been demonstrated to be in excess of 10\u00d7 the minimum inhibitory concentration (Dahan et al., 2019 ). Intrasynovial administration of antimicrobials has also been shown to be very effective at providing high local concentrations of drugs particularly concentration dependent antimicrobials. For example, injection of 150 mg of gentamicin has been shown to yield 1000- fold higher concentrations in synovial fluid when compared to systemic administration of a 6.6 mg/kg bwt IV dose, and concen-trations remain above the MIC for many equine pathogens for more than 24 h (Lloyd et al., 1990 ). Repeated intrasynovial injections can be performed easily on most horses and should be considered in cases of synovial sepsis (Pezzanite, Chow, Hendrickson, et al., 2021 ). incidence intra- articular injec- tion is low, synovitis, cellulitis of the surrounding tissues, cartilage damage, and iatrogenic septic arthritis are all possible sequelae (Gillespie et al., 2016 ; Pezzanite, Chow, Hendrickson, et al., 2021 ). Indwelling drains or catheters can be used to facilitate long term intrasynovial antimicrobial administration in horses refractory to traditional synoviocentesis (Goodrich, 2006 ; Richardson & Stewart, 2019 ). Although direct intrasynovial injection achieves high concentrations of antimicrobials, recent investigations have also demonstrated dose- dependent deleterious effects of antimicrobials on cartilage in vitro, with chondrotoxicity noted even at low doses of amikacin, carbapenems, ceftiofur and 2021 ). Interestingly, amikacin, one of the most commonly used intrasynovial antimicrobials, was significantly more chondrotoxic than the other drugs examined. Additionally, Pezzanite, Chow, Hendrickson, et al. ( 2021 ) also demonstrated dose- dependent increases in synovial fluid inflammatory markers, including TNF- and IL- 1, following intra- articular administration of amikacin in vivo including at doses as low as 32.5 mg/joint. In light of these findings, titration of the intra- articular dose to the lowest ef- fective concentration is probably prudent. In vivo assessment of sy-novial fluid has demonstrated concentrations exceeding 100 \u00d7MIC for most common bacterial pathogens present in septic arthritis, 442 | CROSBY ET AL. with administrations of amikacin at doses as low as 31.25 mg in healthy synovial structures (Pezzanite, Chow, Hendrickson, et al., 2021 ). Intraosseous administration has been largely replaced by IVRLP and intrasynovial injections. However, intraosseous ther-apy can be achieved by drilling a hole through the cortex to access the medullary cavity. An indwelling catheter or cannulated screw can then be placed to provide continued access (Richardson & Stewart, 2019 ). Intraosseous perfusion is performed with a proxi- mal tourniquet and has been shown to be an effective method of delivering high concentrations of antimicrobials to specific locations (Butt et al., 2001 ). Detractors for intraosseous perfusion include the need for specialised orthopaedic equipment and experience as well as patient discomfort secondary to increased intraosseous pressure (Butt et al., 2001 ). Recent application of orthobiologic- based treatments such as platelet- rich plasma lysate and activated have shown in vitro and in vivo. Gilbertie et al. ( 2020 ) demonstrated the FIGURE 2 Intravenous regional limb perfusion (IVRLP) being performed on a (a) front limb using the cephalic vein and (b) hindlimb using the saphenous vein.

Reduction in planktonic biofilm colony counts and enhanced neutrophil bacterial phagocytosis by activated MSCs have been demonstrated in vitro warranting further investigation towards clinical application for orthopaedic infections (Pezzanite, Chow, Johnson, et al., 2021 ). Given these exciting new develop- ments, orthobiologic- based treatments may become more prevalent in the future. The second major tenet of treatment of orthopaedic infections is reduction of bacterial load, inflammatory cells and proteins through drainage, lavage and/or debridement. Physical removal of bacteria and inflammatory agents can mitigate some of the harmful effects of inflammation on surrounding tissues and also facilitates antimi-crobial efficacy (Boothe, 2011 ). Lavage and/or debridement of sy- novial structures is recommended in all horses with septic synovitis. Options for lavage include through- and- through needle lavage in the standing horse or through- and- through lavage in anaesthetised horses, in which large bore cannulas allowing higher volume lavages can be used (Figure 3 ). A sterile balanced electrolyte solution is recommended for lavage, as additives such as povidone- iodine and chlorohexidine can cause serious synovial damage if not used in very low concentrations. Synovial lavage can be repeated if indicated by the clinical progression of the patient. More severe, contaminated, or chronic cases of synovial sepsis benefit from endoscopic lavage and debridement to facilitate re- moval of fibrin, thickened and infected synovium, and foreign mate-rial if present (Figure 3 ). Despite the increased cost of this procedure, the advantages of endoscopic guidance cannot be overstated. Endoscopic surgery can also facilitate debridement of concurrent bony, cartilage or soft tissue lesions if indicated. Debridement should be judicious and targeted, especially in foals where the dis-tinction between normal and pathologic bone is less obvious due to ongoing ossification. In cases where significant fibrin accumulation is suspected but endoscopic examination is not feasible, local an-aesthesia can be used in the standing horse to facilitate larger bore needle (14- gauge) lavage, egress cannula or teat cannula lavage, arthrotomy incisions through, which a haemostat or forceps can be inserted to remove fibrin. Larger arthrotomy incisions can be performed under standing or general anaesthesia and can be left open to drain. However, this technique is associated with a low risk of ascending infection and poor wound healing (Figure 3 ) (Bertone et al., 1992 ). Fibrinolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator FIGURE 3 Treatment of septic synovitis using various techniques of lavage and debridement.

Surgical debridement of necrotic or infected bone typically leads to more rapid and less expensive resolution with a shorter course of antimicrobials when compared to medical therapy alone (Richardson & Stewart, 2019 ). This is particularly true when addressing horses with sequestrum formation. Although some sequestra can be suc-cessfully treated with medical management, sequestrectomy gener-ally offers a more rapid and effective treatment. The use of CT can be very valuable for evaluating bony lesions and surgical planning. Foals with mild lameness and more subtle radiographic bony lesions can often be treated with medical treatment alone (Richardson & Stewart, 2019 ). In foals with physeal lesions, cautious debridement is necessary to preserve limb growth and minimise angular limb de-formities due to uneven growth. In horses with infected orthopaedic implants, suppression of infection until adequate bony healing or fusion is achieved, is the best course of action. This can be accom-plished with local antimicrobial therapy +/ systemic antimicrobial therapy. In cases where orthopaedic implants need to be removed prior to achieving stability, the surgical site should be aggressively debrided, and new orthopaedic implants replaced in a similar fash-ion. Alternatively, external fixation using external fixators or trans-fixation pin casts with implants distant to the original surgical site can be used. Removal of chronically infected orthopaedic implants may also be necessary once the fracture has healed or the joint has fused. Finally, careful attention must be paid to analgesia and support- ive care. Horses with orthopaedic infections tend to be markedly lame on the affected limb and thus at high risk of developing support limb laminitis or contralateral angular limb deformities in growing animals. Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs are used in nearly all cases of orthopaedic infection. However, the side effects of these drugs, including gastrointestinal ulceration and renal toxicity must be considered, especially in horses receiving high- doses or long- term administration. Phenylbutazone has been shown to have superior analgesic effects in horses with orthopaedic pain when compared to ketoprofen (Owens et al., 1996 ), while many clinicians anecdotally re- port better analgesia in horses with orthopaedic pain with phenylbu-tazone compared to flunixin meglumine. Epidural analgesia is a very effective method of providing pain relief, especially in horses with hindlimb pain. Caudal epidural catheters can be placed easily in the standing horse and maintained for long- term use with few adverse effects. More recently, Hopster et al. ( 2022 ) described C2) morphine administration for de- creasing fore limb nociception in experimental horses. We have also successfully used C1- C2 epidural catheters in several clinical cases with forelimb pain. Administration of an opioid such as morphine (0.1- 0.2 mg/kg bwt) is common and can be combined with an - 2 agonist such as xylazine mcg/kg bwt) to prolong duration of action (Goodrich et al., 2002 ). Horses being administered morphine should be monitored for faecal output due to an opioid- induced decrease in gastrointestinal motility. Addition of continuous rate infusions (CRI) of ketamine, lidocaine and/or butorphanol can also be useful in some horses. Lastly, perineural catheters supply-ing continuous local anaesthetics to peripheral nerves have been reported in the medial and lateral palmar nerves (Watts et al., 2011 ); however, these can be very difficult to maintain clinically. ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP Antimicrobial stewardship has rightly become a significant focus of veterinarians. Resistant microbial infections have been responsible for more than 1.2 million human deaths worldwide in 2019 (Murray et al., 2022 ). With the increasingly limited therapeutic options in the human medical field, we have a responsibility as medical profession-als across disciplines to preserve antimicrobial function as much as possible. For example, routine administration of prophylactic anti-microbials for elective orthopaedic surgeries such as arthroscopy should be re- considered. The incidence of septic arthritis in elective arthroscopies without administration of antimicrobial prophylaxis has been reported to occur in 0.5% of joints (Borg & Carmalt, 2013 ), while the incidence of septic arthritis in horses receiving prophylac-tic antimicrobials has been reported to occur in 0.2%- 1% of joints (Brunsting et al., 2018 ). In the face of similar rates of infection with or without antimicrobial prophylaxis, the necessity of this procedure should be questioned. Reducing the prophylactic use of antimicro-bials not only preserves antimicrobial effectiveness but also could decrease the incidence of medical errors in administration of the in-correct antimicrobial or dosage (Muntwyler et al., 2020 ). In all cases of orthopaedic infection, clinicians should always strive to obtain a positive bacterial culture with antimicrobial sen- sitivity testing to enable use of appropriately targeted antimicrobial regimens. Critically important antimicrobials for human medicine should be avoided whenever possible. Additionally, the use of local antimicrobial therapy such as IVRLP or intrasynovial injections should be strongly promoted now that clear evidence of their effi-cacy exists. These administration routes decrease the required dose and directly target infected tissue. Systemic monitoring, including quantification of fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, can help provide objective data about the clinical progression of orthopaedic infec-tions, offering assistance in the decision to continue or cease an-timicrobial therapy (Thurston et al., 2022 ). Moving forward, more research is needed to determine whether shorter durations of anti-microbial therapy are effective as this will help avoid extended use of drugs beyond resolution of infection. Additionally, further investi-gation of alternative treatment methods including PRP- L and MSCs is indicated. PROGNOSIS Prognostication of orthopaedic infections is critical to case man- agement and client understanding. As with many diseases, early intervention and aggressive treatment often leads to improved |445 CURRENT TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF ORTHOPAEDIC INFECTIONS IN THE HORSE prognosis. Causes of failed treatment include the inability to eliminate the causative agent, disrupt the inflammatory cycle or control pain. Regardless of the anatomic site, cartilage or bony involvement negatively influences prognosis, as horses with marked pannus, osteochondral pathology or osteomyelitis are less likely to survive (Vos & Ducharme, 2008 ; Wright et al., 2003 ). In foals, the prognosis for septic arthritis in otherwise systemi-cally healthy animals can be considered favourable, but this varies widely from 42%- 84% (Glass & Watts, 2017 ). The most common factor affecting survival to discharge is the number of joints af-fected (Glass & Watts, 2017 ; Hepworth- Warren et al., 2015 ). Additional criteria leading to a poor prognosis in foals include sys-temic sepsis, greater than 95% neutrophils in the synovial fluid, and increased time to initiation of treatment (Smith et al., 2007 ; Steel et al., 1999 ). Beyond survival to discharge, Thoroughbred foals that had experienced septic arthritis were less likely to start in a race and took significantly longer to get to their first race than maternal siblings (Smith et al., 2004 ). Survival rates for adult horses with septic synovitis have been reported to be as high as 89%- 100%, with 69%- 89% returning to athletic function (Taylor et al., 2010 ; Wright et al., 2003 ). A negative correlation between survival to discharge and positive bacterial culture has been ob-served (Taylor et al., 2010 ). Additionally, synovial infections with Staphylococcus aureus have also associated with worse prognoses (Taylor et al., 2010 ). In contrast, Ahern et al. ( 2010 ) described no significant difference in survival to discharge between bacterial types or mixed infections associated with SSI of internal fixation of long bone fractures. Survival to discharge in horses experienc-ing postoperative infections of long bone fractures requiring in-ternal fixation ranged from 45%- 59%, and horses with SSI were 7.25 times less likely to survive to discharge than horses without implant infection (Ahern et al., 2010 ; Curtiss et al., 2019 ). CONCLUSION Treatment of orthopaedic infections in the horse has significantly progressed in the last two decades. Improved prophylactic proto-cols, earlier recognition of signs of infection, superior diagnostic imaging, and the expansion of local antimicrobial therapy both as prophylaxis and treatment have likely contributed to improved treat-ment outcomes. Further investigation into emerging supplementary practices such as PRP- L and activated MSCs will further facilitate treatment of orthopaedic infections, thus improving success rates as well as promotion of antimicrobial stewardship.
