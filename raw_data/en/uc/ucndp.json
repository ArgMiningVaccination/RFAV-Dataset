Dr . Cohen reported on the initial findings of the International Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Cancer, which is supported by an NCI planning grant and represents a collaborati on between The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and the Fudan University Cancer Center in China. The basic aims of the International Center fall into the main areas of focus within traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): Evaluating herbal/natural pr oducts that target disease outcomes and treatment and disease-related symptoms; determining the effects of acupuncture on specific clinical symptoms in cancer patient s; and quantifying the biobehavioral effects of qigong , a traditional practice of movement and meditation that focuses on energy and the mind/body connection. The collaboration has included training and exchange programs and studies focused on traditional Chinese therapies used to treat cancer and its symptoms. These studies have looked at acupuncture and its effects on cancer-related symptoms; qigong as an adjuvant to radiotherapy for breast cancer patients; Tibetan meditation and yoga for reducing sleep disturbances in lymphoma patients; and Huac hansu, a traditional Chinese extract often used to treat pancreatic cancer. Researc hers will also develop a methodology for examining traditional Chinese diagnostic techniques. Each of these studies moves the group toward an important goal: To create an ongoing research partnership between these institutions in order to share knowledge and develop the most effective treatments for cancer patients in the United States and abroad. Traditional Chinese Medicine for Cancer: The Road to China Lorenzo Cohen, Ph.D. Director, Integrative Medicine Program FUDAN UNIVERSITY CANCER HOSPITAL Medicines and treatment methods were found inscribed on oracle bones from the Shang Dynasty (1766 to 1122 BC) and on silk banners and bamboo slip records between the Chin and Han Dynasties (221 BC to 220 AD), which represent the oldest surviving Chinese medical literature.

Patients will be randomized to either receive gemcitabine, radiotherapy, and huachansu or gemcitabine, radiotherapy, and placebo. Acupuncture \u0084 Examining the effects of acupuncture to prevent prolonged post-operative ileus in patients undergoing ileostomy or colostomy at Cancer Hospital. \u0084 Compare postsurgical quality of life status between treatment and control groups in terms of pain, use of opioid analgesics, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, abdominaldistension/fullness, activity, and sense of well\u00ad being. Acupuncture \u0084 28 patients have been recruited and randomized. \u0084 The trial should be completed this fall. Acupuncture for Xerostomia \u0084 Some research has been conducted in the United States and Europe suggesting thatacupuncture may be a useful treatment for radiation-induced xerostomia. \u0084 However, there have been few randomized trials, the treatment schedules have varied greatly, and the research has never beenconducted in China. Acupuncture for Xerostomia \u0084 A phase I study will evaluate two different treatment schedules. \u0084 Patients will be randomized to one of two groups that will receive acupuncture treatment using a fixed set of points over a 5-week period. \u0084 The various treatment schedules are designed to help establish maximum results with the least patient burden.
