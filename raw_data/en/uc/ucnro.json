As a result we have created a way for interested parties to mak e use of select articles on an ongoing basis. Our intention is for organizations that are promoting Ayurveda to have some material with which to educate their audience and customers. With that in mind: \u00d8 We have selected a collection of 22 articles on Bas ic Ayurvedic Principles from all the articles we have ever published. \u00d8 Each business entity or other organization may select for publication two (2) articles per year from this collection. It is intended that these articles be a part of an organization's ne wsletter or periodical, as part of the information activity of their website, or other venues such as this. Reprinting the articles as a stand -alone publication is not encouraged but can be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. \u00d8 This same collection of articl es is available to everyone. It builds on the theme of Basic Ayurvedic Principles and education. \u00d8 Since historically our primary articles are quite long, usually 4,000 -5,000 words, we suggest the articles be serialized in your publications in blocks of 1,20 0 words or so. This will make Dr. Lad's work an adjunct to the message you are providing to your audience. Alternatively, you can feature articles from different Ayurvedic centers throughout your annual publishing cycle. \u00d8 The content of the articles cannot be changed in any way without prior approval from The Ayurvedic Institute. \u00d8 Our fee for each article used is $200 to $400, according to the word count at a rate of approximately $75 per 1,000 words. The purchase of the rights to reprint an article is for a one- time use, as specified in the contract. \u00d8 The purchasing business entity or organization may not sell or distribute these articles to anyone else. \u00d8 We reserve the right to revise these objectives and policies as necessary. We also reserve the right to onl y allow reprints by organizations that we believe are promoting Ayurveda in the same spirit as we, The Ayurvedic Institute, are. We hope that by providing this service that Ayurveda becomes more understandable and better known to the public.
