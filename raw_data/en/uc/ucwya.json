Days after a team of the Centre's Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa-Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) Ministry collected samples of a local Ayurvedic practitioner's clinic in Andhra Pradesh's Nellore district, the state government on Monday allowed the usage of the herbal medicine being given to Covid-19 patients. The herbal preparations are made by Borige Anandaiah in the Krishnapatnam area. While [ the decision was taken](https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/andhra-pradesh-government-gives-nod-to-use-of-traditional-medicine-prepared-by-ayurvedic-practitioner-1809177-2021-06-01) following the findings of the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), the state government has kept on hold the decision to prescribe the eyedrop variant of the Anandaiah concoction, which the practitioner claims boost oxygen levels in critical patients. However, the government has maintained that Covid-19 patients should not stop taking medicines being prescribed by their doctors. Earlier, a team from the AYUSH Ministry had briefed Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had called for analysing the medicine, after [ people flocked in large numbers](https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/andhra-pradesh-man-miracle-drug-covid19-cure-dies-1809078-2021-05-31) to Krishnapatnam village, following announcements by YSR Congress party MLA Kakani Goverdhan about the distribution of the Ayurvedic medicine. The chief minister had ordered a comprehensive study of the medicine, which is made using turmeric, cumin, nutmeg, pepper, honey and other natural ingredients. According to a report in The Hindu, a team of officers deputed by the Nellore District collector to examine the medicine reported that [Anandaiah is not a qualified professional](https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/jagan-govt-stops-distribution-of-magic-covid-cure-in-nellore-1805616-2021-05-22) in Ayurvedic medicine and that the formula developed by him does not form part of any standard practice. Here's all that has happened so far - Ayurvedic practitioner Borige Anandaiah distributes medicines claiming they can cure Covid-19. - On May 21, Kani Goverdhan Reddy, MLA from Sarvepalli, announced that the state government was making arrangements for the distribution of the ayurvedic medicines creating a hype amid locals about the effectiveness of the medicine as an MLA was pushing for it. - Borige Anandaiah code-named his medicines as P for clearing infection in the lungs, F for clearing poisonous substances from the body, L to activate the liver and K for critical cases. - The sudden rush of people in the village created a stampede-like situation following which police had to intervene to control the unruly crowd. The police said that there was no permission for the distribution of the medicines. The crowd had Covid-19 positive patients in large numbers. - Alarmed over the gathering at the village, CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy ordered a comprehensive study into the medicine to find out if the medicine being given by Anandaiah has any scientific evidence to support it. The call for a detailed study of medicine was also raised by Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, who hails from the Nellore district. The vice-president has asked ICMR to conduct a study, which will be visiting the village soon. - AYUSH team collected samples from Anandaiah's clinic on May 24 and briefed the chief minister. According to a report in the New Indian Express, Anandaiah showed the team the method he follows to prepare his formula. The samples collected from the clinic were sent to a lab for further testing. - According to a report in Deccan Chronicle, locals have claimed that the medicine given by Anandaiah \"has cured the village of Covid-19\" and that people genuinely believe that the medicine works. - This week, the Andhra Pradesh government allowed the distribution of the medicine, but barred the eyedrops from being given. - Sarvepalli legislator K. Govardhan Reddy thanked the chief minister for allowing the distribution of the medicine. Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, he said that it will take three to four days for Anandaiah to procure the ingredients and prepare the medicine again. - 160 Covid patients who consumed the herbal medicine a few days back are still undergoing treatment and eight are in ICU, the majority of them on oxygen support, Deccan Chronicle has reported. - The state government has ordered that relatives should collect the medicine instead of Covid-19 positive patients reaching the village themselves. - Further studies are being performed.
