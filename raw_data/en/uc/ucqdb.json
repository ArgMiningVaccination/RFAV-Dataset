Copyright 2003 Elliott's absorbing account will make readers think again about the ways that science shapes our personal identities.\"\u2014American Scientist Americans have always been the world's most anxiously enthusiastic consumers of \"enhancement technologies.\" Prozac, Viagra, and Botox injections are only the latest manifestations of a familiar pattern: enthusiastic adoption, public hand-wringing, an occasional congressional hearing, and calls for self-reliance. In a brilliant diagnosis of our reactions to self-improvement technologies, Carl Elliott asks questions that illuminate deep currents in the American character: Why do we feel uneasy about these drugs, procedures, and therapies even while we embrace them? Where do we draw the line between self and society? Why do we seek self-realization in ways so heavily influenced by cultural conformity? Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance , by Atul Gawande.

Copyright 2004 In CRITICAL CONDITION, award-winning investigative journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele expose the horror of what health care in America has become. They profile patients and doctors trapped by the system and offer startling personal stories that illuminate what's gone wrong. Doctors tell of being second-guessed and undermined by health care insurers; nurses recount chilling tales of hospital meltdowns; patients explain how they've been victimized by a system that is meant to care for them. Drug companies profit by selling pills in the same manner that Madison Avenue sells soap, while Wall Street rakes in billions by building up and then tearing down health care businesses. And politicians pass legislation perpetuating the injustices and out-right fraud the system encourages. Culture Matters: How Values Shape Human Progress, edited by Lawrence E.

Chen. Copyright 2007 A brilliant young transplant surgeon brings moral intensity and narrative drama to the most powerful and vexing questions of medicine and the human condition. When Pauline Chen began medical school twenty years ago, she dreamed of saving lives. What she did not count on was how much death would be a part of her work.

Final Exam follows Chen over the course of her education, training, and practice as she grapples at strikingly close range with the problem of mortality, and struggles to reconcile the lessons of her training with her innate knowledge of shared humanity, and to separate her ideas about healing from her fierce desire to cure.

Loving Each Other, by Leo Buscaglia, Ph.D \"Loving relationships, though necessary for life, health, and growth, is among the most complicated skills. Before we can be successful at achieving relationships, it is necessary that we broaden our understanding of how they work, what they mean, and how what we do and believe can enhance or destroy them... \"It's up to us to give our relationships a chance. There is nothing greater in life than loving another and being loved in return, for loving is the ultimate of experiences.\" Measuring Medical Professionalism, edited by David Thomas Stern. Copyright 2006 Patients who are confident of physicians' intellectual and technical abilities are sometimes not convinced of their professional behavior. Systemic and anecdotal cases of physician misconduct, conflict of interest, and self-interest abound. Many have even come to mistrust physicians as patient advocates. How can patients trust the intellectual and technical aspects of medical care, but not the professional? In order to enhance and promote professionalism in medicine, one should expect it, encourage it, and evaluate it. By measuring their own professional behavior, physicians can provide the kind of transparency with which they can regain the trust of patients and society. Not only patients, but also institutions which accredit organizations have demanded accountability of physicians in their professional behavior. While there has been much lament and a few strong proposals for improving professionalism, no single reliable and valid measure of the success of these proposals exists. This book is a theory-to-practice text focused on ways to evaluate professional behavior written by leaders in the field of medical education and assessment.

Mortal Lessons, by Richard Seltzer, MD. Published January, 1996 In this collection of nineteen unforgettable essays, Dr. Richard Selzer describes unsparingly the surgeon's art, opening up the body to view, one part at a time. Both moving and perversely funny, Mortal Lessons is an established classic that considers not only the workings and misworkings of the human body, but also the meaning of life and death. And although Dr. Selzer's dark humor makes the burgeoning tumors and ulcerations of his essays more bearable, he is frank about the mysterious and dreaded inevitable - the sometime surprise, as he calls it, at the center of surgery: death. Behind his traditional \"surgeon's arrogance\" the reader will find endearing self-mockery, a very real empathy for his patients, and the ready suggestion that even the surgeon is still very small when he stands before nature. Mountains Beyond Mountains, by Tracey Kidder. Copyright 2003 In medical school, Paul Farmer found his life's calling: to cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most.

Copyright 2000 It was Rachel Remen's grandfather, an Orthodox rabbi and scholar of the Kaballah, who enabled her to see that blessing one another is what heals the isolation and loneliness in us all. He didn't do this by running out every week to volunteer somewhere. He did it by living life knowing that he belonged to it--that everyone belonged to him, and that he belonged to everyone. Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Medicine, by Rita Charon. Published March, 2006 Narrative medicine has emerged in response to a commoditized health care system that places corporate and bureaucratic concerns over the needs of the patient. Generated from a confluence of sources including humanities and medicine, primary care medicine, narratology, and the study of doctor-patient relationships, narrative medicine is medicine practiced with the competence to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness. By placing events in temporal order, with beginnings, middles, and ends, and by establishing connections among things using metaphor and figural language, narrative medicine helps doctors to recognize patients and diseases, convey knowledge, accompany patients through the ordeals of illness--and according to Rita Charon, can ultimately lead to more humane, ethical, and effective health care. Trained in medicine and in literary studies, Rita Charon is a pioneer of and authority on the emerging field of narrative medicine. In this important and long-awaited book she provides a comprehensive and systematic introduction to the conceptual principles underlying narrative medicine, as well as a practical guide for implementing narrative methods in health care. A true milestone in the field, it will interest general readers, and experts in medicine and humanities, and literary theory. On Call: A Doctor's Day's and Nights in Residency, by Emily Transue.

This is a fascinating work that will intrigue readers from all walks of life! The Anatomy of Hope, by Jerome Groopman, M.D. Copyright 2004 Why do some people find and sustain hope during difficult circumstances, while others do not?

Through encounters with many extraordinary people, he sought to answer these questions. This journey of inspiring discovery began when Groopman was a medical student, ignorant of the vital role of hope in patients-lives and it culminates in his remarkable quest to delineate biology of hope.

From Rick to Mrs. Lindstrom to Marty and Carlos and back again, she takes us on her rounds, telling us their stories as she cooks their meals, cleans their houses, does their laundry, helps them bathe - that is, she does what she can, in the end all there is to do, becoming their companion in the everyday gestures that sustain life in the face of death. \"All sorrows can be borne if you put them into a story or tell a story about them,\" Isak Dinesen said. Rebecca Brown has written a brave, true story about dying and death, in language so spare and direct that you don't notice its power until your stomach knots and your eyes fill with tears.

The Soul of a Doctor: Harvard Medical Students Face Life and Death, edited by Susan Pories, MD, Sachin H. Jain. Copyright 2006 By the time most of us meet our doctors, they've been in practice for a number of years. Often they seem aloof, uncaring, and hurried. Of course, they're not all like that, and most didn't start out that way. Here are voices of third-year students just as they begin to take on clinical responsibilities. Their words focus on the odd transition student's face when they must deal with real people in real time and in real crises and when they must learn to put aside their emotions to make quick, accurate, and sensitive decisions. Their decisions aren't always right, and the consequences can be life-altering\u2014for all involved. Moving, disturbing, and candid, their true stories show us a side of the profession that few ever see, or could even imagines. They show, often painfully, how medical students grow up, right at the bedside. The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, by Anne Fadiman.

As the novel opens, the 90-year-old Hagar discovers that her middle-aged son Marvin and his fussy wife Doris intend to place her in a nursing home. Determined not to bend to anyone else's will, she ponders the circuitous path that has led her to the house she shares with them in Vancouver and plots her escape, ultimately spending a wild, hallucinatory night in a deserted canning factory. The motherless daughter of a stern, wealthy storekeeper, Hagar had been schooled in pride and contempt from early childhood. When, on a stubborn whim, she married a rough farmer 14 years her senior, her father disowned her and she and her family gradually descended into bitter poverty. Hagar waged a fierce domestic war with her hard-drinking husband Bram and closed her heart to her first-born son Marvin, giving all her attention to her youngest son John, who she mistakenly saw as meant for better things. She left Bram to settle in Vancouver with John but eventually followed her grown son home to Manawaka where she meddled tragically in his happiness. Only at the end of her life does she realize how much she is like the sightless stone angel that her father erected above her mother's grave. To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System, edited by Linda T. Kohn, Janet M. Corrigan, and Molla S.Donaldson. Copyright 2000 Experts estimate that as many as 98,000 people die in any given year from medical errors that occur in hospitals. That's more than die from motor vehicle accidents, breast cancer, or AIDS\u2014three causes that receive far more public attention. Indeed, more people die annually from medication errors alone than from workplace injuries. And, although errors may be more easily detected in hospitals, the problems extend to every health care setting, including day-surgery and outpatient clinics, retail pharmacies, nursing homes and home care. And the financial cost to the human tragedy and medical error easily raises to the top ranks of urgent, widespread health problems. Faced with these stunning statistics, the Institute of Medicine has initiated a project to examine the issues and recommend rigorous changes in American health care. First in the series of publications from the Quality of Health Care in America project, To Err Is Human breaks the silence that has surrounded medical errors and their consequences -- but not by pointing fingers at caring health care professionals who make honest mistakes. After all, to err is human. Instead, this book sets forth a national agenda -- with state and local implications -- for reducing medical errors and improving patient safety through the design of a safer health system.
