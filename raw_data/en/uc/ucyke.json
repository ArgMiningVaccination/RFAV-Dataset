Reiki offers comfort, nurture and support for the good health and balance of your mind, body and spirit. Reiki is an ancient, Eastern, healing art that promotes healing and helps to balance and energize you physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually. It is administered by using subtle hand placements to bring about the body's own natural healing process. Reiki is based on the idea that an unseen life force energy flows through us. If one's life force energy is low then we are most likely to get sick or feel stress, if it is high we are more capable of being happy & healthy. Reiki Sessions are available at the studio, click on online scheduling at top of page to schedule an appointment.
