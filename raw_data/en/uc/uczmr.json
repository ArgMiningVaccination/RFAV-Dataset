Sip This Healing Golden Immune Booster! Whether you've got the sniffles, feel under the weather or just want to boost your immune system , you HAVE to try this Golden Immune Booster. It's a simple 5-ingredient recipe that takes about 8 minutes to make (or less, depending on how fast you work ). I love sipping on this golden tonic during the winter months and whenever I feel something coming on. It's made with healing ingredients known to support the immune system and tastes like a spiced hot lemonade. Even if you're not a ginger or turmeric lover, I promise this drink is delicious. I've included notes to modify for taste, and you can always top off with a touch of [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/3ixlymO) to sweeten as well. I personally used to drink it with a teaspoon of [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/3ixlymO), and as my taste buds adjusted, I came to love the flavour on its own. To make, all you need to do is throw everything into a pot of boiling water, and let \"steep\", if you will. Then strain and enjoy either hot or iced! what's in this Golden Immune Booster? - Ginger contains gingerol, which is really powerful and medicinal. While ginger is commonly consumed for its soothing effect on the digestive system, it is also a wonderful ingredient that helps to reduce inflammation. Fresh ginger may also protect the respiratory system, making it a wonderful plant to consume while feeling kinda blah. - Turmeric contains curcumin, a really incredible anti-inflammatory compound. When consumed in high quantities, it has been shown to help fight inflammation and increase the body's antioxidant capacity. It gives our drink the most incredible golden colour, and can be quite potent especially when grated fresh from the root. - Lemons not only provide vitamin C, but also give our drink its lemonade-y flavour. The peels, which we're also using, contain D-limonene, and powerful health benefits that lemons provide. When peels are squeezed, they release essential oils, so we're boiling the whole peel to take advantage of the benefits it has to offer, too! - Black Pepper I know what you're thinking-why on earth would we add black pepper to a drink? We're adding just the smallest amount, a pinch, because it actually helps to increase the absorption of curcumin from turmeric. Trust me when I say you won't taste it, but you'll definitely want to add it as piperine (the active ingredient in black pepper) boosts the turmeric health benefits. - Optional add-ins In addition to the ingredients above, you can also consider adding a touch of cayenne pepper for a spicy kick, astragalus for an adaptogenic boost, or [maple syrup](https://amzn.to/3ixlymO)to taste. secrets to success To streamline the preparation and make this drink a lot more quickly, I typically like to start by letting the water sit on the stovetop as I prepare the ingredients. Usually, in the time that it takes to bring the water to a boil, I've already finished ingredient prep, and that's how I get this done in 8 minutes or less! Because vitamin C content tends to decrease in plants as you introduce high heat, I would recommend adding your lemons last. You want to bring everything to a boil, but don't want to over boil, as you do want to keep as much vitamin C in tact as possible! if you like this recipe, try...
