Currently, effective methods for early diagnosis and therapy are lacking. En- hancin g our understanding of liver fibrosis mechanisms and identification of early non -invasive biomarkers is crucial to combat the clinical burden the disease causes. Using human 3D cell models, we aimed to investigate fibrosis and identify extracellular miRNAs as potential trans- lational biomarkers of fibrosis. This thesis is divided into three projects , which assess miRNAs as biomarkers using 3D human liver microtissues (MT) (1), the MT response to several compounds i.e. bile salts and environmental pollutants (2) and increasing MT complexity through the addition of a fourth cell type i.e. endothelial c ells (3) . The research goal of project 1 focussed on assessing the suita- bility of miRNAs as biomarkers of liver toxicity in vitro , with a specific focus on early detection of hepatic fibrosis and potential extracellular involvement of selected miRNAs in the HSC activation was also investigated. Project 2 assessed the effects of several compounds , including bile salts and environmental toxins (di- oxin and -like compounds , on the 3D human liver MTs to investigate the potential ad- verse outcomes they may cause . Finally, project 3 aimed to increase the complexity of the multicellular MTs through the addition of an endothelial cell type to further improve the models physiological relevance. We demonstrated that 3D -HepaRG and 3D multicellular MTs are useful tools for investi- gating miRNA markers -specific re- sponse s in the MTs. Furthermore, were able to identify four extracellular miRNAs (miR -199a - 5p, miR -214-3p, miR -99b-5p and miR -125a -5p) that could contribute towards a non -invasive method to detect liver fibrosis . Three of the miRNAs show direct links to HSC activation. We also identified that t he MTs are able to display the expected phenotypic response through exposure to several compounds. Taken together, these results highlight the versatility of the MTs as an in vitro tool for unde rstanding the biological response to different compounds . Fi- nally, the incorporation of HUVECs into the MTs was successful and did not affect the ir ability to recapitulate the final sequence of events leading to fibrosis upon exposure to TGF -1, MTX and th ioacetamide : HSC activation and increased collagen expression. This suggests that the cell-line based model is a suitable and cost -effective alternative for investigating liver fibrosis in vitro . In conclusion, the compound -specific respo nses of the MTs to a range of compounds demonstrates the suitability and versatility of this in vitro model as a tool to assessing biological 7 and toxicological responses. We were able to identify released miRNAs and determine their phenotypic relevance to liver fibrosis . These miRNAs could contribute towards a panel of po- tentially translational biomarkers of liver fibrosis. We also enhanced the MTs complexity through the addition of a fourth cell type (endothelial cells) to improve the physiological rele- vance of the in vitro model.8 Aims Liver fibrosis is a common consequence of chronic liver injury caused by various aetiolo- gies and poses a high burden to society. Understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms and promoting early detection using non -invasi ve biomarkers is crucial to guide and improve clinical interventions and outcomes. Here, using human 3D cell models we aimed to investi- gate fibrosis and identify extracellular miRNAs as potential translational biomarkers of fibrosis. The specific aims of this thesis can be divided into 3 sections (Figure 1): 1. Identification and characterisation of liver fibrosis biomarkers in a 3D liver model a.

The project aims are briefly summarised to show the 3 projects: Assess miRNAs as biomarkers using 3D human liver m icrotissues (MT) (1), the MT response to several compounds i.e. bile salts and environmental pollutants (2) and increasing MT complexity through the addition of a fourth cell type i.e. endothelial cells (3) . Compound images were taken from PubChem. 10 Introduction 3.1 Liver composition and specific cell function The liver is the largest internal organ in the human body and is composed of two major left and right lobes, with two smaller inferior lobes. The main role of the liver in the digestion process is t he production of bile which is required for emulsification, hydrolysis and uptake of fats in the duodenum 1. It also acts as the interface between the blood and the digestive sys- tem, i.e. the small intestine in which nutrients are absorbed , transforms and detoxifies metab- olites. A variety of plasma proteins including albumin are produced by the liver 2. The blood is supplied by tw o major blood vessels known as the portal vein, which provides 80% of the total blood supply which is nutrient -rich and deoxygenated, and the hepatic artery which supplies oxygenated blood 1. The functional subunit s of the liver are known as lobules, which are polygonal in shape and separated by connective tissue (Figure 2A). The main cell types in i.e. parenchymal cells , comprise the bulk of the liver occupying up to 80% of the total liver volume and perform the majority of liver functions, such as metabolism, detoxification, storage and bile production 3. These functions make hepato- cytes highly susceptible to damage from excessive exposure to fat, alcohol, drugs, and other toxin s as well as a host of pathogens, in particular hepatitis viruses 3,4. Hepatocytes are packed with membranous secretory organelles and and the extensive endoplasmic ticulum and Golgi network reflect their large secretory capaci ty 4. The basolateral side of the hepatocytes is closely associated with both arterial and venous blood due to the highly fenes- trated vessels found throughout the liver, which ena ble the bidirectional cell -to-plasma ex- change of components (Figure 2C & 3). The main functions of the liver including the production of blood plasma proteins and concomitant endocytic uptake of lipids, growth factors and other trophic agents are facilitat ed by this bidirectional exchange 4. The apical plasma membrane is where hepatocytes excrete lipids, salts and degraded proteins into small channels known as canaliculi (~ 1 \u00b5m in diameter), where bile flows through a ductile system and is drained from the liver into the gall bladder (Figure 3) 4-6. The sinusoidal domain of the hep atocytes contains a variety of different receptors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, key lipid - and iron-scavenging receptors (e.g low -density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR and transferrin recep- tor, TfR) and bile acid uptake transporters 7. In the canalicular domain the predominant recep- tors include ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and bile acid efflux transporters 4,6. 11 Situated around the perimeter of the lobule are branches of the hepatic artery, hepatic portal vein and bile duct, which cluster together to form what is known as the portal triad (Fig- ure 2B) 8. The bile duct is is lined by cholangiocytes 9. Lymphatics and nerves are also located at the p eriphery of the lobule. T he central vein is located at the centre of the lobule and is an oxygen poor zone with high metabolic activity including phase 1 enzymes 8. The hepatocytes form an epithelial -like struc ture and are in close contact with vascular channels called sinus- oids, of which the LSEC s create a fenestrat ed endothelium to enable easy communication between the sinusoidal lumen and the space of Disse (Figure 2C) 10. Blood flows through the sinusoidal lumen where LSECs act as a n adhesion platform for liver -resident immune cell populations including innate lymphoid cells, liver dendritic cells and KCs. The space of Disse is located betwe en the endothelium and hepatocytes and collects lymph for delivery to the lymphatic capillaries . It also hosts HSCs , dendritic cells and other immune cells which are i n direct communication with LSECs and hepatocytes (Figure 2C) 11. The space o f Disse also contains extracellular matrix (ECM ) components such as collagen I and pro -collagen I II, non - collagen glycoproteins , proteoglycans and matrix -bound growth factors that are involved in the regulation of cell function in the healthy and fibrotic liver 11. Figure 2. Schematic representation of liver structure . Schematic drawing of liver lobules (A), detailed visualisation of the lobule highlighting the portal triad (B) and visualisation of the sinusoids, including the Space of Disse (C). Adapted from Mescher et al. 1 12 As mentioned above hepatocytes secrete a variety of key proteins into circulation in- cluding -fetoprotein, albumin, transferrin, plasminogen, fibrinogen and clotting factors. the only source of albumin synthesis and secretion and this prote in is one of the most highly secreted proteins of any cells 12. Hepatocytes also produce bile, which is mainly composed of cholesterol, phospholipids, electro lytes, bilirubin and bile acids. Bile is released into the canaliculi and excreted into the gall bladder where it is concentrated or de- livered directly into the intestinal lumen 4. When bile is released into the intestinal lumen , it aids emulsification, digestion and adsorption of dietary fats. It also plays a role in the removal of xenobiotics and endogenous waste products. Hepatocytes also play a princip al role in cho- lesterol homeostasis which is vital for proper cellular and systemic functions 13. Cholesterol is synthesised via 3 -hydroxy -3-meth ylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase up through LDLR in the hepatocytes 14. Hepatocytes also play an important role in xenobiotic metabolism (e.g. drug metabolism) to result in safe elimination of metabolites through a detoxification path- way. Xenobiotic metabolism m ay be separated into two phases, which will be discussed in section 3.2 15. Figure 3. Hepatocyte Structure . Simple schematic representation of the hepatocyte to highlight the location of the basolat- eral membrane and the apical membrane. The basolateral membrane is in communication with the sinusoids (i.e. associated with arterial and venous blood), therefore, allowing bidi- rectional cell -to-plasma exchange of components . These components includ e blood plasma proteins, lipids, growth factors and other trophic agents. T he apical membrane is where lipids, salt s and degraded proteins are secreted into small channels known as can- aliculi, which then collect in the gallbladder. 13 Non-parenchymal cells such as cholangiocytes, HSCs, KCs and LSECs m ake up 20% of the liver volume. Cholangiocytes comprise approximately 3 -4% of the total liver mass and are epithelial cells that line the intra - and extrahepatic ducts of the biliary tr ee and the main role is in medi ation of hepatocyte -derived bile as it travels Cholan- giocytes possess an apical and a basolateral plasma membrane and are joined by tight junc- tions, which play a role in epithelial cell polarity. Cholangiocytes acquire a greater degree of differentiation along the biliary tree (i.e. small to large ducts) in terms of cell polarity, receptor and transporter expression and response to hormones 17. Another characteristic of cholangi- ocytes is the primary cili um which protrudes into the bile duct lumen 18. is extensively modified by cholangiocytes through reabsorptive and secretory processes such bile salts, amino acids and glucose via a variety of transporters ( e.g. Na+-independent Cl/HCO3 exchanger) 9,18. This is an essential step in bile production as it regulates flow, composition and pH of the primary bile salts produced by the hepatocytes 17. Of the non -parenchymal cells , LSECs make up approximately 3% of the total liver vol- ume and 15 -20 % of total liver cells and play an important role in the sinusoid 19. The LSEC structure differs from other endothelia as they lack an organised basal lamina and contain many open pores (fenestr ae) to allow the flow of small or soluble substrates to the hepato- cytes , while excluding larger circulating particles such as blood cells and platelets 20,21. LSECs have a high capacity for clathrin -mediated endocytic activity, which is reflected by the fact that LSECs contain twice as many clathrin -coated pits per membrane unit in comparison with KCs and hepatocytes 22. They also contain 45% and 17% of the liver's total mass of pinocytic ves- icles and lysosomes 22. LSECs play a central role in the clearance of blood -borne waste through the expression of a variety of endocytosis receptors that mediate extremely rapid in- ternalis ation of waste molecules 22,23. LSECs wil l be cover ed in more detail below (section 6.2). Another non -parenchymal cell type is the HSC , which is a liver-specific mesenchymal cell that play s a vital role in liver physiology and wound repair . HSCs are located in the space of Diss e and account for approximat ely 1.5% liver volume and 5-8% of the cells in the liver 24,25. HSCs in the healthy liver are maintained in a quie scent state and contain numerous vit- amin A lipid droplets making up the largest reservoir of vitamin A in the body 26. HSCs also are important sources of paracrine, autocrine, juxtacrine and chemoattractant factors. These characteristics make t hem critical in maintenance of home ostasis of the hepatic sinusoid mi- croenvironment 27. HSCs are also able to intera ct with immune cells, and modulate their ac- tivity or promote their differentiation by releasing cytokines or directly acting as antigen pre- senting cells. HSCs also contribute to angiogenesis, hepatocyte regeneration and to the reg- ulation of oxidant stress 27. After liver injury, HSCs transdifferentiate to an activated state 14 where they transition from a qu iescent vitamin A-rich cell to highly proliferative and fi brogenic cells (Figure 4). This transdifferentiation event results in the acquisition of motility, contractile and pro -inflammatory properties promoting a wound -healing response and repair 24. Figure 4. HSC activation representation of hepatic ), vitamin A storing cells, becom- ing activated during liver injury. Activated HSCs lose their vitamin A storing phenotype and acquire increased motility, SMA expression, and ECM production. They also promote further inflammation including release of cytoki nes e.g. TGF -1. Finally, KCs are another type of non-parenchymal cell, which are a critical component of the mononuclear phagocytic system and are essential in the innate immune response. Their localisation in the sinusoid allows them to act a first line of defence against immunoreactive material passing from the gastrointestinal tract via portal circulation. Their localisation also allows KCs to efficiently phagocy tose pathogens entering portal or arterial circulation 28. KCs are mediators of liver injury and repair and demonstrate plasticity as they express a range of polaris ed phenotypes dependent on the local metabolic immune environment 28. They are capable of expressing a pro -inflammatory M1 phenotype and multiple M2 phenotypes that are involved in the resolution of inflammation and wound healing (Figure 5) 29. 15 Schematic representation of Kupffer Cell ( KC) activation. KCs can acquire two different phenotypes during liver injury and the wound healing process. M1 macrophages are pro - inflammatory and infiltrate during and after injury. M2 macrophages are anti -inflammatory and promotes wound healing e.g. by pro moting fibroblasts proliferation and migration. Figure 5. KC activation to M1 and M2 . 16 3.2 Detoxification of xenobiotics Depending on their physicochemical properties, chemicals can pass into hepatocytes passively or be taken up via different transport proteins. These transport proteins are locate d in the basolateral membrane and include members of the solute carrier (SLC) family, the or- ganic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) superfamily 39, the organic anion transporter (OAT) family and the organic cation transporter (OCT) family 30. After uptake, the first meta- bolic step includes phase I oxidative react ions, by cytochrome p450 enzymes (CYPs) that utilise NADPH and oxygen in their catalytic cycle 31. Following phase I metabolism, intermediate bioactive products are generated that can be hepatotoxic leading to hepatocyte dysfunction and cell death. These potentially toxic intermediate products are detoxified through inactivation by glucurono -, glutathione - or sulfa -conjugation via the most common phase 31. These modifications typically result in a polar product, which does not usually have pharmacological activity. Drugs and metabolites efflux from hepatocytes into the bile or sinusoidal blood for excretion which is mainly mediated by ABC transporters such as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) and anion exchange mechanisms 32. Although the liver has the ability to detoxify the hepatoxic intermediate products, the quantity of metabolite can exceed the capacity of the liver to carry out the following detoxifica- tion step due to depletion of phase II enzymes or conjugating molecules resulting in an accu- mulation of toxic metabolites. This formation of reactive metabolites is one possible mecha- nism through which drug-induced liver injury ( DILI) occurs. A common example of this includes acetaminophen toxicity. APAP is either gluc uronylated or sulfa -conjugated to com- pounds that are excreted in urine. A fraction of the drug is metabolised by CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 to a toxic Generated NAPQI is rapidly bound by glutathione (GSH), which prevents the toxic effects. When GSH is depleted or when NAPQI generation exceeds GST binding capacity the detoxification process cannot occur resulting in severe li ver injury and failure 33. Adverse drug reactions resulting in liver injury (DILI ), are prevalent due to the role of the liver in the detoxification process. A large variety and quantity of medications including anes- thetics, anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antituberculosis agents, antiretrovirals, and cardiac med- ications result in injury and many drugs are taken off the market as a result of their hepatotox- icity 33. DILI is categorised as either chronic or acute based on the duration and histological location of the dama ge. Mechanisms of DILI can include direct toxicity from the administered 17 drug or their metabolite or may result from other immune related mechanisms 33. An additional mechanism of DILI is inhibition of the bile salt export pump (BSEP) which leads to increased intracellular bile salt concentrations. These increased concentrations can damage mitochon- dria and result in hepatotoxicity and hep atic injury 32. Examples of drugs that elicit this adverse outcome include, potent BSEP inhibitors such as cyclosporine A or bosentan which can lead to drug -induced cholestasis 34. Extensive pre -clinical testing in the pharmaceutical industry aims to stop the develop- ment of compounds that may cause DILI. A population based study in the US demonstrated that the incidence of DILI was approximately 13.9 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 3 years 35. However, clinically relevant DILI incidence is dependent on the drug in question such as chlorpromazi ne, azathioprine and sulphasalazine, which show the highest incidence of DILI affecting approximately 1 per 1000 users 35,36. In these cases, clinical management of DILI is based on c orrect diagnosis and identification of the hepatotoxic drug. The majority of cases of DILI can be resolved quickly through the removal of the injury -inducing drug. Therefore, early diagnosis and recognition of the cause is essential as prolonged exposure c ould progress to more severe damage or even result in liver failure 33,37. Therefore, understanding hepatotoxi- city and improving our ability to identify early signs of injury during drug development is re- quired. 18 3.3 Liver fibrosis Liver fibrosis is characterised by accumulation of ECM , which distorts hepatic archi- tecture through the formation of fibrous scars . If left untreated liver fibro sis ultimately pro- gresses into c irrhosis resulting in hepatocellular dysfunction and reduced intrahepatic blood flow leading to hepatic insufficiency and portal hypertension 38,39. It is thought to be the result of wound -healing due to persistent /repeated liver injury 38,40. After acute liver injury, the paren- chymal cells regenerate and replace the necrotic or apoptotic cells, eliciting an inflammatory response and a limited ECM deposition. However, if injury persists then the liver regeneration process fails and hepatocytes are substituted with abundant ECM, including fibrillary collagen (Figure 6) 38. Major alterations in the tissue architecture occur and in advanced stages, the liver contains approximately 6 times more ECM due to increased synthesis and decreased degradation . Degradation of ECM is reduced due to decreased matrix metallopeptidase (MMPs ) activity , which is ma inly due their , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases proteoglycans progression . Injury to hepatocytes resuls in recruitment and stimulation of inflammatory cells including Kupffer Cells (KCs) . resulting in increased producton of ECM and accumulation of scar tissue. Scar tis sue build up re- sults in loss of normal tissue architecture leading to impaired organ function. Image by Iredale et al. 41. The events and cells involved in the progression of liver fibrosis have been investigated in great detail in the clinic, in vitro and in vivo , the results of which have resulted in the gener- ation of the liver fibrosis adverse outcome pathway (AOP) 40. The key events depicted in the AOP include hepatocellular death/injury, KC activation, transforming growth factor beta 1 19 (TGF -1) expression, HSC activation and ultimately accumulation and changes in ECM com- position (Figure 7) 40. The first key event descri bed is hepatocellular injury/death which is considered to be essential for triggering fibrogenesis 40. Damaged/apoptotic hepatocytes release reactive oxy- gen species (ROS), all contribute to oxidative stress, inflam- matory si gnalling and ultimately KC activation. They also release apoptotic bodies that are engulfed by KCs leading to their activation 42. Importantly , damaged hepatocytes release TGF - 1 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) 40. Innate immune cells are also activated by damaged hepatocytes through the release of damage -associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which activate KCs through toll -like tors (TLRs) and recruit activated neutro- phils and monocytes to the liver, resulting in the promotion of ROS formation 40,43,44. Although, KC activation is associated with evident liver damage it also has a protective role, depending on the extent of activation. Excessive or prolonged KC activation shifts from a protective to a damaging inflammatory response , which is the second key event in the liver fibrosis AOP 40. The next key event is the release of TGF-1, which is a polypepti de member of the TGF- superfamily of cytokines and is the most potent fibrogenic and plays a central role in fibrogenesis. TGF -1 activates HSCs , which is in the fibrosis AOP and stimulates ECM synthesis which is the final key event 40. Additionally, after activation HSCs express TGF -1 and promote their own TGF -1 expression to sustain high levels of TGF -1 in sites of liver injury 45. TGF-1 also promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells, portal fibroblasts an d circulating myofibroblasts to the injured liver, which further triggers hepatocyte apoptosis 46. TGF-1 stimulates HSC transcription of -fibrogenic peptide, connective growth factor (CTGF), which stimulates synthesis of Collagen 1 (Col I) and fibron- ectin. Transcription is also increased for TIMP -1, an inhibitor of the collagen cleaving enzymes MMP -8 and MMP -13 25,40. This leads to scarring and increased ECM stiffness which will ulti- mately result in hepatic insufficiency and portal hypertension 38. 20 Figure 7. Graphic representation of AOP . Graphic representation of the adverse outcome pathway from protein alkylation to liver fibrosis. Molecular initiating pathway (MIE) is protein alkylation, which is then followed by the first key event (KE), hepatocyte injury/death. Hepatocellular injury an d apoptosis ( KC) activation, (the most potent pro -fibrogenic cyto- kine) and causing the next KE. HSC activation then leads to progressive collagen produc- tion and accumulation, thereby altering the extracellular matrix (ECM ) composition result- ing in scar development. These events ultimately result in impaired hepatic function. Image by Horvat et al. 40. 21 3.4 Liver fibrosis biomarkers and detection methods Currently the most trusted method of diagnosing liver fibrosis is using liver biopsies, which are still considered the standard diagnostic method despite their invasive nature, sam- pling error and potential clinical complications 47,48. Non-invasive methods (listed in table 1) are available including serum biomarkers such and total bilirubin (TBL) which are all associated with liver injury and fibrosis progression 49. These are assessed using blood tests and are consider ed as 'liver function tests'. Albumin and TBL give information regarding the functional capacity of the liver, whereas ALT, AST and ALP levels detect liver injury 50. Different combinations of serum markers and other parameters such as demographic and blood cell count known as serum aspartate II (FS) or Fibroindex produce scores which can be used for diagnosis of liver fibrosis 49. APRI is calculated using normal AST levels and upper levels of normal, which is then divided by platelet counts and made into a percentage and expressed as absolute frequencies 51. The APRI score has been shown to have the potential to correlate sign ificantly to fibrosis stage 52. However, other studies have demonstrated that this method is only useful to confirm or exclude significant fibrosis or cirrhosis. Thereby, indicating that staging fibrosis is not pos- sible with this method 51. FIB -4 is c apable of predicting moderate or significant fibrosis and there are no additional costs as it utilises parameters measured in standard investigation of liver disease (age, AST, ALT, platelet count) 53. and alpha -(2)-macroglobulin in combination with age and sex. It was found to be 67 -80 % sensitive for significant fibrosis. Similar to Hepascore, FibroTest is calculated from the results of a six -parameter blood test which combines six se- rum markers, Alpha -2-macroglobulin, Haptoglobin, Apolipoprotein A1, GGT, TBL, and ALT with age and gender 54. The results of comparing FibroTest to liver biopsy demonstrated that the results were best for advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis but only fair for lower stages 54. The FS fibrosis panel includes serum hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibi tor of metalloproteinase 1, al- pha2 macroglobulin, which are proteins involved in ECM remodelling. FS uses a logistic re- gression model established for this panel of fibrosis markers to detect significant fibrosis. 55. Finally, Fibroindex is calculated from a combination of the platelet count, AST, and gamma globulin measurements 56. APRI, FIB -4, Hepascore, FibroTest, FS and F ibroindex all include variations on a set of serum markers (Summarised in table 1) but were only able to detect significant fibrosis and were unable to discriminate between intermediate stages of fibrosis 53- 57. These serum biomarkers may be useful for excluding or confirming significant fibrosis but they lack sensitivity and are unable to identify early stages of liver fibrosis. 22 Other alternatives include ultrasonography (Examples: transient elastography, (CT) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) 58-60. TE uses ultrasound to measure the propagation velocity of a wave, as it is proportional to elasticity and correlate s to the amount of fibrosis in the liver as liver stiffness increases 61. Although it is possible to measure liver stiffness there are limitations to this method as it is affected by necroinflammatory activity and/or a high body mass index 61. ARFI uses ultrasound and combines conventional ultrasound and shear wave velocity to gauge liver stiffness 59. ARF I has shown to have a sensitivity of 75% for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis, which increases to 90% for cirrhosis. TE has 70% sensitivity for diagnosing sig- nificant liver fibrosis/liver cirrhosis 59. Advanced liver cirrhosis leads to shrinkage in liver vol- ume and increased spleen volume, which can be measured using CT. It has also been sug- gested that liver and spleen volume may allow for liver fibrosis assessment in patients with chronic liver disease 62. MRE uses propagating mechanical shear waves to assess mechanical properties of the liver. Waves propagate more rapidly in stiffer tissue and slower in softer tis- sue. If there is continuou s application of waves, the speed of propagation is reflected in the wavelength 63. As tissue stiffness increases, the wavelength becomes longer. The wave im- ages are then processed with specialized software to generate quantitative cross -sectional images depicting the stiffness of tissue 63. MRE is capable of differentiating between various stages (F2 -4) of fibrosis as liver stiffness increases incrementally with fibrosis stages 63,64. They detect a variety of liver diseases (i.e are non -specific), lack sensitivity for diag- nosing early signs of liver injury/fibrosis, can be expensive and can carry radiological risks 49,58,65. This highlights the need for sensitive and specific biomarkers that are capable of relia- bly detecting early signs of liver fibrosis. 23 Table 1.

All of these diseases rep- resent a significant global health burden , for example 350 million people globally a re infected with HBV and HCV. In addition, DILI is a leading cause of preclinical and clinical drug failures and wi thdrawals of marketed drugs 66. Additionally, a common feature of liver disease is t hey increase patient risk of developing liver fibros is, cirrhosis and ultimately HCC 38,40. A large variety of animal models are used to investigate liver diseases and for evaluating compound toxicity. Examples of these in vivo models include: NAFLD which can be induced by controlling diets such as a methionine and choline phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN) ; DILI through exposure to a variety of drugs 67. Currently, p re-clinical drug testing requires the use of rodent and non -rodent models to perform risk assessment and minimise adverse outcome in humans . However, based on the number of drugs being withdrawn from the market it is clear that animal models do not completely suffice in i dentifying the potential risk . This could be due to the significant differences across species in drug metabolism 68. In addition to the discrepancies in drug metabolism , rodents are als o not always appropriate for stud ying diseases such as HBV and HCV, which are not infectious to rodents 68. Finally, r odent models used for investi- gating certain diseases and drug toxicity are expensive and time-consuming. Finally , contro- versy surrounding in vivo experiments is also of concern due to the significant harm that might be caused to animals. Therefore, development of in vitro models contributes towards the 3Rs: Replacement, Reduction and Refinement 69. These limitations have resulted in a considerable interest in developing in vitro models of the human liver, which could be employed to investigate metabolism and toxicity . In vitro models could also be used to understand disease development and testing potential thera pies against liver disease . Primary cells are commonly used as an in vitro alternative, including primary hepatocytes (PHHs) and HSCs. PHHs are a useful alternative as they maintain key hepatic -specific functions including carbohydrate metabolism, ureogenesis, xenobiotic CYP enzymes) 70. 2D culture of PHHs has drawbacks including rapid alteration of cellular morphology with loss of structural aspects and polarity. Thereby, bile canaliculi are no longer formed. More importantly, the drug metabolising capac ity significantly decreases over time in 2D configurations 68,71. Primary human HSCs have also provided a great deal of informat ion as they have the capacity to recapitulate HSC activation seen during liver injury. However, primary HSCs have been known to spontaneously activate when cultured on plastic 25 surfaces meaning that primary HSCs have a limited useable life -span in 2D 72. Through culturing PHHs and primary human HSCs in 3D culture conditions, the cell -specific characteristics were maintained for longer periods . Several protocols have been established to differentiated iPSCs into hepatocyte -like cell (HLCs). HLC production is carried out throug h the production of hepatic progenitors following an initial endoderm differentiation . The hepatic progenitors are then matured using specific growth factors and this method result ing in iHLC that express CK18 and CYPs. They also produce and release albumin, urea and glycogen 73-76. Chola ngiocytes have also been pro- duced using by introducing SHH and the NOTCH ligand Jagged -1 during hepatic en- doderm specification. The final stages of maturation include the addition of TGF - which re- sulted in cholangiocyte -like cells 77. iPSC -derived cholangiocytes were also generated using 3D conditions, Matrigel and the addition of specific growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor -10 78-80. HSCs have also been pro duced using iPSCs by two groups 81,82. Coll et al. differentiated iPSCs on matrigel by introducing a variety of different growth factors such as BMP4, FGF1 and FGF3 82. These iPSC -derived HSCs were capable of being activated by TGF-1 treatment and can be co -cultured with HepaRG in 3D microtissues 82. On the other hand, Koui et al. followed an already established protocol for the induction of iPSCs into mes- oderm and then selected HSC progenitors through ALCAM expression and then inhibited the Rho signalling pathway to produce mature HSCs that expressed ECMs and could be co -cul- tured with endothelial cells 81. KCs have also been using iPSCs through supple- mentation with BMP4, ROCK inhibitor and stem cell factor (SCF) to obtain embryoid bodies. Following this, supplements such as macrophage col ony stimulating factor (M -CSF) and In- terleukin -3 were added to generate KCs over 3 -4 weeks, which were functionally competent and similar to primary KCs 83. Finally, LSECs have also been differentiated from iPSCs and is discussed in section 6.2.2. Alternative cell lines exist including HepG2 , a human hepatoma cell line that is charac- terised by unlimited life span, stable phenotype and high availabi lity and are useful for un der- standing certain liver injuries such as gene toxicity 84,85. However, HepG2 have much lower expression of metabolic activities compared with PHHs , which is an issue for drug toxicity studies 86. Additionally, HepG2 lack many relevant hepatocyte specific transporters such as BSEP 86. The hepatoma cell line HepaRG is a more suitable alternative for in vitro liver models. HepaRG cells have been shown to have enhanced metabolic act ivity in comparison to HepG2 making them a more suitable cell line. They also express more of the hepatocyte relevant transporters and are , therefore , more similar to PHHs 86. There are also alternatives to primary HSCs including LX -1, LX 87,88. LX-1 and LX -2 cells were shown to express key receptors 26 regulating hepatic fibrosis such as PDGF -R and proteins involved in TIMP -2 and -2 cells respond to PDGF with in- creased proliferation and are responsive to TGF -1 87,89. hTERT -HSCs were shown to hav e an extended life -span and be responsive to retinol and PDGF . They are also capable of be- coming activated upon exposure to TGF -1 88,90. However, it is important to ca refully monitor HSC cell lines as they have been shown to be similar to activated HSCs 91. Therefore , it is essential to maintai n HSC cell lines at low passages and to take note of morphological changes and potentially use basement membrane -like matrices during expansion depending on the choice of cell line 1. 3D cultures involve both scaffold -free and scaffold -based systems. Scaff old-free systems can be made using ultra low adherence , inert surfaces or non -adhesive hydrogels such as alginate or collagen 92-94. Scaffold -based 3D culture systems include 3D solid matrices derived from natural materials such as decellularised liver derived ECM or synthetic materials 95,96. Culturing PHHs in 3D culture conditions demonstrated prolonged maintenance of hepatocyte - specific characteristics 71,97. HSCs have also been shown to remain in a quiescent state for longer periods when cultured using 3D techniques 98. Despite these advances in culturing primary cells to maintain characteristics there is still a need for extraction to collect these cells which involves invasive methods and there is a limited supply. Additionally, as primary cells lose characteristics in 2D culture they have limited expansion capacity. F or these reasons, a large number of cell lines can be used as surrogates depending on the investigation. As 3D models are more capable of recapitulating tissue microenvironmen ts 99. There are a number of 3D liver models published using one cell type or co -cultures of multiple cell types. Hepatotoxicity has been assessed in 3D -HepG2, 3D -HepaRG and 3D -PHHs 84,100 -104. These models have been useful in understanding hepatotoxicity. However, for elucidating fibrosis and other diseases that include the involvement of HSCs a multicellular model is required. Multicellular microtissue models using primary cells or cell lines have been characterised and are ca pable of recapitulating key events in the liver fibrosis AOP. These cell models include microtissues containing PHHs and NPCs 93,97,100,101,105,106, a combination of different cell lines 92,98 or iPSCs 107. Additionally, a s election of 3D liver models has also been shown to recapit- ulate fibrosis including the models by Mukherjee et al. 108, Prestigiacomo et al. 92 and Leite et al. 98. These models displayed hepatocellular death, HSC activation and accumulation of ECM in response to TGF -1 and other pro -fibrotic compounds or conditions including e (MTX ), thioacetamide (TAA) and lipid -loading 92,98,108. Thus , advances in vitro models provide us with useful tool s for understanding liver toxicity and disease, have the potential to be relevant to human physiology, and can be adapted for high-throughput screening . 27 3.6 miRNA biosynthesis non -coding RNAs , typically 22 nucleotides (nt) in length, that play an important role in protein expression regulation. The majority of miRNAs are tran- scribed from DNA sequences into primary miRNAs (pri -miRNAs). These are then processed into precursor miRNAs (pre -miRNAs) and mature miRNAs 109. Approximately half of miRNAs are intragenic and processed mostly from introns and to a lesser extent exons of protein cod- ing genes. Th e remainin g miRNAs are intergenic and are, t herefore transcribed independently of a host gene and regulated by their own promoters 109,110. miRNA biogenesis is classified into cano nical and non -canonical (Figure 8). The canonical path way is the dominant pathway for miRNA processing. Pri-miRNA is long and contains a stem -loop structure where mature miRNA sequences are embedded. Pri-miRNAs are transcribed and processed by RNA bind- ing protein DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8) an d a ribonuclease III enzyme Drosha, which form a microprocessor complex 111. DGCR8 recognizes an N6 -methyladenyl- ated GGAC and other motifs the pri -miRNA, while Drosha cleaves the pri -miRNA duplex at the base of the characteristic hairpin structure of pri -miRNA 111. This results in the release of a small hairpin -shaped RNA of 65 nucleotides in length which is the pre -miRNA that has a 2 nt 3' overhang 111. Following the generation of pre -miRNA they are exported to the cytoplasm by an exportin 5 (XPO5)/RanGTP complex via nuclear pore complexes where maturation can be completed. Interestingly, knockdown of XPO5 resulted in reduction of total miRNA levels without a nucl ear pre-miRNA accumulation. Pre-miRNA is then processed by the RNase III endonuclease Dicer. Dicer binds to pre -miRNA with a p reference for a 2 nt long 3' overhang that was generated by Drosha. This processing step involves the removal of the terminal loop, and results in a mature miRNA duplex 112. Two strands known as 5p and 3p arise from the 5' end and the 3' end of the pre -miRNA hairpin, respectively. Both strands derived from the mature miRNA duplex can be loaded into the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins in an ATP dependent manner 113. In- terestingly, the proportion of AGO -loaded 5p or 3p strand varies greatly ranging from near equal proportions to predominantly one of the two strands. This loading proportion is depend- ent on the cell type or cellular environment 114. There are multiple non -canonical miRNA bio- genesis pathways and they can -independent and Dicer -in- dependent pathways and are summarised by O'Brien et al. and shown in figure 8. The minimal miRNA -induced silencing complex (miRI SC) consists of a guide strand and AGO 109. The target specificity of miRISC is due to the interaction with complementary se- quences on target mRNA, called miRNA response elements (MREs). MRE complementarity is responsible for whether there will be AGO -2 dependent s plicing of target mRNA or whether there will be translational inhibition resulting in miRISC mediated mRNA decay 115. When the 28 miRNA and MRE interaction is fu lly complementary AGO2 endonuclease activity is induced and targets mRNA cleavage 115. miRNA is t hen degraded as this interaction destabilised the association between AGO and the 3' end of the miRNA 116. The majority of miRNA -MRE in- teractions are not fully complementary in animals and most MREs contain central mismatches to their guide miRNA , which prevents AGO2 endonuclease activity 117. In this case AGO2 acts as a mediator of RNA interference, similar to the non -endonucleolytic AGO family members (AGO1, 2 and 4) 118. The miRNA -MRE interactions in many cases occurs via the 5' seed region and additional pairing at the 3' end provides stability and specificity of the miRNA -target inter- action 119. The molecular steps leading to microRNA -mediated gene silencing was reviewed in depth by Jonas et al. 117. A silencing miRISC comple x formation begins with the recruitment of GW182 family of proteins by mRISC. GW182 provides scaffolding that is required to recruit other effector proteins following miRNA -target mRNA completed the CCR 4-NOT complex 117. This leads to GW182 and poly(A) -binding protein C (PABPC) promoting efficient deadenylation . This re- sults in a subsequent decapping which is facilitated by decapping protein 2 (DCP 2) and asso- ciated proteins. Thi s causes ra pid degradation by exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1) of the target mRNA 109,117. miRNAs repress translation by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. How- ever, it has been proposed that they interfere with the activity and/or assembly of the eukary- otic initi ation comple x recruitment and translation initiation 109,117. Finally, Importin -8 and Exportin -1 shuttles Ago2 between the nucleus and cytoplasm and it has been shown that nuclear localised miRISC was found to regulate transcriptional and post -transcriptional levels of mRNA 120,121. Some studies have shown that low molecular weight miRISC can interact with mRNAs in the nucleus and induce nuclear mRNA degradation. However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood 109. 29 Figure 8. miRNA biogenesis and gene silencing . Canonical miRNA biogenesis starts pri -miRNA transcript which is then cleaved by Drosha and DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8), producing the precursor -miRNA (pre -miRNA). Exportin5/RanGTP export t he pre -miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm to produce the mature miRNA duplex . The strands (5p or 3p) are loaded into the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins forming miRNA induced silencing complex (miRISC ). In DGCR8 cleaves small RNA (shRNA) Exportin5/RanGTP. AGO2 -dependent, but Dicer -independent, capped (m7G) -pre-miRNA cytoplasmic maturation exported Exportin5/RanGTP while m7G -pre-miRNA are exported via Ex- portin1. Both the canonical and non -canonical pathways lead to a functional miRISC com- plex. The majority of translational inhibition is by miRISC bind ing to target mRNAs, result- ing in Argonaute -based recruit ment of the poly(A) -deadenylases PAN2/3 and CCR4 -NOT, which are responsible for initiating and completing the deadenylation process, respec- tively. This leads to the removal of the m7G cap on target mRNA by the decapping com- plex, which then undergo es 53 degradation via the exoribonuclease XRN1. Image by O'Brien et al. 109. 30 3.7 Extracellular/circulating miRNA: release mechanisms In addition to the intracellular mechan isms, miRNAs can be released and elicit intercel- lular interactions. One release mechanism of miRNAs is through extracellular vesicles (EV) which are cell -derived membrane particles ranging from 30 to 5000 nm in size and include exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. EVs are released under physiological tions, but also during cellular activation, senescence and apoptosis. They play an important role in intercellular communication by carrying lipi ds, proteins, DNAs, mRNAs and functional mature miRNA from one cell to another 122. Apoptoti c bodies are the largest EV at approxi- mately 1 -5 \u00b5M in microvesicles approximately 400 -1500 nm and then e xosomes , which are 30 -100 nm in diameter, making them the smallest EVs 123,124. Apoptotic bodies are released at the early stages of apoptosis and contain cytoplasmic contents originating from the parent cell. D ue to enrichment with phosphatidylserine (PS) the apoptotic bodies signal to phagocytic cells ( macrophages content 125,126. Zernecke et al. demonstrated that miRNAs were also packaged in apoptotic bodies shown by the levels of miR-126 found to be released from endothelial cells (ECs) 127. Hergenreider et al. went on to demonstrate that miR -126 was selectively loaded and released in apoptotic bodies by ECs, but not other MVs 128 MVs are secreted under specific conditions by a number of different cells and are formed from the outward blebbing of the plasma membrane and are also enriched with PS and phos- phatidylcholine (PC) 122. MVs have been sho wn to carry functional proteins, mRNAs and miRNA to neighbouring cells (Figure 9A) 125,126. An example of a miRNA released via MVs is miR320b, released by platelets during myocardial infarction. Following release, MVs transfer the miR -320b to human microvascular endotheli al cell line (ICAM -1) are generated from a type of late endosomes known as multivesicular bodies which fuse with the plasma membrane releasing their contents into intraluminal vesicles (I LVs) 123. Once extracellular , these ILVs are termed exosomes and are (CD9, CD63, CD37, CD81, CD82), heat 101 protein (Tsg101), and ALG2 -interacting protein X (Alix) 123. They are also enriched in ceramide, PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 126. The content of exo- somes is dependent on the cell type of origin, trigger or stimulus , but exosome s have been shown to carry miRNA into the extracellular space and to neighbouring cells (Figure 9A) 125,126. miR-122, a putative marker of liver injury, has been shown to be released in exosomes from PHHs upon exposure to hepatotoxicants such as tolvaptan 130. However, the intercellular tar- get of miR -122 is still not fully understood . 31 miRNAs are not only selectively loaded into exosom es but extracellular/circulating miR- NAs are also detected in the microvesicle -free fraction. This indicates an alternative release mechanism through as sociation to protein complexes and i t has been reported that Ago -2- miRNA complexes are released (Figure 9A) 122,131. Results indicate that Ago2 -protein com- plexes might also be involved in delivery of miRNAs from donor cell to recipient cells and facilitate cell -cell communication , similar to the miRNA released in exosomes 122. Arroyo et al. demonstrated that miR -16, miR-92a and miR -122 were consistently enriched in the A GO2 immunoprecipitates extracted from human plasma /serum of healthy individuals 131. Finally, miRNAs have also been identified to be released as high -density lipoprotein (HDL) -miRNA complexes , an example of this form of release is demonstrated in patients with familial hyper- cholesterolemia , who had increased release of miR -223 via HDL, which was transferred to recipient cells 132. As miRNAs are expressed intracellular ly and released into the extracellular space they have been identified in a wide range of bio -fluids including serum, plasma, urine, ce rebrospinal fluid and saliva and more shown in Figure 9B 122. miRNAs a re also released by cells into culture supernatant in vitro 122,130,133,134. Aberrant extracellular miRNAs are also released due to a variety of diseased states and have shown to be highly sensitive biomarkers 135. There- fore, e xtrac ellular miRNAs are a promising method to detect early signs of liver injury, yet miRNAs specific to liver fibrosis are lacking and will be discussed fur ther in section 4. 2.1. 32 Figure 9. Extracellular miRNA release . miRNA biogenesis (described in section 3.6) and release of miRNAs into the extracellular environment. Mature miRNAs can be selectively released from the cell via incorporation into exosomes or coupled with Ago2 protein. Alternatively, miR NAs can be released en- wrapped in microvesicles or attached high density lipoprotein (HDL). Extracellular/circulat- ing miRNAs can then interact with neighbouring recipient cells (A). miRNAs have also been detected in a wide range of bio -fluids throughout the body (B). Images taken from Sohel et al. and modified for the purpose of this thesis 122. 33 Project 1: Biomarkers of liver fibrosis 4.1 Aims The aims of this section were to identify sensitive and fibrosis -specific biomarkers, which as discussed in section 3.4 are needed for detecting early signs of fibrosis. To this end, extra- cellular miRNAs were measured from comprising cellular models of DILI and liver fibrosis, respectively. The first paper titled \" Exosomal miRNA s release as a sensitive marker for drug -induced liver injury in vitro \" investigates the sensitivity of extracellular miRNAs, focusing specifically on hepatocellular injury in a 3D -HepaRG cell culture model and on three putative miRNAs (miR - 122-5p, miR -192-5p and miR -34a-5p) released in exosomes. The second paper titled \" Identification of miR -199a -5p, miR -214-3p and miR -99b-5p as extracellular biomarkers of fibrosis and promoters of HSC activation \" focuses on identifying and characterising novel biomarkers for fibrosis by measuring extracellular miRNAs released by multicellular cultures into the cell culture supernatant. Here, th e specific focus lies in differ- entiating hepatocellular damage (elicited by APAP -exposure) from liver fibrosis (elicited by exposure to MTX). Identification of miRNAs as biomarkers is accompanied by a functional genomics approach based on transfection of H SC with miRNA -mimics was pursued to estab- lish the involvement of selected miRNAs in stellate cell activation, a key event in liver fibrosis.34 4.2 Introduction 4.2.1 MiRNA s as biomarkers of liver injury , disease and fibrosis As mentioned in section 3.4 seru m biomarke rs for liver fibrosis lack sensitivity and spec- ificity and provide limited information. Achieving earlier detection of liver in jury and fibrosis is required to improve disease management. Studies using different tissues and organs have demonstrated that in jury or disease results in aberrant miRNA expression and miRNA release into a range of bio -fluids (described in section 3.7). Therefore, extracellular/circulating miRNAs are being investigated as non -invasive biomarkers of disease. Genome -wide expression profiling has identified 277 miRNAs expressed in the liver, including miR -122 which is thought to make up 52% of all miRNA transcripts in the human liver and is liver -specific. miR-122 is involved in liver development, differentiatio n and homeo- stasis 136 and has been associated with liver injury, disea se and HCC 137. miR-122 expression decreases in liver tissue and release increases into serum/plasma upon exposure to hepato- toxicants such as APAP, paraquat tolvapt an 130,138 -141. Other types of liver injury/diseas e also affect miR -122 expression/release such as HCV and HBV, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and fibrosis 137,140,142. Although , miR -122 is not specific to a single liver condition it has demon- strated the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers as it is released very early upon liver injury and outperform s other methods such as AST and ALT measurements 130,139. Another miRNA linked to liver injury is miR -192 as release was elevated in the serum of alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF) and APAP o verdose patients 143-145. Expression of miR -192 was also shown to de- crease in liver tissue during fibrosis and HBV 146,147. Both miR -122 and miR -192 are useful markers of liver injury but are not disease specific ( e.g. fibrosis). APAP is commonly used to investigate DILI as it elicits concentration dependent acute hepatotox icity. The exact mechanism of APAP -induced hepatotoxicity is discussed further in section 4. 2.3. Krauskopf et al. identified 36 circulating miRNAs associated with APAP -induced hepatotoxicity as a result of overdose in patient samples 5 of which were liver enriched: miR- 122, miR -192, miR -194, miR -483, and miR -210 145. Krauskopf et al. carried out a follow up study using NGS where the differential release of 116 miRNAs was identified in patients who had suffered APAP overdose and once again included miR-122, miR -192, miR -194, miR -483, and miR -210 along with -150, miR -191, miR-21, miR-93, miR-223, more 143. Of these miRNAs, m iR-223 is associated with acute and chronic liver injury 148. miR -223 was shown to be upregulated in the livers of mice with surgi- cally induced ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) and in mice livers injured with CCl 4, APAP, and Conavalin A (Con A) 148. This was also confirme d in patients with ALF which resulted in in- creased miR -223 hepatic expression and release 148,149. 35 ALD has also been studied with regards to miRNA expression and release. Mice fed with an ethanol -containing diet (Lieber -DeCarli diet ) showed increased expression of miR - 320, miR -486, miR -705, and miR -1224 and decreased expression of miR-27b, miR -214, miR - 199a -3p, and miR -322 150,151. Dippold et al. demonstrated the deregulation of a panel of miRNAs, including miR -34a, miR -103, miR -107, and miR -122 in chronic EtOH fed rodents 152. miR -155 was also shown to play a crucial role in ethanol -induced liver toxicity and it is thought to promote liver fibrosis and alcohol -induced steatophepatitis 150,153. Hence, miRNAs have been suggested as putative biomarkers for a number of liver conditions. There is a critical need for non -invasive yet s ensitive and specific biomarkers of fibrosis that are better than those currently available (see section 3.4). As mentioned above , intracel- lular and extracellular deregulation of miR-122 and miR -192 are biomarkers of hepatocellular damage that are also detected during liver fibrosis progression. However they cannot be con- sidered as specific to liver fibrosis but rather indicators of l iver injury 140,141,144. In pursuit of biomarkers specific fo r fibrosis, studies in vitro and in vivo have identified miRNAs that are specifically differentially expressed/released during fibrosis progression (listed in T able 2 with references) . The role these miRNAs may play during HSC activation and liver fibrosis pro- gression has been studied for some but not all of the listed miRNAs. Of the 31 miRNAs listed, twelve inhibited HSC activation: -30c, miR -193, miR -19b, miR -146a, miR -9, miR -24, miR - 34, miR -150, miR -142, miR -29, miR -101 and miR -378 (Table 2). Whereas , ten of the listed miRNAs promoted HSC activation: miR -33a, miR -221, miR - 222, miR -181b, miR -125a, miR -17 and miR -31 (Table 2). Interestingly, of the miRNAs that promote HSC activation miR -33a, miR -181b, miR -125a and miR -17 wer e assessed in human serum samples, whereas miR -146b, miR -33a, miR -214, miR miR -221, miR -222 and miR-31 were studied intracellularly. Additionally, none of these miRNAs have been studied in the context of fibrosis as a result of chronic DILI as the se rum samples were taken from pa- tients with chronic hepatitis and NAFLD. Finally, the relationship between miRNA and tissue damage is complex: Krauskopf et al. demonstrated that some circulating miRNAs are less abundant ( miR-30c, miR -150, miR -222 miR more abundant ( miR-193, miR-34a, miR -221, miR -21 and miR -378) in patients with APAP -overdose 143. Therefore, these miRNAs, although they may play a role in fi brosis progression, are not necessarily spe- cific/suitable biomarkers for identifying liver fibrosis . In summary, a lthough circulating miRNAs have been investigated for patients with liver fibrosis, the majority has been identified in liver biopsy samples. In addition, specific miRNAs associated with DILI -induced fibrosis have not been extensively investigated and a panel of fibrosis -specific miRNAs would be desirable for early detection of fibrosis caused by medica- tions in patients. 36 Table 2. miRNAs associated with liver fibrosis . miRNA Clinical Evidence Study model Effect Ref. miR-30c Decreased in serum (LC).

MTX is composed of a pteridine ring, p -aminobenzoic acid and g lutamic acid (Figure 10) and has a molecular weight of 454.5 g/mol (C 20H22N8O5) and poor aqueous solubility 199. MTX is structurally very similar to folic acid with the exception of a replacement of a carbonyl group for an amine in the pteridine ring and the addition of a methyl group on t he p-aminobenzoic acid (Figure 10 ) 199. Figure 10. Structure of methotrexate and folic acid .

Furthermore, when active folate compounds are not synthesised purine biosynthesi s is also possible an anti -inflammatory agent. Image taken from Schmeling et al. and edited for this thesis 198. Concerning the chemotherapeutic potential of MTX, it is thought that the inhibition of purine and pyri midine biosynthesis results in the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis, a known therapeutic strategy used to treat a number of hyper -proliferative diseases including viral infections, autoimmune disorders and cancer 201,202. The mechanism by which low -dose 40 MTX modulates inflammation is still not fully understood and might differ for each disease. However, when treating rheumatic diseases it has been shown t hat combining MTX treatment with folic acid prevents much of the toxic effects of MTX without interfering with its anti -inflam- matory efficacy 203. This suggests that the therapeutic effect of MTX in pa tients with rheumatic diseases relies on folate -independent mechanisms , including suppression of transmethylation reactions resulting in the promotion of adenosine release as an anti -inflammatory agent 198,200. Although MTX is an effective treatment for RA and psoriasis, the adverse effects often result in therapy being discontinued 204. Minor side effects include mouth ulcers and gastroin- testinal intolerance . Major side effects include primarily bone marrow toxicity and liver function test abnormalities . Additionall y, folate deficiency has been i dentified as a risk factor for MTX toxicity and supplementation with folic acid and folinic acid significantly reduced the rate of discontinuation of MTX in RA patients with no effect on MTX efficacy 203. However, the exact reason how folat e supplementation reduced MTX toxicity is not fully understood 203. MTX has been shown to elicit DILI, resulting for some patients in elevated levels of AST and ALT 205. A comparative study of 108 patients taking MTX as an RA treatment showed that 29 had increased AST, ALT and stiffness demonstrated by abnormal ultrasound and the larger cumulative doses were more likely to promote liver fibrosis. Additionally, this study demonstrated that patients with a higher BMI were more susceptible to developing fibrosis 206. With re gards to MTX as a treatment for RA it has been demonstrated that the risk of develop- ing hepat ic fibrosis and cirrhosis is low 205. hepatic fibrosis is a potential conse- quence of MTX treatment for psoriasis yet the mechanism behind this is not fully understood 207,208. Cobb et al. carried out genome -wide analyses for novel genes involved in the response to MTX where they demonstrated that there was an association with TGF-/SMAD signalling and a member of the multi -drug resistance subfamily of the ATP -binding Moncrieffe et al. to be upregulated in patients with juvenile rheumatic arthritis treated with MTX 210. This is interesting as TGF- 1 release is a key event in liver fibrosis progression due to its stellate cell activating capacity 40. 41 4.2.3 Acetaminophen structure, metabolism and toxicity Acetaminophen (APAP) more commonly known as paracetamol is used worldwide as an analgesic a nd antipyretic that is a weak inhibitor of the synthesis of prostaglandins. Unlike non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase 2 (COX -2), APAP does not suppress inflammation of RA 211. Chemically, APAP is a phenol sub- stituted in the para -position by an amide group (Figure 1 2). Oxidation is essential to its mech- anism of action as a substrate and an inhibitor of the peroxidase function of COX -1 and COX - 2 211 and also leads to the formation of toxic metabolite NAPQI 212. Figure 12. Structure of acetaminophen phenol by an amide group , is a substrate and an inhibitor of the peroxidase function of COX -1 and COX -2. APAP is com- monly used as an analgesic and antipyretic. Image taken from PubChem . APAP is primarily metabolised in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and intestine. Therapeutic doses result in the majority of the APAP ( 52-57%) being in a more water -soluble molecule. Studies in human liver micro- somes and primary hepatocytes demonstrate that UGT2B15 are involved in APAP glucuronidation (Figure 13 A). To a lesser extent APA P (30-44%) is converted to sulfate conjugates. A family of cytosolic enzymes called sulfotransferases (SULT) carries out sulfation of APAP. A sulfo group transferred by SULTs to APAP increasing po- larity , making it more prone to elimination. SULT1A1 and SULT1A3/4 were first shown to cat- alyze APAP for xenobiotic metabo- lism in the liver 213. A minor fraction (5 -10%) is oxidised to the reactive metabolite NAPQI to the toxic metabolite NAPQI and the exact contribution of particular CYP 42 isoforms to APAP bio -activation varies and is dependent on drug concentration. CYP2E1 has been shown to have a role in bio -activation and oxi dation of APAP, but reports also suggest the involvement of CYP2A6 215,216. It has also been demonstrated that CYP2D6 is involved in oxidation of APAP but only at very high (toxic) doses i.e. when plasma lev els reach 2 mM 217,218. There have been suggestions that CYP3A4 is involved in APAP o xidation from experi- ments using hepatoma cell lines, yet experiments in human studies have demonstrated that the role of CYP3A4 is negligible 215. NAPQI elicits hepatotoxicity and is detoxified through the binding of sulfhydryl group of GSH to form APAP -GSH, which is excreted urine as APAP -cys. NAPQI conjugation to GSH occurs via a spontaneous process an d an enzymatic reaction catalysed by glutathi- one- S-transferases (GSTs). The spontaneous and non APAP -GSH and free APAP 212. There are seven distinct classes of enzymes that make the huma n cytosolic GST family with numerous genetic variants within each class 219. The most effective catalysts of NAPQI conjugation with GSH is GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1 212. Interestingly, GSTs have been pro- posed as a sensitive and early biomarker of acute liver damage as they are released as early as 4 hours after poisoning and remain elevated for 12 hours after ingestion 220,221. As supratherapeutic doses (more than 4 g/day) the sulfation pathway becomes satu- rated, while glucuronidation and oxidation increased. However, after a highly toxic dose the glucuroinidation becomes saturated as well leading to higher quantities (~ 10%) of APAP be- ing eliminated unchanged. There is also increased oxidation to NAPQI (> 15%), which even- tually depletes GSH stores resulting in NAPQI forming protein adducts by binding to cysteine groups on cellular proteins . Due to the fact NAPQI primarily targets mitochondrial proteins and ion channels this leads to a loss of energy production, ion misbalance and cell death 212. Lethal APAP doses can be effectively treated within 8 -10 hrs after exposure with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) . NAC replenishes GSH stores, scavenges reactive in mitochondria and enhances the sulfat ion metabolic pathway (Figure 13 B). This results in the risk of hepatotoxi- city being reduced to less than 5% 222. 43 Figure 13. APAP metabolism in the liver . APAP metabolism is shown at a therapeutic dose ( A) and toxic ( B). are excreted via blood and bile, respectively. A small quantity of toxic NAPQI is pro- duced , which is catalysed d via urine (A). Large quantities of APAP result in increased production of NAPQI causing GSH depletion, thereby preventing the detoxification process resulting in increased hepa- totoxicity and hepatocellular death (B). 44 4.3 Paper 1: Exosomal miRNA s release as a sensitive marker for drug - induced liver injury in vitro Accepted: 12th of August 2020 in Applied in vitro Toxicology Catherine Jane Messner 1,2,4, Arts Northwestern Switzerland, 4132 Muttenz, Switzer- land. 2University of Basel, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 4056 Basel, Switzerland. 3 University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western S witzerland, 1950 Sion, Switzerland. 4 Swiss Centre for Applied Human Toxicology (SCAHT), 4055 Basel, Switzerland.

Moreover, the functional involvement of selected miRNAs in the activation of the HSC was also investigated. In the first paper (Messner et al. Applied In vitro Toxicology , 2020) miRNAs were extracted from cell culture supernatant from HepaRG cells grown in 3D culture conditions upon expo- sure to chronic DILI compound MTX and ac ute DILI compound APAP. We confirm that Hep- aRG are a suitable model for assessing DILI due to their response to the compounds and to the maintenance of some key hepatocyte functions in the 3D -culture, namely stable viability, albumin release and CYP3A4 activity. Our data show that HepaRG in 3D have basal and rifampicin induced CYP3A4 activity. We also demonstrate that the ability of HepaRG to me- tabolise testosterone in 3D -cultures exceeds that of 2D cultures. In HepaRG MTs, APAP - induced toxicity resulted in increased release (exosome isolation and total extracellular miRNA sample) miRNAs associated with hepatocellular damage. Using recapitulate chronic DILI, we demonstrated that HepaRG MTs significantly released miRNAs into the medium at concentration s and exposure times at which only minimal toxicity was observed. Interestingly, exosomal miR -122 outperformed all other parameters (including total extracellular miRNA) in terms of detecting very early signs of MTX -induced liver injury. These results support the use of exosomal miRNAs as sensitive biomarkers of liver injury and provides a strong methodo- logical basis that could translate from an in vitro to an in vivo situation. In the second paper (Messner et al. in progress), we identified f our extracellular fibro- sis-specific miRNAs that were differentially released into cell culture supernatant by human liver MTs upon exposure to MTX but not APAP. Mimics of these four miRNAs ted into hTERT -HSCs to assess their role in the activation of the stellate cell. Increased intracellular levels of miR -199a -5p, miR-214-3p and miR -99b-5p promoted a -SMA fibronectin production. In ad- dition, miR -199a -5p and miR -214-3p promoted HSC proliferation and migration. Taken to- gether, our results show that these miRNAs can play a role in fostering fibrosis by activating the hepatic stellate cell. This leads us to propose that extracellular -199a -5p, miR -214-3p, miR -99b-5p and miR-125a -5p could contribute towards a panel of miRNAs to identify liver fibrosis. We were also able to demonstrate a functional link between the proposed biomarkers and a fibrotic 96 phenotype: miR -199a -5p, miR -214-3p and miR -99b-5p are involved in HSC activation an d thereby fibrosis progression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the 3D -HepaRG and 3D multicellular MTs are useful tools for investigating miRNA markers of hepatotoxicity and fibrosis, respectively. Finally, we were also able to identify four extracellu lar miRNAs that could contribute towards a non -inva- sive method to detect liver fibrosis, including three that show direct links to HSC activation. 97 Project 2: Investigating hepatotoxicity and pro-fibrotic potential of additional compounds 5.1 Aims Following, the investigation carried out using MTX and APAP, which demonstrated com- pound -specific responses of the MTs, t he aim of this sectio n wa s to assess the response of the MTs to additional hepatotoxic compounds, to assess fibrotic potential and iden tify the broad uses of this multicellular in vitro model. The first paper titled \"Bile salts regulate CYP7A1 expression and elicit a fibrotic response and abnormal lipid production in 3D liver microtissues\" investigated whether the MTs were capable of reca pitulating cholestatic injury upon exposure to large quantities of bile salts and to assess whether the resultant hepatocellular injury would elicit fibrosis. The second paper titled \"A 3D -human liver microtissue model for the assessment of fi- brotic potent ial of environmental chemicals\" Investigated the pro -fibrotic of (dioxin), PCB126 (dioxin -like) and B[a]P (PAH). Previous evidence has suggested that some dioxins may have an effect on HSC activation but these chemic als have not been introduced to a model capable of liver fibrosis in vitro . 98 5.2 Introduction 5.2.1 Bile biogenesis and c holestatic injury Bile formation is a unique function of the liver a nd serves a number of important func- tions including excretion of harmful substances as well as other endoge- nous substrates. It is also involved in elimination of cholesterol. Bile salts are involved in emul- sification of dietary fats, and facilitate intestinal absorption 6,13. Bile is a complex aqueous secretion that originates from hepatocytes and consists of a including bile en- porphyrins, vitamins , heavy metals, as well as exogenous xenobiotics and en- vironmental toxins 6. Hepatocytes secrete bile through the apical e.g. BSEP) into bile canaliculae. Bile is secreted out of the liver via the biliary tree, which consists of a series of bile ducts, common hepatic duct and the gallbladder. Once bile flows through these ducts it flows to the gallbladder where it is concentrated and stored 6. The bile ducts contain cholangiocytes which regulate the flow, composition and pH of the pri- mary bile 17. In the small intestine, bile salt s facilitate lipid digestion and absorption. On ly ap- proximately 5% of bile salt s are excreted as the other 95% are recycled as needed through enterohepatic circulation to maintain the bile pool 6. Enterohepatic circulation and bile salt concentrations at each stage are shown in Figure 14. Figure 14. Enterohepatic circulation with bile salt concentrations . Illustration shows enterohepatic circulation of bile including basal concentrations of bile flowing through each stage of the enterohepatic cycle (blue) . Concentration in green rep- resents the concentration of bile salts in the hepatic tissue. Image was based on a figure by Fickert et al. 223 then created using the 'Servier Medical Art' website . Concentrations were collected from 4 publications 223-226. 99 Bile consist of organic and typically pas- sively secreted ions at a similar concentration to those in plasma 6. In contrast , organic anions and cations are highly concentrated through active transport mecha nisms at the canalicular membrane , the most prevalent organic anion being bile salts. It is important to note that the chemistry of bile salts varies significantly among different species 6. In humans, t wo primary bile salts are synthesis ed from cholesterol : cholic aci d (CA), a trihydroxylated bile salt, and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), a can conjugate tau- rine or glycine via a side chain 227. These conjugated bile salt s are stronger acids , which limits their passive reabsorption . However, intestinal bacte ria produce \"secondary bile by con- (DCA) and by metabolising CDCA into lithocholic acid (LCA) (Figure 15 ). The bile salt ratio is approximately 40% and 20% DCA and <1% and LCA are the most hydrophobic and cytotoxic, the order of decreasing toxicity is LCA>DCA>CDCA>CA 228. Additionally, increased levels of DCA and LCA in the liver have been linked to cholestasis 229. Two mechanistic pathways known as the classical pathway and the alternative pathway produce bile (Figure 15). The classical pathway is initiated by the rate-limiting enzyme c holes- terol 7 -hydrolase (CYP7A1) , which transcriptionally regulated by a variety of nuclear re- ceptors and is involved in the tight regulation of bile production by a negative feedback loop 230. This is necessary as dysregulation leads to hepatocytes being exposed to cytotoxic con- centrations of bile salts resulting in inflammatory infiltration and injury, i.e. cholestasis 231. The majority of bile salt s are produced via the classical pathway (82%). CA synthesis requires -hydroxy -4-cholesten -3-one, an inter- mediate product and marker for the rate of bile salt synthesis 230. Mitochondrial steroid 27- hydroxylase (CYP27A1) catalys by oxidative cleavage of a 3 -carbon -side-chain to form CA and CDCA 230. In the alternative path way, CYP27A1 initiates bile salt synthesis by hydroxylation and oxidation of cholesterol to 3b -hydroxy -5-cholestenoic acid, is then 7a -hydroxylated by oxysterol 7a -hydroxylase (CYP7B1) to form CDCA bile salt hydrolases de conjugate conjugated -bile salt s and bacterial 7a -dehydroxylas es convert the primary bile salt s CA and C DCA to deoxycholic acid and LCA, respectively 230. Following this, most bile salt s are re -conjugated to glycine or . Conjugated bile salts can th en be transported back to the liver via the portal vein to go into enterohepatic circulation 230. 100 Figure 15. Bile salt production . Bile production pathway showing the two mechanistic pathways known as the classical pathway (produces 82% of bile salts) and the alternative pathway produce bile. The clas- sical pathway is initiated by the rate -limiting enzyme cholesterol 7 -hydrolase (CYP7 A1), which is tightly regulated by a negative feedback loop. Cholic acid (CA) synthesis requires sterol 12a chain oxidation, which is followed by oxidative cleavage of a 3 -carbon -side-chain to form CA and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). In the alternative pathway, CYP27A1 initiates synthesis hydroxylation and oxidation of cholesterol to 3b -hydroxy -5-cholestenoic acid this is Following this, oxysterol 7a -hydroxylase (CYP7B1) then carries out a 7a -dehydrox- ylation to form CDCA. In the jugated -bile CDCA (primary bile salts) to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and LCA (secondary bile salts), respectively. There are specific uptak e and export systems for biliary components in hepatocytes relevant for enterohepatic recirculation and excretion (Figure 1 6). Bile salt uptake transporters include sodium taurocholate co -transporting polypeptide (NTCP) and a family of multi -specific organic anion transporters (OATPs) 232,233. These are mainly responsible for clearance of con- jugated bile salts returning to the liver via the portal vein 233. ATP -binding cassette (ABC) transporter s mediate excretion of bile salts the bile t he excretion of cationic drugs. The phospholipid export pump MDR3 transports phosphatidyl -choline from the inner the bile canaliculi 233,236. Other (OSTa/b) are present at the basolateral membrane and function as back -up pumps for alternative sinusoidal bile salt export 233. Figure 16. Bile salt transporters . Hepatobiliary transport systems in liver and extrahepatic tissues in humans. Hepatocytes, via the basolateral Na2+/taurocholate cotransporter salts (BS). Canalicular for pump (MDR3) facilitates phosphatidylcholine (PC), which forms mixed micelles in bile together with BS and cholesterol. The multidrug (MDR1) -associated protein (MRP1 and MRP3) provide an alternative route for the elimination of BS and non -bile salt OA into the systemic circulation. Finally, reabso rption of BS in the terminal ileum occurs via ileal Na2+-dependent BS transporter renal tubules (PRTs) an additional, trun- cated isoform (t -ISBT) may be involve cholangiocytes. MRP2 is also lo- membrane of enterocytes and PRTs. MDR1 has also been located in the intestines and bile ducts. Image by Trauner and Boyer 233 . 102 5.2.2 Cholestatic liver injury Cholestasis is a clinical syndrome that is a result of impaired bile secretion and flow and can be either extra - or intrahepatic. Extrahepatic cholestasis is defined as a mechanical obstruction to the flow of bile from the liver 237. Causes include choledocholit hiasis and tu- mours. Intrahepatic cholestasis is caused by immune -mediated conditions like cholangitis, ex- posure to several medications (steroids, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, anti - diabetic agents) and inbor n errors of cholesterol/bile salt biosynthesis and/or metabolism 238. Cholestasis causes progressive bile duct injury and drives further r etention of toxic hydropho- bic bile salt s, which cause persistent and extensive damage to the bile ducts and liver 6. A large range of drugs elicit cholestatic injury, either due to toxicity of the drug cau sing direct injury to bile ducts or through eliciting an adverse immune response directed agai nst the liver . Chlorpromazine (CPZ) has been demonstrated to cause toxicity , oxidative stress and inflammation resulting in cholestatic injury 239-241. Drugs can also interfere with the bile excre- tory mechanisms such as ATP -binding cassette transporters 242. An example being bosentan , which is an endothelin receptor antagonist that inhibit s BSEP and MRP2 leading to intracellu- lar accumulation of bile salts, while increasing bile salt -independent bile flow 34. The ability of drugs to cause cholestatic injury is a challenge for drug -development, which means that a greater understanding of cholestatic in jury and development of relevant models of cholestasis would be a useful research tool and could result in preventative or ther- apeutic methods. There are both in vitro and in vivo cholestasis models, which have been proposed as suitable for assessing initiators of the injury process and elucidating relevant mechanisms. Different models have drawbacks and consider ing these is necessary prior to experimentation and is dependent on the research question . Common models typically use rodents such as the bile duct ligation model (BDL) 243, administration of lithocholic acid 244 or alphanaphthyli- sothiocyanate 245, multi -drug transporter knockout mice 246 or involving the inhib ition of BSEP 247. Although these models have aided in elucidating a variety of different potential causes and mechanisms it is important to address in vivo differences in species with regard to bile salt toxicity 228. Rodent models are flawed, as their bile composition is different to that of humans . For example m urine bile contains much larger quantities of hydrophilic bile salts , making their bile less toxic at high concentrations. In mouse liver, CDCA is converted to a-muricholic acid (a-MCA ), whi then epimerized to b -MCA and u -MCA and are highly soluble 230. Addition- ally, the m ouse liver is capable of converting LCA formed in the intestine to CDCA and can be epimerized to ursodeoxycholic acid (U DCA), a highly soluble bile salt that is less toxic than other bile salts 230. In vivo models using rodents with BDL , multi -drug transporter knockout mice and inhibition of BSEP tend to produce more hydrophilic bile salts that are non -toxic up 103 to mM concentrations and do not reflect the toxicity of bile salts seen in humans 228,248,249. Therefore , these animal models may n ot suitable for assessing the effects of accumulation of bile salts in the liver. LCA-feeding in rodents is also a popular cholestasis model as LCA is the most toxic of the bile salts produced, thereby eliciting hepatotoxicity 244. However, LCA only contributes to <1% of the total BS composition and does not reflect a physiologically relevant composition of bile 229. As hepatoc ellular damage by high bile salt concentrations (toxic hepatic concentration > 0.1g/ml or 1 M 223) is thought to be the initiator of the injury process, a variety of in vitro models using hepatocytes have been established 250 including hepatocytes cultured in mono- layers 251, sandwich cultures 252 and MTs 104. Using these methods, it has been demonstrated that exceeding physiological concentrations o f bile salts results in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and hepatocellular death . It is important to note that PHHs 253 tend to quickly lose hepatocellular c haracteristics when cultured in monolayers . Therefore , 3D cell culture techniques are becoming increasingly accepted as these methods have been shown to help maintain the phenotypic characteristics of cells for longer periods 93,104. MTs created using PHHs by Hend ricks et al. and confirmed the protein expression o f BSEP and MRP2, which are export pumps found in hepatocytes in the liver. They also demonstrate exacerbation of cholestatis in PHH through co-exposure to bile salts and compounds with cholestatic potential . This study demonstrated that PHHs can be used to investigate cholestatic injury elicited by compounds such as C CPZ in vitro 104. This is corroborated through transcriptomic evidence of PHH s exposed to a range of drugs with cholestatic potential ( CPZ, cyclosporin A, ibuprofen, amiodarone) against do not elicit cholestatic injury (APAP). Although PHHs are considered the gold standard for in vitro models alternatives are commonly used due to diffi culty i n acquiring primary liver cells as described above in section 3.5. Alternatives typically include the use of hepatoma cell lines of which the most commonly used are Huh7 and HepG2. However, both these cell lines lack or have very low expression of important transporters such as NTCP and BS EP, leading to transfection being required in order to achieve active uptake of bile salts 254-257. HepaRG cells express a variety of essential cytochromes that other hepatoma cell lines do not 86 and they also express both canalicular and basolater al transporters 253,258. This makes these cells an alternative more relevant to human pathophysiology. HepaRG cells have already been used to carry out a variety of drug toxicity studies including the in vestigation of drug -induced cholestasis in both 2D and 3D cell culture systems 104,239,240,259,260. Hendricks et al. demonstrated that HepaRG cells are a suitable cell line especially in 3D models to assess the effects of cholestatic compounds such as chlor- promazine 104. 104 5.2.3 Link between cholestasis and fibrosis If cholestasis is left untreated it can progress to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually liver failure 261. This has been evidenced both clinically 262 and in a variety of in vivo models including BDL 243, BSEP inhibition 252 and administration of alphanaphthylisothiocyanate and lithocholic acid 244,245. Accumulation of bile results in the exposure of the hepatocytes to toxic concentrations of bile salts causing hepatocellular death and inflammation , which are key event s in the liver fibrosis AOP 263. PHHs exposed to bile salts and mice fed with LCA showing that hepatocytes undergo necrosis upon exposure to high concentrations of bile 249,260 and could be a contrib- uting factor to liver fibrosis development. However, Allen et al. suggested that although hepatocytes promote an inflammatory response , it was not through the release of damage - associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) from the dying hepatocytes 251. Instead they hypothesised that hepatocytes exposed to bile salts may contribute to the chemokine milieu that is responsible for lymphoc yte and neutrophil recruitment into the liver 251. Additionally, neutrophil inflammation through ROS production has been shown in BDL rodents 264,265. It is still unclear w hat role the exact hepatocytes play in the development of fibrosis elicited by cholestatic injury. KCs are thought to be involved in cholestatic injury as patients with choles- tasis due to extrahepatic obstruction show increased ICAM -1 expression, which was thought to occur due to KC activation and release of cytokines 266. Cholestatic injury also results in upregulated IL -17 267, which has been shown to play a role in inducing IL-1, TGF -1, IL -6, and TNF - in KCs 268. However, further investigation is required to confirm this link between cholestatic injury and fibrosis and the poten tial role KCs may play. Cholangiocytes also play a role in bile salt toxicity as they have been shown to prolifer- ate in order to handle increased bile load to prevent infarction 269. They also play a role in bile flow through the release of anions ( Cl) and ( HCO3), which regulate water flux and drive biliary flow 270,271. Despite th ese protective methods , cholangiocyte proliferation could also actively play a role in fibrosis progression, as increased secretin and secretin receptor in cholangio- cytes , which is seen in cholestatic injury, results in increased proliferation and fibrogen esis promoting in bile duct hyperplasia and fibrosis, respectively 272. In vitro studies using LX2 cells and primary rat HSCs have demonstrated that bile salts are capable of eliciting HSC activation and proliferation, respectively. Saga et al. demonstrated that secondary unconjugated bile salts (DCA) are capable of inducing shown by increased -SMA production 273. Yarde et al. found that CA, CDCA and LCA promote HSC activation and proliferation 274. In summary, these two publications demonstrate that CA, DCA, CDCA and LCA are all capable of eliciting HSC activation. Using pri mary rat HSCs, Svegliati - Baroni et al. demonstrated that bile salts activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 105 and induce proliferation at concentrations of 25 M to 200 M 275. These concentrations are closer to concentrations seen during cholestatic injury and these data suggest that bile salts could play a role in exacerbating HSC activation in the areas of injury 266. It is clear that cholesta tic liver fibrosis is multicellular process as different relevant liver cells play different roles in potentially eliciting/exacerbating liver fibrosis . Therefore, having a suitable in vitro model will allow us to better understand cholestatic liver fibros is but also could be useful in the development of disease management and therapies. 106 5.3 Paper 3: Bile salts regulate CYP7A1 expression and elicit a fibrotic re- sponse and abnormal lipid production in 3D liver microtissues Accepted: 3rd of June 2019 in Toxicology in vitro Catherine Jane Messner1,2, Linda Mauch1, Laura Suter -Dick1. 1University of Ap plied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland, School of Life Sciences, Muttenz, Switzerland. 2University of Basel, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 4056 Muttenz Email: catherine.messner@fhnw.ch 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 5.4 Introduction 5.4.1 Environmental Pollutants: dioxins and dioxin -like compounds. Environmental pollution is the deterioration in the physical, chemical, and biological quality of the environment. Pollution can directly or indirectly af fect human health. Pollutants can be clas- sified as biodegradable and non -biodegradable 276. Biodegradable pollutants include sewage ef- fluents and organic matter that are readily decomposed. Whereas non -biodegradable substances are not degraded by microorganisms, e.g. heavy metals, plastics, and detergents 276. Dioxins are included in the non -biodegradable category of pollutants and are persistent in the environment 277. Dioxins usually refer to polychlorinated dibenzo crystals and enter the envi ronment as mixtures containing individual components and impurities 278. PCDDs and PCDFs are formed of two ben- zene rings bonded via oxygen atoms. The two rings of PCDDs are joined by two oxygen bridges whereas PCDFs are joined by a carbon bond and one oxygen bridge (Figure 1 7) 278. Chlorine atoms can be attached to eight different place s on the molecule (numbered 1 -8 on figure 1 7) 278. Dioxins have no known natural use and the only natural source is from forest fires and volcano activity. Therefore, m ost are formed and released as by -products of human activities such as industrial processes and waste incineration 278,279 . Other sources include coal -fired power plants and burning of chlorinated compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 277,278,280 . Dioxins are hydrophobic and strongly lipophilic and the increased chlorine content increases solubility 278. Due to the lack of solubility, they attach strongly to any material with high organic content such as aquatic microscopic plants and animals which then get eaten by larger animals and thus diox- ins circulate through the food chain 278. It has been shown that about 90 -98% of the average human exposure to dioxin and dioxin -like compounds results from dietary intake, with animal - based products ( e.g milk) as the predominant source due to contaminations in their feed 281,282. However, there have also been contaminations fou nd in citrus pulps 282. In Belgium , in 1999 , 500 tonnes of animal feed became contaminated with dioxin/dioxin -like compounds, leading to testing of over 40,000 samples of food showing 6.5% of poultry samples and 8.1% of the egg samples tested positive for toxic concentrations of dioxin/dioxin -like c ompounds 283. Accidental exposure has also occurred for example in 1976 a chemical plant in Seveso Italy. An uncontrolled reaction occurred resulting in an explosion that released TCDD into the surroundin g environment reaching up to 100 ppm (100 times higher than the accepted range), which ultimately affected the sur- rounding community members demonstrated by the development of skin lesions 284. This demon- strates the requirement to understand the contamination patterns but also to understand the ef- fects and concentrations of dioxins and dioxin -like compounds could have on human health. 119 Figure 17. PCDD and PCDF structure . Two benzene rings bonded via oxygen atoms form PCDDs and PCDFs. Two oxygen bridges in PCDDs join the two rings, whereas a carbon bond and one oxygen bridge join PCDFs. Chlorine atoms can be attached in eight different places on the molecule, which are mark ed by numbers 1 -8.

Dioxins induce phase I and phase II metabolising enzymes through activation of aryl hydro- carbon receptor ( AhR). AhR is a member of the basic Helix -Loop -Helix (bHLH) \u2014 Per-ARNT -Sim (PAS) family of transcription factors that regulate various physiological and developmental pro- cesses 285. AhR is localised in the cytoplasm and is activated by xenobiotic compounds ( including dioxins and dioxin -like compounds) that diffuse through the plasma membrane due to their lipo- philic properties. Following the activation of AhR the resultant signalling pathway leads to metab- olism of the lipophilic compounds 285. In the canonical pathway , AhR is localised in the cytoplasm and maintained in an inactive form in the absence of agonists. They are maintained in this form by chaperone proteins prostaglandin E synthase 3 (PTGES3), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and AhR -interacting protein (AIP) 285. When an agonist such as a dioxin or dioxin -like compound diffuses through the plasma membrane and binds to AhR the chaperone proteins are released and dioxin -AhR complex binds to the transcription factor AhR nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) 285. The dioxin -AhR complex migrates to the nucleus and it binds to xenobiotic -response elements (XRE), which are found on promotor regions of various genes. The process of dioxin -AhR com- plex binding to XRE modulates the expression downstream genes including: phase I e nzymes CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and CYP1A2; phase UGT1A6; AhR re- pressor (AHRR) 285. The non -canonical pathway involves AhR interacting with other receptor - mediated signalling pathways. There are a wide variety of phenotypical changes AhR signalling can elicit, including cell cycle regulation, mitogen -activated protein kinase cascades, i mmediate -early gene induction and cross -talk with other nuclear receptors 286 There is also evidence of a cross -talk between AhR and estrogen receptor signalling pathways 287. Links between AhR and immune system modula- tion through the transcription factor NF -B have been identified and occur by inducing regulatory T cells expansion, repressing IL -17 or enhancing IL -22 288-290. 120 Figure 18. Structure of TCDD, PCB126, B[ a]P. The structure of TCDD B[a]P (C) are shown.TCDD corresponds to PCDD structure with the addition of four chlorine atoms (A). PCB126 is a bicyclic chlorinated hydro- carbon with structural similarity and toxic mode of action to dioxins (B) . B[a]P is a polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formed by a benzene ring fused to a pyrene (C). Similar to dioxins it also induces AhR signalling. Images taken from PubChem. Organ toxicities have also been observed and a cute exposure to dioxins damages the gas- trointestinal tract, liver, pancreas and causes nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. Acute expo- sure has also been linked to chloracne, which is a chronic infla mmatory skin condition 278. Addi- tionally, dioxins have been shown to be risk factors for cancer 291, immune deficiency 292, repro- ductive and developmental abnormalities 284, endocrine disruption (e.g. diabetes and thyroid dis- orders) 293 and many more conditions which are listed by Schecter et al. 285. For this reason, understanding the effects and toxicity of dioxins and dioxin -like compounds on humans and ani- mals is essential for developing stringent regulations regarding dioxin contaminations and general intake. For the purpose of this thesis, three pollutant compounds capable of inducing AhR signalling were chosen (Figure 18) . The first compound is the with the addition of four chlorine atoms 294. The second com- pound is the dioxin -like compound PCB126, which is a bicy clic chlorinated hydrocarbon, known to elicit d evelopmental toxicity . The third compound is B[a]P , a polycyclic aroma tic hydrocarbon (PAH), known carcinogen and en vironmental pollutant . Rodent models are often used to assess dioxin toxicity. However, there are large differences in lethali ty and phenotypic responses to TCDD exposure. This could be explained by small differ- ences in the gene/structure of AhR. Despite these varied responses a variety of studies hav e been carried out and have provided important information regarding TCDD toxicity and tran- scriptomic responses 295,296. Specifically, rodent models the association between TCDD 121 and tumorigenesis 297,298. PCB126 is linked in rodents to metabolic disruption induces gluco- neogenesis disruption and fatty acid oxidation 299-301. Finally, using models it has been shown that B[a]P elicits tumorigenesis and also affects reproduction 302,303. There are c oncerns involved with using in vivo models to extrapolate human safety and predict adverse effects in humans 304 . Typically, in vivo models require high doses and there is a risk of species specific effects 285,305. Human models to assess dioxin and dioxin -like compound toxicity include the use of lung HepaRG, neuronal cells, MCF -7, primary humans HSCs 306-312. These studies cover a wide range of topics including intestinal absorption 311, potency to the lungs 309, cholinergic enzymes in neuronal studies 308, tumour growth 307 and metabolis m/toxicity in liver 306,310. 5.4.3 Hepatotoxicity dioxin -like compounds. Dioxins and dioxin -like compounds have been shown to have gastrointestinal effects in hu- mans. TCDD has been shown to increase the overall liver size after exposure to TCDD due to industrial accidents. Additionally, acute exposures t o TCDD have also shown increase ALT and AST levels 313,31 4. Using in vivo models it has been shown that dioxins and dioxin -like compo unds are capable of and ECM deposition 315-322. Additionally, TCDD also elicited a pro -inflammatory response in mice 316,317,323,324. Chang et al. assessed hepatotoxicity in mice exposed to TCDD. Their results show that TCDD elicited dose -related pathological changes including centrilobular fatty change, cellular swelling and degeneration and hepatocellular necrosis 321. Multiple studies have demonstrated that TCDD exposure in mi ce elicits HSC activation shown by increased SMA protein 316,317,323. ECM deposition has also been confirmed by increased Col I 316,317 and general collagen staining by PicroSirius Red 320. Interest ingly, a study by Lamb et al. demonstrated that TCDD was capable of increasing necroinflammation and HSC activation , but liver fibrosis was not exacerbated as no deposition of Col I was observed 323. Additionally, exposure of TCDD amplified liver impairment and not only promoted liver fibrosis in obesity -related N AFLD using fatty liver, including TCDD 325. PCB126 exposure promoted lipid accumulation in rats in vivo 300. Additionally, Shan et al. co-exposed apolipoprotein PCBs, which worsened NAFLD 326. PCB126 has been linked to disrupted liver function, lipid ac- cumulation and inflammation and Wahlang et al. exposed fibrotic -mice to PCB126 which demon- strated that PCB exacerbated fibrosis 327. B[a]P has also been shown to have hepatotoxic effects, elicit oxidative stress and DNA damage 328-331 and induce lipid metabolic diseases 332. No direct link has been made that demonstrates that PCB126 or B[a]P are capable of directly causing liver fibrosis 122 The small number of in vitro systems used to investigate dioxin induced liver toxicity are typically human primary cells or cell lines cultured in monolayers. These include hepatocyte - based models using primary hepatocytes, HepaRG or HepG2. Additionally, two publications re- port that assessed the effect of dioxins in vitro using primary HSCs or th e LX-2 cell line 312,333. Studies with HepG2 have demonstrated they are useful for assessing toxicity, AhR signal- ling, metabolomics and transcriptional signatures upon exposure to dioxins 334-338. However, as mentioned in previous sections it has already been shown that HepG2 do not express essential drug-metabolising genes and do not respond in a similar manner to primary hepatocytes 339,340. Comparative studies of HepG2 and HepaRG for the purpose of chemical hazard identification has been carried out by Jenne n et al. In order to understand the biological effects (including adverse outcomes ) that environmental pollutants may cause , they demonstrate that HepaRG most closely resemble PHHs341. HepaRG have only been used for a very small number of dioxin toxicity studies 341-343. Mesnage et al. demonstrated that PCB 126 (concentrations >100 pM) ac- tivated the AhR receptor in HepaRG. PCB 126 also provoked a decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids and an increase in sphingolipid levels. They also show an increase in oxidative stress 342. AhR activation and signalling ha ve also been studied in PHH 306,344,345. As mentioned previously, dioxins and dioxin -like compounds have the potential to elicit fi- brosis in in vivo models. However, t here is currently conflicting data on whether TCDD elicit s fibrosi s, despite the fact that it is the most potent dioxin 346. The majority of studies demonstrate that TCDD appear s to elicit stellate cell activation at high concentrations 316,317,333. Additionally, the in vitro study by Harvey et al. identified that TCDD directly activated immortalised HSCs (LX - 2 cells) and promoted proliferation, but have no effect on Col I mRNA levels 333. HSC activation was also demonstrated by Lamb et al. using LX-2 cells exposed to TCDD, which also resulted in HSC activation 333. To the best of our knowledge, no human co -culture system has been used to assess ad- verse effects of dioxin and dioxin -like compounds to investigate whether environmental pollutants have any fibrotic potential. 123 5.5 Paper 4 Assessment of fibrotic pathways induced by environmental chemicals using 3D -human liver microtissue model Manuscript currently under review Lu Yan*1, Catherine Jane Messner*2,3,4, Xiaowei Zhang1, Laura Suter -Dick2,4 1 State Key Laborator of Pollution Control & Resource Reuse, School of the Environment, Nan- jing, P.

In the first paper (Messner at al. In vitro Toxicology, 2019) the MT s were exposed to high concentrations of bile salts (CA & DCA) to investigate the link between cholestatic injury (charac- terised by bile accumulation) and fibrosis. Using multicellular MTs in comparison to 2D culture systems , we see increased sensitivity to bile salts , closer to the physiolog ical concentrations. Recently, the median concentration of bile salts in subjects with fi brosis has been iden tified to be approximately 1.3 \u00b5g/ml (2.9 \u00b5M) 347, demonstrating the toxicity we see at 30 \u00b5g/ml is only 20 times higher, as opposed to previous studies investigating bile salt induced HSC activation that used concentrations as high as 205 \u00b5g/ml (500 \u00b5M) 273. We demonstrate that the multicellular MTs contain bile canaliculi and bile sa lts treatment decreased CYP7A1 expression, thereby regulating bile salt production through the negative feed- back loop, demonst rating the suitability of this in vitro MT model to investigate cholestasis. Clini- cally bile accumulation leads to hepatotoxicity, inflammation, fibrosis and dysregulation of hepatic functions such as lipid production, which we were also able to recapitulate using bile salts and our 3D culture system . These data are in support of the 3D human liver MTs as being a useful in vitro tool for investigating the hepatotoxicity of bile salts and the link to fibrosis , which could con- tribute to further understanding and therapy development. In the second paper (Yan an d Messner et al. under review) the MTs were exposed to three environmental pollutants TCDD, PCB126, B[a]P to assess the adverse outcomes these toxins could cause. Human relevant in vitro models are required , as a large number of dioxin studies use rodent m odels, despite known species differences in AhR signalling 338. All thr ee compounds are known to activate AhR leading to increased expression of CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 , which the MTs were able recapitulate . Interestingly, we saw a strong CYP1A1 induction by PCB 126 even at the lowest concentration of 60 pM, which is a c oncentration seen environmen- tally 342. This response shows that the MTs are presenting a compound -specific response to dioxin and dioxin -like compounds. Only B[a]P elicited hepatotoxicity and fibrosis in the MTs at the concentrations tested, de- spite all three compounds eliciting AhR signalling. This suggests that activation of AhR signalling alone does not promote a fibrotic response. This is also supported by the response to PBC126, which stimulated the highest expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 but did not cause toxicity or fibrosis. Our finding that AhR signalling is not directly linked to fibrosis is in agreement with a previous finding that demonstrated AhR stimulation by a non -toxic compound resulted in de- creased HSC activation 312. These data demonstrate that the MTs are a promising in vitro tool for 134 assessing the safety of environmental toxins and could provide a more human -relevant model for extrapolat ing human risk. In conclusion, the MTs demonstrate the capacity to respond to a variety of different com- pounds and display the expected phenotypic response: toxic bile salt concentrations elicit CYP7A1 downregulation and cholestatic injury; environmental pollutants activa te AhR signalling. This demonstrates the versatility of the MTs as an in vitro tool for understanding the biological response to many different compounds. 135 Project 3: Incorporation of endothelial cells to the multicellular MT model 6.1 Aims The aim of this project was to increase the structural complexity of the MTs through the addition of an endothelial cell type. The endothelial cell type chosen are HUVECs, which are readily available an d a commonly used surrogate in in vitro models for a wide range of endothelial cells. We also aimed to investigate whether the 4 -cell model containing HepaRG, THP -1, hTERT - HSC and HUVECs was viable and stable overtime. Furthermore, the MTs were exposed t o pro - fibrotic stimuli (TGF -1, MTX and TAA) in order to assess whether the incorporation of the addi- tional cell type would result in a different response or affect the capacity of the MTs to recapitulate fibrosis . 136 6.2 Introduction 6.2.1 LSEC s in healthy and fibrotic liver LSECs are differentiated during embryogenesis at gestational weeks 5 -12 in humans and ultimately make up 15-20 % of total liver cells 2. It has been shown that during differentiation the endothelial cells destined to become LSECs lose classic endothelial cell such as platelet endothelial adhesion molecule -1 -1) of differentiation (CD31), CD34 and 1F10 antigen. They also gain expres sion of markers of adult sinusoidal cells and intracellular adhesion molecule to LSEC mature LSEC s, intrahepatic or resident si- nusoidal endothelial cell progenitors, and bone marrow derived sinusoidal endothelial cell pro- genitors 20. Mature LSECs can proliferate in normal conditions when stimulated with growth fac- tors including vascular endothelial growth factor or (FGF) 20,348. Resident sinusoidal endothelial cell progenitors most likely LSEC regeneration. Bone marrow derived sinusoidal endo thelial cell progenitors do not elicit LSEC turnover in a normal liver. However, it is important to remember that LSEC renewal differs between physiological and pathological conditions and after liver injury, the bone marrow derived sinusoidal endothelial cell progenitors have been shown to be a main driver in liver regeneration 20. The l iver sinusoid has a dual blood supply and receives blood from the portal vein (70%) and the hepatic artery (30%) 19. Intrahepatic shear stress is recognised as a main driver of hepatic blood flow regulation and is known as the frictional force applied by blood flow on the endothelial surface 349. It has been previously demonstrated that LSECs are the main source of NO in the normal liver through endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation by shear stress. factor 2 (KLF2) elicits the downr egulation of vasoconstrictive molecules such as endothelin - 1. LSECs also release other molecules capable of regulating blood flow including vasodilating agent carbon monoxide (CO) and the metabolites of the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway (throm- boxane A2, Pro stacyclin) 19. All these molecules act in a paracrine manner on hepatic stellate cells localized in the space of Disse. Healthy LSECs maintain hepatic stellate cell qui escen ce, thereby inhibiting their vasoconstrictive effect 350. LSECs form highly permeable structures due to their fenestrae and absence of basement membrane 19. The fenestrae are 50 -150 nm in diameter, organised in cluste rs termed sieve plates. The periportal region contains larger but fewer fenes- trae per sieve plate whereas the centrilobular region has smaller but more numerous fenestrae per sieve plate 351. It was also been shown that the cytoskeleton is of great importance for the structure of the fenestrae which appear surrounded by actin filaments 352. LSECs retain blood cells in the vessels while other molecules such as metabolites, plasma proteins, pharmaceutical drugs, lipoproteins, small chylomicron remnants, viruses and exosomes can access the space of Disse to be taken up by hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells 352,353. 137 LSECs have one of the highest endocytic capacities in humans. This in combination with a strong lysosomal activity give the LSECs the ability to clear waste from the blood. LSECs clear soluble macromolecules and small particles through endocytic receptors. LSECs also endocytose molecules into the space of Disse, which is a process called transcytosis. LSECs express multiple endocytosis receptors such as scavenger receptors (SR -A, SR -B and SR The SRs mediate endocytosis of poly anionic molecules such as oxidis ed and acetylate d low- density lipoproteins, advanced glycation end points and waste products (hyaluronan , chondroitin sulfate or N -terminal propeptides of procollagen (I, III)) 22. The mannose receptors are not specific to LSECs and bind a wide range of glycoproteins and microbial glycans, such as collagen alpha chains (I, II, III, IV, V, XI), tissue plasminogen activator regulating fibrinolytic activity, and lysoso- mal enzymes that are recruited for further use in LSEC 354. The Fc gamma -receptor IIb2 is the only Fc gamma -receptor expressed by LSECs and mediates the clearance of small circulating immune c omplexes; LSEC s play a role in vascular immunity through this receptor 354. LSECs are strongly invol ved in initiation and progression of chronic liver disease. Four processes Capill arisation in the context of liver injury cor- responds to the loss the unique phenotype of LSECs to become ordinary non -specialised endo- thelial 19,355. Capilliarisation precedes HSC activation and KC act ivation, making it an early event in liver fibrosis progression 19. The crosstalk between LSECs and hepatic stellate cells un- derlines that LSECs contribute to the maintenance of HSC quiescence 350. Two major pathways, i.e. capillaris ation of the LSECs and the release of soluble factors affecting the phenotype of neighbouring cells initiate the onset of fibrogenesis. I n parallel, other key events mentioned pre- viously are occurring such as hepatocellular injury and KC activation 19. 138 Figure 19. Role of LSECs in liver fibrosis & cirrhosis . In which results in the release of vasodilating agents such as nitric oxide (NO). It also causes downregulation of vasoconstrictive molecules including endothelin -1. LSECs produc- tion of collagen and fibrosis progression. Cirrhotic livers have shown that endothelial cells lose their fenestrae and develop a basement membrane. Image taken from Poisson et al. 19. 6.2.2 Current in vitro liver models containing endothelial cells Successful extraction and culture of LSECS (human and rodent) using 2D culture tech- niques has been reported . Experiments using 2D LSECs have demonstrated it is possible to as- sess multiple characteristics such as fenestrae, expression of (vWF) and acety- lated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) uptake 357. Short -term experiments can also be carried out such as transcriptional characterisation and identification of new markers/transcriptional regula- tors for such as GATA binding protein and Meis homeobox 2 358. However, u sing LSECs in 2D has drawbacks as it was shown that the LS EC morphology and growth rate i s only maintained for 3 passages, when the cells beco me flattened, granular fenestrae are lost and irregular cytoplasmic projections appe ar 350,359. Therefore, long -term cul- tures required for assessing certain diseases such as liver fibrosis are not possible using this system. LSECs have also been successful ly immortalised using both rodent and human primary cells. E 19. The different immortalised c ell lines display different benefits and drawbacks. Of the human cell lines, TRP3 and SK Hep1 demonstrate a more successful maintenance of fenestrae, are capable 139 of forming tubes, taking up acLDL and express vWF 360,361. Whereas, the human LSEC cell line TMNK1 is capable of taking up acLDL, forming tubes and expresses vWF on an mRNA level but no organised fenestrae were maintained 362. The rodent models TSEC and NP11 showed a few and no organised fenestrae, respectively. However, similar to the TMNK1 human cell line they were capable of taking up acLDL and forming tubes 363,364. The use of immortalised LSECs pro- vides us with the ability to maintain typical LSEC characteristics for longer ( 11 passages) but even immortalisation does not provide us with the capacity to carry out long -term c ulture experi- ments . Micropatterned sandwich culture techniques have also been used which involved co -cul- tures directly together and separated cultures using Matrigel, in an attempt to prolong character- istic maintenance. However, co -cultures with and withou t Matrigel did not significantly improve the model or allow for long experiments. Interestingly, despite the benefits of 3D cell cultur e mentioned above in section 3.5 no pub- lications were found using LSECs in 3D alone, as they are typically only used in combination with other cell types. There are both human and rodent 3D culture models published that incorporate different variations of LSECs, KCs cessfully extracted from rats and mice, characterised and cultured long -term 365,367. However, as described above (section 3.5) rodent in vivo and in vitro models have issues when extrapolating findings to humans dependent on the research question. Therefore, human in vitro models are the primary focus. Successful incorporation of the PHH and NPC mixture into 3D mic rotissues has been car- ried out demonstrating the spheroids express both PHH and NPC markers 97,101,106,368. In addition to the incorporation and characterisation , drug toxicity studies have been carried out on the mul- ticellular MTs demonstrating successful aluridine 93,106. 106,368. However, of these publications only Baze et al. showed data demonstrating the suc- cessful incorporation of endothelial cells by LYVE1, PECAM1 expression 101. Messner et al. demonstrated that no positive staining was visible for endothelial markers, thereby demonstrating a lack of efficient LSEC incorporation 93. Two studies have successfully used iPSCs to generate LSEC -like cells 81,369. Koui et al. obtained mature LSECs by using an established protocol to induce IP SC differentiation into mes- oderm and then endothelial cell progenitors, which are CD34 positive. The cells were further ma- tured using a TGF inhibitor and hypoxic conditions that promote the acquisition of mature endo- thelial morphology 81. Gage et al. used a similar method as they first produced venous and a rterial angioblasts , which was and TGF -inhibition resulting in -like cells. They also concluded that using venous angioblasts was a more effi-140 cient method to produce LSEC -like cells with markers over the arte rial angio- blasts 369. These have not yet been incorporated into a 3D model. iPSC derived hepatocyte -like cells have been cultured with human adipose microvascular endothelial cells (HAMEC) to gener- ate Co of iPSC -derived hepatocytes and HAMEC, demonstrated enhanced hepatocyte characteristics through the co -culture based model 370. iPSC - derived hepatocytes have also been co -cultured wi th human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HU- VECs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which self -assembled to create clusters that resem- bled liver buds 371. HUVECs are a commonly used endothelial cell surrog ate in a variety of different models as umbilical veins are more readily available and are isolated and maintained with relatively min- imal effort 372,373. HUVECs have been incorporat ed into a handful of in vitro liver models 371,374 -376. Suurmond et al. generated a co -culture model of hepG2, mouse KCs and HUVECs to establish a NASH liver model. However, this model is lacking HSCs and contains mouse KCs so it is not optimal for reflecting human physiology 374. Jung et al. also used a hepatoma cell line Huh7 in combination with HUVECs to investigate HCC in vitro . As mentioned previously in section 3.5 HepG2 and Huh7 are not the most rel evant cell line s for assessing hepatocyte function, addition- ally this model is lacking essential HSCs and KCs. HUVECs have also been incorporated into collagen/fibronectin matrix composites by Takebe et al. and co -cultured with human fetal liver cells and MSCs to generate hepatic tissue 377. Co-culture has also been performed by Nelson et al. with hepatocyte -like C3A cells and HUVECs to assess APAP toxicity 376. Similar to the other models mentioned these models successfully incorporate HUVECS, but are lacking other essen- tial cell types that play important roles in liver function and injury. All the models were lacking HSCs, whic h as mentioned previously plays an important role in liver injury and wound healing. The majority of them are also missing KCs, which provide an inflammatory response, which is another essential contributor to liver injury and disease. A 3D in vitro model that efficiently and consistently contains endothelial cells co -cultured with other essential liver cells (HSCs, hepatocytes, KCs) is required to investigate the role endo- thelial cells play in liver injury. 141 6.3 Materials and Methods 6.3.1 Cell culture HepaRG cells were obtained from Biopredic International (Rennes, France). The cells were seeded at 1 x 105 undifferentiated cells/cm2 in medium with growth supplements ADD710 (Bio- predic). The cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 14 days before differentiation. After 14 days of culture, cell differentiation was induced with medium with differentiation supplements ADD720 (Biopredic) for 14 days. Then the cells were maintained in differentiation medium for up to 4 weeks. HepaRG were passaged using Trypsin -EDTA (Invitrogen, provided by Dr. Bernd Schnabl (UC San Diego, USA) and were cultured in DMEM Hig h Glucose (Invitrogen, monocytic cells (Cell Line Service) were cultured at 2 -10 x 105 cells/mL in RPMI 2. THP -1 cells were differentiated into macrophages over 48 hours in RPMI 1 640 medium containing 10 ng/mL Phorbol 12 -myristate 12 -acetate (PMA) (Sigma, Cat. 79346) as described in previous literature 92 .

The unpaired Student t test was used for comparison between two groups and P < 0.05 was considered to be significant: * , P 0.05; ** , P 0. 01; ***, P 0.001 . 146 6.4 Results HLMTs were (methods 6.3.2) HepaRG, HUVECs, -1 6.3.3). At 48 hrs of mainte- nance the HepaRG appear ed to be located on the outer layers of the HLMTs. Both the THP -1 and hTERT -HSC were stained with violet CelltrackerTM so we can conclude that these two cell types are also located on the outer la yers but a few cells are more central. HUVECS which were stained using red CelltrackerTM can be seen in the centre of the HLMTs (Figure 20A). Following this, the HLMTs were cultured for longer periods. The ATP content of the HLMTs were measured over 28 d ays and the relative content is shown in comparison to day one demon- strated there was no significant cha nge in HLMT viability (Figure 2 0B). Following the aggregation phase the diameter of the HLMTs was also measured over 21 days, which also demonstrated that there was no significant difference in size during t he maintenance phase (Figure 2 0C). Ex- pression of CD31 was assessed using q -RT-PCR to confirm the incorporation of HUVECs over the 28 day culture period. Results demonstrate that CD31 is stably expresse d over time in the HLMTS (Figure 2 0D). HLMTs were fixed at day 7, day 10 and day 14 and stained to identify the incorporation of the four cells types: CD31 1). As the THP -1 stained positive for CD31 additional staining was carried out using vWF, which is specific to HUVECs, to confirm incorporation and investigate localisation. The HUVECs were located in the central area of the 14 day old MTs (Figure 2 2), which is consistent with the resu lts using CellTracker (Figure 20A). In order to identify whether the HLMTs were capable of recapitulating liver fibrosis they were exposed to pro \u00b5M MTX and 10 mM TAA for 10 days. Relative ATP content (% of untreated) was measured and demonstrated that 1 ng/ml TGF -1 and the co -1 and 5 ng/ml PDGF significantly increased relative ATP content, whereas 30 \u00b5M MTX and 10 mM TAA elicited a sig- nificant decrease in relative ATP content (Figure 2 3A). RNA was extracted from day 10 treated HLMTs and fibrosis markers SMA, Col I and Col IV were measured using q -RT-PCR. Gene expression results show that all the trea tment conditions elicited an increase in fibrotic marker expression (Figure 2 3B). Treated day 10 HLMTs were fixed and stained to investigate the quantity/ changes in SMA protein. Immunostaining results show that 1 ng/ml TGF -1, 30 \u00b5M MTX and 10 mM TAA el icited an increase in HSC activation demonstrated by the increase in SMA staining (Figure 2 4). In conclusion, all four cell types were successfully incorporated into the HLMTs and suc- cessfully cultured for up to 28 days without a change in size or viabili ty. Exposure to pro -fibrotic compounds resulted in increased fibrotic marker expression and increased SMA protein. 147 Figure 20. Long -term culture of four cell HLMTs .

The MT with the four cell types could be maintained in culture for up to 28 days. Additionally, pro -fibrotic tr eatments TGF-1, TGF -1 with PDGF, MTX and TAA resulted in increased gene expression of fibrotic markers SMA, Col I and Col IV and increased staining for SMA. HepaRG have been shown to be an excellent surrogate for primary hepatocytes as they display man y characteristics of PHHs and retain metabolic activity 86. Additionally, the co -culture of HepaRG, hTERT -HSC and THP -1 has been demonstrated to be cap able of recapitulating liver fibrosis upon exposure to pro -fibrotic compounds including hepatocellular damage, HSC activa- tion, inflammation and ECM deposition 92. Using this established liver fibrosis, we aimed to in- crease complexity and physiological relevance through the addition of an endothelial cell type. HUVE Cs were successfully co -cultured with HepaRG, hTERT -HSC and THP -1, which using tracker, IHC and q -RT-PCR. Co-culture of the HLMTs was successful for 28 days as demonstrated by the unchanged ATP content and MT size. CD31 expression wa s maintained up to 28 days. CD31 is an endothelial cell marker, yet the THP -1 were also stained positive for CD31 in our HLMTs. Monocytes such as THP -1 have been shown to stain positive for CD31 under angiogenic conditions 382. The me- dium included endothelial growth factors, which could have pro moted the THP -1 to express CD31. Therefore , further investigation needs to be carried out including alterat ions in medium to improve the maintenance of the macrophage phenotype. Although the THP -1 and HUVECs stained posi- tive for CD31 , we can infer based on the CellTracker localisation that the CD31 positive cells in the centre of the HLMT are HUVECs and those further to the exterior are the THP -1. This was confirmed by staining the MTs with vWF, a marker of endothelial cells 383, which stained strongly in the centre of the HLMTs. MTX and TAA are two substances that have been shown to elicit toxicity and liver fibrosis in vitro 92,98. TGF -1 and PDGF are cellular factors involved in HSC activation and migration 263. Additionally, TGF -1 express ion is a key event in the liver fibrosis AOP 263. These four compounds were used to assess whether the HLMTs would respond to pro -fibrotic stimuli . We demonstrate that exposure of the HLMTs to TGF-1 and PDGF we resulted in increased expression of fibro tic markers Col I and Col IV. TGF-1 also elicited increased HSC activation shown using im- munostaining and gene expression. MTX and TAA elicited a toxicity in the HLMTs as expected based on previous findings 92. HSC activation is a key event of the liver fibrosis AOP 263, which our HLMTs recapitulated as demonst rated by increased SMA expression and staining. This sug- gests that the addition of the fourth cell type (HUVECs) did not affect the susceptibility of HSCs towards exposure to pro -fibrotic treatments. The activated HSC led to increased Col I and Col IV 153 expression, suggesting increased ECM production , a key event in fibrosis progression 263. Further experiments are required to confirm ECM deposition on a protein -level and other key events in- cluding hepatocellular damage and p ro-inflammatory response through KC activation 263. Although HUVECs phenotypically differ from LSECs, they are endothelial expressing VCAM -1 and ICAM -1 384. These proteins are involved in antigen presentation, thereby playing an important role in inflammation and immune responses in the liver 19. Additionally, capil- larisation is involved in the progression of liver fibrosis and it has been shown that HUVECs hav e the potential to form capillaries 385. Therefore, HUVECs do possess relevant endothelial charac- teristics that could be useful when investigating liver fibrosis in vitro . Additional experiments are required to assess whether the H UVECs are capable of recapit- ulating LSEC -specific changes during progression. Further involve as- sessing the capillarisation capacity of HUVECs upon exposure to pro -fibrotic compounds, as this is an important step during liver d amage 19. Finally, it would also be of interest to optimise a 3D in vitro model using PHHs, HSCs, KCs and LSECs and to compare the cell line based model to the primary model to identify benefits and limitations of each model. 6.6 Conclusion We successfully produced HLMTs comprising HepaRG, THP -1, hTERT -HSC and HUVECS, which were able to be cultured for 28 days with no effect in viability and composition. We also demonstrat e that the cells self -aggregate and localise into specific positions, which were main- tained overtime. We also demonstrate that the HLMTs recapitulate the final sequenc e of events leading to fibrosis, including HSC activation and increased collagen expressi on. In conclusion, we suggest that, after additional optimisation, our HLMTs are a suitable in vitro model for investigating liver fibrosis. 154 Scientific impact, limitations and future perspectives The research hypothesis on which th is work was based was that multicellular, 3D, human in vitro models could recapitulate clinically relevant cellular processes leading to fibrosis. Thus, a model based on three hepatic cell lines was employed to mimic events leading to liver fibrosis, to evaluate responses to a variety of chemicals and to identify miRNAs that could serve as transla- tional biomarkers of liver fibrosis. The results presented in this thesis confirm that the 3D model is able to recapitulate physiologically r elevant , compound -specific effects related with liver fibrosis and that released miRNAs are promising biomarkers in vitro and potentially in vivo . The presented model represents thus a contribution towards the replacement of animal models and the advance- ment of the 3Rs . We could establish that the 3D -HepaRG cell line (a surrogate for primary hepatocytes) differ- entially release d miRNAs into the cell when exposed to MTX and APAP. Fur- ther the release of miRNA -122 from HepaRG -cells undergoing toxic insult confirmed the suitability of extracellular miRNAs, in particular released via exosomes, as early biomarkers in this in vitro system . Experiments using a multicellular model and NGS to identify novel miRNAs as putative specific biomarkers of fibrosis resulted in a of extracellular miRNAs (miR -5p, miR -214-3p, miR -99b-5p and miR -125a -5p). Mechanistic investigations showed that three of these miRNAs were associated with stellate cell activation, providing phenot ypic anchoring to these putative biomarkers. In addition, comparable results were also obtained using 3D cell cultures generated with primary human hepatic cells exposed to profibrotic stimuli. Regarding the transferability of the results to the clinical situation, the miRNAs identified using the MTs still require confirmation for use as biomarkers by assessing miRNAs in human se- rum/plasma and tissue samples. The obtained data however demonstrate that the cell-based models are capable of recapitulating clinically prov en APAP -induced miR -122 release. We can thus infer that there is a potential for in vitro -in vivo translation of the results, but future investiga- tions should be performed to substant iate that claim. Furthermore, t hree of the four investigated miRNAs led to d ecrease d expression of known target proteins and to HSC activation. These find- ings also support the potential of these selected extracellular miRNAs as relevant fibrosis bi- omarkers . Additional research is required to identify which cell types are releasing each specific miRNAs and how potential intercellular interactions take place. Applying in situ hybridisation for miRNA -detection on fibrotic tissue and immunostaining for detectio n of suspected protein targets , we may be able to enhance our understand ing of the role of the miRNAs and their targets in fibrosis progression. The results presented here with different chemicals make evident that the MTs display great versatility and broad applicability as an in vitro tool for assessing adverse outcomes. The 155 system was able to reproduce the toxic effects of compounds causing different types of DILI (MTX and APAP elicit ing fibrosis and acute hepatotoxicity, respectively ); of bile sa lts causing decreased CYP7A1 and cholestatic injury; of dioxins and dioxin -like compounds stimulating AhR signalling. These physiologically relevant results provide us with further confirmation that the MTs are a suitable in vitro tool, which could contrib ute towards the replacement of animal models and ad- vance the 3Rs. Despite the demonstrated good performance, the MT model could be optimised further in terms of physiological likeness by including endothelial cells, as the LSECs play an important role in the liver. To this end, we introduced HUVECs into the multicellular model to enhance its rele- vance and more faithfully recapitulate liver physiology. The generated four-cell model was also able to develop a fibrotic phenotype upon exposure to pro -fibrotic stimuli including TGF -1, MTX and TAA. These are promising results , but due to the unique nature of LSECs (fenestrae a nd lack of basement membrane) a more appropriate endothelial cell line should be considered for future developments and investigation of specific endothelial cell responses such as c apillarisation . In summary, in this thesis we clearly demonstrated the versatility and potential of a mult i- cellular, 3D, in vitro model based on human cell lines for the investigation of hepatic fibrosis and the identification of novel biomarkers. The presented results contribute to the understanding of cellular events in the progression of liver fibrosis, to the discovery of potential non -invasive b i- omarkers and to the 3Rs, as the model represents a sound altern ative to animal studies . 156 Acknowledgements I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude for the support that a large number of people have provided me throughout my PhD studies.
