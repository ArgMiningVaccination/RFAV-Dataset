Thanks, Crystal The Midwife- \"I have worked as a midwife for 15 years and am now offering services privately for families interested in my model of midwifery care. If you are preferring to stay out of the hospital, except for complications, then midwifery care and homebirth may be a good option for you. \" Crystal Bailey CNM, APRN, ND Certified Nurse Midwife Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Doctor of Naturopathy Homebirth is Safe. Did you know that homebirth is safe, and can be safer, than a hospital birth in the US? With a supportive midwifery model, you will be less likely to have medical interventions and a cesarean. Safety is also dependent upon the skill of the midwife and the health of the mother. Staying within the proven standards for out-of-hospital birthing keeps mothers and babies safe. Women's Health Well woman exams, paps, hormone health, fertility, family planning, gyn problems Newborn Newborn care, night nursing care & sleep consults, colic care & allergy testing, breastfeeding assistance Philosophy I have a deep respect for the ability of women to birth babies, and for babies to be honored in their gestation and birth. I will push you to be informed and to be strong, because you can do natural birth like women around the world do every day. The midwife should be a quiet presence that helps create a conducive environment for this physiologic, primal thing of birth. However the midwife should have a confident authority at birth to facilitate things when they need guidance or intervention. I named my practice \"Moonlight Midwifery\" because babies come at night, when the world is calm, our stress is low, and babies get to come in peace. We are very intelligently designed and I like to first and foremost, honor this design, and use my training to interact with it in a safe and appropriate way to keep a woman and her baby safe. How does working with Crystal differ from other practices? As a solo practitioner, Crystal can offer personalized and attentive care to a small number of clients. Crystal has: You'll experience: Conclusion: Hiring a homebirth CNM midwife will look very different than if you went to a group CNM/OB practice that funnels you through a system that takes care of a lot of women and has to bill insurance. Protocols After working at and starting birth centers, I've got a very good grasp of acceptable protocols. Data supports midwifery care and out of hospital birth. Therefore, this is how I practice. Midwifery care is supportive of the normal process of pregnancy and birth. Having safe parameters is also important, because no birth experience is more important than the life of the mother and baby. I deeply respect that pregnancy and birth may not proceed normally and I've worked with a lot of high risk cases during my career as a midwife working in rural OB practices and with Doctors without Borders in Africa. A midwife should always be thinking ahead and ready with a management plan. Homebirth is Financially Feasible Everyone's financial situation is different. Having your own midwife has many benefits, and the quality of care per dollar spent may be the best investment you can make in ensuring a mother and baby are cared for well. I'll explain costs and how I can help you use insurance benefit by sharing my financial policies here. There's no better time than now to know your options Georgia has the highest maternal mortality rate in the US, and the US is far behind most other developed nations in obstetric care outcomes. It's time to question whether standard US obstetric care is right for you. Personal care by an experienced Certified Nurse Midwife will keep you and your baby safe. "}
