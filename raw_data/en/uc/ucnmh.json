I help empaths & seekers heal, know their purpose, and share their medicine with the world. My [Mentorship](https://www.mindbodyfree.com/mentorship/) and [Integrative Healing Coach Training](https://www.mindbodyfree.com/ihct/) programs are community-based, 6-month transformative journeys to heal your mind, body and spirit, remember who you truly are, and share your medicine with the world. Being trained in Shamanic Chinese Medicine, Medical Qigong Therapy, Yoga, Hypnotherapy, and Neuro-Linguistic Programming, my journeys have led her to learn from Shipibo Shamans in Peru, Yogis in India, and Daoist Masters in the US and Canada. Growing up in Canada and now calling Calgary, AB home, nature has always been my solace. It was nature who called me back to myself many years ago through plant medicines. My experiences with Shamans, healers and the Amazon jungle guided me to to becoming the healer I am today. My desire for freedom drove me to seek deeper answers, and in my search, I found a roadmap back to my true self. I believe that within each of us is an original medicine; a set of gifts that only you can share with the world. I know how deeply fulfilling it is to answer your calling, and that all it takes is the will and some guidance to find your way. My medicine is being this guide to others. My healing journey started when my heart broke open in 2012. I had fallen down a rabbit hole of documentaries on animal agriculture, environmental crisis, and inequality. I had always known of injustice in the world, cared for animals, and felt concern for the environment, but I hadn't looked deeply into the shadows and let myself really feel it in my heart until then. And the moment I did, my heart cracked open and broke into a million pieces. I became disillusioned with life. I felt helpless to fix all the world's big, heavy problems. I was devastated by what seemed an insurmountable darkness, and I almost let it beat me. I didn't know how to escape the depression that weighed down on me. I was at war with everyone around me; I was at war with myself. I was spinning my wheels looking for ways to somehow make all the pain in the world stop. I was depressed, angry, and I felt like I didn't belong. I couldn't control what the world did. But I what could do, and what I desperately needed to do, was to find a way to help myself. I was seeking. And what you seek, you eventually find. I heard an interview on the radio of a man sharing his Ayahuasca experience and meeting his inner child. He told of how he held and loved this child and told it everything would be ok. He spoke of how he let go of a deep wound he'd been carrying, and how his life changed. As I heard this, every cell in my body lit up and I immediately had to find out what Ayahuasca was. I found a [National Geographic article](http://www.kirasalak.com/Peru.html) of a woman sharing how Ayahuasca guided her through facing and letting go of the depression she'd been carrying her whole life. I did some more digging and found artists sharing their journeys of awakening to another world within themselves and in nature. And my decision was made. A couple of weeks later I was on a plane to Peru. I went to the Amazon jungle to experience plant medicines and be guided by Shipibo shamans. And while it's certainly not for everyone, from the moment I heard the radio interview I knew this was for me. My experience was more profound than I ever could have imagined. I was able to release such a depth of pain from my mind, body and spirit that had clouded my connection with life. I woke up to the light inside of me and the whole universe. I had taken my blinders off, and my life would never be the same again. (You can read more about my Ayahuasca journey on my blog in [Part 1](https://www.mindbodyfree.com/journey-home-part-1/) and [Part 2](https://www.mindbodyfree.com/journeyhome2/).) I came home lit up, and entirely unprepared for how to integrate my experience into life outside the jungle. It was a tumultuous couple of years that followed. I was trying to fit my transformed self back into my old life, and it wasn't working. I didn't know how to maintain the connection I'd experienced in the jungle. No one around me could relate to my experience, and I felt alone in a world that didn't understand me or the magic I'd discovered. I was looking for answers; for ways to make my life work outside of the jungle. Hungry for a sense of freedom, I felt called to attend 10 days of silent meditation at a [ Vipassana Meditation Centre](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index), where I learned how to observe the patterns of my mind and experience my body as energy. I became an observer of my thoughts; realizing that I didn't need to believe each one as it appeared and could simply see them as passing stories. I learned how to sense the subtler parts of my inner world and go deeper into feeling and experiencing my subconscious mind and body. I learned what buddhists call 'anicca', or impermanence. A practice of acknowledging that nature is dynamic and ever changing, and we create suffering for ourselves when we try to attach to the impermanent nature of our lives and reality. Is something painful? Anicca. Is something blissful? Anicca. Understanding this is a medicine for the mind. No matter how difficult something may seem, this too shall pass. Soon after Vipassana, I went back to volunteer as a facilitator and photographer at the [Ayahuasca Healing Centre](https://www.nimeakaya.org/) in Peru. For two months, I was immersed in a community of healers from around the world, each offering a unique set of skills and talents. The Shipibo shamans have worked with plant medicines for thousands of years, and it was amazing to witness them leading guests through Ayahuasca ceremonies. I was privileged to support as a facilitator; helping attendees to integrate their experiences. It was inspiring to see each guest's transformation and it ignited a passion in me to not only heal myself but to help others heal too. After Peru, I completed a [Yoga Teachers training](https://worldpeaceyogaschool.com/) in India. Nestled among the Himalayan Mountains and Ganges River, I learned a scientific, spiritual, and practical approach to wellness. The blend of yoga philosophy, breathwork, meditation, and exercises took things I had seen as esoteric and made them grounded, straightforward, and approachable for anyone ready to do the work. Through being fully immersed in yoga for a month I could feel the noticeable difference in my mind and body. I felt light, present, calm, and balanced. It didn't take away life's challenges, but it lifted their weight and created a more joyful way to move through them. When I came home, I went on to train in [Medical Qigong Therapy and Shamanic Chinese Medicine](https://www.emptymountain.com/). This system works with thoughts, emotions and the physical body as a fully interconnected system, which at its core, is energy. As a shaman and Medical Qigong Therapist, I help people heal the spiritual cause of an issue. Trauma is stored in the body, the nervous system, and in the energy that makes up your mind, body and spirit. This work enables us to release the root of an issue from your mind, body and spirit in a profoundly healing way. The results from this kind of work look like magic, and in many ways they are. They're also a kind of science, one that's gradually becoming more understood through the study of quantum physics, consciousness and energy. I went on to also train in [Rapid Transformational Therapy](https://rtt.com/), which combines the most beneficial principles of Hypnotherapy, Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Psychotherapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to quickly get to the heart of subconscious issues that are causing physical or emotional distress and heal them permanently. It's profound, gentle, and life changing. Throughout my years of training and practicing, I've found powerful tools for healing. And while these tools are the framework for transformation, doing my own inner work along the way has given me the wisdom, presence and compassion to more fully and completely understand, hold space, and my clients through a journey of transformation. Changing the world begins with each of us. Because when you feel fully in your authentic self; when you know you're lovable, worthy, and good enough, you naturally become the light the world needs. Healing yourself is the most powerful work you can do and may be the biggest gift you can give to the world. *We will never sell, rent or share personal information. "}
