I look forward to meeting you. I am so honored to work with you on your healing path and to serve you, however, I can. I am a Naturopathic Doctor, Acupuncturist, Breathwork Facilitator, and Mama of two little ones. I am a lover of the ocean, the trees, neon green moss after the rain, the medicine in plants, flowers, and food, people, giggles, sunshine, and barefeet. I value an integrative approach to health, through preventative medicine, functional medicine, mindfulness, magic and individualized treatment. I encourage you to take an active role in your health and honor your body's innate ability to heal. Healing in all its forms ignites me. It is alchemy. I am honored to bear witness to it daily, in myself and in all the amazing humans I have met on this journey. PRACTICE: I am a Board Certified Naturopathic Doctor in California, Hawaii and British Columbia and a Nationally Licensed Acupuncturist. I am currently offering patient visits through telemedicine for those near and far and in person on Maui and in California. I am also a Breathwork Facilitator, Public Speaker and Retreat Leader. I offer wellness talks, breathwork events and retreats for companies and programs around the globe. My Clinical background includes extensive training in Women's Health, Family Medicine, Thyroid Balance and Digestive Health. I have also spent time doing some Clinical work abroad in countries such as Bolivia where I trained in pediatric clinics and hospitals, and Kenya where I worked with patients and physicians in rural natural health and homeopathic clinics. I founded and was Medical Director at Thyme Integrative Health, an Integrative Health Clinic in Northern California for over a decade where I brought together many amazing Integrative Practitioners- (Psychologists, Integrative MDs, Midwives, Physical Therapists, Naturopathic Doctors and Acupuncturists). I have mentored several other Naturopathic Doctors, and Acupuncturists over the years and LOVE to teach and collaborate. And always, I consider myself a student, and am forever curious and passionate about expanding my learning, knowledge and experience in the layers and complexities of healing and wellness. I believe that how we choose to nourish and move our bodies is integral to overall health. I believe strongly in the power of food as medicine, the potency of plants, living in right exchange with the land and the waters and the importance of mindfulness and breath in health. I am passionate about Women's Health and focus on gently guiding people to live as healthily and happily as their potential. My focus is on optimizing endocrine health (hormonal balance, thyroid health, fertility, menopause, PCOS, graceful aging, adrenal health and healthy menstrual cycles and rhythms), though I emphasize working with the whole complex and unique person. I love working with women around fertility, throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period with both Acupuncture and Naturopathic Medicine. I also enjoy working with kids, and have two spunky little kids of my own. I am a Fellow of the American Board of Oriental Reproductive Medicine (ABORM) a group of internationally recognized Acupuncturists, and other Integrative Doctors in the field. Another area of focus is Thyroid Health, including Hashimoto's, Inflammatory Thyroiditis and Hypothyroid and Hyperthyroid imbalances. I am a certified WTS Doctor (AARM) and will work with you to optimize body temperature and thyroid function through nutrition, herbal medicine, acupuncture and various forms of thyroid hormone medication as needed. As well, I work with a wide array of Digestive troubles, Autoimmune processes, Food and Environmental Sensitivities, Sleep health, Cardiovascular and Metabolic disease, and Emotional balance to optimize the health of the body, mind, spirit. Really I work with YOU as a complex, fascinating and whole person. I hold strong value in bringing health, wellness and mindfulness into the workplace. I have led numerous in person and online Breathwork and Meditation sessions for several Companies, Institutions and Private Retreats around the world including Robinhood, Maze Therapeutics, The Bay School San Francisco and many others.
