Prior to changes to the Veterinary Feed Directive in 2017, antibiotics were commonly given to cattle prophylactically, often in feed, to minimize the incidence of BRDC.

Influenza D virus, bovine rhinitis A and B viruses, BRSV, and bovine coronavirus detection were significantly associated with disease. Likewise, metagenomic sequencing of diseased and healthy feedlot cattle in the U.S. and Mexico found a significant association between IDV RNA levels and clinical disease (Mitra et al., 2011). A common finding of the three geographically limited metagenomic surveys was a dearth of detection of viruses commonly associated with BRDC and included in BRDC vaccines, with only BRSV being associated with BRDC in the Western Canadian feedlot study. Influenza D virus was associated with BRDC in all three publications, as was bovine rhinitis A virus in two of the three papers. These results suggest that several viruses not typically considered as etiological causes of BRDC likely play a significant role in disease.Similar to cattle, porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) is a multifactorial disease which manifests at the intersection of host, environment, and pathogen (Opriessnig et al., 2011). While the three primary viral pathogens associated with PRDC are IAV, PRRSV, and PCV2, metagenomic sequencing of respiratory disease samples negative for typical PRDC viruses have identified potentially emerging respiratory viruses such as porcine parainfluenza virus (Park et al., 2019), porcine circovirus 3 (Palinski et al, 2016), and porcine astrovirus 4 (Padmanabhan and Hause, 2016). A recent metagenomic survey of the viromes of PRDC-affected pigs in China identified 17 viruses (Qin et al., 2018).

Animal Health Component 100% Research Effort Categories Basic 33% Applied 34% Developmental 33% Goals / Objectives Respiratory disease is a major cause of loss for both the swine and cattle industries. In swine, major respiratory viral pathogens include porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2). These primary pathogens initiate damage which often leads to secondary infections by opportunistic and commensal bacteria such as Streptococcus suis and Glasserella parasuis, leading to pneumonia with multiple etiologies termed porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) (Opriessnig et al., 2011). Likewise, bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a multifactorial disease thought to involve interactions between host, pathogens, and the environment (Mosier, 2014). Central to our understanding of the pathogenesis of BRDC is a primary viral insult often initiated by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3), or bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), followed by secondary somni, Mannheimia haemolytica. or Pasteurella multocida.A are available to prevent BRDC. These multivalent vaccines commonly contain attenuated live BRSV, BVDV, BHV1, and BPIV3, in addition to live or attenuated forms of M. haemolytica and P. multocida. Despite their widespread use for decades, the incidence of BRDC has continued to increase (Hilton, 2014; Gorden and Plummer, 2010). Likewise, a majority of swine are vaccinated for PCV2, PRRSV, and IAV, yet respiratory disease is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.Advances in diagnostic technologies have revolutionized our ability to detect and characterize pathogens. One objective of our proposal is to characterize the virome in swine and cattle respiratory specimens submitted for diagnostic testing. Identification and characterization of novel and emerging viruses that are part of swine and bovine respiratory disease complexes is the necessary first step for this proposal's broad, long term goal of disease prevention and control. Our team has significant expertise in this area, with notable discoveries including influenza D virus (Hause et al., 2011), porcine circovirus 3 (Palinski et and atypical porcine pestivirus (Hause et al., 2015).The overarching objective of the project is to develop novel vaccines targeting emerging viruses associated with bovine and porcine respiratory disease complex (BRDC and PRDC, respectively). This will be accomplished by five objectives.Objective 1: Characterize the virome present in nasal swab samples collected from swine and cattle with respiratory disease via metagenomic sequencing Objective 2: Identify infectious viruses and establish disease etiology using Immunocapture sequencingObjective 3: Propagate novel and emerging viruses in cell culture using traditional cell culture based approaches or reverse genetics-launched virusesObjective 4: Characterize virus pathogenesis in the host animal and establish the challenge modelObjective 5: Develop vaccines and demonstrate efficacy in the natural hostAt the completion of this project we expect to have identified a number of emerging viruses for which we have established their clinical significance and etiological role in bovine and porcine respiratory disease. These viruses, propagated in vitro or used to develop reverse genetics systems which can be used to infect animals directly, will be the basis for pathogenesis and vaccination studies. Our ultimate goal is to reduce the burden of respiratory disease in swine and cattle. This will improve animal health and the sustainability of livestock production. Project Methods Objective 1: Characterize the virome present in nasal swab samples collected from swine and cattle with respiratory disease via metagenomic sequencing The South Dakota State University Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ADRDL) performs >20,000 PCR tests for PRDC and BRDC pathogens annually. Samples primarily originate from the upper Midwest which includes top states for cattle and swine production. A total of 100 nasal swab pools (five swabs per pool) will be analyzed for both PRDC and BRDC submissions. Nasal swab pools will be assembled from diagnostic cases containing at least five nasal swabs submitted in Mycoplasma/Virus Transport Media from animals with reported clinical respiratory disease. The 100 cases each for PRDC and BRDC swab pools will be selected to ensure maximal seasonal and geographical representation, as well as from different animal age classes and ownership.Pooled nasal swabs will be analyzed by metagenomic sequencing as previously described (Hause et al., 2016). A combination of de novo and reference-based assemblies, along with targeted amplification and resequencing, will be utilized to complete assembly of identified virus genomes when possible, which will subsequently be deposited with Genbank. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis will be performed on the assembled genomes to assess genetic variability. The output from this objective will be a foundational start to understanding the genetic diversity of the virome in PRDC and BRDC.Objective 2: Identify infectious viruses and establish disease etiology using Immunocapture sequencing One challenge with metagenomic sequencing is distinguishing pathogenic from environmental viruses. The nasal swab virome consists of viruses derived from both the host as well as environment, complicating conclusions on metagenomic sequencing results with disease etiology.Following metagenomic sequencing of pooled nasal swabs in Objective 1, pools with novel or emerging viruses will be identified within four weeks of original sample submission. The submitting veterinarian will subsequently be contacted and asked to provide several serum samples from animals in that herd. The serum samples will be pooled and used to immunoprecipitate viruses present in the original nasal swab pool using commercially available protein A/G coupled to magnetic beads. Immunoprecipitated viruses will subsequently be analyzed by metagenomic sequencing to identify viruses which animals in the herd have seroconverted. While not direct proof of causation, the presence of an adaptive immune response to particular viruses will aid in interpretation of the significance of identified viruses.Objective 3: Propagate novel and emerging viruses in cell culture using traditional cell culture based approaches or reverse genetics-launched viruses Virus isolation is a critical prerequisite for virus characterization. With advances in molecular biology, virus isolation is often neglected or overlooked. Isolated virus is needed to fully characterize novel viruses, especially for pathogenesis studies. Additionally, vaccine licensure requires proof of efficacy which nearly always requires vaccination and challenge models in the host animal.Given the critical need for virus which can be propagated in the laboratory, virus isolation will be attempted on a combination of swine and bovine primary cells and immortalized cell lines. Samples positive for atypical viruses will be inoculated on a panel of cells including primary porcine and bovine respiratory epithelial (Sreenivasan et al., 2019) and kidney cells (Takenouchi et al., 2014), as well as alveolar macrophages (Yoon et al., 1992). Swine samples will additionally be inoculated onto immortalized cell lines ST, Vero, and PK15. Bovine samples will be inoculated onto immortalized cell lines MDBK, BT, and HRT18-G. Cells will be monitored for cytopathic effects daily. Additionally, pooled convalescent antisera from the farm where the sample originated will be used to screen for virus isolation by immunofluorescence assay.Reverse genetics will also be employed where suitable systems exist for similar viruses. For example, one likely candidate for further study is bovine rhinitis virus (BRV), which has been associated with BRDC (Ng et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019; Hause et al., 2015). BRV is a member of the genus Aphthovirus which notably includes foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). A FMDV reverse genetic system was initially developed 30 years ago and has been significantly improved (Zibert et al., 1990). Given the high similarity between FMDV and BRV genomes, a reverse genetic approach for BRV seems attainable and represents an alternate path to generate infectious virus for follow up studies should cell culture isolation fail.Objective 4: Characterize virus pathogenesis in the host animal and establish the challenge model Fulfillment of Koch's postulates is a critical step in establishing the significance of novel viruses, as virus detection does not equate to causation. In this objective we will performed controlled host animal infection studies. Na\u00efve, seronegative high health animals will be inoculated with cell culture or reverse genetics-derived virus and virus pathogenesis will be studied by the collection of clinical samples (nasal and fecal swabs, serum, tissue, etc.) at various time points post inoculation. Signs of clinical disease will be recorded. The immune response to the viral inoculum will be monitored over time. Virus isolation and titration will be performed on samples collected inoculated animals.Results from this objective will demonstrate the pathogenesis of emerging viruses and assign them a causative role for respiratory disease. The host animal challenge model developed here will additionally serve as the basis for vaccine development efforts detailed in the following objective.Objective 5: Develop vaccines and demonstrate efficacy in the natural host Our ultimate goal is to improve livestock health and vaccines remain the most effective disease preventative measure. In this objective we will develop vaccines to prevent disease caused by infection with emerging viruses. While the vaccine design will be dictated in part based on the specific biology of the emerging virus, possible vaccines include whole inactivated virus, attenuated live virus and vectored subunit vaccines. Host animal vaccination studies will be carried out to measure the immunogenicity of the vaccine, and protection will be assessed by controlled inoculation of emerging virus followed by monitoring of clinical disease. Prototype vaccines affording significant protection will be considered candidates for further development with an industrial partner. Our long term objective is licensure of these vaccines and mitigation of disease. "}
