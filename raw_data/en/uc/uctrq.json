Brand Name and Manufacturer JYNNEOS /Imvamune/Imvanex (Smallpox /Monkeypox (vial) Indication(s) and Intended Population(s) Indicated for prevention of smallpox or monkeypox disease for these populations if patient is determined to be at high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection: 18 years and older: o FDA-approved as a two -dose series administered subcutaneously o EUA for intradermal administration Under 18 years : Authorized under EUA as a t wo-dose series administered subcutaneously (see press release ). Dosing Regimen or Schedule 2-dose vaccine series (full protection is anticipated 2 weeks following 2nd dose) Minimum Intervals 28 days apart; doses administered up to 4 days early are considered valid Warning and Precautions Severe Allergic Reactions: Appropriate medical treatment must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of JYNNEOS. Altered Immunocompetence: Immunocompromised persons, including those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may have a diminished immune response to JYNNEOS. Screening & Consent For adults: No consent form require d; optional screening form available here . Post -Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) The sooner an exposed person gets the vaccine, the better. CDC recommends that vaccine be given within 4 days from date of exposure to prevent onset of disease. If given between 4-14 days after date of exposure, vaccination may reduce symptoms of disease, but may not prevent the disease. Efficacy Efficacy of JYNNEOS to prevent monkeypox is inferred from seroconversion and immunogenicity that is noninferior as compared with replicating orthopoxvirus vaccines. Administration Subcutaneous (SC): Administer 0.5 mL; allow vaccine to thaw and reach room temperature before use (see package insert ). Alternative intradermal (ID): Administer 0.1 mL (one -fifth of standard subcutaneous dose), preferably to inner side of t he forearm, per EUA. Adverse Reactions Injection site reactions .
