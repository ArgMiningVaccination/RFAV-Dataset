I specialise in combining physical, mental and spiritual health to address the root cause of your illness. Next Retreat 2nd-7th March 2024 A shout out to you all. To let you know that time is running out, to take advantage of early bird prices. If you're on the fence at the moment, click the link below and book in for a call. Early bird pricing ends on August 30. To take advantage of this, get in soon. The prices are in Australian dollars, which is great news for those of you in the US (your dollar is worth nearly double). Join me in March 2024 in the Cook Islands for my healing, health and well-being retreat. This is an amazing place where culture and white sandy beaches meet adventure and healing. For those of you, who have never heard of the Cook Islands, it is a little piece of paradise in the South Pacific. This is the perfect opportunity for healers, coaches and health and well-being professionals to network, up-level, heal and grow, taking your life to the next level! A typical day at the retreat involves locally made organic food, yoga, meditation, sound healing, Polynesian dance lessons, subconscious belief healing, education, exclusive teachings that I haven't yet released, adventure activities (such as hiking, snorkelling, stand up paddle boarding). Every person that attends the retreat will receive a 1:1 naturopathic consultation and 1:1 healing. A true highlight is Polynesian dance, where you learn to really tune into your body through movement and understand the intricacies of the cycles that our bodies need to function at their best. If you book before August 30, you will receive 10% the retreat price and if you book with a friend, you both receive 20% off. There are limited spots left. So, if paradise is calling you for a true up-level in your life, well-being, healing journey and business and you love having fun while relaxing, this is for you. If you're craving a holiday with like-minded people, this is for you. If you're after the perfect balance of rest, relaxation and activities, this is for you. If you enjoy organic fresh foods, this is for you. And yes, the picture below has no filter! It really is that amazing!
