His basic research focused on neurophysiological studies of the vestibular system (the inner ear sense of balance) , and his clinical practice focused on patients with vestibular disorders and involv ed the medical and surgical components of otology and neurotology. Minor built an active, NIH- supported research program, and his first R01 grant is still funded today (2020) with a colleague who is now principal investigator. His basic research also had s ignificant clinical impact when, in 1998, he described a previously unrecognized inner ear disorder, which he named superior canal dehiscence syndrome. He developed a surgical procedure to correct the disorder that is now a commonly used therapy , bringing considerable benefit to patients with previously refractory symptoms. In 2012, Minor was elected to the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine). During his tenure as Chair of the Johns Hopkins Department of Otolaryngology from 2003 to 2009, Minor expanded annual research funding by more than half and increased clinical activity by more than 30 percent, while strengthening teaching efforts and student training. He also initiated a comprehensive diversity program that focused on creating a climate of inclusion and respect by aggressively recruiting qualified underrepresented and women faculty , developing mentorship programs for diverse faculty , and increasing the pipeline of qualified candidates. From 2003 to 2009, the number of female clinical faculty increased from 5.8 percent to 33.3 percent , and the number of female research faculty increased from 11.1 percent to 21.4 percent. As Provost and Chief Academic Officer (2009-2012), Minor launched many university- wide programs , such as the Gateway Sciences Initiative to support pedagogical innovation and award grants for improving student learning in introductory science courses. Committed to building on Johns Hopkins' historical legacy, he established the Doctor of Philosophy Board, a unive rsity- wide board that approves candidates for the PhD Lloyd Minor PAGE 2 degree. Minor also worked with others around the university and health system to coordinate the Individualized Health Initiative, which uses genetic information to transform health care. During his tenure as Provost, Minor made the undergraduate experience an institutional priority by shifting the reporting structure and recruiting a new Vice Provost for Student Affairs and a new Vice Provost for Admissions and Financial Aid. Other initiatives strengthened student advising, enhanced campus community, and promoted civic engagement, resulting in increased selectivity (27 percent in 2009 to 18 percent in 2011) and yield (31 percent in 2009 to 36 percent in 2011). The number of underrepresented minorities in the incoming freshman class rose to a record 18 percent in 2011, up from 12.9 percent in 2009. Stanford University Carl and Elizabeth Naumann Dean of the School of Medicine, since 2012 As chief executive and the academic, clinical, and business leader of the Stanford School of Medicine, Minor has overseen significant growth during his tenure. The annual budget increased from $1.6 billion in 2013 to a projected $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2021, and the number of faculty increased from 1,851 to 2,802; students from 1,240 to 1,661; residents and clinical fellows from 937 to 1,356; and postdoctoral fellows from 1,147 to 1,428. Minor oversees the selection and quality of all physicians within Stanford Medicine, an academic medical center with a projected $10.7 billion operating budget in fiscal year 2021 (up from $5.5 billion in 2013) that includes the school, Stanford Health Care, and Stanford Children's Health, and he also plays an integral role in setting strategy for the clinical enterprise. In this capacity, Minor has enhanced faculty accountability for quality, safety, and value, leading to significant improvements in the institution's performance on key quality metrics. He also led the development and implementation of an innovative cancer research and care delivery model, which helped Stanford achieve \"Comprehensive\" status by the National Cancer Institute. And with the WellMD Center, Minor has positioned Stanford Medicine as an internationally recognized leader in physician wellness. In philanthropy, Minor led the Campaign for Stanford Medicine, which raised $1.7 billion from 30,000 individuals, corporations, and foundations for a variety of programs, including support for biomedical innovation initiatives and the building of the new Stanford Hospital. Since the conclusion of the campaign in 2016, he has overseen continued growth in annual fundraising. In 2020, Stanford Medicine raised $485 million in philanthropic support (up from $244 million in 2012) from entrepreneurs and leaders in diverse industries and $430 million in new commitments. He played a central role in cultivating and negotiating Stanford's founding membership in two revolutionary partnerships: the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. A trusted partner in Silicon Valley, Minor has enhanced Stanford Medicine's relationship with industry partners such as Google and Apple. In research, Minor has promoted core support and infrastructure that has helped Stanford Medicine's NIH portfolio grow despite a stagnant NIH budget, from $295 million in 2012 to $471 million in 2019. Overall, the school's total NIH funding ranking has moved up from #10 in 2012 to #5 in 2019, according to data reported in 2020. And total sponsored research awards to Stanford Medicine have increased 93 percent during this same period, from $443 million to $853 million. In 2015, Minor articulated an industry-leading strategic vision for Stanford Medicine, earning buy-in at all levels of the organization as well as national recognition of Precision Health as an innovative approach to predicting, preventing, and curing disease. An expert in governance and managing culture change, Minor has Lloyd Minor PAGE 3 substantially enhanced organizational alignment and integration across Stanford Medicine. He initiated and led integrated strategic planning and is now leading institution-wide implementation. Committed to fundamental discovery, Minor has enhanced support for the basic sciences and established an innovative faculty seed grant funding program for high-risk, high-reward projects. He has empowered PhD trainees by fully funding the first four years of their training, making Stanford Medicine a national model among PhD programs and leading to an increase in selectivity (11.3 percent in 2012 to 7.2 percent in 2019) as well as yield (51.6 percent in 2012 to 68.2 percent in 2019). One of Minor's most significant accomplishments has been the recruitment and retention of outstanding faculty and leaders. He has appointed nine clinical chairs (five women and four men), served as co-chair for the search that selected David Entwistle as President and CEO of Stanford Health Care and for the search that selected Paul King as President and CEO of Stanford Children's Health. To enhance opportunities for leadership, Minor launched the Stanford Medicine Leadership Academy with a particular focus on women and underrepresented minorities. Passionate about diversity and inclusion, Minor has significantly increased the number of underrepresented students and trainees at Stanford Medicine through expanded programming, outreach, and scholarships. Between 2012 and 2020, the number of incoming PhD students belonging to underrepresented minority groups has increased from 9.9 percent to 22.3 percent, and the number of incoming underrepresented MD students has increased from 14 percent to 37.8 percent. In 2020, the PhD entering class was 54.5 percent female. To enhance diversity among faculty, Minor has worked with department leaders to increase accountability and transparency. Between 2012 to 2021, the number of female department chairs has increased from 14 percent to 47 percent (well above the national average of 20 percent), the number of women faculty has increased from 40.2 percent to 48.3 percent, and underrepresented faculty has increased from 5.6 percent to 6.6 percent.
