Here at Palmers we are super excited to announce that we now stock an array of crystals that have numerous benefits. There are a number of different types of crystals, each filled with their own healing abilities for the mind, body and soul. They're thought to promote the flow of good energy and help rid the body and mind of negative energy for physical and emotional benefits. Historically speaking, crystals are touted as ancient forms of medicine, with philosophies borrowed from Hinduism and Buddhism. The key to indulging in this self-care experience is mindfulness, reflection and acceptance. Research shows that a person's mind may have much more healing power than it's given credit. Even though there isn't a great deal of scientific support of Crystals, a number of people swear by their powers. We have them scattered all round the place...in our cars, by our beds, on our coffee tables. Come and try the power of crystals for yourself. They make great gifts too! So if you're curious to give them a go, come and try them out and see what each stone can do for you.
