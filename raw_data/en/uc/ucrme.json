It was likely a year filled with so many rough transits. Ready to get a head start for 2021? You'll want to sift through and take a look at my personally curated [limpias and rituals](https://hiplatina.com/limpias-curanderas-new-year/) for [every zodiac sign](https://hiplatina.com/rituals-limpias-for-2020/). You can perform these for your Sun sign, Moon sign, Rising sign or Venus sign. These rituals and limpias will assist you with freeing up lingering negative energy or help you with manifesting more abundance in 2021. We interviewed some other [brujas](https://hiplatina.com/brujas-on-instagram-2/), [curanderas](https://hiplatina.com/how-curanderismo-is-helping-me-cope-with-coronavirus-anxiety/), and spiritualists in the Latinx community to get their take on limpias and they shared some of their techniques with us. We are so excited and grateful to include limpias from Christy, the owner of [Bruja's Botanica](https://www.instagram.com/brujasbotanica/), and Cindy Rodriguez of [Reclama](https://www.instagram.com/recla.ma/). Wondering what a limpia is and why you should incorporate them into your spiritual practice? Limpias are a form of cleansing our mind, body and soul. Particularly they are rituals used to create good auric hygiene and keep your aura uncompromised from the daily hustle. \"I see them as self- care. Its important for your spiritual well-being. If you allow energetic 'junk' to build up, it will eventually take its toll. Limpias are a great way to cleanse, re-new and build a connection to spirit,\" Christy of Bruja's Botanica tells HipLatina. Valeria The Mexican Witch believes, \"They [limpias] are powerful ways to protect yourself and I personally have had success with limpias to heal illnesses (mild-like colds or skin issues). It is an important thing to do to clear energy as soon as it happens. Stay on top of doing them when you have bad experiences or when you can feel someone else's energy projecting onto you.\" Another reason why the pros recommend limpias? \"Giving yourself limpias allows you to take a pause, reflect on what you need out of your life, and rids you of stagnant energy simply based on the intention you put into this ritual. If you aren't sure where to start with limpias, talk to your family. You'd be surprised who can be a resource to you. There's always someone in the family that has the lowdown on limpia recetas. If not, start with herbs and other natural elements that call your attention, Cindy Rodriguez of Reclama. Rodriguez tells HipLatina, \"The point is to make it your own so it speaks to you, put out an offering for someone in the spirit world you feel is looking out for you, and add intention to it as you visualize yourself removing unwanted energies.\" Read on to find the limpia or ritual that goes with your sign and share with your loved one so they can do the same. Aries A quarterly limpieza by Cindy Rodriguez of Reclama Items needed: Water Ruda (Rue) Candle Glass bowl A journal Duration: 1 hour Intention: Intention of this ritual is to rid yourself of stagnant energy surrounding you whether it be self-imposed or mal de ojo (evil eye) energies. This plant is for magical protection. I use this quarterly as spiritual maintenance in January (new year!), April (my birthday, fire sign, so water helps calm me down), Aug/Sept. (Entering a new season, shift in the air), and Dec. (cleanse before I do a limpieza for new beginnings and intentions for the following year). The reason I use Ruda is because my father has always recommended it to me whenever he sees me cargarda or low energy. Ritual Steps: 1. Set aside at least one hour for this ritual (Preferably before you are going to shower or take a bath at night) 2. Bring about a pot of water to boil, then add Ruda, and let it seep for about 30-45 min. 3. While it's seeping, turn on your candle and take out your journal. Write out: \"The intention for this limpieza is to rid myself of... \" 4. Once the water has cooled down a bit, secure it in a container and place in your bathroom. Bring the candle if you can. 5. Take a shower or bath. Once you are done. Pour the limpieza over you from the top of your head down. Close your eyes and visualize your spirit guides and ancestors lifting those mala vibras (bad vibes) off of you and surround you with magical protection. As you pour, say aloud what you wrote in your journal. 6. Stand there for a bit, closing your eyes, and focusing on what you just did. Breathe. Give it space. 7. Now, air dry. Don't rinse off. 8. Set an offering out for anyone in the spirit world protecting you. It can be their favorite drink or dessert, as long as it's done with intention. 9. Repeat as needed. You can do this once a month or quarter. It depends on what you need. Buena suerte. Good luck!

Aquarius Crystal and Flower Grid for energy cleansing and limpia by Valeria The Mexican Witch Items needed: Need a cologne/perfume or a spiritual perfume such as Florida Water, Rose Water or Kolonia. Any type of loose crystals, preferably shiny and spotted crystals in varied sizes. Focus on creative and vibrant energy and colors. Suggestions are clear quartz, sodalite, dalmatian jasper, moonstone, rhodonite, chevron amethyst, selenite, and snowflake obsidian. A crystal grid. A good grid uses 20 stones or more! There is no wrong way to do this and it could work with as few as four crystals. Fresh flowers of your choice. My recommendations are white daisies and/or white roses. Duration: Do whenever you're in your restroom. Leave it up for 3-4 days. Continue to work with it during the day or night when you do your normal routine. Intention: To create an uplifting mood and energy space cleansing. Purpose is to uplift the spirit. Simply being around vibrant colors can benefit an Aquarius. Aquarius is a zodiac sign that can sometimes numb their senses and emotions. Aquarius suns or folks with Aquarian placements are great at manifesting naturally. This ritual is all you need for a quick boost of good energy, according to Valeria Ruelas. Ritual Steps: Conduct in your restroom. Place crystals on crystal grid or form your own crystal grid formation. Arrange the crystals in a way that feels serene and inspiring to you alternating shapes and colors (a spiral shape, ankh, or infinity symbol does wonders). Grab your flowers. Cut them off the stems down to the bud. Spray the flower buds with cologne while saying an intention. Once you do this you can enchant your flowers with affirmations. Then scatter the flower buds amongst the crystals. Stare at the crystals and focus on your intention when you brush your teeth night and day.
