Methods We performed a systematic literature review for studies in which standard titre MCV was given to infants < 6 months of age. We extracted data on the following outcomes: immunogenicity (humoral and cellular), vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE), duration of immunity, blunting and safety. Where appropriate, meta- analyses and meta- regression was performed. We compared results with results from our 2015 review of MCV1 <9 months of age. Quality of all included studies was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Results of the search and selection From an initial se arch carried out in June 2015, 867 references were identified. Following an updated search in April 2017, an additional 186 references were identified. A total of 19 studies from both searches were included in the review. Results of the review of included studies The proportion of infants seroconverting increased from 50% (95% CI 29 -71) at 4 months of age to 67% (51-81%) at 5 months of age . The proportion of infants seroconverting was found to be further depend ent on the vaccine strain used. Seropositivity also increased with age and was strain dependent. GMT s were higher after MCV <6 compared to 6 months of age , but results for MCV<6 months were derived from only two studies . There was l imited evidence on cellular immunity , vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, duration of immunity, blunting and safety to draw conclusions. Conclusions We found humoral i mmunity after MCV1<6 months of age was dependent on age of MCV1 and presence of maternal antibodies. There was limited evidence available for cellular immunity, vaccine effectiveness, duration of immunity, safety and blunting following MC V1<6 months of age . 5 Abbreviations CI Confidence interval GMC Geometric mean concentration GMT Geometric mean titre HI Hemagglutination vaccine pfu Plaque forming unit PRNT Plaque reduction neutralization test PubMed Public MEDLINE RCT Randomized controlled trial RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment ( the Netherlands) TCID Tissue culture infective dose VE Vaccine effectiveness/ efficacy WHO World He alth Organization 6 1 Introduction The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a two dose measles containing vaccine (MCV) schedule, with the first dose of MCV (MCV1) at 9 months of age in countries with ongoing measles transmission , and at 12 months whe n MCV coverage is high and the risk of measles in infancy is low. The recommendations for the age of the second MCV dose ( MCV2 ) are based on programmatic considerations , e.g. the age at which the highest coverage of MCV2 and, hence, the highest population immunity , can be achieved (1). Measles outbreaks now show a bimodal age distribution in many countries, with a high proportion of cases occu rring below the WHO recommended age for MCV1 . In addition, many measles cases are occurring among adolescents and/or young adults (2). In 2015, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in the Netherlands conducted a systematic literature review of effects and safety of MCV below 9 months of age for the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization ( 3). Based on this review , and other evidence, SAGE made recommendations that infants from 6 month s of age receive a supplementary dose of measles containing vaccine in the following situations (1); during a measles outbreak as part of intensified service delivery; during campaigns in settings where the risk of measles among infants <9 months of age remains high; for internally displaced populations and refugees, and populations in conflict zones; for individual infants at high risk of contracting measles; for infants travelling to countries experiencing measles outbreaks; for infants known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected or exposed. However, recent outbreaks have found many cases are occurring in children less than 6 months of age. As a result, c ountries have requested information for MCV <6 months in order to assess whether infants less than 6 months can be protected against measles while maintaining robust population immunity. Several strategies exist to protect ch ildren younger than six months of age against measles. The first, and most important, is to reduce measles virus transmission overall such that the risk of exposure in young infants is minimal to none. Second, MCV could be administered prior to 6 months of age under some circumstances, although the proportion of children who develop protective antibodies is expected to be lower than following vaccination at a later age. Third, measles antibody levels could 7 be increased in women of child bearing age, althoug h this should be done prior to pregnancy as MCVs are contra- indicated during pregnancy. 2 Objective To conduct a n update of the 2015 systematic review of the evidence on whether the effect of MCV below 6 months of age - in terms immunogenicity, efficacy or effectiveness, duration of protection, safety and blunting - is equal or less than the effect of MCV at 6 -8 months of age . 8 3 Methods 3.1 Review Questions PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator and Outcome) framework questions were pre -defined to inform th e review objectives and are presented in Table 1. Table 1: PICO framework for the effect of measles vaccination < 6 months of age Population Intervention Comparison Outcome Infants up to 6 months of age receiving an MCV Any currently licensed MCV administered to infants < 6 months of age. Any currently licensed MCV administered to infants 6-8 months of age 1. Immunogenicity 2. Efficacy 3. Effectiveness 4. Duration of immunity 5. Safety 6. Blunting 3.1.1 Prima ry questions What is the immunogenicity, duration of immunity, efficacy and effectiveness of MCV1 (M, MR and MMR) when given to infants younger than 6 months of age (as compared infants aged 6 -8 months ). Does a dose of MCV1 administered <6 months of age blunt the immune response to a subsequent dose of measles vaccine ? Is the safety profile for infants vaccinated with MCV1 at <6 months of age comparable with infants vaccinated with MCV1 at 6 -8 months of age? 3.1.2 Primary outcome measures a) Immun ogenicity Humoral immunity We will consider serological measles antibody responses in terms of the proportions seroconverted and seropositive, geometric mean titres (GMTs) and the avidity assay. - Seroconversion was defined by a four -fold increase in titre s pre - and post -vaccination or by a change from a negative to a positive titre before and after vaccination (only for HIA). We did not consider the latter criterion adequate for PRNT seroconversions, as due to the sensitivity of the assay this would exclude all infants with pre -vaccination maternal antibodies (and limit the external validity of the results); - Seropositivity was defined by cut -off values as described by the authors and by a PRNT titre >120 mIU/ml; - GMTs were reported only when based on PRNTs with samples taken at least 6 weeks after the receipt of a MCV. For all reported GMTs based on non -PRNT assays, and for the avidity index, we used relative measures from within study comparisons, as these assays are not sufficiently comparable between laboratories. - When multiple GMTs or proportions seroconversion/seropositive are reported at different time points, we used the highest values. Cellular immunity Here we used relative indicators repor ted from within study comparisons, e.g. the stimulation index for measles T -cell proliferation. b) Efficacy Vaccine efficacy against measles cases and measles deaths (laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked measles cases) as assessed from RCTs. c) Effec tiveness Vaccine effectiveness against measles cases and measles deaths (laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked measles cases) as assessed from post -implementation field studies. d) Duration of immunity Trends in antibody levels over time since meas les vaccination, taking into account exposure to wild -type measles virus. e) Safety Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAEs). 10 f) Blunting Reduced immune response to a subsequent dose of a measles containing vaccine. 3.2 Search strategy An initial search was carried out on 01 June 2015 for any articles published in relevant databases reporting MCV <9 months (3). An u pdated search was carried out on 13 April 20 17 for articles publis hed after 01 January 2015 reporting MCV<6 months . 3.2.1 Searching literature databases The initial search was carried out as previously described ( 3) and results of the initial search wer e screened for studies reporting MCV<6 months . The updated search for MCV<6 months was carried out in the following primary databases outlined in Appendix A: Databases and websites used for literature search . The databases were s earched using controlled vocabulary (i.e MeSH terms) with a pre -determined strategy as detailed in Appendix B: Database search strategy . Secondary databases were also searched for relevant studies. A time limit of records publishe d after 01 January 2015 was applied to capture any articles published since the initial search . The search results were transferred to an EndNote library. Duplicate records were removed using the EndNote \"Find duplicates\" function, followed by a manual che ck. 3.3 Literature selection All articles found by the updated search were screened by one reviewer (Laura Nic Lochlainn ) using a two-stage approach by reviewing the title, abstract and full text as outlined below. 3.3.1 First selection step: title and abstract The title and abstract of each article were reviewed to see if they met criteria for inclusion. In case of uncertainty about inclusion or exclusion, a second opinion was sought . 3.3.2 Second selection step: full article Articles which met criteria for inclusion were reviewed for full text screening . In case of uncertainty about inclusion or exclusion, a second opinion was sought . 11 3.3.3 Eligibility criteria After gathering the evidence, the eligibility criteria outlined below were applied to the results. 3.3.3.1 Types of studies Randomized control trials (RCTs), quasi- randomised control trials (qRCTs), outbreak investigations, cohort and case control studies regarding vaccination schedules for currently licensed measles containing vaccines. 3.3.3.2 Types of participants Infants <6 months of age receiving their first dose of a MCV. 3.3.3.3 Types of intervention Any currently licensed measles containing vaccine administered to infants < 6 months of age. A currently licensed measles containing -C and TD97. Combination vaccine containing various combinations of the above measles strains with other viruses: 3.3.3.4 Minimum data requirements For inclusion in the review, the articles must report a minimum set of data as shown in Table 2. Table 2: Minimal data requirements within articles for inclusion in review Data requirements for all studies Age at vaccination Exact age (months) Safety Adverse events case definition Data requirements for immunogenicity studies only Vaccine strain used Exact vaccine strain and or potency used Immunogen icity results Type of laboratory test used 12 3.3.4 Exclusion criteria Ecological studies, case reports, modelling studies, non -human primate studies, meeting abstracts, editorials, newspaper articles and other forms of popular media were excluded. High titre vaccines were excluded from the review (3). Stud ies derived from combining MCV with gamma globulin or obtained after intradermal (rather than subcutaneous) administration of MCV were a lso excluded from the review. Studies reporting on the n on-specific effects of measles vaccination (e.g. overall mortality) were not considered. The reasons for excluding studies (including reasons for exclusion following review of the full text) were recorded at each stage. 3.4 Data extraction The characteristics of included studies were extracted into a data extraction form and entered into an Access database. For any trial data , per -protocol analyses were used rather than intention to treat results. 13 3.5 Data analyses We used Stata version 1 4 (StataCorp, Austin, USA) for all analyses. Where possible, results were stratified by age at administration of MCV in months. Where sufficient data was available, results were pooled by meta -analyses. We examined hetero geneity between results of different studies with forest plots and quantitatively using the I2 statistic . We used random effects meta -analysis to estimate the weighted average of the pooled effects. Where possible, random effects meta - regression was employ ed, to explore whether determinants of age at MCV , vaccine strain and titre, continent, or decade of study explained heterogeneity between studies. 3.5.1 Analyses per outcome measure Immunogenicity We employed random effects meta -analysis for proportions, using the Freeman -Tukey double arcsine transformation for standard errors . We made forest plots of the proportion seroconverted by age of administration of MCV . Here we only considered results obtained by applying the following definitions of seroconversion: 4 times increase in titre (with or without adjusting for pre -vaccination antibody de cay), or a change from a negative pre - vaccination titre to a positive post- vaccination titre (only for HIA tests). We analy sed GMTs based on PRNT by age of administration o f MCV (<6 months or 6-8 months ), on a natural logarithmic scale by random effects meta- analysis. Studies reporting GMTs derived from methods other than PRNT or with a time between vaccination and sampling less than 6 weeks were excluded from this analysis. Cellular immunity We reviewed only results from measles specific cellular immunity tests, including blast transformation, T cell stimulation, proliferation tests and memory T cell assays. Results of cytokine studies were not included in the review. Given the lack of standardization of assays, we only considered within study comparisons of MCV <6 months or 6 -8 months of age. Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness (VE) were summarized . Where available, multiple outcome measures for VE were considered (clinical measles, laboratory confirmed measles, measles hospitalisation and measles related deaths). 14 Duration of immunity We reviewed only results of studies with GMTs and corresponding confidence intervals that were within study comparisons and had different time points between MCV vaccination and sampling . We plotted the GMT measures by time between vaccination and sampling to look at the effect of time on the GMT values . Safety We summarized a vailable evidence of adverse events following immunization ( AEFIs ). Blunting Here we considered the proportion seropositive, avidity index and stimulation index after MCV2 or MCV3 by age of administration of MCV . 3.5.2 Comparison of review results with evidence of administra tion of MCV at older ages The current review considered MCV administered <6 months of age. Evidence on the effects of administration of MCV at 6-8 months of age was obtained from Nic Lochlainn et al., 2015 (3). 15 4 Results of the literature search An initial literature search carried out on 01 June 2015 yield ed a total of 8 67 references (Error! Reference source not found. ). An updated search carried out on 13 April 2017 yield ed a total of 186 reference s (Figure 2). A total of 1 8 studies from both searches (17 and 1, respectively) were included in the review . 16 4.1 PRISMA flow chart s Figure 1: Flow chart of the initial literature search ( 2015) with excluded and included items, and number of studi es according to outcome measure. *Data were extracted from some studies for multiple outcomes . 17 Figure 2: Flow chart of the updated literature search (2017) with excluded and included items, and number of studi es according to outcome measure. 18 4.2 Overview of studies included in the review A summary table of studies with eligible data is shown in Table 3.

The pooled estimates of the proportion SC by age of MCV ranging from 4 to 5 months, stratified by strain, are presented in Figure 3.

As a reference, we included the proportion SC reported by Nic Lochlainn et al ., for MCV1 at 6 months [76% (95%CI 71-82)] (3) and as reported by Moss and Scott for MCV1 at 9 months [92% (95%CI 59 -100)] and at 11 months [ 98% (95%CI 88-100) ] (23).

The study by Whittle et al ., (20) examined GMTs of infants vaccinated at 4 or 5 months with different titres of the Schwarz or Edmonston -Zagreb strains. The study by Ko et al ., (12) examined GMTs of infants vaccinated at 5 months with standard titre Schwarz strain. However, they stratified their resul ts by GMT antibody levels prior to vaccination. Figure 6 shows the pooled GMT estimates for infants vaccinated with MCV <6 months of age ( 275 (95% CI 126-600) ). We also included the pooled GMT estimates for infants vaccinated with MCV >6 months of age which was 24 7 (95% CI 14 8-412). 25 Figure 6. Random effects meta -analysis of PRNT geometric mean titres after MCV in infants <6 months or 6 -8 months of age. Titres are expressed as TCID50 unless specified othe mean titre. interval. There were n o stud ies examining avidity following MCV vaccination below 6 months of age . 5.1.4 Cellular immunity We found one stud y by Njie -Jobe et al ., (16) which found that infants vaccinated with MCV1 (Edmonston -Zagreb) at 4 months had higher IFN - memory T -cell responses at 9 months compared to the unimmunized group . They found that 14 and 44 mo nths following vaccination, IFN - memory responses were similar in the group with two MCVs at 4 and 9 months and the group with MCV1 at 9 months. They also found that the p resence of maternal antibod ies had no effect on memory T -cell responses nor did the number of reporting seropositivity for measles antibodies following MCV1<6 months (9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25). The estimates of the proportion seropositive by age of MCV ranging from 3 to 5 mont hs, pooled across strain and titre are presented in Figure 7. The overall pooled estimate for seropositivity following MCV1 <6 months was 68% (95%CI 58 -78). The pooled seropositivity estimates stratified by age at MCV and strain in are presented in Figure 8. The corresponding forest plot is available in Appendix D: Supplementary results (Figure 15 to Figure 19).

Error bars present 95% confidence intervals. 28 5.2 Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness We identified two studies following MCV1 <6 months; one reporting v accine efficacy (13) and one reporting vaccine effectiveness (8). Hull et al ., report ed on the vaccine effect iveness of the Moraten strain following a measles outbreak in the Gambia in 1981 (8). They found vaccine effectiveness of 54% (95%CI 0 -84%) among infants vaccinated with MCV1 below 5 months (n=5), and vaccine effectiveness of 37% (95%CI 0 -74%) among infants vaccinated with MCV1 at 6 -8 months (n=11) ( 8). Martins et al ., reporte d on the interim analysis of a randomised clinical trial in Guinea- Bissau using the Edmonston -Zagreb strain. The outcomes of interest were vaccine efficacy against measles infection, admission to hospital for measles, and measles mortality before standard vaccination at 9 months of age (13). They found vaccine efficacy of MCV1 (Edmonston -Zagreb) at (95%CI -42-100)] . 5.3 Duration of immunity We identified two studies (12, 14) reporting findings following MCV below and above 6 six months. Ko et al ., stratified their findings by infants' response to MCV 1 (Schwarz) at 5 months and compared them four to six weeks follow ing MCV2 (MMR II , Wellcome ) at 13 months . They found one infant who responded to MCV1 but showed no further rise in GMT following MCV2. However, the remaining 15 infants who responded to MCV1 had significantly higher responses four to six weeks following M CV2 at 1 3 months, compared to those who did not respond to MCV1 (12). Martins et al ., examined the GMTs of infants following vaccination with MCV1 at 4.5 months and MCV2 at 9 months using s tandard -titer Edmonston -Zagreb (14). Overall, they found that at 24 months, infants vaccinated early maintained high protective antibo dy levels (14). 29 5.4 Blunting We found t wo studies (14, 16) reporting seropositivity following MCV1 <6 months and MCV2 >9 months of age. Martins et al ., found infants at 24 months of age had measles seropositivity of 97% (95%CI 94-98) following MCV1 at 4. 5 months and MCV2 at 9 months (14). Nije-Jobe et al ., found measles seropositivity at 9.5 moths to be 98% following MCV1 at 4 months and MCV2 at 9 months of age (16). Twelve months following MCV3 at 36 months, antibody titres had dropped but all infants had protective levels of antibody. 5.5 Safety We found two studies ( 7, 12) reporting on safety following MCV1 below 6 months . Ko et al ., reported two episodes of rash with fever among 53 stud y participants following MCV1 (Schwarz) at 5 months . However, the authors stated that one infant had a rash throughout the recording period and unlikely to be due to the vaccination . The second infant developed a rash 19 days after MMR vaccination , a saliv a specimen collected five days after rash onset was negative for measles IgM and IgG . No adverse events were reported . A study by Do et al ., relates to the RCT in Guinea -Bissau previously reported by Martins et al ., (13, 14). However, here they report on AEFIs among 1 ,592 infants who were randomized to receive MCV1 (Edmonston -Zagreb) at 4.5 months . Overall, t hey found r educed skin reaction among infants who received MCV1 at 4.5 months of age [ Hazard Ratio 0.76 (95% CI 0.60 -0.95) ]. Also, they found no significant difference between groups randomized to receive MCV1 at 4.5 months or 9 months for AEFIs 7 and 14 d ays post vaccination (7). 30 5.6 Secondary questions 5.6.1 Presence of maternal antibodies and seroconversion We found two studies comparing the proportion seroconverted in infants with maternal antibodies following MCV <6 months (4, 15). Figure 9 shows a summary of the results of th e meta -analysis of the proportion seroconver ted stratified by presence of maternal antibodies. The proportion seroconverted is higher in infants without maternal antibodies compared to t hose with maternal antibodies. These differences were, however, not si gnificant. As seroconversion was measured by different techniques in these studies (PRNT, HIA and ELISA), these are crude estimates and only suited for a general comparison between infant with and without maternal antibodies. Forest plots can be found in Appendix D: Supplementary results Figure 20 and Figure 21. Figure 9. Overall p roportion of seroconverted infants with maternal antibodies following MCV below 6 months .

The proportion seroconverted is higher in infants without maternal antibodies compared t o those with maternal antibodies. Figure 10: Proportion seroconverted by month of MCV, stratified by presence of maternal antibodies. 6 GRADE quality of evidence found Seventeen of nineteen included studies were observational. T herefore, f or all outcomes, the quality of evidence was found to be moderate, low or very low but of importance. See Table 5 in Appendix C: GRADE data quality assessment . 32 7 Discussion In our review, w e encountered a number of areas with paucity of studies of infants vaccinated with MCV1 <6 months of age. These include studies on antibody avidity, vaccine effectiveness, cellular immunity, duration of immunity and blunting to subsequent MCVs following MC V <6 months. In addition, more observations are needed to estimate the incidence of AEFIs following MCV below 6 months of age. This paucity of data, together with heterogeneity between studies, warrants caution when interpreting our results. In terms of h umoral immunity among infants vaccinated below 6 months of age, the proportion seroconverted and seropositive increased with age, and was also dependent on strain. We found that GMTs were higher among infants vaccinated below 6 months , but there was variat ion by strain and age of MCV1 vaccination. Furthermore , the se findings are based on only two studies among infants vaccinated below 6 months and five observations from three studies among infants vaccinated above 6 months. For vaccine efficacy and effectiveness and safety , there were f ew eligible studies and , those eligible had small sample sizes . Metaregression did not find significant findings for any of the outcomes. T he quality of evidence was found to be moderate, low or very low for all outcomes con sidered but of importance. 8 Conclusions We found h umoral immunogenicity following MCV1<6 months of age was dependent on age of MCV1 and low levels of maternal antibodies . There was limited evidence available for ce llular immunity, vaccine effectiveness , duration of immunity, safety and blunting. 9 Recommendations for future research In order to obtain reliable evidence to inform decisions , a trial, with a long follow -up after subsequent doses of MCV in an endemi c area with MCV1 at 4 -6-9 month would be helpfu l. Observational case -control studies in high endemicity areas where MCV1 has bee n given at 6 months of age in the past e.g. South Africa or Papua New Guinea , could provide useful humoral and vaccine effectiveness data . Finally, s eroepidemiological studies in low and middle income countries could 33 provide a better understanding of population immunity towards measles and other vaccine preventable diseases . 10 Acknowledgements We thank the Members of the WHO IVB team for the opportunity to conduct this review.
