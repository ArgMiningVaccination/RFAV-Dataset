Introduction Ayurveda, a formof TraditionalIndian Medicine (TIM), lifespan\" [ 1]. Ayu- rveda is a Whole System of Medicine (WMS) [ 2-5]. In its South Asian countries of origin it has been practiced for more than 2000 years in an unbroken tradition and is thus one of the oldest WMS of mankind [ 6]. Ayurveda is fully recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a medical science analogous to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and has amassed an enormous wealth of empirical healingknowledge.(Proto)scientificconceptshavehadafirm place in mainstream Ayurvedic medicine ever since around thebeginningofthecommonerawiththeemergenceofthe \"classic texts\" (e.g., Caraka Samhita [ 7,8]) and are centered around designated disciplines of logic and methodology[9]. In India and some neighboring countries, Ayurvedic medicine is officially and legally recognized as on par with c o n v e n t i o n a lm e d i c i n e .I ti su s e di na na r e aw i t hm o r et h a n 1./four.fitted billion people as a broad system of medicine [ 10,11]. The importance of Ayurveda in modern South Asian health care setups is reflected by the following figures: in India aloneabove/four.fitted00,000registeredAyurvedicphysicianspractice Ayurveda [ 12] and there are more than 250 universities and colleges where Ayurvedic medicine is systematically taught as a /four.fitted-6-year university degree program [ 13]. In its diagno- stic and therapeutic approaches Ayurveda is steeped in the principlesofsalutogenesis[ 1/four.fitted]Primary,secondary,andterti- ary prevention, patient self-empowerment, and self-efficacy play crucial roles in the holistic and multidimensional Ayu- rvedic approach to healing [ 15]. Ayurveda not only is a WMS but also incorporates eclectic philosophies of life that have helped to shape complex theories about health2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine and disease over more than three millennia, including philosophical,epistemological,andspiritualdimensions.For example, Ayurveda postulates a paradigmatic harmony of physiological, psychological, social, and environmental fac- tors of the human microcosm and the universal macrocosm [16,17]. InadditiontoitskeyroleinAsianhealthcaresystems,it isplayingagrowingroleinComplementaryandAlternative Medicine(CAM),especiallyinintegrativesettingsinEurope and North America. For instance, in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland Ayurveda is one of the fastest growing CAMmethods[ 18].Aninternetsearchfor\"Ayurveda\"yields >7 , /four.fitted 0 0 , 0 0 0e n t r i e si nG o o g l e[ 19]. In 2011 the establishment of the German Medical Doctors Association of Ayurvedic Medicine (D \u00a8AGAM) took place [ 20]. In several training institutions throughout Germany professional development and training opportunities certified by various state-level German Medical Doctors' Associations are being offered Hamburg, and Rhineland-Palatinate). Yet thereisnonationalcertificateforAyurveda.Importantareas ofdiscussionsurroundingthecharacterofAyurvedainclude (a)itsunderlyingcoreconceptsfordiagnosisandtherapy,(b) therapeutic aims, and (c) demarcation from other SouthAsiantraditionalmedicalsystems(e.g.,Siddha,Unani- Tibb) and modern western medicine and remain largely unanswered [ 17]. Inquiries regarding the importance of reli- gionandspiritualitywithinmedicalcontextshavebeenposed repeatedly in Indology, Sociology, Anthropology, Religious Studies, and Medical Sciences [ 18,21,22]. Whole Medical Systems (WMS) are by definition complete and coherent systemsofmedicaltheoryandpracticethathaveevolvedand continue evolving, in different regions, cultures, and time periods around the globe. They have evolved relatively inde- pendent of modern western medicine, supporters of \"scientific\" Ayurveda state that it has always been an empirical medical system in which religious and spiritual speculations are mere interpo- lations,alien to the system, or(b) supporters of\"traditional\" Ayurveda state that religious and spiritual elements have always been integral components of Ayurveda as a WMS. Thesepositionsare,however ,notmutuallyexclusive. There is growing acceptance and demand for Ayurveda in western countriesand there are currentlymorethan 2500 online publications on Ayurvedic therapies in PubMed [ 30] andgreaterthan52,000referencedAyurvedaresearcharticles in the Indian digital database DHARA (Digital Helpline for Ayurveda Research Articles) [ 31]. It is hypothesized that spiritualitymightbeamainattractorfortheincreasingpop- ularityofAyurveda[ 32];however,thereisstilllittlescientific evidence regarding the influence of religious and spiritual elements on the diffusion and implementation of modern hybridformsofAyurveda[ 33-35]. This is striking because spirituality has already entered discussions in neurobiology [ 36] and most of all qualityof life (QoL) research [ 37], especially in chronic diseases [38-/four.fitted/four.fitted]. However, cultural and spiritual attractors of non- western CAM have been discussed in recent years [ /four.fitted5,/four.fitted6] and are beginning to be researched [ /four.fitted7,/four.fitted8]. The rather late awareness of spiritual aspects in CAM might be due to t h ei m p a c tt h a tt h em e t h o d o l o g yo fE v i d e n c e - b a s e dM e d i - cine (EbM) had on the medical system as such and in particularonresearchinitiativesinCAM.Morerecently,after CAM research has managed to close some evidence gaps, researchers have become aware of the necessity to conduct research focused not only on specific evidence but also on unspecific or contextual or patient-centred aspects (related toCAM)[ /four.fitted9-52].ThisisbynomeansinoppositiontoEbM becauseoneofitsfoundersdefinedEbMastheintegrationof (a) the best research evidence with (b) clinical expertise and (c)patientvalues[ 53].However,clinicalresearchhadfocused predominantlyonthetwoformeraspectsuntilrecently. In order to explore the general role of religion and spi- ritualityspecificallywithinthefieldofAyurveda,anewque- stionnaire was developed. While existing questionnaires, for example, the Spiritual Perspective Scale [ 5/four.fitted,55], the S-PRIT [56], the FACIT-Sp [ 57], the Spiritual Scale Aspects of Spirituality [ 59], the SpREUK [ 60], the Health and Religious Congruency Scale [ 61]a n do t h e r s [62-68] would be useful for further analysis, the objective of this pilot survey was to focus on the specificities of the c o m p l e xfi e l do fA y u r v e d ai naw e s t e r ns e t t i n g ,l e a v i n gt h e definition of spirituality as open as possible. Spirituality and religion were thereby not used as analytical but as emic (ethno)categories[ 69-71].Thisquestionnairewasdistributed amongpatientsaccessingandtherapistsofferingAyurvedain German-speakingcountries. 1.1.Hypothesis. To shed some light on the influence and mea- ning of religious and spiritual aspects on the diffusion and implementation of Ayurvedic practices in Europe the follo- winghypotheseswereformulatedtothesurveyapriori.

To be included participants had to be 18 years of age. Patient participants had to have had 1 experience with Ayurvedic therapies and therapist participants had to have hadatleastonecourseofinstitutionalizedAyurvedictraining and had to offer Ayurvedic therapies or have a plan to do so atthetimeofinclusion(detailsabouttheindividualtraining durationwerenotfurtherassessed). Patientswereexcludediftheysufferedfromalifethreat- ening disease, in order to avoid systematic bias/confounders duetoa\"lastexitmentality\"whichcaninfluencetheoverall compliance with respect to their choice of therapies and therapists. The survey with anonymized questionnaires, part of a master thesis for the corresponding author, was performed at the Institute for Indology and Tibetology, Philosophical Faculty, University of G \u00a8ottingen, Germany. Of note this is not a clinical study, and according to university procedures therefore no ethical approval was mandatory and informed consent, anonymized questionnaires, and respect of data privacyweresufficient. 2.2. Construction of the Questionnaire. Firstly, a preliminary questionnaire considering content validity, internal consis- tency,criterionvalidity,constructvalidity,andreproducibil- itywasdeveloped[ 72]. The items for the preliminary questionnaire version were derived from three sources: (1) exploratory interviews with expert representatives, (2) as discussed in the research literature, and (3) items inspired by existing questionnaires i nt h efi e l d( e . g . ,\" A s p e c t so fS p i r i t u a l i t y , \"s e ea b o v e ) .Th i s preliminary version of the questionnaire was pretested with 10 test persons accustomed to filling out questionnaires, to gaininformationonreliabilityandvalidityaspects.Theques- tionnaire was then modified based on the received feedback a n dr e e x a m i n e d .I tw a st h e nm o d i fi e da n da p p r o v e db y expert representatives and scholars from various disciplines (Medicine, Indology, Religious Sciences, Informatics, and Sociology). This resulted in a final version of the question- n a i r et ob ed i s t r i b u t e dt ot h et a r g e tg r o u pi ni t sfi n a l i z e d version. Therefore the underlying questionnaire might be regarded as a \"standard\" questionnaire in the sense of Olsen [73]. A validated questionnaire in the traditional sense was not possible, since we could not compare this instrument againstagoldstandard,assuchagoldstandardforAyurveda as a Whole Medical System this context does not yet exist [58]. The final version of the questionnaire included a section for sociodemographic baseline data and 50 questionnaire items.Themajorityoftheitemsarescoredona5-pointLikert scalerangingfrom\"total\"disagreementto\"total\"agreement(0-/four.fitted)orona3-pointLikertscale(i.e.,\"yes,\"\"no,\"and\"donot know\").Inordertoobviatetheproblemofacquiescencebias, wedesignedascalewithbalancedkeying(anequalnumberof p o s i t i v ea n dn e g a t i v es t a t e m e n t s ) ,w h i l ep o s s i b l ed i s t o r t i o n s through central tendency and social desirability are more difficulttocontrol. 2.3. Statistics and Validation. All returned questionnaires underwent statistical analysis. For descriptive statistics each item was analyzed separately and in some cases item responsesweresummedtocreateascoreforagroupofitems. Thefrequenciesofthevariousvariableswerecalculated.Dif- ferences in frequency distributions were tested with the 2- Test. Principal Component Analyses with Varimax Rotation and Kaiser Normalization were used to represent the main structural features of the multivariate data set by a smaller number of attributes. This is achieved by transforming data from the original coordinate system (i.e., spanned by the original attributes) into a different coordinate system where the variables are linearly independent. The factor loading, a standardized scoring coefficient, was used to determine the contributionofavariabletoaparticularfactor.Variableswith rotatedabsolutefactorvalues>0.5(or<0.5)foraparticular factorwereconsideredsignificantcontributorsforthatfactor (seeTable 3. The 12 variables are /four.fitted factors: for example,thevariables\"Ayurveda=Spirituality?,\"\"Ayurveda= Philosophical system?,\" and \"Ayurveda = Way of life?\" have rotated absolute factor values >0.5 for factor 1, which expresses a strong correlation between these variables; all othervariableshavefactorvalues 0.5or0.5withrespect to factor 1; therefore they do not significantly contribute to this factor). Negative rotated absolute factor values express inversecorrelations.Weused10ormoretestpersonsperitem in connection with multivariate analyses. Ten test persons per 1 item is a well-known rule of thumb for the number of instances(datasets)inconnectionwithknowledgediscovery processes, that is, multivariate analyses. Based on reliability analyses inner consistencies and discriminatory power were tested. A significance level of<0.05 was taken as a basis. Calculationswere performedwith NCSS (version 2007)and SPSS(version19). The validation of questionnaires in general is based on methods of the classical test theory and factor analyses for thedesignofquestionnaireitems.Factoranalysiswasoneof thecentralmethodsfortheevaluationofthisquestionnaire. It serves for the grouping of parameters and for the partial validation of this questionnaire. The a priori allocation of different subject areas was tested by factor analyses. For each subject area a factor analysis was calculated to find out whether the chosen subject area captures the construct or whether the existence of several factors hints at the existence of different subconstructs.

Discussion Themetapostulateofthisworkwasconfirmedthatindividual andexpectationsregardingAyurvedichealthcare.Statistical relationshipsbetweenindividualreligiousandspiritualback- groundsandindividualdecisionstoofferoraccessAyurvedic servicesareclearlyshown. Astatisticallysignificantlargerfractionofwomeninboth groups is noticeable. Both therapists and patients also share an above average education. Results support the thesis that Ayurveda is being used by a predominantly well-educated, urban,andfemaleclientele[ 76-78].Differenceswithrespect to income between groups suggest that hybrid forms of Ayurveda in the West are part of a \"luxury\" medicine; theirusageispredominantlyreservedforpeoplewithhigher incomes(see Table 1)[79]. ThissurveyinvestigatestheperceptionofAyurvedafrom a convenience sample of therapists and patients of predom- inantly western backgrounds. Therefore, it cannot define Ayurvedainanyabsolutetermnordoesitattempttocompare contemporary with \"classic\" Ayurvedic perspectives. Nev- ertheless the results of this survey point to a conception of Ayurveda as Whole Medical System, which also impacts the implementation of Ayurveda, particularly regarding the patient-doctorrelationship[ 80,81]. Individualformsofspiritualityandreligionseemtoplay a key role in the perception and definition of Ayurveda for patients and therapists. In our population adherers of Ayurveda have a tendency to have a special affinity for Buddhism, Hinduism, and South Asian culture in general. Christian religions (e.g., Protestant or Catholic churches) seemtoplayalessintegralroleinthepracticeandperceptionofAyurveda,while\"traditional\"religiousbeliefs(e.g.,abelief in god, angels, and the devil) can be grouped together with SouthAsianreligiousbeliefsforamajorityoftherespondents (notably a belief in god, angels, and the devil can also be included in several South Asian belief systems as more recenttextsincludesuchconcepts).Spiritualityandreligious aspects appear to be central in individual conceptions of salutogenesis [ 82,83] and within the Ayurvedic therapeu- tic paradigm [ 8/four.fitted]. Thereby spirituality, not religion, is the preferred self-categorization within the field of Ayurveda. The results pose the question whether individual references to traditional Christian values might have become weaker due to a loss of confidence in established western religious institutions [ 85,86]. These values may thus be substituted or supplemented by the individually composed syncretistic realitiesofpatientsandtherapistsusingorofferingAyurveda (e.g., combining god, karma, and nirvana), whose religious andspiritualimpulsescontinuetoguidethem[ 87]. While both therapists and patients are engaged with religiousandspiritualquestionsandareopentotheseissues, therapistsseemtodealevenmorewithreligiousandspiritual matters than their patients. Beyond pure somatic healthcare services, adherents of Ayurveda expect the therapist to also function as a spiritual/psychological caregiver. As a result oftrainingandpatientexpectations,theAyurvedictherapist also frequently engages in functions (within an Ayurvedic treatment) that are also characterized by religious and spir- itual elements, for example, mantra recitation, performing rituals,meditation,prayers,andsoforth[ 88]. O u rd a t as u p p o r tt h eh y p o t h e s i st h a te l e m e n t sf r o m SouthAsianculture,religion,andphilosophyseemtoplayan importantroleforAyurvedicpatientsandtherapists.Ahigh level of \"authenticity\" and \"authentic therapy\" is expected from the therapists and therapies. It is notable that not only therapists but also patients seem to be quite well versed in South Asian culture, religion, and philosophy. This suggests t h a tt h ec h o i c ef o rA y u r v e d am i g h tg oh a n di nh a n dw i t ha fundamental affinity to South Asian culture and worldview [89]. For Ayurvedic patients and therapists, spirituality, reli- gion, and principles of modern science are not in conflict. For them, Ayurveda contains aspects of spirituality, religion, a n ds c i e n c ea tt h es a m et i m e .W h i l es p i r i t u a l i t yi ss e e na sa very important aspect, which also influences the daily life of therapists and patients, the medical dimension of Ayurveda is still seen as the most important one and does not exclude the simultaneous use of modern medicine for the majority. ThecompositionofAyurvediccharacteristicsthatisexpected from the majority of those participants could be interpreted as a curiosity for novel things and at the same time as an expression of uncertainty and discontent with prevailing structures. Frustration with modern medicine is less impor- tant in the decision to use Ayurveda than, for example, the inclusion of the spiritual dimension. An \"enchantment of the world,\" a concept often mentioned in CAM contexts, is supposed to help overcome the separation of matter, mind, andsoul.Nexttoscientificknowledge,spiritualitystandson equal footing. Religion in a classical sense seems to take a backseatinfavourofspirituality.However,thisistoacertain8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine degreeatenuouspositionbasedonthefactoranalysesrelated tothesecondhypothesisofthiswork. In our survey Ayurveda is used\u2014as is CAM in general in the western world\u2014by a well-educated, middle class, and femaledominatedclientele[ 90,91].WomenaccessAyurveda more often than men among the surveyed participants, and w o m e na p p e a rt ob em o r eo p e nt or e l i g i o u sa n ds p i r i t u a l matters [26]. Almost all characteristics related to religiosity and spiritual attitudes are more prominently represented amongwomeninourdataset[ 92]. Ayurveda patients and therapists seem to be more open to CAM, especially nonwestern CAM methods, but this does not exclude the simultaneous use of modern western medicine for the majority of respondents. Moreover, Ayu- rveda may be compensating for deficits in the field of psychosocial healthcare logistics [ 93,9/four.fitted]. In this concep- tion the Ayurvedic therapist does more than simply treat somatic disorders. Ayurvedic concepts are based on anthro- pologic/cosmological assumptions which include different levels of human existence in both diagnostic and therapeu- tic healing approaches. As a result, therapist-patient rela- tionships focused on the individual's unique experience and promoting trust and confidential discussion of spiritual mattersinthetherapeuticencounterareaccommodatedand indeedcultivated. Thereareseverallimitationsofthiswork.Thisstudywas informed by a small sample size rather than a large scale inquiry; thus various nonspecific effects, for example, the inhomogeneoussettings,mayhavecontributedtotheanswer patterns and thus may have significantly biased the results. Further a statistically significant larger fraction of women in both groups is noticeable (which however also refle- cts the field). Moreover, the partial reporting of the results as pooled data from patients and therapists may bias the picture depending on potentially different attitudes and knowledge about Ayurveda via patients versus therapists. The fact that 15% of patients are also trained as Ayurvedic therapistsisafurtherlimitationandapotentialsourceofbias. Anotherissue may be thatthepotentialsimultaneoususe of other CAM methods was not assessed by the questionnaire. Another minor limitation is the fact that some of the used items may have had influencing or directing effects due to their wording or an intentional open phrasing. It is also importanttokeepinmindwhileinterpretingtheresultsthat thisnotarepresentativepopulationsamplebutasamplethat waslikelytobepronetoAyurveda,whichofcourseisanother limitationofthisstudy. To summarize, key questions regarding the character, essence,complexity,andcontextualizationofAyurvedainits original and hybrid forms remain largely unanswered. The following questions yet to be answered seem to be of high exigency. (a) What is Ayurveda in general and can a clear definition of it be given independently of western or Indian contexts?(b)WhatarethereasonsforchoosingAyurvedaout of a range of different methods of CAM and is the choice for Ayurveda specific or random? (c) What exactly does \"spirituality\" mean for therapists and patients in the case of Ayurveda? Overall, normative questions about whether Ayurveda is a science or religion or spirituality seem to bedeceptive.Itmightalsobehelpfultomoveawayfromasking whether and to what extent Ayurveda acts in this context a n dt oi n s t e a df o c u sm o r eo nw h ya n dh o wi tf u n c t i o n si n associationwithscience,religion,andspirituality.Letuskeep inmindthattheseconceptsarenotnaturalentities.Religion, spirituality, and science are modern western concepts and have a strong potential to export normative and ideological items into what are primarily nonwestern contexts [ 17,95- 97]. LookingatAyurvedaasawholemedicalsystemincluding physical, psychological, medical, and spiritual elements, as well as a philosophy and a way of life, may challenge the differentiation,compartmentalization,andrationalizationof modern societies [ 98-100], while leading to a better under- standingofAyurvedaasanexpressionofandcomplementto \"modernwesternmedicine.\" Given the complexity of the topic and the exploratory nature of the survey, larger surveys with fully validated que- stionnaires, preceding qualitative phases, and refined hypo- theses are warranted to support the results of this first pilot survey.
