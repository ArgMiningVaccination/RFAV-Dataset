Chiropractic Care FAQ At Back To Mind Chiropractic, we know that many of our patients are coming from other healthcare providers. Therefore, we expect to get a few questions. We have collected a few of the most frequently asked questions about family chiropractic and chiropractic treatment for the benefit of our visitors. Some of the most commonly asked questions include: Chiropractic care is a subset of medicine that focuses on treatments and adjustments of the spine for the benefit of the entire body. Chiropractors are doctors; however, whereas traditional doctors have an MD (medical doctors), chiropractors have a DC (doctor of chiropractic). Doctors of Chiropractic attend four years of graduate school after college to earn this degree. Chiropractors use chiropractic adjustment techniques to realign the spine, which [pinches nerves](https://backtomind.com/conditions/pinched-nerve/), blood vessels, tendons, and ligaments. In addition, chiropractic care takes a well-rounded approach to the field of medicine, incorporating counseling, therapy, exercises, and more. Chiropractic techniques come in many shapes and forms. The most common treatment we use is called a chiropractic adjustment. This is a series of controlled thrusts that we can apply to realign the vertebrae in the back. We may also use a technique called [spinal decompression](https://backtomind.com/our-services/spinal-decompression/). In this technique, traction is placed on the spine to stretch the vertebrae ever so slightly. This can relieve compression issues in the spine. There are a number of benefits that come with family chiropractic treatment. First, a chiropractor will try to get to the root of a patient's problem. Instead of treating the symptoms on the surface, the goal is to eradicate the root cause, preventing the issue from returning. Furthermore, chiropractic care generally has few to no side effects or complications. Chiropractic care is far more personalized than other healthcare options. The chiropractor costs are going to vary from visit to visit. In general, the cost is going to be between $75 and $200 depending on the treatment provided (without insurance). Chiropractic care is accepted by health insurance. Therefore, those who have health insurance will be able to use this to cover a significant portion of the expenses. Other factors that might influence the cost of the visit include deductibles, coinsurance, and copays.
