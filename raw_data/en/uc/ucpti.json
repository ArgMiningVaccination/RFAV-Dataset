P a g e 2 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog Table of Contents President's Welcome ................................ ........................... 123 President's Message P a g e 3 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog President's Welcome to Sonoran University of Health Science s You hold in your hands the inaugural Sonoran University of Health Sciences catalog. Since the new catalog isn't that different from its predecessors, you might wonder, \"How is Sonoran University different from SCNM\"? These changes, subtle at first, will be increasingly apparent as Sonoran University's growth, diversity and interconnectedness accelerates over the next five years. Sonoran University's strategic pl an will increase interprofessional learning, with faculty teaching and students learning across disciplines. Picture it as a more diverse and enriched intellectual ecosystem. Similarly, in patient care , naturopathic medical students and nutrition students will collaborate (and other professions as we launch new degree programs) to provide patients a wider range of treatments. Another benefit that academic diversity brings comes from a phenomenon described in James Surowiecki's book The Wisdom of Crowds. Simply stated, harnessing the collective experience of a wide -ranging group of individuals working together yields better solutions. For example, Sonoran University's growing and increasingly diverse faculty and learning specialists share their collective ex periences and knowledge of learning science to enrich the student - centered experience. Changes ahead will be profound across higher education. The abrupt adaptations - to teaching, learning, and to work in general - opened our eyes to what was possible, and they are here to stay. Sonoran University of Health Sciences will not go back to business as usual . We will go forward and continue to innovate for our students, our patients, and the communities we serve. Join us, let's shape the future together.

The aggregate limit for Direct Unsubsidized loans is $224,000. Masters Students The maximum amount a student may borrow in Direct Unsubsidized Loans is $20,500 per nine -month academic year. The aggregate limit for Direct Unsubsidized loans is $138,500. Private Loans Private student loans are available to those who qualify and are cr edit based. There are no fixed annual or aggregate loan limits for private student loans. However, private loans may not exceed the cost of attendance for a nine -month academic period ( see Financial Policies ). In accordance with th e U.S. Department of Education (ED) 34 CFR 668.1 64 (c), federal student aid shall be posted to student accounts for allowable tuition and fee charges prior to crediting student accounts for other costs such as living expenses. Further, student verification of attendance in classes or clerkships must be documented prior to financial aid disbursement. Once student aid is applied to student accounts and attendance verification is received, the net difference between aid and tuition and fee charges results in an amount due to student or an amount due from student. Amounts due to students are provided in the form of a paper check or directly deposited in student bank accounts. Amounts due from students are due and payable according to the payment guidelines (see Payment Options). Foreign Financial Aid or Third -Party Payer Recipients Proof of official promissory note and/or offer letter from a third-party payer must be delivered to the Sonoran University Business Office prior to the first day of a term in order to avoid being dropped from all registered courses and clerkships and having to re -register for courses. General Eligibility Requirements All students seeking financial aid must meet general eligibility requirements regarding citizenship, financial need , and satisfactory academic progress. Students who are currently in default and have not made satisfactory loan repayments or owe a refund on a Title IV program do NOT qualify for any form of federal aid. Financial Aid Policy for Repeat Coursework Federal regulations (Title IV) limit the number of times a student may repeat a course and receive federal financial aid for that course. The Financial Aid Office does not determine if a student may repeat a course, only if the student is eligible for federal financial aid for the repeated course(es). Repeat coursework can also have consequences on a student's Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) calculation. Federal regulations prohibit students from using Title IV funds to cover a course for more than two at tempts after a failure of a course. A student may receive federal financial aid when repeating a course that was previously failed. Once a student has completed any course twice and earned a passing grade, they are no longer eligible to receive federal financial aid for that course . Loss of Eligibility Due to a Drug Conviction A student who is convicted of a state or federal offense involving the possession or sale of an illegal drug that occurred while enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid is not eligible for Title IV funds (see Sonoran University 's Drug and Alcohol Abuse Policy in the Sonoran University Student Handbook). A borrower's eligibility is based on the student's self - certification on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Convictions that are reversed, set aside, or removed from the student's record or a determination arising fr om a juvenile court proceeding do not affect eligibility and do not need to be reported by the student. A student convicted of a drug -related offense while enrolled in school and receiving Title IV aid loses Title IV eligibility as follows: 1. For the posses sion of illegal drugs: First offense: one year from the date of conviction Second offense: two years from the date of the second conviction Third offense: indefinite period 2. For the sale of illegal drugs: First offense: two years from the date of convi ction Second offense: indefinite period A school must provide a student who loses Title IV eligibility due to a drug -related conviction with a timely, separate, clear, and conspicuous written notice. The notice must advise the student of their loss of Ti tle IV eligibility and the ways in which the student may regain that eligibility. Program Limit s Financial Aid Recipients Financial Policies P a g e 18 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog Regaining Eligibility after a Drug Conviction Students denied eligibility for an indefinite period can regain eligibility after completing any of the following three option s: 1. Successfully completing a rehabilitation program (as described below, which includes passing two unannounced drug tests from such a program); 2. Having the conviction reversed, set aside, or removed from the student's record so that fewer than two convic tions for sale or three convictions for possession remain on the record ; or 3. Successfully completing two unannounced drug tests which are part of a rehab program (the student does not need to complete the rest of the program) A drug rehabilitation program is considered approved for these purposes if it includes at least two unannounced drug tests and meets one of the following requirements: The program received or is qualified to receive funds directly or indirectly under a federal, state, or local government program. The program is administered or recognized by a federal, state, or local government agency or court. The program received or is qualified to receive payment directly or indirectly from a federally or state licensed insurance company. The program is administered or recognized by a federally - or state -licensed hospital, health clinic, or medical doctor. When a student regains eli gibility during the award year, Sonoran University may award campus -based aid for the current payment period (quarter) and Direct Loans for the period of enrollment (academic year). Federal Student Aid Handbook. ( 2021 -2022 Retrieved from: https://fsapartners.ed.gov/sites/default/files/2021 - 04/2122FSAHbkVol1Master.pdf Students in eligible programs interested in obtaining financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the Direct Master Promissory Note (MPN), and Federal Stafford Entrance Counseling Exam . Approximately two to three weeks after submission of the FAFSA, the results of the compilation of information, including the estimated family contribution, is sent to the student and Sonoran University . Once the student's file is reviewed for eligibility , federal funding is determined. The student will receive an offer letter reflecting the cost of attendance based on the student's credit hour load reflected in their final registration and the type of aid offered based on the student's eligibility. Federal Work Study (FWS) awards are need -based. Campus -based s tudents in eligible programs are required to indicate their desire to participate in the FWS program when completing their FAFSA or communicate their desire to the Sonoran Universi ty Financial Aid Office to ensure FWS awarding is an option. Available positions are advertised each quarter. Please contact the Financial Aid Office for additional information at finaid@Sonoran.edu . Although international students do not qualify for U.S. federal financial aid, there are other options to help fund their Sonoran University education. Private student loans are available to foreign students; howev er, they must have a U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co -signer. Canadian Citizens Canadian students may be eligible to apply for Canadian student loans through their respective provin cial governments. Canadian students receiving financial aid from their provincial governments will be held to the same payment deadlines for tuition . Tuition must be paid in full by the end of add/drop period. If provincial financial aid is received by Sonoran University after the student has paid, a refund of excess tuition will be issued to the student within ten business days. Canadian students are responsible for initiating the process of financial assistance from their province. Documentation should be sent to the Financial Aid Office at Sonoran University for completion and returned to the appropriate provincial government.

Pre-registration All Sonoran University programs are cohort -based ; therefore , students are automatically registered for core courses (not electives or selectives) , including courses, labs, and clinical clerkships. Students may not deviate from their prescribed program of Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Change of Name Registration Institutional Policies P a g e 23 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog study. Following registr ation and prior to the start of the term, students enrolled in campus -based courses will have the opportunity to trade course/lab sections or clinical clerkships ( see Sonoran University Clinical Handbook) according to published deadlines for their prescrib ed program of study. Registration New campus -based students are required to upload a copy of a government -issued photo identification (i.e., Driver's license or passport ) to the Sonoran University Admissions Portal for registration . Registration for ND selective courses is available to students online 24/7 during the open registration period. Registration dates for each program of study are published in the academic calendar unless posted otherwise. Registration is the responsibility of the student. ND students may not register for courses after the second week of classes ; MS students may not register for courses after the fourth day of the course session see Adding and Dropping Courses). Students who fail any courses may not be eligible to progress in th eir prescribed program of study, will be dropped from the post -requisite course(s) and must meet with an Academic Advisor to amend their registration. Students must have the required prerequisites or co - requisites to be registered for the next quarter's co urses. Students who fail milestone, capstone , or sequence courses are not eligible to progress until the course is repeated with a passing grade. Students must be final registered for courses in order to attend. To finalize registration each term, ND stude nts must complete the online Registration Term Agreement. MS students will confirm their agreement through correspondence with their Student Success Counselor . As part of fall quarter registration, all students are also required to review and update their personal and emergency contact information. Students enrolled in online distance education programs are required to verify their current address and indicate the state in which they will be taking courses, if different from their address, prior to the star t of each quarter. Students who do not complete the agreement (and information update when required) during the designated time period will be charged a Late Registration F ee and may not be registered for the next quarter's courses (see Tuition and Fee s). Registration Holds A registration hold may be placed on a student's record to prevent the student from registering for courses in future quarters for financial, administrative , admissions , or academic reasons (including failure to comply with Sonoran University 's requirement of Safety and Prevention Courses , current NPLEX policies, or address verification requirement) . Any registration hold must be resolved before a student is registered. Students a re expected to attend all classes, laboratories, and clinical clerkships. It is the faculty member's prerogative to determine individual course attendance requirements. Attendance requirements are stated in the course syllabus. Attendance at laboratories a nd clinical clerkships is mandatory. Students must notify their faculty and the Dean of Students ' Office of a qualified incident utilizing the excused absence form in order to obtain an excused absence for course attendance and test/assignment rescheduling purposes , unless there are extenuating circumstances (see Missed Examinations, Assignments, or Required Attendance) . Attendance for online distance education courses is determined by active participation within the course such as submitting an assignment or exam, attending an online chat, or posting to a discussion forum. Simply logging into the course is not considered participation. Participation will not be counted for assignments submitted prior to the official first day of the quarter. Class participa tion by the end of the fourth day of the course is required to verify attendance and to release financial aid, if applicable. Students who do not maintain active participation in a distance course, as outlined in the syllabus, are encouraged to withdraw from the course to avoid failure of the course (see Adding and Dropping Courses ). Students receiving Title IV financial assistance, including assistance from the Veterans Administration (VA), are responsible for meeting VA and/or applicable federal aid attendance requirements. The Academic Policy and Progress Committee (APPC) is comprised of faculty, administration, and staff members. The APPC makes academic decisions regarding students' progress throughout their program. The decisions of the APPC ar e final with the exception of decisions regarding academic dismissal, which may be appealed to the Dean of the College of Naturopathic Medicine or the Dean of the College of Nutrition depending on the student's program of study. Sonoran University 's programs of study are track program s. Changes to the student's prescribed program of study must receive approval from APPC. Schedule changes requested Attendance Academic P olicy and Progress Committee Adding and Dropping Cours es Institutional Policies P a g e 24 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog after the start of a quarter are only permitted as detailed below: Students who fail to drop any course for which they are registered and fail to attend/participate in that course are subject to failing the course and the academic policies pertaining to failing a course ( see Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of stu dy). Students dropping a course after the add/drop period must follow the Course Withdrawal policy and are subject to the Drop ped Courses /Refund Policy . Withdrawing from courses after the add/drop perio d may impact their academic performance/academic progress. See the ND Program Add/Drop Requirements for additional program requirements . Students may audit a course with approval of both the course faculty and the program dean if they have already received credit fo r the course, met the course prerequisites, and have registered for the course. In cooperation with the program dean, the faculty will determine the degree that a student may participate. A student may not audit a course for which they have not already rec eived credit. Rare exceptions are noted in the course syllabi . A student cannot audit laboratory courses or clinical courses. Non -degree students may not audit courses. When auditing a course, students do not earn a grade, nor do they receive credit. Cours es taken as audit will appear as an AU on the student's official transcript , audit and course fees may apply (see Tuition and Fees) . Audit students are not eligible to participate in faculty office hours. Audit students will not complete any assignments or take any tests with the exception of exam preparation courses or in the event a unique exception is granted. A leave of absence (LOA) may be granted by the APPC to any student maintaining satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed program of study and who has met all financial obligations to Sonoran University . All LOA s requests must be submitted to the APPC for review and approval or denial . While on LOA , students are not eligible to attend c ourses or clinical clerkships, nor receive financial aid. The Financial Aid Office will be notified of the student 's intended last date of attendance when s tudents request an LOA. If students are unable to complete a quarter, tuition and fee refunds will be issued according to the Add/Drop Policy; and final grades will be issued according to the Grading Scale Policy (see Adding and Dropping Courses and Grading Scale Policy ). LOA is a period of non -enrollment where stud ents are not considered to be working toward the completion of their degree. The length of time allowed for LOA va ries depending on the type of leave (see Types of Leave of Absence) . Students on LOA are not eligible for financial aid and are subject to federal regulations pertaining to current loans. Upon return from LOA, the student must continue to meet technical standards and graduation requirements for their prescribed program of study. Requesting a Leave of Absen ce 1. Students must initiate the LOA pr ocess through an Academic Advisor or Dean of Students 2. Requests for LOA will be considered individually by APPC using the following guidelines: a. LOA will only be granted to students demonstrating satisfactory academic progress for their prescribed program of study . b. LOA should be requested prior to the beginning of a term and be approved before the term for which it is requested. c. Sonoran University strives to create an educational environment where students can pursue their academic goals. On rare occasions, a student may experience an unforeseen, uncontrollable, or unavoidable medical, mental health, or personal crisis that is so severe as to incapacitate the student preventing completion of the program. Therefore, currently enrolled students may request a ha rdship withdrawal from the respective program Dean and Dean of Students. 3. Leave time will be considered a portion of the total time limit for the degree ( see Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study) . 4. Students who do not return to act ive enrollment at the end of the granted leave are administratively withdrawn from Sonoran University . Students who are absent in excess of one year and wish to re -enter their degree program must go through the admission process for re - entry. Students are responsible for any outstanding tuition, fees, medical center bills, and library fines. Types of Leave of Absence Administrative Leave of Absence The Administrative Leave of Absence (ALOA) policy is designed to support students by streamlining the leave of absence process for those students unable to progress in their prescribed program of study due to the failure of a required course. Students will receive an official notification of the ALOA from the Registrar's Office . The gen eral policies for a student on LOA typically apply to a student on ALOA . For complete information on an ALOA , please see Auditing Courses Leave of Absence Institutional Policies P a g e 25 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog the Sonoran University Student Handbook . Sonoran University reserves the right to place a student on an ALOA in the event the student is unable to return to courses or has submitted medical documentation indicating they are unable to participate in courses. Personal Leave of Absence Students who are temporarily un able to continue their program of stud y for personal reasons may request a Personal LOA for a specific period of time not to exceed two consecutive quarters in a 12 -month period. Students on a Personal LOA that exceeds two quarters must request an extensio n from APPC or they may be officially withdrawn . Medical Leave of Absence Students who are temporarily unable to continue their program of study for medical reasons may request a Medical LOA for a specific period of time not to exceed a 12-month period. S tudents requesting an LOA for medical reasons must provide documentation by a clinician qualified to diagnose in the appropriate area of specialization. Documentation must be based on a current evaluation, provided on letterhead, typed, dated , and have an original signature. The same documentation is required when a student wishes to return from the medical LOA, indicating the student is able to resume their academic program. All documentation must be submitted with the LOA request . For information regardin g medical accommodations, please see Accessibility Office pages on MySonoran . A Medical LOA can be requested in conjunction with a Grade of Incomplete request, if occurring during the term and requirements are met. Military Leave of Absence Any student who is a member of the National Guard or other reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States and is called to active duty will be granted a Military LOA for the period of active duty and one year thereafter. Students will submit th e student's notification of duty requirements from the military . Upon return from a Military LOA, the student will be reactivated with the same academic status and without loss of academic credits earned, scholarships or grants awarded, or tuition or other fees paid prior to the commencement of active duty. Leave of Absence and Financial Aid The U.S. Department of Education requires that a student maintain a minimum status of half -time enrollment to receive federal financial aid. Therefore, students who are on ALOA/LOA will be considered withdrawn according to financial aid regulation 34 CFR 668.22 (d). If students are unable to complete a quarter, tuition and fee refunds will be issued according to the Add/Drop Policy for their prescribed program of study ; and final grades will be issued according to the Grading Scale Policy. Leave time will be considered a portion of the total time limit for degree completion. (See Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of study .) Exit Counseling Students who are enrolled less than half -time, withdraw , or graduate from Sonoran University are required by the U.S. Department of Education to complete the online exit counseling. Exit counseling help s borrowers understand their responsibilities when repaying their federal student loans . Please visit https://studentaid.gov/ for more information. Leave of Absence and Library Resources Enrolled students at Sonoran University have full borrower privileges and full access to electronic databases. Students approved for an LOA must return all li brary items and pay any outstanding fines prior to LOA approval. Depending on the type of LOA, students may not have borrower privileges or remote access to electronic databases ( see Library Privileges during a Leave of Absence) . Reactivation of Enrollment after Leave of Absence Students wishing to be re -activated within a year from the last date of attendance must submit the Reactivation Application form to the Academic Advising office. Academic Advising supports the student with applying for reactivation of enrollment, including assistanc e on requirements, submission of supporting documents related to the student's LOA (if applicable) , and answering any questions the returning student may have. All reactivation requests must be approved by the APPC. The A PPC will review the request and determine the student's eligibility to re-enter the program based on resolution of the issue(s) that resulted in the LOA . Upon return from LOA, the student must continue to meet all technical standards and all graduation req uirements for their prescribed program of study . If a student enrolled in the ND program ceases to be enrolled, including LOAs, Arizona ND statutes require that the certificate to engage in clinical training held by that student be automatically canceled. Therefore, ND students returning from a n LOA must re -apply for a new clinical training certificate (CTC) prior to their return t o Sonoran University as required by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medi cal Board. A CTC is required to be current, and it is the responsibility of the ND student to ensure that they have a valid CTC during their enrollment . ND students who return from an LOA may be required to attend Clinical Skills Development Sessions (CSDS) and/or Basic Science Institutional Policies P a g e 26 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog immersion course(s) to ensure they are prepared for re - entry into the program . The time during which the student was on LOA and/or withdrawn will be consider ed toward the total time limit for degree completion. Each student's a cademic standing is finalized at the conclusion of each quarter after a review of the term's final grade submissions. A student who meets the criteria for probation and/or dismissal will be notified at the end of the term ( see Satisfactory Academic Progress for prescribed program of stud y). Administrative Withdrawal Sonoran University is required to verify the enrollment and participation of students who participate in Federal Title IV student aid programs and/or who receive educational benefits through alternate funding sources. Students may be administratively withdrawn from the college under the following circumstances: Failure to meet admission requirements or falsification of information on the Sonoran University application. Failure to pay tuition and fees for the prescribed program of study by the published deadline . Failure to return to active enrollment at the end of the granted leave . Failure to complete Registration Term Agreement, Personal Information Update (when required), and/or necessary authorizations for registration to occur . Course Withdrawal Sonoran Univ ersity recognizes the complex lives of our adult learners, therefore there are conditions under which a student may withdraw from courses after the drop/add period. Courses dropped after the add/drop period may result in a grade of Withdrawal (WD) on the s tudent's official transcript if the withdrawal meets the Final Date of Withdrawal criteria stated in the course syllabus. Students are ineligible for a course withdrawal if they have completed all course requirements. The grade earned at that time will be assigned by faculty as the final grade for the course. There is no refund due to a student who withdraws from courses after the official add/drop period of the prescribed program of study. Withdrawals are reflected on the student's transcript as credit ho urs attempted (not credit hours earned), therefore a grade of WD on the student's transcript does not impact the student's GPA. Reenrollment in a previously withdrawn course beyond the add/drop period will be noted as a repeated course on the student's off icial transcript.If a course syllabus does not specify a Final Date of Withdrawal, withdrawals will be processed in accordance with the guidelines below. Courses with a final exam: deadline to drop the course is prior to date/time of the regularly schedu led final exam (not makeup exam dates) as published in the course syllabus. Courses with a final assignment (e.g., project, paper): deadline to drop the course is prior to the scheduled submission deadline. Courses with both final written and final practic al exams: deadline to drop the course is prior to date/time of the earliest scheduled final exam. Courses with both final written exam and final assignment: deadline to drop the course is prior to date/time/due date of the one that is scheduled earliest. Courses without a final exam or final assignment and/or with a final quiz only: deadline to drop the course is prior to the final scheduled course session. To withdraw from a course, the student is required to meet with an Academic Advisor, as withdrawin g from a course may impact a student's progress in their program of study. Please note the following considerations. A copy of the course syllabus with Final Date of Withdrawal must be submitted with the request for withdrawal. A student who fails to sit for a scheduled make -up exam is unable to withdraw from the course. A WD in a prerequisite for other courses precludes the student from enrolling in those courses until a letter grade is earned in the withdrawn course. A student may not withdraw from a course if the impact of the withdrawal results in a failure to meet satisfactory academic progress standards or will inhibit the student's ability to graduate within the maximum timeframe to completion (See Minimum Academic Requirements). (ND Program only) Clinical Skills Development Sessions may be required for a student who withdraws from a clinical clerkship. Dropped Courses/Refund Policy Students who do not completely withdraw from the college but drop a course/clerkship during the pu blished drop period will be refunded the difference in the tuition paid and the tuition rate applicable to the reduced number of hours, including course -specific fees assessed to the courses dropped. There is no refund due to a student who partially withdr aws from courses after the official add/drop period of the prescribed program of study. Academic Standing and Withdrawals Institutional Policies P a g e 27 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog Tuition paid for intensive courses will not be refunded once the course has begun. Special drop deadlines may apply for certain courses. Deadlines will be included in q uarterly registration notifications . Com plete Withdrawal /Refund Policy Complete withdrawal is defined as completely withdrawing from all c ourses (including a leave of absence). In the case of a complete withdrawal, the following tuition refunds apply and are dependent upon the withdrawal date. The date of complete withdrawal for 11- or 12 -week courses is the date the student provides written notic e to an Academic Advisor, Registrar 's office , or Dean of Students' office. Written notice via email is sufficient if the email is sent from the student's Sonoran University email account. In the case of a student who fails to notify the College of intent t o withdraw, the date that is the midpoint of the term or the student's last documented date of an academically related activity will be considered the withdrawal date, whichever is the latest date . Courses that are taught in sessions (courses that do not span an 11 - or 12 - week term ) will be considered stand - alone courses for the purpose of withdrawal and refunds. Refunds are determined based upon the last date of attendance in relation to the course's official start date. The percentage of time enrolled in each session will dictate the refund amount : Withdrawal Date Refund Calculations Complete withdrawal before the start of the term 100% tuition and fees except for non-refundable fees as noted in Tuition and Fees Complete withdrawal after the start of the session/ term, or before 60% completion of the session/term % tuition and non- refundable fees will be based on the federal guidelines formula as shown belo w, except for non-refundable fees as noted in Tuition and Fees After the 60% completion point of the session /term 0% tuition and fees refunded Federal Formula 1. Percent Earned : Calendar days completed in the period of enrollment divided by total calendar days in the period of enrollment (excludes breaks of five or more consecutive days ). 2. Payment Period : Sessions that are not scheduled for 11 or 12 weeks ; the payment period only includes the calendar days in which the student is registered . 3. Refund Amount : Tuition charges for the period of enrollment multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV aid This calculation determines the percentage of federal funds that have been earne d by the school at the time of withdrawal and the amount of unearned funds that must be returned to the federal program. For more information , contact the Financial Aid Office at finaid@ sonoran.edu . Institutional Policies P a g e 28 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog Sonoran University value s the pursuit of knowledge, research , and personal growth . These pursuits cannot be achieved without an adherence to ethic al standards of behavior and honesty. As we embrace this quest for academic growth, we are guided by a Sonoran University Core Value : Do the Right Thing . Academic integrity is the commitment to and the demonstration of honesty and integrity within an acad emic or learning environment. It is important that students understand what constitutes academic integrity. The following paragraphs define Sonoran University 's expectations of our students with respect to academic integrity and honesty. Examination / Ass essment Standards When taking in -person or online examinations or other individual graded assessments, students: Are expected to abide by Sonoran University 's Code of Professional Conduct and Academic Honor as described in the Student Handbook. Cheating is a violation of the Sonoran University Code of Professional Conduct and Academic Honor policies and undermines the community of trust and integrity of which we are all stewards. Failure to follow the Code of Student Professional Conduct and Acad emic Honor policies as outlined in the Sonoran University Student Handbook will not be tolerated , and students in violation may be subject to disciplinary actions, including suspension and dismissal. Are expected to understand that taking a screenshot, photo, or transcribing questions and/or responses to questions or sharing answers with other students is strictly prohibited and constitutes cheating. Should encourage honesty and discourage dishonesty among other students. May not receive/send answers from/to other students (via text, instant message, phone, email, etc.) Must refuse to assist other students in cheating. Are expected to adhere to all expectations as outlined in course syllabi a s well as examination/assessment instructions. Some examinations and assessments have specific requirements and unique expectations. In addition to the expectations outlined above, when taking in-person or online examinations students: Are required to leave all books and other aids in an inaccessible sp ot, such as in the front of the room or in another room (exception: open -book tests). Are not allowed to talk to each other during an examination. Should place as much space between themselves and other students as possible, when necessary. Are encouraged to take the initiative to prevent others from copying their work. May not leave the room or virtual testing environment and return to the test without expressed permission by the faculty or proctor . If note/blank paper is allowed, all notes must be turned in with the exam or destroyed as instructed. Students who violate any standard above will receive an automatic zero for the examination or assignment and are subject to disciplinary actions. For more information, see the Sonoran University Student Handbook , Integrity, and Academic Honesty. Missed Examinations , Assignments, and Absences Students are expected to take all examinations at the scheduled time and day as well as complete examinations and assignments by the published deadline. This includes didacti c and clinical exams, quizzes, assignments, activities, assessments, midterms, finals, and meeting attendance requirements as applicable. In exceptional situations, the course faculty may allow a student to reschedule a missed exam, provide a comparable le arning activity/assignment, or permit an extension of an assignment deadline, depending on attendance, examination, and/or assignment specifications, due to an extenuating circumstance as defined in the Excused Absence Policy. Absences must be reported (see Requesting an Excused Absence ) prior to the absence, scheduled exam, or assessment deadline unless due to sudden emergency or the student 's being incapacitated, in which case notifications are required upon resolution of the emergency or upon returning to class, whichever is sooner. Failure to submit documentation within this time frame will result in an Unexcused Absence. The Dean of Stude nts makes a determination as to whether the absence is excused, and the faculty at their discretion make s a determination as to the student's eligibility to receive a makeup exam or an extension on other classroom exercises, assignments, and assessments. Excused and Unexcused Absences To request an Excused Absence, students must complete the following. A bsence for presenting at a conference must be pre -approved by the program dean before completing the steps below : 1. The student must complete the Excused A bsence Request Form and, when applicable, provide medical, religious, or other supporting documentation to the Dean of Students ' Office. For non -acute illness, Examinations and Course Assignments Institutional Policies P a g e 29 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog medical documentation from a neutral (non- supervisory) qualified licensed health care profession al must accompany their Excused Absence Request Form. 2. Students must immediately notify the course faculty by email. Clinical clerkship faculty must be notified by phone. The Dean of Students will evaluate the submitted excused absence request along with supporting documentation to determine whether it conforms to the Sonoran University Excused Absence Policy. The Dean of Students will issue either an Excused or Unexcused Absence decision. This decision is communicated to the student, the course faculty , and the program dean within one business day. The faculty will then notify the student as to whether or not the Excused Absence permits them to take a rescheduled exam, receive an assignment deadline extension, or complete a comparable learning activity/as signment. The format of any rescheduled exam will be determined by the faculty member, subject to any ADA testing accommodations required by law. Special Examination Fee(s) apply for missed exams ( see Tuition and Fees). Requests to reschedule tests or receive an assignment deadline extension, or comparable learning activity /assignment for Unexcused Absences are solely at the discretion of the faculty member and will be refused if deemed not within the parameters of the assignment, activity, and/or cours e syllabus . Students who are not permitted to make up a missed examination or assignment and/or believe they were not provided fair treatment may utilize the College feedback or complaint procedures found in the Student Solution Center on MySonoran . Competency Examinations As part of the transfer credit evaluation process, s tudents may request to take a competency examination for select course transfer credit if a similar course has been completed more than seven ( 7) years prior to the start of the course . Due to complexity of scheduling and because it affects the student's schedule, c ompetency examinat ions must be requested and approved prior to matriculation. Competency e xams for all firs t-quarter courses must be completed prior to matriculation; all other competency exams for courses must be completed prior to the start of quarter two. Eligibility is determined on a case -by-case basis by the Registrar's Office, in conjunction with the faculty and the program dean. A syllabus of the previously completed course and other official documentation are required to determine eligibility. The competency examination applies only to the course requested and may not be used for another course. Students may request to take a competency exam by submitting a request to Admissions or the Registrar's Office. Students may attempt a competency examinatio n only once per approved course. If a student fails the competency examination, the student must enroll in the course. Course credit given through passing a competency examination may be reflected as transfer credit or grade of \"S\" Satisfactory on the tran script. Competency Examination Fee(s) apply ( see Tuition and Fees ). Clinical credits are not eligible for competency examinations. Sonoran University is committed to excellence in educational quality and learning outcomes by providing a supportive academic environment to students. To help Sonoran University and students identify if the student is making progress toward the completion of their degree, the university sets standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress . (SAP). Federal regulations require Sonoran University to establish specific standards for measuring SAP for students receiving financial aid, which includes a quantitative measure (credit hours completed) as well as a qualitative measure (grade point aver age). To meet Satisfactory Academic Progress at Sonoran University, students must : Successfully complete (earn) a cumulative number of required credits by the end of every calendar year (see Satisfactory Academic Progress for the prescribed program of stu dy). Maintain a minimum career GPA (see Satisfactory Academic Progress for the prescribed program of study ). Failure to maintain either of these requirements will result in a student being placed on academic probation and/or being academically dismissed (see Good Academic Standing for more information ). Grading Scale Policy Faculty members are required to provide students with a course syllabus that outlines course requirement s, including methods of evaluation that assess mastery of course content. Core courses in the ND program will be graded A/B/C/F ; clinical clerkships and lab/medicinary posts unsatisfactory (S/U). S/U gr aded courses have no effect on GPA and are noted in the course syllabus. Core courses in the MS program s are graded A/B/F . Some selectives are graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U). S/U graded courses have no effect on GPA and are noted in the course syllabus. Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress Institutional Policies P a g e 30 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog Please note, faculty are not required to round up grades to higher grade s irrespective of relative percentages. Faculty may also adjust a final letter grade depending on extenuating circumstances while maintain ing the academic integrity and learning objectives of the course. Grade Point Averages The Grade Point Average ( GPA ) for each quarter is calculated by multiplying the point value of the grade received (see the following table) by the number of credits for each course. To calculate the G PA, add the credits, then add the grade points and divide the total points by the total credits. The same principle applies to the cumulative GPA reflected on the transcript. If a course is repeated, all grades earned are used in determining the GPA. Grade s received at another institution are not included in the Sonoran University GPA . Grades specific to the Doctor of Naturopathic (ND) program are indicated next to the grade . Grades specific to the Master of Science (MS) program s are indicated next to the grade. Grade Description Points Percentage A Outstanding 4 90-100% B Very Good 3 80-89% C (ND) Average 2 70-79% F (ND) F (MS) Fail Fail 0 0 Less than 70% Less than 80% AU Audit Taken I Incomplete Additional work required I/R Incomplete/ Remediate Additional work required U (ND ) Unsatisfactory Fail/No earned T Transfer Graduate transfer WD Withdrew Withdrew WV Waived Requirements waived WIP Work in Progress Continuing course Grade of Fail, Unsatisfactory A grade of Fail (F)/Unsatisfactory (U) can seriously affect the student's academic progress and the student's eligibility for financial aid. A grade of U or F in a prerequisite for other courses precludes the student from entering those courses until the U/F has been rectified. In order to rectify the grade of U/F, the course must be repeated at the next available offering in the student's prescribed program of study, with the exception of selectives , Students on federal financial aid should be aware of funding eligibility for repeating a failed course. Please see Financial Aid Policy for Repeat Coursework on page 17. If a U/F is earned for the repeated cours e, the student will be academically dismissed. Both the original U/F and the grade given in the repeated course appear on the student's transcript. (See Academic Probation and Academic Dismissal for prescribed program of study.) Grade of Incomplete If a st udent is unable to complete a course, the student may request a grade of Incomplete \"I\" using the Incomplete Grade Request Form on My Sonoran . The student initiates the process by submitting the completed form to the course faculty, including supportive documentation. The Incomplete Request Form is to be completed collaboratively by the student and course faculty and serves to create a feasible course completion plan should the request be approved by the program dean. The faculty will itemize unfinished coursework and sign the form, indicating preliminary approval, only if the student meets all minimum course completion requirements to receive a Grade of Incomplete: 1. The Grade of Incomplete does not contradict the course requirements as outlined in the course syllabus or other published course documents; 2. The student either: a. Has completed at least 70% of the course duration, or b. Has no more than 30% of grades outstanding; 3. The student is passing the course at the date of submission of the Grade of I ncomplete request; 4. The request is submitted to the course faculty before the final week of the course; If approved by the course faculty, the program dean will ensure: 1. The presence of a legitimate circumstance (i.e., serious illness, bereavement, or anothe r unanticipated factor) beyond the student's control; 2. The course is not a repeat of a previously failed course; 3. Student is not on Probation II or Dismissal Appeal status. If approved, the program dean will notify the faculty and student. All work for the c ourse must be completed by the Friday following completion of the course. Students are responsible for meeting all stated requirements. Any failure to meet these requirements will result in the Incomplete grade reverting to the cumulative grade calculation , Institutional Policies P a g e 31 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog including all assessments - completed or not - at the end of the course. Incompletes for ND clinical clerkships will follow the Incomplete/Make -Up Policy and process outlined in the Sonoran University Clinical Handbook and do not require dean approval un less completion requires extension beyond the normal time period, as determined by clinical faculty. Students on documented medical or military leave must resolve their Incomplete grade within four academic quarters. If the Incomplete grade is not resolve d within four quarters, the Incomplete will be converted to the cumulative grade calculation, including all assessments - completed or not - at the end of the course. (See Medical Leave of Absence Policy or Military Leave of Absence Policy in the Course Ca talog.) Grade Reports Grade reports are available within two weeks of the end of the quarter for the prescribed program of study . Grades are considered a part of the student's educational record and will not be released to anyone other than the student or authorized school official or posted in any personally identifiable form. Grade reports are available upon request through the R egistrar's Office and online through MySonoran . Grade Appeal Procedures For courses taken in the College of Naturopathic Medicine , grade appeals must be initiated no later than the second Monday after the quarter has completed . For courses taken in the College of Nutrition , grade appeals must be initiated no later than the second Monday after the course has completed. Final grades a re posted to the Student Services, Academic Records section in My Sonoran . Grade appeals are only applicable for final course grades and will only be pursued if evidence and a valid basis are presented . The responsibility for presenting a case for appeal re sts with the student. Students should consider only the following evidence when initiating a grade appeal: Final grade included a miscalculation of the course grades or final exam /assignment .

Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. Naturopathic doctors cooperate with all other branches of medical science, ref erring patients to other practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate. Naturopathic doctors (NDs) are primary care physicians clinically trained in natural therapeutics with a philosophy derived in part from a Hippocratic teaching more than 2, 000 years old: vis medicatrix naturae \u2014nature is the healer of all diseases. Their practice is based on the same basic bio - medical science foundation as that of allopathic practice. However, their philosophies and approaches differ considerably from their conventional counterparts. Naturopathic doctors diagnose disease and treat patients by using natural modalities such as physical manipulation, clinical nutrition, herbal medicine, homeopathy, counseling, acupuncture, and hydrotherapy, among others. T hey choose treatments based on the individual patient, not based on the generality of symptoms. This approach has proven successful in treating both chronic and acute conditions. The precepts that guide the practice of naturopathic medicine include the Sev en Principles of Naturopathic Medicine, The Therapeutic Order, and The Components of Patient Centered Care. These seven principles guide the therapeutic methods and modalities of naturopathic medicine. First Do No Harm primum non no cere Naturopathic medicine uses therapies that are safe and effective. The Healing Power of Nature vis medicatrix naturae The human body possesses the inherent ability to restore health. The physician's role is to facilitate this process with the aid of n atural, nontoxic therapies. Discover and Treat the Cause, Not Just the Effect tolle causam Physicians seek and treat the underlying cause of a disease. Symptoms are viewed as expressions of the body's natural attempt to heal. The origin of disease is remov ed or treated so the patient can recover. Treat the Whole Person tolle totum The multiple factors in health and disease are considered while treating the whole person. Physicians provide flexible treatment programs to meet individual health care needs. The Physician Is a Teacher docere The physician's major role is to educate, empower, and motivate patients to take responsibility for their own health. Creating a healthy, cooperative relationship with the patient has a strong therapeutic value. Prevention Is the Best \"Cure\" praevenire Naturopathic physicians are preventive medicine specialists. Physicians assess patient risk factors and heredity susceptibility and intervene appropriately to reduce risk and prevent illness. Prevention of disease i s best accomplished through education and a lifestyle that supports health. Wellness Salus Establish or re -establish health and well -being. Re-establish the basis for health Remove obstacles to cure by establishing a healthy regimen Stimulate the healing power of nature Use various systems of health such as botanicals, homeopathy, Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine, nutrition, and mind -body medicine Tonify weakened systems Use modalities to strengthen the immune system, decrease toxicity, normalize inflammatory function, optimize metabolic function, balance regulatory systems, enhance regeneration, and harmonize life force Philosophy Naturopathic Principles Therapeutic Order ND Program Information P a g e 46 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog Correct structural integrity Use therapeutic exercise, spinal manipulation, and massage, cranial -sacral to return to optimal structural condition Prescribe specific natural substances for pathology Use vitamins, minerals, and herbs to return to and promote health Prescribe pharmacotherapy for pathology Use pharmaceutical drugs to return to and promote health Prescribe surgery, pharmacotherapy Use aggressive therapies to attempt to maintain health Taken from \"A Hierarchy of Healing: The Therapeutic Order\" Pamela and Stephen ND, BMed, PhD.

Fam Med 2002;34 (9):644 -5 At the ti me of this printing, 22 states, the District of Columbia, the U .S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U .S. Virgin Islands, and five Canadian provinces have licensing laws for naturopathic physicians. In these states naturopathic physicians are required to graduate from an approved four -year naturopathic medical school and pass extensive postdoctoral board examinations in order to receive a license. The North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE) administers and provides the Naturopathic Physician Licensing Examination (NPLEX) , which is comprised of biomedical science and clinical science examinations that are used in North America to license graduates of approved naturopathic medical schools. Once licensed, naturopathic physicians must practice wi thin a specific scope of practice defined by their state's law s and fulfill state -mandated continuing medical education requirements annually. It is the responsibility of the student/graduate to determine the licensure laws or scope of practice in the stat e in which they intend to practice. Naturopathic physicians practicing in the state of Arizona enjoy one of the broadest scopes of practice within the United States. The state of Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Medical Board (NPMB) regulates the practice o f naturopathic medicine in the state of Arizona. This includes applications and fees for students planning to enter clinical training and new graduates applying for licensure.

The Sonoran University Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Regenerative Medicine offer opportunities for students to work with a diverse group of medical practitioners including naturopathic physicians , medical doctor s, a Chinese medical doctor, and acupuncturists . Sonoran University is committed to providing students diverse clinical settings to deliver patient care. In addition to clinical clerkships at the Medical Center and Neil Riordan Center for Reg enerative Medicine , Sonoran University physicians and students provide care to underserved patient populations at a variety of community clinics. These clinics are staffed by faculty members who oversee both the students' education and the patients' care. The community clinics provide students access to a broad range of patient populations and disease conditions not regularly seen at the Sonoran University medical facilities (see Extended Sites Community Clinics ). The legal aspects of practicing naturopathic medicine vary by state in the U nited States and by province in Canada. In those states and provinces in which naturopathic physicians are licensed, NDs may see patients for general healthcare and for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions. Their scope of practice may include nutritional science; botanical medicine; naturopathic manipulative therapies and other physical medicine; acupuncture; homeopathy; mind -body medicine; natural childbirth; minor surgery ; prescriptive authority, including immunizations; and all methods of laboratory, x -ray, and clinical diagnoses. Practicing Without a License In Arizona, practicing naturopathic medicine without a license involves the diagnosis o r treatment of any patient by an unsupervised naturopathic medical student or any other unlicensed person where money may or may not be exchanged. Arizona Revised Statutes (ARS Title 32) defines practicing without a license as any conduct involving the una uthorized, intended, or perceived practice of any of the healing arts, including but not limited to the unauthorized practice of naturopathic medicine or other healing arts, regardless of whether the violation ultimately results in conviction or prosecutio n under relevant laws, and regardless of whether the violation results in any sanction or other formal or informal action by any administrative or regul atory body outside the College.

At times this requires the ability to be aware of and appropriately react to one's own immediate emotional responses. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and be able to function at a high level in the face of personal fatigue, dissatised patients and their families, and tired colleagues. Students must be able to develop pro fessional relationships with patients and their families, providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate while protecting patient condentiality. Students must be able to maintain professional conduct when interacting with patients and the families o f patients suffering from catastrophic illness, trauma, and death.

Once a sch edule is released, changes will be made only in the event of extreme circumstances. Intensive Courses An intensive course is offered in a shortened time period. Intensives may be scheduled as a 5 -day format or over a weekend, with classes beginning Friday evening and continuing Saturday and Sunday. Every effort is made to minimize the scheduling of required weekend intensives. Adding and Dropping Courses and Clinic Clerkships Academic Courses Sonoran University programs of study are track program s. Students on the 4 -year track seeking to move to the 5 -year track must receive approval from the Academic Policy and Progress Committee ( APPC ). In addition to the Institutional requirements for adding and dropping courses , schedule changes requested after the start of a quarter must also adhere to the following : Intensive courses may be added up until the first day of class but may not be dropped after the course has begun (some exceptions may apply). Tuition paid for intensive courses will not be refunded after the course has begun . Selectives may be dropped only during the add/drop period unless otherwise noted. Selectives may only be added up through week one of a quarter and in week two with the permission of the instructor (some exceptions may apply). Clinical C lerkships Clinical clerkships do not follow the same add/drop policy as didactic courses noted above ; clinical students must refer to the Clinical Handbook regarding policy for adding and dropping clerkships ( see Add/Drop Refund Policy) . An add/drop fee will be charged for any clerkship changes after the clinic add/drop period has ended (see Tuition and Fees). Students are not able to drop clerkships after the clinical add/drop period without approval from the APPC. Students awaiting decision s are required to attend assigned clerkships and meet current clinic policies until otherwise notified in writing. NPLEX Board Examinations The licensing of naturopathic physicians to practice medicine is a function of an individual state or province. The states and provinces that license naturopathic physicians recognize the North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners (NABNE), which certifies candidates as eligible to register for the licensing exam that is administered as the Naturopathic Physicians L icensure Examination (NPLEX). It is the student's responsibility to be familiar with NABNE and NPLEX policies and procedures. Sonoran University considers the NPLEX Parts I and II to be significant measures of professional achievement toward becoming a nat uropathic physician. Student performance on the NPLEX provides the faculty and administration an external measure of the level of understanding students have in a broad number of subject areas. This performance offers Sonoran University important informati on on curricular content and teaching methodolog ies. Student scores also provide Sonoran University and the patients they see with a level of assurance that they can perform with basic competency as student physicians. To qualify for the NPLEX Part I, students must have satisfactorily completed all basic science coursework, including GNMD 6044, be currently enrolled or on an approved leave of absence, and be certified by the Registrar's Office as eligible to sit for the exam. NPLEX Part I Students are requi red to take NPLEX Part I to be eligible to participate in the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine clinical training program. Students must take the NPLEX Part I at the first offering of the exam immediately following their 8th quarter in the 4 -year P rogram of Study ( POS ) and 12th quarter in the 5 -year POS or completion of the basic science courses, including GNMD 6044, whichever comes first. Students who do not pass NPLEX Part I must take it again at the next offering. Students who do not take NPLEX I at the ne xt offering will be dropped from the following quarter's clinical clerkships and may not be allowed to continue in clinical clerkships until they have taken NPLEX I. In order to register for future clinical clerkships, all students must submit the original examination results from NABNE to the Registrar's Office each time it is taken. Appeals to any part of this process follow the normal Sonoran University complaint procedures . This policy applies to all ND students, including professional transfer students . ND Academic Policies P a g e 58 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog NPLEX Part II Passing NPLEX Part II examination is not a graduation requirement of Sonoran University , but it is required to become licensed. Students should be aware that NABNE may modify its policies and procedures at any time. It is the student's res ponsibility to be aware of NABNE/NPLEX policies and procedures. Satisfactory Academic Progress - Completion The ND program is designed to be completed in four calendar years or 15 academic quarters (five calendar years or 19 academic quarters for the 5 -year track). Students who deviate from the standard academic program will extend the length of the program. Satisfactory academic progress in the ND program is defined as passing all program requirements within the maximum timeframe of one and one -half (1.5) times the length of the longest published program in which they are enrolled, from initial date of matriculation and including any and all leaves of absence and periods of withdrawal followed by re - activation. Generally, this is between 6 -7.5 years. Credit s transferred from an approved institution count toward the minimum academic requirements to be completed at the end of each academic year (see Minimum Academic Requirements) and count toward the maximum completion time for financial aid.

ND Academic Coursework P a g e 61 | 2022-2023 Course Catalog ND Academic Coursework The Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program at Sonoran University is a cohort -based program that follows a prescribed track. All academic credit is computed in quarter hours (see Credit Equivalence ). All students are guided by the curriculum as outlined in their prescribed program of study. Students are pre -registered f or core courses, including labs and clinical clerkships. Students may not deviate from their prescribed program of study. Sonoran University reserves the right to make curriculum changes that are applicable to all students, if necessary. Students are admitted to either a 4 - or 5-year track program. The 4 -year track offers students a traditional path to graduation. The 5 -year track offers support for students who may want more time to complete the basic and pre - clinical sciences by distribut ing the firs t year of basic sciences and pre -clinical medicine courses across two years. The remaining 3 years of both the 4 - and 5 -year tracks of the ND curriculum are the same. Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress on the 4 -year track may be tra nsitioned into the 5 -year track. Students cannot move to the 5 -year track after completion of year 1 of the 4 -year track. In addition , students cannot move back to the 4 -year track after starting the 5 -year track without approval from the Academic Policy a nd Progress Committee ( APPC ). If a student stays on track with the program, taking all courses as they are offered in sequence, students can expect to graduate within 15 consecutive quarters, or four calendar years, if on the 4 -year track (or 19 consecutiv e quarters , or five calendar years, if on the 5 -year track). After matriculation, approval by APPC is required for track changes. For a detailed list of required courses, see the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Program of Study . The first calendar year begins with the basic medical science curriculum in the study of biochemistry and normal structures and functions of the body, including anatomy and physiology.

To educate and inspire the next generation of leaders and practitioners in the field of clinical nutrition to use evidence - based practices to safely, ethically, and effectively enhance the health and well -being of the people and communities they serve. Requirements for the practice of nutrition vary from state to state (and country to country), with a wide range of certification types available. Currently, the state of Arizona has no regulation for Dietetics and Nutrition practice. There is currently no licensure law in this state outlining restrictions and/or regulations for the field of nutrition. Graduates of the MSCN program may wish to work as clinicians in private or integrative practice s ettings , while others may wish to work as consultants, writers, educators, or business leaders in the food, supplement, or natural products industry. Others may opt to go on to earn a PhD or a clinical doctoral degree.

According to the American Nutrition Association , as of June 2022 , eleven states require a Registered Dietitian (RD) credential to practice an d be licensed / registered to practice nutrition and currently do not offer a pathway to licensure for non -dietitian nutritionists. Four states require licensing to perform individualized nutrition counseling and provide a pathway to licensure for Certified Nutrition Specialists (CNS )s, RDs, and other advanced nutritionists. Thirty -five states allow the practice of individualized nutrition counseling without licensure, though some of these states offer licensing or state certification to RDs, CNS s, and other advanced nutritionists to perform medical nutrition therapy. For current updates on state laws , we recommend visiting the American Nutrition Association's website at https://theana.org/advocate .
