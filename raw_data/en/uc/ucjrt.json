I integrate and draw upon this extensive knowledge and clinical toolkit every day in my practice. As the clinic Director, I am hugely passionate about the role of [Integrative Medicine](/integrative-medicine) and [Precision Health](/precision-health) in regaining and maintaining our health and wellbeing. My passion lies in combining my extensive scientific and medical understanding with a whole person approach and creating a precisely tailored health plan drawing on a broad range of therapeutic interventions that are aimed at tackling root causes, not just plastering over symptoms. I believe that our current healthcare system, while often life-saving, is not life-optimising, and is rarely able to deliver whole person care for prevention and management of complex, chronic disease. As a doctor providing integrative, personalised care to support people with cancer and other complex illness, I see the transformative impact of this approach on personal resilience, quality of life and clinical outcomes every day. Alongside clinical work, I also teach medical and nutrition professionals in [integrative medicine and integrative cancer care ](https://www.drninafullershavel.com)and engage in academic work and research focusing on precision cancer medicine and broader personalised and integrative approaches, including my current MSc in Precision Cancer Medicine and PG Dip in Health Research at the University of Oxford. I am a Fellow of the College of Medicine, Fellow of BANT (British Association for Nutrition and Lifestyle Medicine) and Fellow of RSA (Royal Society of Arts), and I regularly present and review research for national and international conferences and contribute to guideline development. Areas of special interest: Integrative cancer support, mainly for breast cancer and gynaecological cancers but also other solid tumours - please note that I am an integrative medicine doctor, not an oncologist, and I would always aim to work with your extended medical team to provide supportive care I have a particular interest in marrying precision oncology approaches with integrative medicine to rationally design comprehensive collaborative care plans Integrative support for complex and chronic cases, particularly in women's health (this usually involves chronic gut problems, autoimmune disease, hormone-related symptoms and mental health and wellbeing or a combination of all of the above) Please note that I am not currently taking on any new cases, and my waiting list is closed due to high demand. Members of our [nutrition team](/nutrition) can start helping you in the meantime and may be able to refer internally later on according to availability, please [contact the clinic](/contact) for further details. For women's health enquiries, please see [Dr Amy Shacaluga](/dr-amy-shacaluga)'s profile. We work closely together as a team, marrying my extensive experience in integrative medicine with her deep working knowledge of obstetrics and gynaecology and qualifications in lifestyle and functional medicine. Professional positions and international engagement I am the outgoing Co-Chair of [BSIO](https://www.bsio.org.uk) (British Society for Integrative Oncology, 2021-2023), now co-chairing the BSIO Clinical Practice and Education Committee with Dr Penny Kechagioglou. I am a member of the Editorial Board for the Nutritional Medicine Journal (NMJ) and the new International Journal of Integrative Oncology (IJIO), as well as being a member of several SIO (Society for Integrative Oncology) SIGs (special interest groups), including yoga and acupuncture.
