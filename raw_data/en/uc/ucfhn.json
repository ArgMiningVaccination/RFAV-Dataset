CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASEREQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/ 25/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 1 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill? Transmissibility - How does it spread from one host to another? How easily is it spread? Host Range - How many species does it infect? Can it transfer from species t o species? What do we know ? The human infectious dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is unknown by all exposure routes. SARS -CoV-2 is the cause of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID -19). A total dose of approximately 700,000 pl aque - forming units (PFU) of the novel coronavirus SARS - CoV-2 was sufficient to infect cynomolgus macaques via a combination intranasal and intratracheal exposure (106 TCID 50 total dose).122 Macaques did not exhibit clinical symptoms, though viral shedding occurred (nose and throat).122 Rhesus macaques are effectively infected with SARS - CoV-2 via the oc ular conjunctival and intratracheal route at a dose of approximately 700,000 PFU (106 TCID 50).57 Initial experiment s suggest that SARS -CoV-2 can infect genetically modified mic e containing the human ACE2 cell entry receptor. Infection via the intranasal route (dose: 105 TCID 50, approximately 70,000 PFU) causes light infection, however no virus was isolated from infecte d animals, and PCR primers used in the study do not align wel l with SARS -CoV-2, casting doubt on this study.15 The infectious dose for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 ( SARS ) in mice is estimated to be between 67 -540 PFU (average 240 PFU, intranasal route).55-56 Genetically modified mice exposed intranasally to doses of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS) virus between 100 and 500,000 PFU show signs of infection. Infection with higher doses result in se vere syndromes.7, 46, 86, 161SARS -CoV-2 is passed easily between humans, likely through close contact with relatively large droplets and possibly through smaller aerosolized particles. Pandemic COVID -19 has caus ed 468,523 infections and 21,192 deaths77 in at least 173 co untries and territories ( as of 3/ 25/202 0).30, 127, 147 There are 66,132 SARS -CoV-2 cases across 50 US states, with 947 deaths. ( as of 3/ 25/2020 )77; there is sustained communit y transmission of COVID -19 in the US.18 High -quality estimates of human transmissibility (R 0) range from 2.2 to 3.1100, 109, 119, 153, 160 SARS -CoV-2 is believed to spread thro ugh close contact and droplet transmission,34 with fomite transmission78 and close so plausible.23, 67 SARS -CoV-2 replicates in the upper respiratory t ract (e.g., throat), and infectious virus is detectable in throat and lung tissue for at least 8 days.149 SARS-CoV-2 is present in infected patient saliva,137 lower respiratory sputum,143 and feces.90 Aerosolized virus has been detected in COVID -19 patient rooms, with particle sizes within the human respirable range (0.25 - 2.5 m).96 Individuals can transmit SARS -CoV-2 to others before they have symptoms. Pre-symptomatic163 or asymptomatic13 patients can transmit SARS -CoV-2; between 12%60 and 23%95 of infections may be caused by asymptomatic or pre - symptomatic transmission. Undetected cases play a major role in transmission. Models suggest u p to 86% of early COVID -19 cases in China were und etected , and these infections were the source for 79% of reported cases.88 Behavior changes may limit spread. Social distancing and other policies are estimated to have reduced COVID -19 spread by 44% in Hong Kong .52 Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., school closures, iso lation) are likely required to limit transmission.64SARS -CoV-2 is closely related to other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal h ost before infecting humans; the identi ty of the SARS -CoV-2 intermediate host is unknown. Early genomic analysis indicates similarity to SARS,166 with a suggested bat origin.5,47, 166 Anal ysis of SARS -CoV-2 genomes suggests that a non-bat intermediate species is responsible for the beginning of the outbreak.121 The identity of the intermediate host remains unknown.89, 92 -93 Positive samples from the South China Seafood Market strongly suggests a wildlife source,36 though it is possible that the virus was circulating in humans before the disease was associate d with the seafood market.19, 48, 155, 159 SARS -CoV-2 uses the same receptor for cell entry as the SARS coronavirus that circulated in 2002/2003. Experiments suggest that SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) receptor -binding domai n binds the human cell receptor (ACE2) stronger than SARS,152 potentially explaining its high trans missibility; the same work suggests that differences between SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV Spike prot eins may limit the therapeutic ability of SARS antibody treatments.152 Modeling between SARS -CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 proteins suggests that SARS -CoV-2 can bind and infect human, bat, civet, monkey and swine cells.141 There is currently no evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infects domestic animals or livestock.REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/25/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 2 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Infectious Dose - How much agent will make a healthy individual ill?

What are the mutations in SARS -CoV-2 that allowed human infection and transmission? What animals can SARS -CoV-2 infect (e.g., pet dogs, potential wildlife reservoirs)?REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/25/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 3 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear? Are people infectious during this time? Clinical Presentation - What are the signs and symptoms of an infected person? Clinical Diagnosis - Are there tools to diagnose infected individuals? When during infection are they effective? What do we know? The majority of individuals develop symptom s within 14 days of exposure. For most people, it takes at least 2 days to develop symptoms, and on average symptoms develop 5 days after exposure. Some individuals never develop symptoms, but can still transmit disease. The best current estimate of the CO VID-19 incubation period is 5.1 days, with 99% of individuals exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of exposure.84 Fewer than 2.5% of infected individuals show symptoms sooner than 2 days after exposure.84 The reported range of incub ation periods is wide, with high -end estimates of 24,68 11.3,12 and 18 days.87 Individuals can test positive for COVID -19 despite lacking clinical symptoms.13, 38, 68, 133, 163 Individuals can be infectious while asymptomatic ,34, 123, 133, 163 and asymptomati c individuals can have similar amounts of virus in their nose and throat as symptomatic individuals .167 Infectious period is unknown, but possibly up to 10 - 14 days 5, 88, 127 On average, there are approximately 460 to 7.587 days between symptom onset in successive cases of a single transmission chain. Most individuals are admitted to the hospital within 8-14 days of symptom onset.165 Currently, there is no evidence that recovered patients can be reinfected with SARS -CoV-2. Experimentally infected macaques were not capable of being reinfected after their primary infect ion resolved.14 According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re - infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.83 Patients are positive for COVID -19 via PCR for 8 -37 days after symptom onset.165 Individuals may test posi tive via PCR for 5 -13 days after symptom recovery and hospital discharge.82 The ability of these individuals to infec t others is unknown. According to the WHO, there is no evidence of re - infection with SARS -CoV-2 after recovery.83 Most COVID -19 cases are mild, but severe disease can be found in any age group. Older individuals and those with underlyi ng medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death. The majority of COVID -19 cases are mild (81%, N = 44,000 cases)133 Initial COVID -19 symptoms include fever (87.9% overall, but only 44% - 52% present with fever initially11, 68), cough (67.7%68), fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, reduction in lymphocyte count.35, 41, 73 Heada che40 and diarrhea are uncommon ,73, 87 though lack of appetite may be an early symptom.107 Complications include acute respiratory distress (ARDS observed in 17 -29% of hospitalized patients,44, 73 which leads to death in 4 -15% of cases44, 73, 142), pneumonia,106 cardiac injury, seco ndary infection, kidney failure, arrhythmia, sepsis, and shock.68,73,142,165 Approximately 15% of hospitalized patients were classified as severe,68, 133 and approx imately 5% of patients were admitted to the ICU.68, 133 Most deaths are caused by respiratory failure or respiratory failure combined with myocardial (heart) damage.124 The case fatality rate (CFR ) depends on comorbidities; cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and respiratory conditions all increase the CFR.133, 165 The CFR increases with age; individuals olde r than 60 are at higher risk of death,133, 165 and >60% of confirmed fatalities have been male.133 Children of all ages are susceptible to COVID -19,59 though generally pr esent with milder symptoms42, 98 or no symptoms at all.98 Severe symptoms in children, however, are possible.94 In the US, 34% of hospitalizations have been individuals less than 44 yea rs old.4 Variation in the CFR among countries may be due to demographics, testing criteria, and how COVID -19 relate d deaths are defined.104 Based on one patient, a productive immune response is generated and sustained for at least 7 days.134 Diagnosis relies o n identifying the gen etic signature of the virus in patient nose, throat, or sputum samples. These tests are relatively accurate, but testing rates in the US are low compared to other countries. As a result, confirmed cases are underreported. PCR protocols and primers have bee n widely shared among international researchers.29, 50, 87, 129, 144, 148 PCR-based diagnostic assays are unable to differentiate between active and inactive virus. A combination of pharyngeal (throat) RT -PCR and chest tomography are the most effective diagnostic criteria (correctly diagnosing 91.9% of infections).116 Single throat swabs alone detect 78.2% of true infections, while duplicate tests identify 86.2% of infections.116 Nasal and pharyngeal swabs may be less effective as diagnostic specimens than sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.143 RT-PCR tests are able to asymptomatic cases; SARS -CoV-2 infection was identified in 2/11 4 individuals previously cleared by clinical assessment.72 Combination RT -PCR and serology (antibody) testing may incr ease the ability to diagnose patients with mild symptoms, or identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.162 The FDA released an Emergency Use Authorization enabling laboratories to develop and use tests in - house for patient diagnosis .63 Updated tests from the US CDC are av ailable to states.29, 34 US CDC has expanded patient testing criteria to include symptomatic patient s at clinician discretion.17 Several rapid or real -time te st kits have been produced by universities and industry, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology,53 BGI,21 and Cepheid.140 The US CDC is developing serological tests t o determine what proportion of the population has been exposed to SARS -CoV-2.79 Machine learning tools are being developed to predict severe and fatal COVID -19 cases based on CT scans.130 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/25/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 4 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Incubation Period - How long after infection do symptoms appear?

Vaccines? Environmental Stability - How long does the agent live in the environment? Decontami nation - What are effective methods to kill the agent in the environment? What do we know? Treatment for COVID -19 is primarily supportive care including ventilation if necessary.68, 101 A number of therapeutic tri als are ongoing, but results are preliminary.20 Preliminary reports from several clinical trials in China suggest that favipiravir improves lung func tion and reduces recovery ti me in COVID -19 patients.43 Early results suggest that t ocilizumab may be effective at treating severe COVID -19 cases.156 Some evidence suggest s that chloroquine is effective at redu cing symptom duration .1, 65 Hydroxychloroquine in combinat ion with azithromycin may reduce viral load in patients compared to controls.66 Combinatio n lopinavir and ritonavir with standar d care was no more effective than standard care alone.25 JHU is pursuing an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval to provide passive antibody therapy (convalescent serum) to patients ,27 and Takeda Pharma (Japan) is working to create treatments based on patient plasma .69 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be effective at inhibiting deterioration whe n given at the appropriate time in severe cases. 26 Corticosteroids are commonly given to COVID -19 patients165 at risk of ARDS,157 but their us e is not recommended by the US CDC.32 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has developed potential SARS -CoV-2 antibody therapies.110 The development of a coronavirus fusion inhibitor in the lab suggests efficacy across multiple human coronaviruses.154 Work is ongoing to develop a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine in human and animal trials. No preliminary results are available. Multiple entities are working to produce a SARS - CoV-2 vaccine,8 including N IH/NIAID,70, 85 Moderna Therapeu Sciences,2-3, 103 and Sanofi with HHS.22 Moderna has begun phase 1 clinical vaccine tr ials in humans in WA state.120 CEPI has partnered with multiple entities to develop vaccines including Univ ersity of Oxford, Novavax Hong Kong University, and the Institut Pasteur. SARS -CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for at least 3 days depending on conditions. If ae rosolized, SARS -CoV-2 is stable for at least several hours. The seasonality of COVID -19 transmission is unknown. SARS -CoV-2 Data SARS -CoV-2 can persist on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to 3 days (at 21 -23oC, 40% RH), with a half-life of 13 -16 hours.138 SARS -CoV-2 has an aerosol half -life of 2.7 hours (particles <5 m, tested at 21 -23oC and 65% RH).138 SARS -CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) was detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic cruise ship passenger rooms up to 17 days after cabins were vacated; the infectiousness of this material is not known.102 Surrogate Coronavirus data : Studies sugge st that other coronaviruses can survive on non -porous surfaces up to 9 -10 days (MHV, SARS - CoV)28, 39, and porous surfaces for up to 3 -5 days (SARS -CoV)62 in air conditioned environments (20 - 25oC, 40 -50% RH ). Coronavirus survival tends to b e higher at lower temperatures and lower rela tive humidity (RH),28, 39, 113, 139 though infectious virus can persist on surfaces for several days in typical o ffice or hospital conditions139 SARS can persist with trace infectivity for up to 28 days at refrigerated temperatures (4oC) on surfaces.28 No strong evidence exists showing reduction in transmission with seasonal increase in temperature and humidity.99 One hour after aerosolization approximately 63% of airborne MERS virus remained viable in a simulated office environment (25oC, 75% RH)111 The aerosol survival of related human coronavirus (229E) was relatively high, (half -life of ~67 hours at 20oC and 50% RH), indicating ~20% of infectious virus remained after 6 days.75 Porous hospital materials, including paper and cotton cloth, maintain infectious SARS -CoV for a shorter t ime than non -porous material.81 Soap and water , as we ll as common alcohol and chlorine -based cleaners, hand sanitizers, and disinfectants are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2 on hands and surfaces. SARS -CoV-2 Twice -daily cleaning with sodium dichloroisocyanurate decontaminated surfaces in COVID -19 patien t hospital rooms.105 Alcohol -based hand rubs are effective at inactivating SARS -CoV-2.80 EPA has released a list of SARS -CoV-2 disinfectants, but solutions were not tested on live virus.6 Other Coronaviruses Chlorine -based146 and ethanol -based49 solutions are recommended. Heat treatment at 56oC is sufficient to kill coronaviruses,113, 164 though effectiveness depends in part on amount of protein in contaminate d media .113 70% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, sodium hypochlorite [bleach, 200 ppm], and UV radiation are effective at inactivating several coronaviruses (MHV and CCV ).125 Ethanol -based biocides are effect ive disinfectants against coronaviruses dried on surfaces, including ethanol containing gels similar to hand sanitizer.74, 150 Surface spray disinfectants such as Mikrobac, Dismozon , and Korsolex are effective at reducing infectiv ity of the closely related SARS -CoV after 30 minutes of contact.112 Coronaviruses may be resistant to thermal inactivation for up to 7 days when stabilized in stool.135-136 Additionally, coronaviruses are more stable in matrixes such as respiratory sputum.61 Hydrogen peroxide vapor was found to be effective with repeated decontamination of N95 respirators.118 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/25/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 6 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Medical Treatment - Are there effective treatments?

Forensics - Natural vs in tentional use? Tests to be used for attribution. Genomics - How does the disease agent compare to previous strains? What do we know? The effectiveness of PPE for SARS -CoV-2 is currently unknown, and data from other related coronaviruses are used for guida nce. Healthcare workers are at high risk of acquiring COVID -19, even with recommended PPE. Healthcare worker illnesses (over 1,000133) demonstrates human -to-human transmission despite isolation, PPE, and infection control.126 Risk of transmission to healthcare workers appears high, with up to 20% of healthcare workers in Lombardy, Italy be coming infected.115 US CDC does not recommend the use of facemasks for healthy people. Facemasks should be used by people showing symptoms to reduce the risk of others g etting infected. The use of facemasks is crucial for health workers and people in close contact with infected patients (at home or in a health c are facility).31 \"Healthcare personnel entering the room [of SA RS- CoV-2 patients] should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye prote ction (e.g., goggles or a face shield)\"33 WHO indicates healthcare workers should wear clean long -sleeve as well as gloves.145 Respirators (NIOSH -certified N95, EUFFP2 or equivalent) those dealing with possible aerosols146 Addit ional protection, such as a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) with a full hood, should be considered for high -risk procedures (i.e., intubation, ventilation)24 Particular attention should be pa id to the possibility of transmission via exhaled air during supportive respiratory procedures.67 Despite extensive environmental contamination, air sampling in patient rooms did not detect SARS -CoV- 2 RNA105 (but detected RNA in other rooms 96) The efficacy of \"ho mema de\" PPE, made with T - shirts, bandanas, similar materials, i s less than standard PPE, but may be used if no other options are available.45, 54, 1 17 All current evidence supports the natural emergence of SARS -CoV-2 via a bat and possible intermediate mammal species. Genomic analysis places SARS -CoV-2 into the beta - coronavirus clade, with close relationship to bat viruses. The SARS -CoV-2 virus is distinct from SARS and MERS viruses.58 Genomic an alysis suggest that SAR S-CoV-2 is a natural variant, and is therefore unlikely to be human -derived or otherwise created by \"recombination\" with other circulating strains of coronavirus.9, 166 Some genomic evidence indicates a close relat ionship with pangolin coronaviruses151; data suggests that pangolins may be a natural host for beta -coronaviruses 92-93. Additional research is needed. Genomic data support at least two plausible ori gins of SARS -CoV-2: \"(i) natural selection in a non -human animal host prior to zoonotic transfer, and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\"9 Either scenario is consistent the obser ved genetic changes found in all known SARS -CoV-2 isolates. Additionally, \"[...] SARS -CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone,\" reducing the likelihood of laboratory origination,9 and \"[ ...] genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS -CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, [though] it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin.\"9 Current evidence sugg ests that SARS -CoV-2 accumulates mutations at a similar rate as other coronaviruses. Mut ations and deletions in specific portions of the SARS -CoV-2 genome have not been linked to any changes in transmission or disease severity. There have been no document ed cases of SARS -CoV- 2 prior to December 2019 Preliminary genomic analyses, however, suggest that the first human cases of SARS -CoV-2 emerged between 10/19/2019 - 12/17/2019.10, 19, 114 The mutation rate of SARS -CoV-2 is estimated to be similar to other RNA viruses (e.g., SARS, Ebola, Zika), and is currently calculated to be 1.04x10-3 substi tutions per site per year (N = 116 genomes).71 Preliminary phylogenetic analysis identified a very close genetic similar ity between SARS -CoV-2 and a Bat coronavirus (RaTG13) isolated from Yunnan Province, China; suggesting that SARS -CoV-2 originated f rom bats.108 Pangolin coronaviruses are closely related to both SARS -CoV-2 and the closely related Bat coronavirus (RaTG13); phylogeneti c analysis suggested that SARS -CoV-2 is of bat origin, but is closely related to pangolin coronavirus.92-93 The Spike protein of SARS -CoV-2, which mediates entry into host cells and is th e major determinant of host range, is very similar to the Spike protein of SARS -CoV.97 The rest of the genome is more closely related to two se parate bat 97 and pangolin93 coronavirus. Analysis of SARS -CoV-2 sequences from Singapore has identified a large nucleotide (382 bp) deletion in ORF-8 that may result in an attenuated (less virulent) phenotype.131 REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR EFFECTIVE INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAK RESPONSE SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) Updated 3/25/2020 CLEARED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE 8 SARS -CoV-2 (COVID -19) PPE - What PPE is effective, and who should be using it?
