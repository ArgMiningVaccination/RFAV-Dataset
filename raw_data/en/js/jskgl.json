Abstract High dose vitamin A (HDVA) concentrate began to be distributed in India in 1970 as a short -term, stop -gap approach to reduce clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency. As this problem declined globally, the purpose of distributing them changed to the reduction of young child mortality. However, their impact on this has also declined, if not disappeared, as suggested in India by the enormous DEVTA study. This may be because of im proved protection against and treatment of the main morbidity involved, measles and diarrhea. At the same time, semi - annual provision of mega -doses of vitamin A is not without risks, in particular linked to children's vaccination status. While a single dos e is inexpensive, large -scale implementation of HDVA programs is expensive, particularly the opportunity cost involved in reducing the time health workers involved have to deal with their other commitments. Balancing potential benefits, risks and costs leads us to recommend an immediate cessation of the distribution of HDVA in India. Keywords: vitamin A; India; high -dose vitamin A; vitamin A deficiency 3 Why and how national universal vitamin A supplementation programs began The distribution of high dose vitamin A ( HDVA ) as a concentrate began in India at a sub -national scale in 1970. It was considered to be a stop- gap short -term measure to reduce clinical vitamin A deficiency (VAD) until longer term measures could be put into place. While levels of s ubclinical VAD , estimated from local or sub -regional serum retinol (SR) surveys, suggest high VAD prevalence in much of India, clinical signs have declined to relatively low levels. [1] The results of the ongoing Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey are expected to provide fresh estimates of SR levels soon. While it is widely assumed that HDVA can reduce subclinical VAD as defined by low SR, this is not the case ( [2], Appendix 1). See Appendix 1 in reference 2. The rise in SR resulting from 6 -monthly HDVA is small (by a few mcg/dl, about 10- 20% of baseline) and transient, lasting only for 1- 3 months. [3]; [4]Thus semi -annual HDVA distribution has no cumulative impact on SR levels . Even if HDVA is provided at high coverage levels for decades, there will be no change in community prevalence of low SR unless some other factors are involved such as improved dietary diversity or quality . Indeed, HDVA distribution is the only common intervention against VAD not able to increase SR . Good maternal, infant and young child feeding practices and prevention of infections, on the other hand, are fund amental to increasing SR , and should be the focus of preventive programs. [5] Globally, the purpose for HDVA distribution changed after a series of randomized trials conducted in the 1980s and early 19 90s. [6]; [7] These trials suggested that HDVA had a substantial impact on the under -five mortality rate (U5MR), being associated on meta -analysis with 23% reduction in all -cause mortality. [6] In response, to reduce all -cause mortality , it became a long -standing WHO recommendation to provide HDVA (200,000 IU or 66,000 mcg ) to semi -annually in countries with VAD. [8] It was recommended to integrate HDVA with the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), providing HDVA at vaccination contacts after 6 months of age. Many countries also , or instead , utilized biannual national campaigns to deliver HDVA , often together with oral polio vaccine or missing vaccines . Based on this recommendation , a total of some 8 billion HDVA have been distributed, and around 200 million children in 103 LMICs receive at least one dose per year. [9] Is mega -dose vitamin A supplementation likely to reduce young child mortality if implemented now in India? The reason for th e apparent mortality -reducing effect of HDVA has never been adequately explained. It was observed that the effect of HDVA was not associated with the deg ree of underlying VAD, indicating that the effect on mortality was not mediated via an effect on VAD. [6]; [7]; [10]; [11] Studies searching for the expected and logical impact of HDVA on morbidity have failed to find any , including in Tamil Nadu, where HDVA vs placebo was given every four months . [12] Two questions need to be asked before assuming India would benefit from such a mortality reduction if semi -annual HDVA distribution were implemented today: 1. Why, if HDVA has such a large impact on mortality, did three of the initial trials fail to find any impact at all? (O ne trial in Sudan [13] , one in Hyderabad [14], and another in Haiti, [15] ). One likely explanation is that measles, the only disease in which vitamin A deficiency has been shown to be closely linked to mortality in a randomized trial, [16] travels in epidemics. After ravaging unvaccinated young children in a given location, it is quiet for some time b ecause the majority of susceptible people are immune. Thus , some trials during the early years when measles vaccination coverage was low may have taken place at times when measles was largely absent from the communities involved in HDVA trials. Another fa ctor which may have played a role was the roll out of the EPI - in a reanalysis of one of the trials which showed a beneficial effect of HDVA on mortality, the Ghana VAST, the mortality reducing effect was only seen in the 43% of children who did not have a vaccination card, not in 57% children with a vaccination card . [17] In females who ha d received measles vaccine, but who were missing one or more doses of diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis ( DTP )-containing vaccine and likely got them shortly after , receiving 4 HDVA versus placebo was associated 95% CI: 41% -380%) higher mortality , an effect which was significantly different from the effect in males . [17] Subsequent studies have also supported that the effect of HDVA may differ by vaccination status in males and females and may at times be negative (reviewed in [11] ). 2. Why is the impact of HDVA on young child mortality declining over time? Mason et al (Figure 2 in reference 2) [2, Figure 2] illustrate how its apparent protective effect has declined over time, reaching close to zero at the time of the DEVTA trail in Utta r Pradesh, by far the largest such trial ever conducted, with a sample size of over one million children. [18] Another recent trial that showed no impact, conducted in Guinea -Bissau, [19] was the first individually -randomized trial of HDVA provided at vaccination contacts as recommended by WHO. [8] Others have also reported on this diminishing effect . [20]; [21] The effect of HDVA s has been explained not only through reducing mortality from measles , [16] but also diarrhea has now been substantially controlled by immunization - measles mortal ity fell by an estimated 74% in 2000- 7. [25] Measles vaccination coverage in India had climbed to above 55% by 1999 and above 70% by 2013. [26] National DHS surveys have found that 35% of children under five had received all 8 vaccines in 1992 -3 and this had increased to 62% by 2025- 6. (https://www.statcompiler.com/en/) Diarrhea deaths are much reduced. [27] DHS surveys in India indicate that in 2005 -6, only 26% of children with diarrhea had received home fluids during the past 5 years, and this increased to 57% in 2015 -6. (https://www.statcompiler.com/en/) The potential effect of HDVA may have also diminished with the improvement in underlying U5MR from better living conditions and improved nutrition. Another explanatory factor may be the link with vaccinations. A s indicated above, in a reanalysis of one of the original trials the effect of HDV A differed by vaccination status, and may be negative in subgroups, such as females who receive DTP vaccine; this may have counteracted beneficial effects of HDVA in other subgroups . [11] In any event, calculations by Mason et al [2] and those of Stevens et al [20] suggest that today only about 2% of the overall U5MR would be reduced in LMICs, even if HDVA were currently effective. In India, the difference between the U5MR and IMR is only 9/1000 live births . [28] Though this is a slight under -estimate because HDVA may be given before 12 mo of age, it does suggest that very few deaths c ould be avoided even if HDVA were implemented with a high level of coverage and if it actually w ere efficacious. On this basis alone, the role of HDVA should be questioned. In addition, HDVA programs are not as inexpensive as is commonly claimed (based on the low cost of a single dose). High coverage throughout early childhood cannot be attained via routine distribution of HDVA through primary health care services. The opportunity cost of distributing HDVA through national campaigns such as Child Health Days is not small. Health personnel need to be withdrawn from their normal duties, with increased risk to their usual populatio n served. Three studies have documented this, in one case noting that it is the weakest health systems that are the most affected. [29] ; [30]; [31] Can HDVA do harm? SR is quite readily increased (for all ages) by regular vitamin A in physiological doses (the only dose considered safe for women of reproductive age). [8]; [2] But when the dose of vitamin A is as high as 200,000 IUs ( over 2 00 times daily allowance), the liver may not be able to store it in such quantities, and the excess is broken up and excreted; [32] and vitamin A, if no t stored or tightly bound (as with retinol binding protein), can be toxic to cells. A number of studies in Zambia suggest hypervitaminosis A is occurring, and Guatemala scaled back its vitamin A 5 fortification levels due to similar concerns . [33] Kapil and Sareen [28] have summarized some of the other concerns about the possible side effects of HDVA , including increased respiratory tract infections and harm to bone health . Lastly, as indicated above, HDVA may cause increased mortality in s ubgroups , e.g. in females who receive DTP vaccine. The underlying mechanisms are unknown but may be related to recent observations that vitamin A may induce epigenetic inhi bitory m odifications of monocytes, leading to innate tolerance . [34] It is worth noting that i n India, which recommends a booster DTP vaccine at 18 months of age, children will have DTP vaccine as their most recent vaccine in the majority of the first 5 years of life. Conclusions HDVA should be immediately discontinued in India on the basis of balancing the benefits and risks enumerated above and particularly the financial and logistic costs that could be diverted to other comprehensive and sustainable solutions. Before -after cessation studies of mortality outcomes by age and sex , if carefully planned, could provide important evidence regarding potential benefits or harms of continuing the program elsewhere in the world.
