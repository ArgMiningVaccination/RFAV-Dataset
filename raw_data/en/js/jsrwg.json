We first covered Angela Adrian last year, when she lost three papers on how to apply intellectual property laws and ideas in the age of the internet. (The irony did not escape Adam, who linked to Alanis Morissette's ballad \"Ironic.\") She is now the chief knowledge officer for reputation management firm Icondia, which helps the rich and famous \"protect their unique and priceless individuality in the 21st century.\" It's not clear what the investigation entails; a spokesperson for the school declined to give details \"at this stage.\" The thesis \u2014 about strengthening personality and property rights in the world of online gaming \u2014 is unavailable on the university website. Instead, this message is displayed when you try to access it at Queen Mary Research Online (QMRO): Continue reading IP lawyer/plagiarist's PhD thesis under review The editors of ACS's Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data have sunk a paper on halogenated alkanes after realizing that \"a significant amount\" of the data was \"inaccurate,\" thereby \"invalidating\" the paper. We and others have documented plenty of cases where papers get retracted because authors manipulate citations to boost their impact factor. Sometimes, journal publishers pressure authors to cite papers within the journal to artificially inflate its impact factor. Since this is highly discouraged - COPE has extensive commentary on the problem - it usually happens behind closed doors. For decades, the U.S. FDA has uncovered misconduct in clinical trials but hidden it from the public, according to a new paper in JAMA Internal Medicine. The study, by New York University journalism professor Charles Seife, looked at 78 publications resulting from trials where the FDA found serious misconduct, including \"failure to protect the safety of patients\" and data fakery. Only three of those publications mentioned the problems uncovered by the FDA. No retractions or errata were ever issued for any of them. Tulane researchers Tong Wu and Chang Han, who have been anonymously accused of figure duplication in the past, have now finally lost a paper for that reason. The frequent plagiarism tipster Juuichi Jigen (a pseudonym) set up a blog in 2012 alleging that the pair inappropriately reused images in six other papers, though none of those have been retracted. The recent notice, issued at the end of January by the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry, states that the figure duplication was confirmed by the University of Pittsburgh's Office of Research Integrity. Han, the first author, was at UPitt when the paper was published in 2008, though she moved to join Wu at Tulane in 2009. As reported in the Boston Business Journal, Saad's lawsuit claims that his institution, the State University of Campinas, investigated two articles at the journal's behest. The American Diabetes Association was unhappy with the results, and asked the school to reopen the investigation, including two additional papers. Saad is suing to prevent the journal from retracting the papers, in addition to monetary compensation. With the increasingly hectic pace of modern life, everybody is always on the look out for time-saving tricks and tips. Scientists at the National University of Singapore and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University certainly found one, but we really can't recommend it: doing one randomized controlled trial (RCT) with several outcomes, and publishing them as three separate 2014 papers with \"considerable overlap.\" So far, one paper has been retracted, and another withdrawn. The hits keep coming for University of Maryland researcher Anil Jaiswal. The latest retraction for the cell biologist is in Cancer Research, for a 2007 paper about ways in which the cell tries to protect the tumor suppressor p53. Like the first Jaiswal retraction we covered, the latest notice specifically taps figure duplication as the cause of death, \"as a result of an error.\" The other two retractions gave no explanation for the withdrawal. The authors of a 2014 paper on soccer injuries have forfeited their publication after revealing that the foundation of the work was based on faulty data. (Look, we could have written about letting air out of balls, yadda yadda, but the Super Bowl has come and gone.) The article, which appeared in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, was written by a group in Denmark and Qatar led by Cristiano Eirale, a sports medicine researcher at the Aspetar-Qatar Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Hospital, in Doha. It showed goalies had a lower rate of injuries during training than field players. "}
