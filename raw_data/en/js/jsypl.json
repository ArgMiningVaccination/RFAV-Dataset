In the past few years, alternative medicine has become increasingly popular as people try to find [natural remedies](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/edge/treat-athlete-s-foot-garlic/) for their health issues. Now there might be a legitimate alternative cure to sore, post-workout joints. Dr. Minerva Santos, the director of integrative medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York, suggests turmeric as an effective remedy for joint pain. Turmeric is a deep orange-yellow colored spice often used in South Asian dishes such as [curry](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/healthy-recipes/poultry-power-spicy-chicken-curry-recipe/). It is also known to have [anti-inflammatory](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/gain-mass/anti-inflammatory-foods-bodybuilding-needs/) properties, which makes it an excellent therapy for swollen, achy joints. In 2009, a study was published in the [Journal of Alternative and Complimentary Medicine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19678780), which compared the pain relieving effects of curcumin (the active ingredient in turmeric) and ibuprofen. It was found that the curcumin provided equally effective results as the ibuprofen. Dr. Santos recommends taking 1000 mg of turmeric in pill form a day. This is because when bottled, the turmeric is usually combined with a compound known as piperine, which aids in absorption. However, it should be noted that turmeric has the ability to slow the clotting of blood so it should not be mixed with blood thinners or taken within 2 weeks of any type of surgery. Also, it should be avoided if you have gallstones because it may worsen gallbladder problems. Dr. Santos suggests consulting with your doctor before starting a turmeric regimen. "}
