Funding Opportunity Description 1. Background a. Overview Prenatal alcohol and other substance use as well as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) remain a critical public health issue. Recent data show that nearly 1 in 7 pregnant people report current drinking and about 1 in 20 report binge drinking in the past 30 days. Further, current alcohol use and binge drinking during pregnancy in the US increased slightly from 2011 to 2018. Data also show that polysubstance use is high among those who use alcohol during pregnancy. While few estimates for the full range of FASDs are available, experts estimate that up to 1 in 20 US school children may have FASDs. From FY2018 -FY2022, CDC funded cooperative agreements with national medical and professional societies with memberships who serve people who are or might be pregnant as well as a national partner whose primary focus is FASD prevention and support. This NOFO expands and leverages previous efforts in the following ways: Collaboration and coordination remain foundational elements with a multidisciplinary approach to address the mother-infant dyad. Non-clinical, public health partners are now integrated to improve access to care, mental health services, and other resources for people who are medically underserved. Innovative up-to-date approaches to assessing the state of the science, disseminating data and messages, and updating educational materials are essential. Efforts are expanded to include the impact on the mother and infant and to encompass other prenatal substance use. A regional and local approach is required to reach communities and individuals at-risk. Activities can include early identification and care of children and families with FASDs. Healthcare professionals are trusted messengers for people trying to become pregnant, those who are pregnant, and those recently pregnant. In addition, parents and caregivers rely heavily on Page 4 of 58 healthcare providers' advice for children. Healthcare professionals trust and rely on information and recommendations from their professional organizations. While healthcare professionals continue to be a priority audience to partner with, people with limited access to health care or who might be distrustful of the medical establishment may rely on advice from other trusted messengers. Previous partnership efforts have focused on medical organizations and been discipline-specific; however, there is a strong need to build a cohesive, multi-disciplinary collaborative to maximize impact. This NOFO is intended to build a collaborative framework of national partner organizations that contribute to 1) reducing prenatal alcohol and other substance use, 2) improving support services and access to care, and 3) improving identification and health of children/families with FASDs. This NOFO has three components, each designed to serve a different population. Component A will fund entities that engage with healthcare and/or allied health professionals serving people who are or might be pregnant and/or children and families with FASDs. Component B will fund entities with a national and/or regional reach that engage with non-clinical professionals serving maternal and child health populations with limited access to health care. Component C will fund an entity with national reach that engages individuals, families, and communities affected by prenatal alcohol and other substance use and/or individuals with FASDs. Each recipient will conduct some or all activities tailored to their population and are also expected to work together across NOFO recipients as part of a multidisciplinary collaborative. b. Statutory Authorities This program is authorized under Sections 301 and 317C of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 241 and 247b-4], as amended c. Healthy People 2030 This program addresses the Healthy People 2030 focus area of Maternal, Infant, and Child Health, objective MICH-09, increase abstinence from alcohol among pregnant women from 89.3% to 92.2%. d. Other National Public Health Priorities and Strategies HHS Strategic Goal 2, Objective 2.3: Reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders through prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support - \"Encourage healthcare providers' use of screening and brief intervention approaches for alcohol, opioid, and other substance use disorders to reduce...effects of harmful substance use in pregnancy\" HHS Strategic Goal 3, Objective 3.2: Safeguard the public against preventable injuries and violence or their results - \"Protect women from harmful exposures before, during, and after pregnancy, such as from...alcohol, opioid, and other harmful substance use, and improve outcomes for newborns and pregnant women\" e. Relevant Work CDC currently funds: CDC-RFA-DD18-1803 : Reaching Healthcare Professionals in the Prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders through National Professional Organizations Page 5 of 58 CDC-RFA-DD18-1801 : Promoting Resources for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness and Prevention These projects, ending 9/29/2022, have focused on promoting training for healthcare professionals, incorporating FASD prevention content into professional licensure requirements, and integrating and disseminating messaging on FASD prevention. Additionally, CDC is funding a communication contract through 9/2022 to conduct message testing to improve patient-provider communication on the risks of prenatal alcohol exposure. 2.

Purpose Page 7 of 58 This NOFO is intended to build a collaborative framework of national partner organizations that contribute to 1) reducing prenatal alcohol and other substance use, 2) improving support services and access to care, and 3) improving identification and health of children and families with FASDs. ii. Outcomes During the period of performance, concrete evaluation data should be collected related to the short-term and intermediate outcomes; however, achieving long-term outcomes in the logic model is not required, because they represent the ultimate impact to which the strategies and activities will contribute. Although CDC will be responsible for measuring the long-term outcomes, recipients will contribute to the long-term outcomes by implementing the NOFO strategies/activities and demonstrating measurable progress towards achieving the short-term and intermediate outcomes of the NOFO logic model. Each recipient will complete specific activities that pertain to a group of outcomes in the logic model, which are outlined below. All strategies may not have both a short-term and intermediate outcome. Example measures that may provide qualitative and/or quantitative data for these outcomes are further described in section (b)(i) CDC Evaluation and Performance Measurement Strategy . Expected short-term outcomes (STO) and intermediate outcomes (IO) include the following: Strategies: 1. Participate in a cohesive, multidisciplinary FASD champions network; 6. Coordinate efforts across and between all components to share information and resources and ensure consistent messaging; and 7. Develop and foster a cohesive, multidisciplinary FASD champions network STO: Demonstrated collaboration between clinical and public health partners dedicated to prenatal alcohol and other substance use and FASD-related services IO: Increased integration of evidence-based strategies into clinical practice and non- clinical settings Strategies: 2. Develop and disseminate messaging through national and regional systems, as well as other networks using evidence-based recommendations about prevention of alcohol and other substance use among people who are pregnant or might be pregnant and promoting early identification and management of children living with FASDs STO: Increased use of evidence-based information and resources about prenatal alcohol and other substance use IO: Increased integration of evidence-based strategies into clinical practice and non- clinical settings Strategy: 3. Build community, state, and local capacity to link clinical and public health partners to reach affected populations with effective programs and practices STO: Improved capacity of state and local networks to reach affected populations with relevant, evidence-based messaging and services IO: Increased linkage of people at risk of prenatal alcohol and other substance use as well as families living with FASDs to local services, treatment, support groups, prevention programs, and statewide services Page 8 of 58 Strategy: 4. Evaluate the effectiveness of program strategies, including membership knowledge, practices, referral patterns, and awareness of resources STO : Increased identification of organizations' members' knowledge, current practices, and organizational needs Strategy: 5. Develop and use innovative, updated methods to educate organizations' members serving populations of reproductive age, including pregnant people, and/or those serving children and families STO: Increased use of evidence-based information and resources about prenatal alcohol and other substance use IO: Increased knowledge related to the risks of prenatal alcohol and other substance use IO: Increased incorporation of prenatal alcohol and substance use content related to clinical recommendations and organizational policies into organizational resources, student curricula, or certification requirements Note: Strategy 4. Evaluate the effectiveness of program strategies, including membership knowledge, practices, referral patterns, and awareness of resources is cross-cutting and has application across all other strategies. It is most closely aligned with STO: Increased identification of organizations' members' knowledge, current practices, and organizational needs, which will help establish a baseline for other outcomes to be measured during the period of performance. iii.

Collaborations a. With other CDC programs and CDC-funded organizations: Collaboration is an essential element of this NOFO. Recipients will be required to collaborate within and across NOFO components. Recipients will also be expected to collaborate with other CDC-funded FASD-related efforts, including: American Academy of Pediatrics, funded through CDC-RFA-OT18-1802: Strengthening Public Health Systems and Services through National Partnerships to Improve and Protect the Nation's Health and any entity funded in the future to primarily reach pediatric providers. b. With organizations not funded by CDC: Applicants should describe the specific agencies and organizations, including state, local, and/or community-based organizations, with whom the applicant currently or previously collaborated on FASD- and/or prenatal substance-related issues and identify other organizations expected to join in the network to accomplish the proposed activities. Recipients should establish, build, and/or maintain collaborative relationships that will support the implementation of the proposed strategies and activities to maximize public health impact and contribute to long-term goals. Recipients should consider collaborating with other federally funded efforts, such as those funded by agencies within the Interagency Coordinating Committee on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (ICCFASD) \u2014e.g., the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) cooperative agreement with a focus on FASDs . 2. Target Populations Applicants for Component A must target a specific healthcare professional or allied health specialty on a national level with the capacity for extensive partnership and widespread dissemination of resources nationally and regionally. Each applicant must identify and target only one professional specialty \u2014e.g., emergency medicine, family medicine, medical assisting, Page 13 of 58 behavioral health, nursing, obstetrics and gynecology, social work, or medical or nursing students. Applicants for Component B must target maternal and child health populations, particularly with a focus on prioritizing access to care, mental health services, and other resources for underserved populations. Applicants for Component C must engage with individuals, families, and communities affected by prenatal alcohol and other substance use and individuals with FASDs and/or who have an interest in FASDs on a national and regional/local scale. a. Health Disparities All applicants should provide information on how they will ensure that activities include diverse representation to serve populations of interest. Recipients should consider the spectrum of people who are at risk of prenatal alcohol and other substance use and who are at risk of having FASDs and be sure to prioritize those at greatest risk for adverse outcomes with their specific programmatic activities. Component B of this NOFO is intended to target entities that engage with individuals focused on underserved populations, particularly pregnant people and families with limited access to health care. Component C activities aim to involve people with lived experience willing to be consulted to help inform access to services, recommendations, messaging, dissemination, and programmatic activities. iv. Funding Strategy Applicants can only apply for one component. Component A: Up to six awards will be funded to entities serving healthcare and/or allied health professionals. Component A recipients are expected to address all the strategies listed in the logic model and in the Strategies and Activities section of the NOFO 1) in the section marked for Components A, B, and C and 2) in the section marked for Components A and B only. Component A recipients will be funded up to $325,000 for Year 1. Funding award ceilings for Years 2, 3, and 4 are not set. Only one Component A applicant will be funded focused on any one specific healthcare professional or allied health specialty \u2014e.g., emergency medicine, family medicine, medical assisting, behavioral health, nursing, obstetrics and gynecology, social work, or medical or nursing students. Component B: Up to three awards will be funded to entities with a national and/or regional reach who serve maternal and child health populations with limited access to health care.

The Component C recipient is expected to address all the strategies listed in the logic model and in the Strategies and Activities section of the NOFO 1) in the section marked for Components A, B, and C and 2) in the section marked for Component C only. The Component C recipient will be funded up to $400,000 for Year 1. Funding award ceilings for Years 2, 3, and 4 are not set. b. Evaluation and Performance Measurement i. CDC Evaluation and Performance Strategy The CDC's monitoring and evaluation (M&E) strategy for tracking recipients' performance of implementing strategies/activities and achieving the program outcomes (short-term and intermediate) of this NOFO will use both process and outcome evaluation consistent with the logic model/approach presented earlier. Evaluation and performance measurement helps CDC and recipients demonstrate achievement of proposed program outcomes to relevant stakeholders and the value of the NOFO in contributing to the long-term goals, which CDC is responsible for measuring. Additionally, evaluation can provide insight into programmatic activities of the NOFO that are effective, identify barriers and facilitators to program implementation, and help build evidence towards the desired NOFO outcomes, which facilitates continuous program improvement. The applicant must describe in the budget narrative how they will use the DD22-2201 funds allocated to support evaluation activities with staff supporting the project at a minimum of 25% time. Key evaluation questions that may be answered include, but are not limited to the following: To what extent can collaboration between national organizations improve members' knowledge about the risks of prenatal alcohol and other substance exposure? To what extent can clinical and public health partners collaborate within a multidisciplinary network to promote evidence-based recommendations and messages about prenatal alcohol and other substance use and FASDs? To what extent has messaging and resources about prenatal alcohol and other substance use and FASDs reached affected populations at the regional, state, or local level? To what extent has messaging and resources about prenatal alcohol and other substance use and FASDs reached organizations' members? To what extent are evidence-based strategies for the prevention of prenatal alcohol and other substance use being integrated into clinical practice and non-clinical settings? To what extent are the activities contributing to reducing prenatal alcohol and other substance exposure during pregnancy? To what extent are the activities contributing to increasing early identification and management of children living with FASDs?

CDC will also provide information to funding recipients on the timeline to report performance measurement data through required annual progress reporting (see NOFO section (F) Award Page 18 of 58 Administration Information (3. Reporting)). Technical assistance will be provided by CDC to recipients about collecting, using, and submitting quantitative and qualitative M&E data on an ongoing basis throughout the period of performance. Evaluation Findings The proposed M&E strategy will be used to determine if NOFO strategies and activities are scalable and effective at reaching priority populations. Evaluation findings will be used to inform programmatic planning and to guide technical assistance that CDC will provide to recipients. Data collection and reporting will be limited to data that will be analyzed and used by CDC and recipients for program monitoring and quality improvement. Recipients will submit to CDC the required M&E data on the implementation of strategies/activities for their specific component. Recipients will be expected to collect and report both qualitative and quantitative performance measurement data that will be finalized by CDC with input from funding recipients. Evaluation data provided to CDC will be aggregated to highlight similar data on performance measures across components and help generate annual evaluation reports regarding program implementation, barriers and facilitators, as well as outcomes achieved related to this NOFO. The annual evaluation report will highlight key measures of performance for individual recipients under each component, as well as the combined performance across each component of the NOFO. Performance measurement data will be shared with recipients at least annually in the evaluation report. Evaluation findings may be repurposed for sharing in different formats and settings including at national conferences, through publication in peer-reviewed journals, and via online reports. Data Management Plan Since this NOFO does not involve the generation or collection of public health data, a Data Management Plan is not required for this NOFO. ii.

Work Plan Applicants are required to provide a work plan that provides both a detailed description of the first year of the award and a high-level overview of the entire four (4)-year period of performance. The first-year work plan should incorporate all NOFO-related program strategies and activities with a concise description of how the recipients plan to implement the activities for their component and monitor the work with the appropriate measures. Work plans will allow CDC project officers and recipients to monitor (a) implementation of project strategies and activities (i.e., process evaluation) and (b) progress toward achieving period-of-performance outcomes (i.e., outcome evaluation). A sample work plan format is presented below. In this format, the table would be completed for each of the project strategies. While this format is not required, it may simplify development of the work plan and help ensure that it includes all required information in an easy-to-follow format. If a particular strategy leads to multiple outcomes (short-term and/or intermediate), it should be described with multiple outcome measures. Page 22 of 58 Post-award, recipients will refine and finalize the first-year work plan in collaboration with CDC within the first 3 months of award to better align with the required reporting needs established in the NOFO (see section 3. Reporting ). Work plans should also be updated annually and submitted as part of the Annual Performance Report. Strategy: [from Approach section ] 1. 2.

CDC Monitoring and Accountability Approach Monitoring activities include routine and ongoing communication between CDC and recipients, site visits, and recipient reporting (including work plans, performance, and financial reporting). Consistent with applicable grants regulations and policies, CDC expects the following to be included in post-award monitoring for grants and cooperative agreements: Tracking recipient progress in achieving the desired outcomes. Ensuring the adequacy of recipient systems that underlie and generate data reports. Creating an environment that fosters integrity in program performance and results. Page 23 of 58 Monitoring may also include the following activities deemed necessary to monitor the award: Ensuring that work plans are feasible based on the budget and consistent with the intent of the award. Ensuring that recipients are performing at a sufficient level to achieve outcomes within stated timeframes. Working with recipients on adjusting the work plan based on achievement of outcomes, evaluation results and changing budgets. Monitoring performance measures (both programmatic and financial) to assure satisfactory performance levels. Monitoring and reporting activities that assist grants management staff (e.g., grants management officers and specialists, and project officers) in the identification, notification, and management of high-risk recipients. In addition to those listed, other activities deemed necessary to monitor the award may be applied. Monitor recipient program performance via use of multiple approaches, such as site visits, emails, conference calls, and standardized review of performance reports and other data reports, to support program development, implementation, evaluation, and improvement. Priority Measures CDC and the recipients will spend the first 6-months of the period of performance finalizing the performance monitoring and accountability approach. Although a list of measures has been provided in section (b.) (i.) CDC Evaluation and Performance Measurement Strategy, CDC and recipients will finalize a subset of priority measures that are feasible for recipients to collect and report on throughout the period of performance. Recipient Feedback Performance feedback will be shared with individual recipients at least annually in the form of an annual evaluation report, upon CDC review of end-of-year performance measurement data. As the annual evaluation report is being developed, CDC will work with recipients to answer questions and provide feedback related to any data that are submitted. The annual evaluation report will include key individual recipient and aggregated recipient data across components to help CDC and recipients understand the overall performance of the NOFO. The evaluation report will serve as another opportunity to provide feedback to recipients on areas that may be improved upon each budget period to support ongoing program improvement and reporting. f. CDC Program Support to Recipients In a cooperative agreement, CDC staff will be substantially involved in the program activities, above and beyond routine grant monitoring. CDC activities for this program are as follows: Page 24 of 58 Within the first six (6 months) of funding, CDC will work with recipients to finalize an evaluation plan to describe evaluation methods, data collection, use, and data submission requirements. Provide guidance and coordination to funded organizations to improve the quality and effectiveness of work plans, evaluation strategies, products, and collaborative activities with other funded organizations. Collaborate, as appropriate, in assessing progress toward meeting strategic objectives and in using established performance measurement and grants management systems for documenting progress to understand performance improvements and best or promising practices.

Budget Narrative Applicants must submit an itemized budget narrative. When developing the budget narrative, applicants must consider whether the proposed budget is reasonable and consistent with the purpose, outcomes, and program strategy outlined in the project narrative. The budget must include: Salaries and wages Fringe benefits Consultant costs Equipment Supplies Travel Other categories Contractual costs Total Direct costs Total Indirect costs Page 35 of 58 Indirect costs could include the cost of collecting, managing, sharing and preserving data. Indirect costs on grants awarded to foreign organizations and foreign public entities and performed fully outside of the territorial limits of the U.S. may be paid to support the costs of compliance with federal requirements at a fixed rate of eight percent of MTDC exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards in excess of $25,000. Negotiated indirect costs may be paid to the American University, Beirut, and the World Health Organization. If applicable and consistent with the cited statutory authority for this announcement, applicant entities may use funds for activities as they relate to the intent of this NOFO to meet national standards or seek health department accreditation through the Public Health Accreditation Board (see: http://www.phaboard.org ). Applicant entities to whom this provision applies include state, local, territorial governments (including the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianna Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau), or their bona fide agents, political subdivisions of states (in consultation with states), federally recognized or state-recognized American Indian or Alaska Native tribal governments, and American Indian or Alaska Native tribally designated organizations. Activities include those that enable a public health organization to deliver public health services such as activities that ensure a capable and qualified workforce, up-to-date information systems, and the capability to assess and respond to public health needs. Use of these funds must focus on achieving a minimum of one national standard that supports the intent of the NOFO. Proposed activities must be included in the budget narrative and must indicate which standards will be addressed. Vital records data, including births and deaths, are used to inform public health program and policy decisions. If applicable and consistent with the cited statutory authority for this NOFO, applicant entities are encouraged to collaborate with and support their jurisdiction's vital records office (VRO) to improve vital records data timeliness, quality and access, and to advance public health goals. Recipients may, for example, use funds to support efforts to build VRO capacity through partnerships; provide technical and/or financial assistance to improve vital records timeliness, quality or access; or support vital records improvement efforts, as approved by CDC. Applicants must name this file \"Budget Narrative\" and upload it as a PDF file at www.grants.gov . If requesting indirect costs in the budget, a copy of the indirect cost-rate agreement is required. If the indirect costs are requested, include a copy of the current negotiated federal indirect cost rate agreement or a cost allocation plan approval letter for those Recipients under such a plan. Applicants must name this file \"Indirect Cost Rate\" and upload it at www.grants.gov . 13. Pilot Program for Enhancement of Employee Whistleblowers Protections Pilot Program for Enhancement of Employee Whistleblower Protections: All applicants will be subject to a term and condition that applies the terms of 48 Code of Federal Regulations Page 36 of 58 (CFR) section 3.908 to the award and requires that recipients inform their employees in writing (in the predominant native language of the workforce) of employee whistleblower rights and protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712. 13a. Funds Tracking Proper fiscal oversight is critical to maintaining public trust in the stewardship of federal funds. Effective October 1, 2013, a new HHS policy on subaccounts requires the CDC to set up payment subaccounts within the Payment Management System (PMS) for all new grant awards. Funds awarded in support of approved activities and drawdown instructions will be identified on the Notice of Award in a newly established PMS subaccount (P subaccount). Recipients will be required to draw down funds from award-specific accounts in the PMS. Ultimately, the subaccounts will provide recipients and CDC a more detailed and precise understanding of financial transactions. The successful applicant will be required to track funds by P-accounts/sub accounts for each project/cooperative agreement awarded. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a record of fiscal responsibility and the ability to provide sufficient and effective oversight. Financial management systems must meet the requirements as described 45 CFR 75 which include, but are not limited to, the following: Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally- funded activities. Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award. Written procedures to implement payment requirements. Written procedures for determining cost allowability. Written procedures for financial reporting and monitoring. 13b. Copyright Interests Provisions This provision is intended to ensure that the public has access to the results and accomplishments of public health activities funded by CDC.

Also at the time of submission, Recipient and/or the Recipient's submitting author must specify the date the final manuscript will be publicly accessible through PubMed Central (PMC). Recipient and/or Recipient's submitting author must also post the manuscript through PMC within twelve (12) months of the publisher's official date of final publication; however the author is strongly encouraged to make the subject manuscript available as soon as possible. The recipient must obtain prior approval from the CDC for any exception to this provision. The author's final, peer-reviewed manuscript is defined as the final version accepted for journal publication, and includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process, and all graphics and supplemental material associated with the article. Recipient and its submitting authors working under this award are responsible for ensuring that any publishing or copyright agreements concerning submitted articles reserve adequate right to fully comply with this provision and the license reserved by CDC. The manuscript will be hosted in both PMC and the CDC Stacks institutional repository system. In progress reports for this award, recipient must Page 37 of 58 identify publications subject to the CDC Public Access Policy by using the applicable NIHMS identification number for up to three (3) months after the publication date and the PubMed Central identification number (PMCID) thereafter. 13c. Data Management Plan As identified in the Evaluation and Performance Measurement section, applications involving data collection or generation must include a Data Management Plan (DMP) as part of their evaluation and performance measurement plan unless CDC has stated that CDC will take on the responsibility of creating the DMP. The DMP describes plans for assurance of the quality of the public health data through the data's lifecycle and plans to deposit the data in a repository to preserve and to make the data accessible in a timely manner. See web link for additional information: https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/ar-25.html . 14.

The applicant should include funding in the budget for two individuals for one annual grantee meeting at CDC in Atlanta, GA. c. Phase III Review Applications for each component will be rank-ordered. CDC may fund out of rank order in consideration of the following factors: Only one Component A applicant will be funded focused on any one specific healthcare professional or allied health specialty \u2014e.g., emergency medicine, family medicine, medical assisting, behavioral health, nursing, obstetrics and gynecology, social work, or medical or nursing students. For example, if multiple applicants propose to work in the specialty of nursing, only the top-ranked applicant for nursing would be funded before moving on to the next highest- ranked applicant for a different specialty. For Component B applicants, the ability to reach populations with limited access to health care and populations not addressed in other applications might affect the funding decision. CDC will provide justification for any decision to fund out of rank order. Review of risk posed by applicants. Prior to making a Federal award, CDC is required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR parts 180 and 376. In accordance 41 U.S.C. 2313, CDC is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB- designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Recipient Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. CDC may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.207. CDC's framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If it is determined that a Page 44 of 58 Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. The evaluation criteria is described in this Notice of Funding Opportunity. In evaluating risks posed by applicants, CDC will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following: (1) Financial stability; (2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part; (3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards; (4) Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F 45 CFR 75 or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and (5) The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities. CDC must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities. 2.

Reporting Reporting provides continuous program monitoring and identifies successes and challenges that recipients encounter throughout the project period. Also, reporting is a requirement for recipients who want to apply for yearly continuation of funding. Reporting helps CDC and recipients because it: Helps target support to recipients; Provides CDC with periodic data to monitor recipient progress toward meeting the Notice of Funding Opportunity outcomes and overall performance; Allows CDC to track performance measures and evaluation findings for continuous quality and program improvement throughout the period of performance and to determine applicability of evidence-based approaches to different populations, settings, and contexts; and Enables CDC to assess the overall effectiveness and influence of the NOFO. The table below summarizes required and optional reports. All required reports must be sent electronically to GMS listed in the \"Agency Contacts\" section of the NOFO copying the CDC Project Officer. Report When? Required?
