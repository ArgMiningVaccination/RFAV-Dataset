Are these clogged pores on your nose causing you discomfort? Then it's time to address your woes by following natural and Ayurvedic remedies to clean large, clogged pores on your nose. Nose pores are the openings on your nose, where the sebum glands secrete and spread natural oils. The size of skin pores varies, and the pores located on the nose are relatively larger than the pores located in other parts of your body. Scroll down to know the causes of large nose pores, and how to cleanse nose pores using natural methods and Ayurvedic remedies. Highlights: What Are Nose Pores? Nose pores are small openings for the hair follicles in your skin. These hair follicles are further attached with the sebaceous glands, which secrete a natural emollient called sebum. It helps in naturally moisturizing and nourishing your skin. The pores in your skin are different in size [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337418/)], and nose pores are naturally larger than the pores located elsewhere in your skin. This difference in pore size is due to the sebaceous glands which are present beneath the nose pores, and are equally large in size. The pore size also enlarges if you have an oily complexion. Additionally, genetics also plays a key role in determining pore size. There's nothing concrete you can do to reduce the enlarged pores on your nose. However, there are tricks to help make them look smaller. The pores on your skin don't close and open! They only dilate to stretch or narrow down. What Causes Large Nose Pores? Various factors may cause nose pores to appear stretched, large, or more visible. In most cases, the small dots spread on your nose are not whiteheads or blackheads, and don't require exfoliation. Genetics, blocked pores, and issues like hormonal changes or acne may cause the pores to appear large. Even your lifestyle choices may influence the visibility of nose pores. The causes of large, [open pores](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-treat-open-pores) may differ from one individual to another. These factors include: 1. Genetics Your genes may determine the size of your skin pores, including your nose. A few individuals have enlarged pores due to their skin complexion and specific characteristics. 2. Oily Complexion People with oily complexion are prone to excess sebum production in their skin pores. This excess sebum [ [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17034515/)] then blocks the pores, making them more prominent. Also, excess sebum in your skin may extend and stretch the skin pores. 3. Dry Skin People with dry complexion may also experience stretched, large pores in their nose. This happens when your body reacts to skin dryness by producing and secreting excess sebum. 4. Absence Of Skin Exfoliation Regular scrubbing and [exfoliation of your skin](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/skin-exfoliation) helps in removing accumulated oil, debris, and dead skin cells. When you don't exfoliate your skin at regular intervals, it may clog your skin pores and lead to open, stretched pores. 5. Hot & Humid Weather Warm and humid weather may also make skin pores appear large and stretched. This weather condition makes pores more prominent. 6. Extreme Sun Exposure The UV A and B rays of sunlight may damage your skin beyond repair, especially if you skip wearing a [sunscreen](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/spf-sunscreen-which-spf-is-best). The damage from UV rays may also lead to early signs of aging, which affects the collagen in your skin and makes pores more visible. 7. Poor Skincare Regime Individuals who don't have a regular skincare regime as per [their skin type](https://vedix.com/pages/vpq-skin) and specific needs are more susceptible to have accumulated dead skin cells, bacteria, and excess sebum in their skin pores. 8. Acne Skin conditions like acne occur when excess sebum, debris, and dead skin cells block the hair follicles within the pores. This may cause the pores to look large and stretched. Following remedies and treatments to manage your acne breakouts may help lower the chances of clogged nose pores. 9. Stress & Hormonal Fluctuations Factors like significant stress levels and hormonal imbalances may affect your skin's sebum production as well as overall complexion. Stress and hormonal fluctuations may also contribute to various other causes of enlarged nose pores like acne breakouts. 10. Diet Diet plays an essential role in your overall health and well-being. It also influences your skin's appearance and health. By following a nutritious diet devoid of junk and oily food, fats, and sweetened products, you may ensure that your skin naturally stays supple, healthy, and beautiful. A few food allergies and intolerances may also impact your skin health. \"Skin pores are very sensitive to heat, so hot climates, hot spices in diet and even Pitta prakriti can stimulate skin pores,\" says Dr. Zeel Gandhi, Chief Ayurvedic Doctor at Vedix. Your periods can affect your pore size. Hormonal fluctuations during your menstrual cycles impacts your pore size. How To Clean Nose Pores? Let's understand how you can deeply cleanse your nose pores by following natural ways, Ayurvedic remedies, and home remedies. A. Natural Ways To Clean Nose Pores The important first step to clean nose pores is to ensure that they're clear of blockages. Makeup, debris, and natural oils can cause blocked nose pores. 1. Clean Your Face Twice A Day Cleansing your face with a mild, herbal facial cleanser removes bacteria, dirt, oil, as well as any makeup residue from your skin pores. For best results, you should cleanse your face twice a day. If you tend to sweat profusely post workout, then you may have to [cleanse your face](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-clean-your-face) once again. Oily and combination skin types are cleansed effectively with a mild facial cleanser which is either cream or gel-based. Both types of facial cleansers cleanse your nose pores without aggravating or irritating your skin. 2. Exfoliate To Remove Dirt, Excess Sebum, & Dead Skin Cells Use a mild exfoliator around 2-3 times a week to [remove accumulated dead skin cells](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-remove-dead-skin-from-face), excess sebum, and debris which may be blocking your nose pores. The rule of thumb is to gently massage the exfoliator onto your face, especially your nose. Avoid aggressively scrubbing and exfoliating, as it may further irritate and damage your skin. 3. Use A Suitable Moisturizer Even though your nose pores may secrete excess sebum, it is still important to apply a moisturizer after cleansing your face. This step ensures that your skin is naturally nourished, and is not excessively dry after cleansing. Excessive dryness may worsen your skin condition. Always opt for a gel or water-based moisturizer which doesn't block your pores. 4. Essential Oils For Rejuvenation A few essential oils are known for their cleansing and soothing properties [ [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435909/)]. These include: A. Clary Sage Clary sage is best known for its soothing, calming, and cooling sensation. The flowering herb also helps clear blocked pores and calm inflamed skin regions which are susceptible to [blackheads](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-remove-blackheads). B. Eucalyptus The potent flowering tree is well-known for balancing your skin's excess oil secretion and preventing the appearance of blackheads. You may add a few drops of the essential oil in your favourite moisturizing or cleansing cream. Additionally, you may also make a facial scrub containing raw almonds, white clay, oatmeal, and a few drops of eucalyptus and lavender essential oils. C. Tea Tree Oil One of the most potent and popular essential oils, tea tree oil is well-known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Research has shown that tea tree oil is capable of minimizing [skin lesions ](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/skin-lesions-types-causes-treatment)and scars when used in any acne treatment plan. As acne and blackheads are mostly linked with a specific bacterial strain, P. acnes, the antibacterial property of tea tree oil can be beneficial for treating blackheads. Vedix Tip: Before using any essential oil on your skin, it is advised to test the diluted essential oil on your inner forearm and leave it for 24 hours to observe any adverse skin reaction. B. Ayurvedic Remedies To Clean Nose Pores The chin, forehead, and nose have the highest cluster of [sebum glands on your face](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/what-is-sebum-how-to-balance-it).

Even professional treatments may not work effectively. Does Your Nose Get Bigger If You Squeeze It? No, your nose pores don't enlarge or stretch when squeezed. But, if you continuously keep squeezing your nose pores on a daily basis, then the soft skin tissue in your nose may temporarily swell up. What Is The White Substance In Your Nose Pores? The white substance which lies underneath your pores comes out as thin strands when you forcibly squeeze your nose. This white substance is known as sebaceous filament. This is primarily made up of accumulated dead skin cells and sebum. Sebaceous filament usually collects in the pores around your chin and nose, as the pores in these areas are larger. Also, the sebum accumulates in the pore lining till it is squeezed out. The Last Word Your skin complexion, lifestyle choices, and genetics may determine the pore size of your skin. A few additional conditions may also influence your pore size, and effectively regulating these conditions may minimize the occurrence of enlarged nose pores. A good [skincare routine](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/skin-care-routine-steps) focusing on cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing your skin greatly helps in minimizing the appearance of stretched pores.
