What Students Are Saying \"My experience in Level 2 was both positively challenging and rewarding! In a nutshell, Level 2 brings the information we learned in Level 1 into a clear focus. I enjoyed learning to make tinctures by using the scientific method, and experimenting with drip percolation. The monthly case studies empowered us to use our education (thus far) in a mock clinical setting where we discussed various methods for assessing an individuals condition and possible protocols for a wide range of health issues. As a Level 2 graduate, I feel confident in my abilities as an herbalist while at the same time I'm excited to continue my education!\" - J.G. Practices and Protocols Graduate \"Lupo teaches plant wisdom from a heart centered space which encourages students to continue to connect with the plants in a sacred and traditional way. In level 2 you will have the opportunity to form deeper relationships with plants, which is an extremely transformational and healing experience.\" - C.H. Practices and Protocols Graduate \"I feel so fortunate to have been part of Lupo's classes and study at Twin Star! I truly enjoy the knowledge, stories, protocols and experiences provided to us. I can't wait to explore more classes offered, thank you!\". - Rachel M. \"I really like the way the information was broken up between months and expand upon what we learned in Level 1. I loved having Rebekah teach us advanced medicine making. She did a great job, explaining each type of herbal medicine practice and keeping all of us on task! Ilana was a great teacher and is definitely a wealth of knowledge! I really appreciated what she shared about working with children as well as homeopathic medicines.\" - Shannon M "}
