PFOS and PFOA decreased from around 2000, even though only PFOS was significant. PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA increased during the whole period, largest increase after the year 2000. Axmon et al. (2014) 1972-2008 n = 20 pools of breast milk healthy native Swedish mothers at the Mothers' milk center in Stockholm cross sectional Sweden PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS Concentrations of PFOS, PFOA and PFHxS increased from 1972 to the 1990s. From around 2001 to 2008 the concentrations of all three PFASs decreased, while the trend for PFHxS was not significant. Sundstr\u00f6m et al. (2011) 1996-2010 n = 36 pools of serum primiparous women living in Uppsala County, donated serum samples within the third week after delivery age: 19-41 to 2010, while PFOS, PFDS, FOSA and PFOA decreased in the same period. For PFHpA and PFUnDA no significant trend was observed. PFHxA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTeDA were not detected in any sample above LOQ. The increasing trends of PFBS and PFHxS have later been shown to be due to contamination of drinking water with these PFASs (Gyllenhammar et al., 2013) Glynn et al.

The concentrations of PFOS, PFOA and PFHpS decreased from around 2000, while for FOSA the decrease started somewhat earlier. No particular trends were observed for PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA after around 2000. The concentrations of PFPeA, PFHpA, PFDoDA and PFTrDA were quite stable during the whole study period. Haug et al. (2009) 1979-2007 n = 254 serum samples from 53 males from Northern Norway median age at first and last sampling was 43 and 71 years, respectively repeated sampling and measurements at up to five time points (1979, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2007) longitudinal sampling Norway Ten PFASs were quantified, from which trends were observed for all the eight PFAS from 1979 and onwards. For PFOS, PFOA and FOSA significant decreasing concentrations were observed from 2001 to 2007. In contrast, increasing concentrations were observed throughout the whole study period for PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA, while only the trends for PFNA and PFDA were statistically significant for all time periods. Similar concentrations of PFHxS were observed in 2001 and 2007. Somewhat lower concentrations of PFHpS were observed in 2007 when compared to 2001, but this trend was not significant . N\u00f8st et al.

Serum. 284 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Appendix C - Toxicokinetics in Experimental Animals During the previous decades, most of the information on the fate of PFASs was based on PFOS and 9127 PFOA (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2008, 2018). These compounds have been shown to be readily absorbed 9128 in the gastrointestinal tract in mammals, including humans, and to distribute predominantly to the 9129 plasma and liver. PFOS and PFOA are not metabolised and are excreted in both urine and faeces. They 9130 may be subject to extensive enterohepatic recirculation. For PFOS, the serum elimination half-lives in 9131 rats and mice were slightly higher than one month, whereas in rabbits and monkeys, the serum 9132 elimination half-life was 3-4 months. Significant sex differences in the elimination of PFOA are observed 9133 in some species such as rats, for which half-lives may vary from few hours (in females) to several days 9134 (in males). Differences in biological half-lives between species for both PFOS and PFOA and between 9135 sexes for PFOA are mainly due to differences in renal clearance. For both PFOS and PFOA, maternal 9136 transfer occurs prenatally to the fetus through placental transfer and postnatally through the 9137 consumption of maternal milk. 9138 C.1 PFCAs 9139 In the past ten years, a significant amount of data was published on the toxicokinetics of shorter chain 9140 PFCAs such as PFBA, PFHxA and PFHpA, as well PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, animals to PFCAs 9142 having a perfluorinated carbon chain length of 3 to 11 was shown to result in an estimated absorption 9143 fraction greater than 95 % of the administered dose (ATSDR, 2018). None of the experimental studies 9144 observed the formation of metabolites, suggesting, as previously reported for PFOA (EFSA CONTAM 9145 Panel, 2018), that the biotransformation of PFCAs is unlikely in mammals, irrespective of their chain 9146 length. As it is known that transport proteins play a key role in PFCA elimination, in particular in renal 9147 tubular reabsorption, information on this process is given at the end of section C.1. 9148 9149 No data were identified PFPeDA, PFHxDA and PFODA. 9150 Regarding PFOA, et al., 2018; NTP, 2019a; Pizzuro 9151 et al., 2019), confirm that this PFAS is well absorbed following oral exposure (>90%), is not 9152 biotransformed by xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and is preferentially distributed to the liver and 9153 serum in most species. The NTP study showed that in male Sprague Dawley rats administered once 9154 daily by gavage, for 28 days to PFOA doses from 0.625 to 10 mg/kg bw per day, the liver/plasma ratios 9155 ranged from 0.87 to 1.07 (NTP, 2019a). Although the ratio was not provided for females, the plasma 9156 concentrations found in males were 2 or 3 levels of magnitude higher than in females exposed to similar 9157 doses. The reasons for such sex differences in tissue distribution is unclear, but could be related to 9158 longer half-lives of PFOA in male versus female rats (Pizzurro et al., 2019). The half-life of PFOA in male 9159 and female Sprague Dawley rats was found to range from 3 to 14 hours in females and from 8 to 12 9160 days in males (Dzierlenga et al., 2019, cited by NTP, 2019a). The of PFBA was investigated in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats given either single 9163 oral doses by gavage (3, 10, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg bw) or a single i.v. dose (30 mg/kg bw) of ammonium 9164 PFBA (Chang et al., 2008). Gastrointestinal absorption was estimated to be rapid (mean Tmax ranging 9165 from 0.63 h in females to 1.25 h in males for the 30 mg/kg bw dose) and almost complete in both sexes 9166 (similar Cmax values obtained after oral or i.v. dose). For male rats, 24 h after oral dosing, mean liver 9167 concentrations ranged from 22 to 27% of the mean serum levels, depending on the dose. Values in 9168 females were not reported and concentrations in other tissues were not measured. Clearance for the 9169 30 mg/kg bw oral dose (corresponding to 140 \u00b5mol/kg bw) varied from 444 mL/kg per day in males to 9170 1718 mL/kg per day in females and mean serum elimination half-life was 9.2 h in males and 1.8 h in 9171 females (Table C.3). PFBA was mainly excreted in urine ranging from 51% to 64% of the administered 9172 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 285 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN dose (for doses ranging from 3 to 100 mg/kg bw) in males at 24 h and representing 100% of the 9173 administered dose in females. Within the first 24 h, fecal excretion was between 0.1 and 3% in males. 9174 There was no evidence indicating that PFBA was metabolised in rats. A similar study was carried out in 9175 CD1 mice by the same authors (Chang et al., 2008). Male and female animals were given by gavage 9176 single oral doses of ammonium PFBA (10, 30, 100, 300 mg/kg bw). At the 30 mg/kg bw dose 9177 (corresponding to 140 \u00b5mol/kg bw), clearance varied from 254 mL/kg per day in males to 835 mL/kg 9178 per day in females and the serum elimination half-life value was 16.3 and 3.1 h in males and females, 9179 respectively (Table C.3). The percent of dose recovered in urine of female mice after 24 h (ranging from 9180 65 to 68%) was approximately twice that recovered in urine of male mice. A small proportion of the 9181 ingested dose of PFBA (4-11%) was found in feces at 24 h, suggesting incomplete absorption and/or 9182 biliary elimination. PFBA toxicokinetics was also investigated in male and female cynomolgus monkeys 9183 given a single i.v. dose (10 mg/kg bw) (Chang et al., 2008). In both males and females, the clearance 9184 was approximately 1700 mL/kg per day, whereas elimination in urine at 24 h was 42 and 36% of the 9185 administered dose, respectively. The serum elimination half-lives were similar in males and females 9186 (approximately 40 h, Table C.3). 9187 Butenhoff et al. (2012) carried out 28-day and 90-day studies in male and female Sprague Dawley rats 9188 exposed by gavage to ammonium PFBA at doses up to 150 and 30 mg/kg bw per day, respectively. 9189 Each study also included recovery groups that were sacrificed 3 weeks after the end of the dosing 9190 period. Serum and liver concentrations of PFBA were measured at the end of the treatment and recovery 9191 periods. At the end of both 28-day and 90-day dosing periods, males and females had mean serum 9192 PFBA concentrations that increased with dose. For the 30 mg/kg bw per day dose, concentrations 9193 measured in the serum of males were approximately 38 and 52 \u00b5g/mL at the end of the 28-day and 9194 90-day dosing periods, respectively. These values decreased to approximately 0.2 and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL at the 9195 end of the 3 weeks recovery periods, respectively. At the same dose, in females mean serum PFBA 9196 concentrations at the end of the exposure period ranged from 1.7 \u00b5g/mL (28 day) to 5.2 \u00b5g/mL (90 9197 day), and concentrations at the end of recovery were approximately 2-4% of those at the end of the 9198 dosing period. PFBA levels were also measured in the liver. In males exposed during 28 and 90 days at 9199 a dose of 30 mg/kg bw, hepatic concentrations were 17.4 and 16.1 \u00b5g/g, respectively, whereas females 9200 had mean concentrations of 0.4 and 0.9 \u00b5g/g, respectively. At the end of the recovery period 9201 concentrations of PFBA in the liver were close to or below the LOQ (0.050 \u00b5g/g). 9202 Chengelis et al. (2009) investigated parameters of PFHxA in rats and cynomolgus 9203 monkeys. In a first experiment, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single iv dose of 9204 10 mg PFHxA/kg bw (corresponding to 31.8 \u00b5mol/kg mean half-life of PFHxA in serum was 9205 shorter for female than for male rats (0.4 h compared to 1.0 h, Table C.3). In a second experiment, 9206 male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given daily by gavage during 26 days 50, 150, or 300 mg bw (corresponding to differences were 9208 observed between the mean serum concentrations of PFHxA measured 24 h after the first oral dose 9209 compared to the concentrations measured 24 h after the last dose. The half-life of PFHxA in serum was 9210 about 2-3 h regardless of dosage level, sex, or number of doses (Table C.3). Approximately 90% of the 9211 administered daily dose of PFHxA was recovered in the urine of male rats during 24 h post-dosing; in 9212 the same conditions, urinary elimination in female rats was about 80% of the administered dose. There 9213 were no significant sex differences in the toxicokinetics of PFHxA in monkeys following a single iv dose 9214 of 10 mg/kg bw (Table C.3). The average half-life in serum ranged from 2.4 to 5.3 h. 9215 The toxicokinetics of sodium 14C-PFHxA was investigated in rats and mice following a single dose (2 or 9216 100 mg/kg bw by gavage) or after 14 (2 mg/kg unlabelled PFHxA by gavage) followed 9217 by a single oral dose of 14C-PFHxA (Gannon et al., 2011). Absorption was almost complete and rapid 9218 (Tmax between 15 and 30 min after dosing in both species) and bioavailability was nearly 100% at both 9219 levels in both species. In rats the plasma elimination half-life was slightly longer in males (1.5-1.7 h) 9220 than in females (0.5-0.7 h). Half-lives were not calculated in mice. In all tissues except skin, PFHxA was 9221 not quantifiable 24 h after dosing in both sexes of the two species. The primary route of elimination 9222 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 286 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN was via urine (approximately 99% of the dose) in male and female rats and mice, irrespective of the 9223 administered dose. The route and extent of elimination was unchanged after 14 days of daily dosing. 9224 No metabolites were observed in plasma, urine or feces samples. The absence of biotransformation was 9225 confirmed in vitro (incubation of 14C-PFHxA with rat and mouse hepatocytes) in the same study (Gannon 9226 et al., 2011). 9227 The rapid and extensive absorption of PFHxA in rodents as well as its efficient elimination via urine were 9228 confirmed by Iwai (2011) in a study carried out in rats and mice in which animals of both sexes were 9229 orally administered single or daily doses (50 mg/kg bw) of ammonium 14C-PFHxA. 9230 Based on the data from Gannon et al. (2011), Russell et al. (2013) estimated the plasma clearance of 9231 PFHxA at 1957 and 6654 mL/kg per day for male and female rats, respectively. 9232 In a paper dealing with the toxicokinetics of PFHxS in different species, Sundstr\u00f6m et al. (2014) 9233 reported, as unpublished data, half-life values of PFHxA in monkeys (1.5 and 0.8 days for males and 9234 females, respectively). 9235 Fujii et al. (2015) investigated the toxicokinetics of 8 PFCAs with six (C6) to fourteen (C14) carbon 9236 atoms, in male and female FVB/NJcl mice, administered by iv injection (0.31 \u00b5mol/kg bw, single dose, 9237 corresponding or by gavage (3.13 bw, 1 mg/kg 9238 bw), each PFAS separately. After gavage administration or iv injection, PFHxA was not detected in the 9239 serum at any sampling time (LOD = 0.2 nmol/g). 9240 Iwabuchi et al. (2017) administered PFHxA to male rats either as a single dose (gavage, 100 \u00b5g/kg bw) 9241 or in drinking water (1, 5 or 25 \u00b5g/L) for one or three months. PFHxA was very rapidly and completely 9242 absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the body with a half-life ranging from 2 to 4 hours (Table 9243 C.3). No tissue accumulation was observed in the chronic study and the steady state was reached within 9244 a day. 9245 More recently, PFHxA was evaluated in male and female Sprague Dawley rats administered by gavage 9246 doses of 62.6, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw perday for 28 days (NTP, 2019a). At the end of the 9247 experiment, males generally had a higher (1.6 to 3-fold) plasma concentration compared to females. 9248 The liver/plasma ratios, calculated in males only, were less than 1 (0.5 or lower) for animals treated 9249 with the three highest doses (hepatic concentrations > LOQ). 9250 Kudo et al. (2001) investigated the elimination of different PFCAs in rats. In a first experiment, male 9251 and female Wistar rats were administered a single i.p. dose (20 mg/kg bw) of PFHpA and urine and 9252 feces were collected up to 5 days. In a second experiment rats were bile duct-cannulated prior to 9253 administration of a single i.v. dose (25 mg/kg bw) of PFHpA. Bile samples were collected up to 5 h after 9254 the injection. PFHpA was rapidly eliminated in urine, >90% of the dose within 120 minutes in both 9255 males and females. In contrast, fecal elimination was limited, (<2% for both sexes). Part of fecal 9256 elimination was due to biliary excretion of PFHpA, with a significantly faster biliary elimination rate in 9257 females compared to males. 9258 The toxicokinetics of several PFCAs, including among others PFHpA, were studied by Ohmori et al. 9259 (2003) in male and female Wistar rats administered with a single i.v. dose (48.63 \u00b5mol/kg bw, 9260 corresponding to approximately 25 mg/kg bw) of the perfluorinated substance. Half lives in male and 9261 female rats were calculated to be 0.10 and 0.05 days, respectively; total clearances were 1604 and 9262 3070 mL/kg per day, respectively, and distribution volumes were approximately 200 mL/kg in both 9263 sexes (Table C.3). 9264 The toxicokinetics of PFHpA was investigated in male and female mice by Fujii et al. (2015, see above). 9265 Estimated gastrointestinal absorption was > 94% of the orally administered dose (3.13 mol/kg, 9266 corresponding to approximately 1.14 mg/kg bw) in both sexes. In males, 24 h post-dosing via gavage, 9267 PFHpA was not quantifiable in the sampled tissues (serum, liver, kidney, brain, adipose tissue), whereas 9268 in females 1.8% and 0.2% of the administered dose was found in liver and kidney, respectively. The 9269 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 287 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN major route of elimination was via urine (approximately 46% of the dose at 24 h) whereas fecal 9270 excretion represented less than 8% of the dose during the same period for both sexes. In animals 9271 exposed to PFHpA via gavage, total clearances were found to be 293 and 190 mL/kg per day in males 9272 and females, respectively (Table C.3). 9273 After intraperitoneal PFNA (20 mg/kg bw) Wistar rats (Kudo et al., 2001, see above), 9274 elimination in urine within 5 days post-dosing amounted to 2.0% and 52% of the dose in males and 9275 females, respectively; during the same period, fecal elimination was <5% of the dose in males and 9276 <2% of the dose in females. Biliary excretion was investigated in male and female rats injected 9277 intravenously with PFNA at a dose of 25 mg/kg bw and was found to occur at a higher extent in females 9278 compared to males (approximately 0.4% of the dose eliminated within 5 hours after injection in females 9279 compared to less than 0.1% in males), suggesting a more efficient re-absorption mechanism of biliary-9280 excreted PFNA in females. At the end of the experiment, the concentrations of PFNA for males were 9281 approximately 45 \u00b5g/mL and 90 \u00b5g/g in serum and liver, respectively; in females these levels were 9282 approximately 18 and 8 times lower, respectively. 9283 Toxicokinetic parameters of PFNA injected intravenously to Wistar rats at a dose of 48 \u00b5mol/kg bw 9284 (corresponding to 22.3 mg/kg bw) were reported by Ohmori and co-workers (2003). Half-lives in male 9285 and female rats were calculated to be 29.5 and 2.44 days, respectively (Table C.3). A significant sex-9286 related difference was observed for total clearance (6.9 and 105.7 mL/kg per day, in males and females 9287 respectively) and this disparity was mainly due to a significantly lower renal clearance in males compared 9288 to females. Protein binding, estimated in vitro using plasma protein from male and female rats, was 9289 over 98%. 9290 The toxicokinetics of PFNA was investigated Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice by Tatum-Gibbs et 9291 al. (2011). Male and female rats were given a single dose of PFNA by oral gavage at 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg 9292 bw, and blood was collected for analysis at 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 16, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 50 days after treatment. 9293 In addition, PFNA concentrations in liver and kidney were measured at the end of the experiment. For 9294 the 10 mg/kg dose, the Cmax was 89.8 and 68.4 \u00b5g/mL in males and females, respectively. For the 3 9295 mg/kg bw dose, corresponding to 6.47 \u00b5mol/kg bw, an average estimated half-life of 23.6 and 32.0 9296 days for males and females, respectively, was reported (Table C.3). PFNA was found to be stored 9297 preferentially in the liver. Male and female CD-1 mice were given a single oral dose (1 or 10 mg/kg, 9298 corresponding to 2.16 or 21.6 \u00b5mol/kg bw) of PFNA, and animals were killed at time intervals similar to 9299 the rat experiment; blood, liver and kidney were collected. In the mouse, the rates of PFNA serum 9300 elimination were slightly faster in females than males, with estimated serum half-life of 25.7-68.8 days 9301 and 34.4-228 days, respectively, depending on the dose (Table C.3). PFNA was found to be stored 9302 preferentially in the mouse liver. A significantly higher hepatic retention of PFNA was observed in male 9303 mice than in females. The liver/serum concentration ratios ranged from 5 to 15, while kidney/serum 9304 ratios typically range between 0.2 and 0.4. 9305 9306 The toxicokinetics of PFNA was also investigated by Fujii et al. (2015) using male and female FVB/NJcl 9307 mice as models (see PFHxA sub-section for experimental details). Gastrointestinal absorption was found 9308 to be complete in both sexes. After iv injection, total clearance was 3.9 mL/kg per day in males and 5.1 9309 mL/kg per day in females, whereas after gavage administration the values were 4.0 and 2.4 mL/kg per 9310 day, respectively (Table C.3). The distribution volumes reported for mice injected with PFNA were 220 9311 and 150 mL/kg in males and females, respectively. Twenty-four hours after iv injection, a limited portion 9312 of the administered dose was eliminated in urine (1.3% for males and 2.2% for females) and even less 9313 was excreted in faeces (<1 % for both sexes). The majority of the dose was retained in serum (27% 9314 of the dose for males and 32% for females) and liver (69% for males and 46 % for females). For males 9315 and females treated by gavage, urinary elimination and faecal excretion were close to, or below 1% of 9316 the administered dose and the distribution pattern was similar to that found in animals exposed by iv 9317 injection. 9318 Perfluoroalkyl substances Iwabuchi et al. (2017) administered PFNA to male rats either as a single dose (gavage, 50 \u00b5g/kg bw) 9320 or in drinking water (1, 5 or 25 \u00b5g/L) for one or three months. After a 3-month exposure period, PFNA 9321 was found to accumulate mainly in the liver: at the highest dose tested (25 \u00b5g/L) the concentration in 9322 this organ was 2.4 mg/kg. The estimated plasmatic half-life ranged from 18 to 64 days (Table C.3), but 9323 for the liver, the average estimated half-life was 160 days. 9324 In a 28 day study, Sprague Dawley rats were given repeated oral gavage doses of PFNA ranging from 9325 0.625 to 10 mg/kg bw per day in males and from 1.56 to 25 mg/kg bw per day in females. At similar 9326 doses, PFNA plasma concentrations were generally five- to ninefold higher in males compared to 9327 females. The liver/plasma ratios (calculated in males only) ranged from 0.9 to 2.6 (NTP, 2019a). 9328 Kim et al. (2019) investigated the tissue distribution and excretion of PFNA in rats i.v. administered 9329 PFNA dose of 3 mg/kg bw. PFNA distributed preferentially in the liver and the kidney. The liver 9330 distribution of PFNA in male rats was about 2.5 times higher than that in female rats. In males, the 9331 cumulative excretion of PFNA in \u00b1 0.45% of the dose, whereas corresponding values in females were 34.56 \u00b1 2.21% and 3.13 \u00b1 2.18%, 9333 respectively, showing that urine is the major excretion route of PFNA in rats and that elimination occurs 9334 at a higher extent in females than in males. Based on the i.v. study and using a one-compartment 9335 model, the serum elimination half-lives in male and female rats were estimated to be 40.2 and 4.4 days, 9336 respectively, and the clearances were 7.4 and 16.6 mL/kg per day, respectively (Table C.3). 9337 9338 Disposition of PFAS was investigated in rats by Kudo et al. (2001, see above). In males and females, 9339 the concentrations of PFDA in the serum and the liver at the end of the experiment were approximately 9340 37 \u00b5g/mL and 130 \u00b5g/g, respectively. 9341 Ohmori et al. (2003) investigated the toxicokinetics of PFDA in rats (see above experimental conditions 9342 for PFHpA). Half-lives in male and female rats were found to be 40 and 59 days, respectively; distribution 9343 volumes were 348 and 441 mL/kg, respectively and total clearances were approximately 5 mL/kg per 9344 day in both sexes (Table C.3). 9345 Toxicokinetic parameters of PFDA in mice were also reported by Fujii et al. (2015, see PFHxA sub-9346 section for experimental details). Gastrointestinal absorption was found to be almost 100% of the 9347 administered dose for both sexes. After iv injection, total clearance was 2.2 mL/kg per day in males and 9348 2.8 mL/kg per day in females, whereas after gavage administration the values were 3.9 and 2.2 mL/kg 9349 per day, respectively (Table C.3). The distribution volumes reported for mice injected with PFNA were 9350 250 and 200 mL/kg in males and females, respectively. Irrespective of the route of administration and 9351 of the sex, 0-24 h urinary and faecal excretions were close to, or below 1% of the dose and most of the 9352 administered PFDA was retained in the liver. 9353 Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were given for 28 days oral gavage doses of PFDA ranging from 9354 0.156 to 2.5 mg/kg bw per day. PFDA plasma concentrations were slightly higher (30 % or less) in 9355 females compared to males. The liver/plasma ratios (calculated in males only) decreased with dose from 9356 5.3 to 1.6 (NTP, 2019a). The toxicokinetics of PFDA wererecently examined in male and female rats by 9357 Kim et al. (2019). After i.v. administration of PFDA to rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg bw, PFDA was mainly 9358 distributed to the liver, followed by the kidney, with slightly higher values in males compared to females. 9359 The cumulative excretion of PFDA in urine and 11.22 \u00b1 5.28% and 16.44 \u00b1 in female rats, respectively. Based on the i.v. 9361 study and using a one-compartment model, the serum elimination half-lives in male and female rats 9362 were estimated to be 109 and 50 days, respectively, and the clearances were 0.76 and 0.81 mL/kg per 9363 day, were studied by Fujii et al. (2015) in 9365 mice (see experimental details in PFHxA sub-section). The gastrointestinal absorption of these 9366 perfluorinated compounds having between 11 to 14 perfluorinated carbon atoms was at or near 100% 9367 for both males and females. The analyses of the tissues and organs 24 h after i.v. injection or gavage 9368 administration showed that most of the perfluorinated compounds were distributed to the liver and, to 9369 a lesser extent to the serum in both males and females. For C11 to C14 compounds, urinary elimination 9370 during the 0-24 h period was 0.1% of the dose, irrespective of the route of administration and of the 9371 sex. During the same period, fecal excretion was approximately 1% of the dose for C11 to C14 injected 9372 intravenously. When administration occurred by gavage, fecal excretion was slightly higher than via i.v. 9373 for PFTrDA (1.7 - 3.1% of the dose, depending on the sex) and PFTeDA (3.0 - 6.1 % of the dose, 9374 depending on the sex). Most of the C11 to C14 compounds were retained in the liver (64-78% for males, 9375 47-53% for females). After i.v. injection, total clearance varied from 2.8 mL/kg per day for PFUnDA to 9376 10.4 mL/kg per day for PFTeDA, whereas after gavage administration the values were from 3.1 mL/kg 9377 per day for PFUnDA to 106.3 mL/kg per day for PFTeDA (Table C.3). When the total clearances of 9378 gavage- and i.v.-administered mice are compared, disparities exist long-chain perfluroalkyl 9379 carboxylic acids (C13 and C14), suggesting for these compounds that bile is an important elimination 9380 route. 9381 9382 There were no marked differences between sexes. The distribution volumes reported for mice injected 9383 with PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA and PFTeDA, varied from 280 to 430 mL/kg in males and from 330 to 9384 580 mL/kg in females. 9385 9386 Interactions with binding proteins, including carriers and transporters 9387 Interactions with proteins, namely serum albumin, liver fatty acid binding proteins (L-FABP), and transporters influence the toxicokinetics of PFASs. 9389 9390 Although several authors investigated binding of PFASs (mainly PFCAs) to albumin, few studies tested 9391 a series of perfluorinated compounds using the same methodology. Using in vitro approaches PFNA and 9392 PFDA were found to bind to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at levels greater than (Bischel et al., 2010; Vanden Heuvel et al., 1992). The association constants are on the 9394 order of 105M-1 for PFNA, PFDA and et al., 2010). 9395 Bischel et al. (2011) investigated the associations, at bound (> 9397 95%) to BSA, except PFDoDA (80%). Affinity of PFCAs for BSA, estimated on the basis of the protein-9398 water distribution coefficient ( KPW) increases with PFCAs decreases from to 11 9399 perfluorinated carbons, probably due to steric hindrances associated with longer and more rigid 9400 perfluoroalkyl chains. Log KPW ranges from 3.3 to 4.3. Additional observations at pH-induced changes 9401 in binding affinity support evidence that short- and long-chain PFCAs bind at different locations on BSA. 9402 9403 Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) is a lipid binding protein highly expressed in the liver as well 9404 as in the intestine and the kidney. L-FABP appears to have a higher affinity for PFCAs than albumin. 9405 Using purified recombinant rat liver L-FABP, Woodcroft et al. (2010) tested its interaction with PFCAs 9406 having perfluorinated carbons chain length of 4 to 8. They found an increasing affinity from PFPA to 9407 PFNA. Additional data on interaction of PFCAs with L-FABP are presented in section 3.3.1.2. 9408 9409 In rat as in human, PFCA renal active excretion and reabsorption are mediated through an organic anion 9410 transport system (Table C.1). The roles of the five rat renal organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT2, 9411 OAT3, URAT1, (C2-C18) were 9412 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 290 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN investigated by Weaver et al. (2010). OAT1 and OAT3 reside in the basolateral membrane of the 9413 proximal tubular cells, and would facilitate PFCA renal tubular secretion. In contrast, due to their 9414 expression in the apical membrane of the proximal tubular cells, OATP1A1, OAT2, OAT4, and URAT1 9415 would be the transporters involved in PFCA renal tubular reabsorption (Han et al., 2012). Inhibition of 9416 uptake of model substrates was measured for the different transporters. PFHxA, PFOA 9417 inhibitor. PFOA and PFNA were the strongest inhibitors for OAT3-mediated estrone-3-sulfate transport, while OATP1A1-9419 mediated estradiol-17-glucuronide uptake was PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnDA, with PFDA giving 9420 the strongest inhibition. No strong inhibitors were found for OAT2 or URAT1. Kinetic analysis was 9421 performed for the strongest inhibitors. OAT1 transported PFHpA with a Km value of 50.5 M, OAT3 9422 transported PFNA with a Km value 174.5 M. OATP1A1-mediated transport yielded Km values of 20.5 9423 (PFNA), and 28.5 M (PFDA). These data suggest that OAT1 and OAT3 are involved in renal secretion 9424 of PFHpA and PFNA, whereas OATP1A1 can of PFNA and PFDA. 9425 9426 Table C.1 Uptake transporters that have been reported to mediate PFAS membrane transport in renal 9427 tubular cells, hepatocytes and enterocytes (extracted from Weaver et al., 2010; Han et al., 2012; 9428 Zhao et al., 2015, 2017) 9429 Cell types Excretion (re-)absorption Human Rat blood); 9430 b: expressed at the apical membrane (exchanges with urine or bile or intestinal lumen). 9431 Note that uptake transporters may be capable of being bi-directional (uptake and efflux). 9432 OAT = organic anion transporter, 9433 carrier family gene, 9434 URAT = uric acid transporter, a member of the OAT family, 9435 OATP = PFOS, the most investigated PFSA, is known to be well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, to be 9441 resistant to biotransformation and to be mainly retained in liver and plasma (EFSA 2008, 2018). These 9442 properties are confirmed in articles and reports published recently (Chou and Lin, 2019, Gomis et al., 9443 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo 2019b; Pizzuro et al., 2019). The NTP study showed that in male and 9444 female Sprague Dawley rats administered once daily by gavage, for 28 days, to PFOS doses from 0.312 9445 to 5 mg/kg bw per day, plasma concentrations were similar in males and females and the liver/plasma 9446 ratios, (measured in males only) ranged from 2.7 to 3.8 (NTP, 2019b). After a single gavage 9447 administration of 2 mg/kg PFOS to male and female Sprague Dawley rats, Huang and co-workers found 9448 a liver/plasma ratio of 3-4 in females, whereas in males, the ratio increased from ca 5 (1 d post-dose) 9449 to 30 (140 d post-dose); a half-life of about 38 days was calculated in both sexes (Huang et al., 2019). 9450 Table C.2 summarises selected TK parameters for PFOS. 9451 To date, only limited data were published on the toxicokinetics of PFSAs other than PFOS. PFBS and 9452 PFHxS were investigated in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys, but no data were identified regarding 9453 the toxicokinetics of PFHpS and PFDS. Based on animal experiments, the gastrointestinal absorption of 9454 investigated PFSAs is estimated between 50% of the dose for PFBS to almost 100% for PFHxS (ATSDR, 9455 2018). As previously reported for PFOS, there are no indications that PFSAs are metabolised. 9456 A series of studies was undertaken by Olsen et al. (2009) to evaluate the toxicokinetics of PFBS in rats 9457 and monkeys. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose of 30 mg potassium 9458 PFBS/kg bw by either iv injection or oral gavage. In male and female rats dosed orally, mean Tmax 9459 values were 0.4 and 0.3 h, respectively, suggesting a rapid gastrointestinal absorption of PFBS. The 9460 mean serum PFBS concentrations at 24 h were significantly higher in males (0.38\u00b10.07 \u00b5g/mL) than in 9461 females (0.02\u00b10.01 \u00b5g/mL). At 96 h, the amount of PFBS found in the liver of males and females 9462 corresponded to approximately 0.03 and 0.05% of the administered dose, respectively. The comparison 9463 of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values obtained from the i.v. and oral studies resulted in a 9464 bioavailability of 100% in females, and 55% in males. In orally treated animals, approximately 69% and 9465 74% of the administered dose were found in urine after 24 h in males and females, respectively, 9466 whereas fecal excretion was 0.5% in both sexes. The mean serum half-life values were significantly 9467 shorter in males (4.7 h) than females (7.4 h) for animals orally exposed, but no difference was observed 9468 for animals intravenously injected (Table C.3). 9469 In cynomolgus monkeys given a single iv dose of 10 mg/kg potassium PFBS, there were no statistically 9470 significant differences between males and females for any of the toxicokinetic parameters (Olsen et al., 9471 2009). Mean serum concentration at 24 h was approximately 8 \u00b5g/mL. The percentage of administered 9472 dose recovered in urine from 0 to 24 h ranged from 33.8 to 86.8%. Mean serum elimination half-lives 9473 in male and female monkeys were 95 h and 83 h, respectively (Table C.3). 9474 Chengelis et al. (2009) investigated the toxicokinetic parameters of PFBS in rats and monkeys, using 9475 the same experimental design as for PFHxA (see section C.1). In Sprague-Dawley rats given a single iv 9476 dose of 10 mg PFBS/kg bw, the half-life of PFBS in serum was shorter for female than male rats (0.64 9477 h compared to 2.1 h) and apparent clearance from the serum was approximately 7- to 8-fold higher for 9478 female rats than for male rats (Table C.3). Approximately 70% of the administered dose of PFBS was 9479 recovered in the urine of male and female rats during the 0-24 h period. In monkeys given a single iv 9480 dose of 10 mg/kg bw, the half-life of PFBS in serum ranged from 8.1 to 15 h. 9481 Adult male C57/BL6 mice were dietary exposed for 1-5 days to 16 mg/kg bw per day) of 35S-PFBS 9482 (Bogdanska et al., 2014). PFBS was found to distribute to most of the twenty tissues examined. The 9483 tissue levels increased from 1 to 3 days of exposure but appeared thereafter to level-off in most cases. 9484 After 5 days of treatment the highest PFBS levels were detected in liver, gastrointestinal tract, blood, 9485 kidney, cartilage, whole bone, lungs and thyroid gland. 9486 Recently, PFBS was evaluated in male and female Sprague Dawley rats administered by repeated 9487 gavage doses of 62.6, 125, 250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg bw per day for 28 days (NTP, 2019b). Males 9488 generally had higher (5- to 18-fold) plasma concentrations compared to females across all dose groups. 9489 The liver/plasma ratios (calculated in males only) ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 across the doses. 9490 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 292 EFSA Journal Huang et al. (2019a) investigated the toxicokinetics of PFBS in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. 9491 After a single i.v. or gavage administration, concentrations were measured in the plasma, liver, kidney 9492 and brain. In all tissues, concentrations decreased slightly over time, with females having a faster 9493 decrease than males, and were as follows: liver > kidney > brain. In males, the liver/plasma ratio was 9494 generally above 1, dropping below 1 at 12h, whereas in females the ratio was 1.5-2 times lower than 9495 in males. After i.v. administration, plasma half-lives were 0.4 and 2.3 h in females and males, 9496 respectively, whereas after gavage these values averaged 1.3 and 3.3 h (Table C.3). 9497 9498 Butenhoff et al. (2009) exposed by oral gavage male and female Sprague Dawley rats to potassium 9499 PFHxS at dose levels of 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg for 2 weeks prior to mating and during mating, gestation 9500 and lactation (postnatal day 22) for parental females as well as during 6 weeks for males. The mean 9501 serum PFHxS concentrations in parent males at the end of the exposure period ranged from 44 g/mL 9502 at 0.3 mg/kg to 201 g/mL at 10 from postnatal 22, serum 9503 concentrations from 9 g/mL at 0.3 mg/kg to 94 g/mL at 10 mg/kg. At the end of gestation, 9504 maternal serum PFHxS ranged from 3 g/mL at 0.3 mg/kg to 60 g/mL at 10 mg/kg. At doses of 1.0 9505 mg/kg per day or higher, PFHxS-treated rats appeared to have reached serum steady state by after 2 9506 weeks as their serum PFHxS concentrations were not statistically different between 2 and 6 weeks. 9507 Mean liver to serum PFHxS concentration ratio determined after 6 weeks of exposure ranged from 9508 approximately 1 to 3 for parent males, depending on dose, whereas in females and pups, this ratio 9509 never exceeded 0.4. 9510 Comparative toxicokinetics of PFHxS in Dawley rats, and cynomolgus monkeys were 9511 reported by Sundstr\u00f6m et al. (2012). After a single oral dose of potassium PFHxS (10 mg/kg bw/d), 9512 given to male and female rats either by gavage or i.v., the toxicokinetics parameters were estimated 9513 using a two-compartment model. Based on the iv study, the serum elimination half-lives in male and 9514 female rats were 6.83 and 1.83 days, respectively, and the clearances were 40.3 and 119 mL/kg per 9515 day, respectively (Table C.3). At 24 h, the PFHxS mean serum concentrations after oral administration 9516 were 61 and 30 \u00b5g/mL, for males and females respectively. For females, the comparison of the AUC 9517 value obtained from the iv and oral studies resulted in a bioavailability of 50%. The female Tmax value 9518 after oral dosing was estimated to be at approximately 30 min, suggesting a rapid gastro-intestinal 9519 absorption process. Due to the short duration of the observation period (24 h) and hence to the lack of 9520 significant serum elimination over this period, the estimation of most of the parameters was considered 9521 as poorly reliable, especially for males. A second experiment was conducted in male and female rats 9522 given a single iv dose of potassium PFHxS (10 mg/kg bw per day) followed up for 10 weeks. The 9523 toxicokinetics parameters were estimated using a two-compartment model for males and one-9524 compartment model for females. At the end of the experiment, the mean serum PFHxS concentration 9525 in males was approximately 6 g/mL, whereas it was below the LOQ (0.01 g/mL) in females. The half-9526 life was estimated to be approximately 29 days in male rats, but only 1.6 days in females (Table C.3), 9527 indicating strong sex-related differences. The clearances were 6.71 and 53.35 mL/kg per day in males 9528 and females, respectively. A third experiment was designed to investigate the distribution and 9529 elimination routes of PFHxS in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. The percentage of the PFHxS 9530 administered dose recovered in serum, liver, urine, and feces 96 h after a single oral dose of either 1, 9531 10, or 100 mg potassium PFHxS/kg bw was determined. Regardless of sex, mean serum PFHxS 9532 concentrations were non-linearly related to dose. Female serum and liver concentrations were 9533 considerably lower than those of males given an equivalent dose. For instance, for males, at the lowest 9534 dose tested (1 mg/kg bw), approximately 18 and 31% of the dose was found in serum and liver, 9535 respectively, whereas for females these values were 7 and 2%, respectively. Urine was the major route 9536 of excretion in male and female rats. Within 96 h following a single oral dose at 1, 10, and 100 mg 9537 PFHxS/kg bw, females excreted 35%, 28%, and in urine, respectively, whereas urinary 9538 excretion for males was only about 6-7% of the dose at the 1 and 10 mg/kg dose level, but 30% at the 9539 mg/kg dose level. Fecal excretion was limited (<1 % of administered dose), irrespective of the dose 9540 or the sex. 9541 Additional studies were carried out in male and female mice given a single oral dose of potassium PFHxS 9542 (1 or 20 mg/kg bw) and followed for 23 weeks (Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2012). Regardless of sex, dose or 9543 sampling time, mean PFHxS concentrations were highest in serum followed by liver and then kidney. As 9544 indicated in Table C.3, mean serum half-life values were quite similar between male and female mice 9545 (approximately 30 versus 25 days for 1 mg/kg bw and 28 versus 27 days for 20 mg/kg bw for males 9546 and females, respectively). Clearances were similar between sexes and were approximately 3 and 4 9547 mL/kg bw per day for the doses of 1 and 20 mg/kg bw, respectively. Urinary elimination predominated, 9548 but was slow and no indication of a clear sex-related difference was observed. Based on the data 9549 provided by the authors, a urinary elimination of about 30% of the administered dose within 2 months 9550 may be estimated. During the same period, total fecal excretion was likely close to or below 1% of the 9551 administered dose. 9552 In male and female cynomolgus monkeys given a single i.v. dose of 10 mg potassium PFHxS/kg bw and 9553 followed during 24 weeks, mean serum elimination half-lives were less for females (87 \u00b1 27 days) than 9554 males (141 \u00b1 30 days), however this difference was not statistically significant (Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2012). 9555 The toxicokinetics of PFHxS in female and male Sprague Dawley rats after a single i.v. or oral 9556 administration of 10 mg/kg bw were investigated by Kim et al. (2016). They found that PFHxS was 9557 almost completely absorbed in both sexes and was more rapidly absorbed in the female rats (Tmax of 9558 1.37 h) than in the male rats (3.11 days). The measurement of PFHxS concentrations in different tissues 9559 at the end of the experiment (72 days in males, 14 days in females) showed that the highest values 9560 were found in the liver and the kidney. Based on the i.v. study and using a two-compartment model, 9561 the serum elimination half-lives in male and female rats were 20.7 and 0.88 days, respectively, and the 9562 clearances were 9.0 and 227.9 mL/kg per day, respectively (Table C.3). The calculated excreted 9563 percentage of the i.v. dose of PFHxS in female and male rats was 28.02 and 8.26% in urine, respectively, 9564 showing a significant sex difference, probably due to differences in the transport and renal re-absorption 9565 process of PFHxS between male and female rats. 9566 Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were given for 28 days oral gavage doses of PFHxS ranging from 9567 0.625 to 2.5 mg/kg bw per day (males) or from 3.12 to 50 mg/kg bw per day (females). Although 9568 females were administered doses five times higher than those administered to males, the female plasma 9569 concentrations were about half of male concentrations. The liver/plasma ratios (calculated in males 9570 only) ranged from 0.6 to 1.2 (NTP, 2019b). The toxicokinetic parameters of PFHxS after a single i.v. or 9571 gavage administration in male and female Sprague Dawley rats were reported recently by Huang et al. 9572 (2019). In both sexes, concentrations of PFHxS were highest in the liver, around 1- to 3-fold less in the 9573 kidney and 40-fold less in the brain. Liver/plasma ratios ranged from 0.5 to 0.82 and from 0.29 to 0.55 9574 in males and females, respectively. Based on the i.v. study and using a two-compartment model, the 9575 serum elimination half-lives in female and male rats were 0.7 and 13 days, respectively. After gavage 9576 administration with the lower dose tested (4 mg/kg bw), the half-life based on a one compartment 9577 model was 17.6 days in males whereas it was 7.5-fold shorter in females (Table C.3). 9578 Interactions with binding proteins including carrier and transporters 9579 Bischel et al. (2011) investigated the associations, at low ligand concentrations, of PFBS, PFHxS and 9580 PFOS with BSA. All the were highly bound (> 99%) to BSA. PFBS exhibits higher affinity the equivalent chain-length PFCA (PFPA). 9582 Zhao et al. (2015) demonstrated that the uptake of PFBS, PFHxS and PFOS into freshly isolated rat and 9583 human hepatocytes is mediated by sodium-dependent mechanisms through Na+/taurocholate co- 9584 transporting polypeptide (Ntcp), a bile salt transporter expressed at the sinusoidal membrane of 9585 hepatocytes (See Table C.1). More recently, the same team found that rat organic anion transporting 9586 polypeptides OATP1A1, OATP1A5, food 2017). Thus, both Na+/taurocholate co- 9588 transporting polypeptide and the transporters of the OATP family could contribute to the enterohepatic 9589 circulation of PFSAs in rodents. It is also plausible that these transporters play a role in the accumulation 9590 of PFSAs in the liver. 9591 Perfluoroalkyl substances 295 C.2 PFAS (sex) Routej Dose (mol/kg) Half-life Clearance to t (mL/kg per day) Volume of distributio n (mL/kg) Reference PFOS Rat (F) Rat (M) Rat (F) Rat (M) Rat (F) Rat (M) Rat (F) Rat (M) Rat (F) Rat (M) Rat (F) Rat (M) Rat (F) Rat (M) Mice (F) Mice (M) Mice (F) Mice (M) Monkey (F) Monkey (M) G G G G i.v. i.v.

(2009) conducted an isomer-specific disposition study following a single oral dose of a 9615 PFAS mixture administered by gavage to male Sprague Dawley The dose as impurities. The PFNA isomer profiles in 9618 the dose and in blood suggested both preferential uptake and elimination of iso-PFNA. The half-lives for 9619 iso-PFNA and n-PFNA, were 20.7 days and 40.6 days respectively. On day 3 post-dosing, maximum 9620 concentrations were found in liver (2.7 and 2.3 \u00b5g/g for iso-PFNA and n-PFNA, respectively). 9621 Approximately 33% of administered PFNA was excreted in urine throughout the experiment (38 days), 9622 with the remainder in feces. The portion of iso-PFNA in urine and feces was 63 and 57% of the dose, 9623 respectively. The same team repeated the experiment selecting a subchronic exposure instead of a 9624 single dose study (De Silva et al., 2009). Male and female Sprague Dawleys rats were dietary exposed 9625 to the same mixture of isomers for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week depuration period. On day 38 of 9626 the exposure period (steady state), the greatest site of accumulation was the liver. Levels of n-PFNA 9627 and iso-PFNA in female liver tissue corresponded to 1.3 and 0.37 \u00b5g/g, respectively, whereas in males 9628 the corresponding levels were 9.9 and 6.3 \u00b5g/g, respectively. Half-lives of 47 and 31 days for n-PFNA 9629 and iso-PFNA in male rats and 2.1 and 0.8 days in females were reported. PFHxS data suggest 9630 preferential absorption of the linear isomer. Branched isomers were eliminated quickly from all tissues, 9631 such that only n-PFHxS was detectable on day 38. In blood, the half-life of linear PFHxS was 15.9 days 9632 whereas for branched isomers it varied from 3.5 days to 6.9 days. Liver half-life of n-PFHxS was over 3 9633 times longer than that estimated for blood. Elimination of branched isomers occurred primarily via urine. 9634 In a study carried out by Numata et al. (2014), the fate of 7 PFCAs and PFSAs, was investigated in male 9635 and female pigs fed during three weeks a diet contaminated with a mixture of these PFASs. Absorption, 9636 tissue distribution and excretion were measured and the half-lives were estimated. \u00b1 13, 22.4 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5g/kg. Only the data for PFHxA suggest a steady state 9639 after 3 weeks of exposure. For PFBS, the estimation of the time to 95% completion of the steady state 9640 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 299 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN was 217 days, whereas it was between 1 and 10 years for the rest of the compounds. At the end of the 9641 experiment, more than 80% of the total mass PFBS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS, PFOA was found and other tissues. For PFHpA and PFHxA, this percentage was approximately 60% and 20%, 9643 respectively. For all investigated substances except PFOS, blood plasma was the largest reservoir of 9644 unexcreted PFAS and less than 7% of unexcreted PFAS present in the liver (for PFOS approximately 9645 35% of the ingested dose was found in the liver). Fecal excretion occurred at a limited extent for all 9646 investigated PFASs (less than 8% of the ingested dose). Elimination in urine was < 5% of the dose for 9647 PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOS and ranging from 10 and PFBS and higher than 60% for 9648 PFHxA. No significant differences were observed between males and females. The half-life was 9649 estimated to be 4, 43 and 74 days for PFHxA, PFBS and PFHpA, respectively. It was approximately 0.6, 9650 1.1, 1.8 and 2 years for PFOA, PFHpS, PFOS and PFHxS, respectively. 9651 Guruge et al. (2016) investigated the toxicokinetics micro-minipigs weighing 9-9653 14 kg. After a single gelatin capsule filled with a mixture, corresponding to a dose of 3 mg/kg bw of 9654 each of the 10 tested substances, was given, they found that absorption of PFBA, PFPeA and PFHxA 9655 was rapid, with concentrations in the blood reaching the maximum in less than 12 h. The maximum 9656 levels of the rest of the PFASs in the blood were reached at 24-48 h after the exposure. PFPeA had the 9657 shorterstblood half-life followed by PFHxA, being 1.6 and 2.7 days, respectively. In contrast, PFOS 9658 elimination from the blood was the slowest, with a half-life of 86.6 PFUnDA, PFOS, PFDA and PFNA were the liver, whereas for PFBA, PFHpA and PFOA, the concentration was higher in the blood than in the 9662 liver. At the end of the experiment, PFPeA and PFHxA were undetected in blood and liver whereas the 9663 PFNA body burden was the highest among the tested PFASs. 9664 C.4 Other PFASs 9665 Some other PFASs can precursors and degrade or biotransform to PFSAs and PFCAs. The 9666 environmental degradation is reported in the environmental fate section, whereas the biotransformation 9667 in experimental animals or in biological in vitro models is described hereinafter. Most of the studies have 9668 been performed on 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2 FTOH), whereas there have been limited 9669 investigations on non-FTOH metabolism. 9670 The toxicokinetics of 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol was reviewed by ECHA (ECHA, 2013) and is summarised 9671 in Table C.4. In rats 8:2 FTOH is rapidly absorbed (absorption rate estimated between 27 and 57%, 9672 depending on the dose), and the parent compound and metabolites are quickly distributed to blood and 9673 tissues (Hagen et al., 1981; Martin et al., 2005; Fasano et al., 2006). At 7 days following the 9674 administration of radiolabelled 8:2 FTOH, 4-7% of the orally administered dose was present in the 9675 tissues as parent compound and related metabolites and the levels in the majority of these tissues were 9676 greater than in whole blood, with the highest levels observed in fat, liver, thyroid and adrenals (Fasano 9677 et al., 2006). Elimination was mainly via faeces (>70%) and biliary excretion was between 20 and 45 9678 % of the administered dose, depending on the dose. Less than 4% of the administered dose was 9679 excreted in urine, and females eliminated more than males (Fasano et al., 2006). Metabolites identified 9680 in plasma, urine and feces were in principle glucuronide and glutathione conjugates of the parent FTOH and most metabolites were rapidly or completely cleared from the tissues (8:2 FTOH t 1/2 = 9683 approximately 5 h), with the exception of PFOA (particularly in males). The half-life based on total 9684 radioactivity (Fasano et al., 2006) was approximately 9 and 7 days in males and females respectively. 9685 Whereas single dose studies showed no differences between sexes in metabolic profiles, the repeated 9686 dose study carried out by Fasano et al. (2009) resulted in levels of PFCAs (PFNA, PFOA and PFHpA) 9687 consistently higher in male livers than in female livers (Table C.4). 9688 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 300 EFSA 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Dagnino et al. (2016) administered by oral gavage a single dose of 8:2 FTOH at 5 or 50 mg/kg bw to 9689 male Sprague Dawley rats and blood, urine, and feces samples were collected at 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 9690 120 h after dosing. In the 50 mg/kg bw group, the highest concentration of metabolites measured serum was for PFOA (1,995 ng/mL), PFNA ng/mL. In 9692 urine, PFOA (303.6 ng/mL) was PFNA concentration was 0.84 9693 ng/mL. Other PFCAs were not examined (Table C.4). 9694 Recently, Huang et al. (2019b) investigated the toxicokinetics of 8:2 FTOH in male and female Sprague 9695 Dawley rats given a single dose via gavage or i.v. of 8:2 FTOH. The parent substance and its two 9696 metabolites (PFOA and 7:3-fluorotelomer acid [7:3-FTA]) were determined in plasma, liver, kidney, and 9697 brain. There was rapid absorption and distribution of 8:2-FTOH after gavage administration and the 9698 plasma elimination half-life ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 h. Bioavailability of 8:2-FTOH ranged from 22 to 41% 9699 for both sexes with no dose-dependent trends. 8:2-FTOH metabolites, PFOA and 7:3-FTA were detected 9700 in plasma following administration of the parent FTOH. The plasma half-life of PFOA was longer in males 9701 than in females (198-353 h and 4.47-6.9 h, respectively). The plasma half life of 7:3-FTA was around 9702 2-3 days in both sexes. 8:2-FTOH and 7:3-FTA were detected in all tissues; PFOA was found in the liver 9703 and kidney (Table C.4), but not in the brain. Detectable concentrations of metabolites persisted longer 9704 than the parent FTOH. Sex differences were observed in the tissue distribution and elimination of PFOA, 9705 but not 8:2-FTOH and 7:3-FTA. 9706 Henderson and Smith (2007) examined the metabolism and disposition of 8:2 FTOH in timed-pregnant 9707 mice exposed to a single gavage dose (30 mg /kg bw) (Table C.4). During gestation (GD9 to GD18), 9708 maternal serum and liver concentrations of PFOA decreased from 789 \u00b1 41 to 668 \u00b1 23 ng/mL and 9709 from \u00b1 23 to 587 \u00b1 55 ng/g, respectively. PFOA was transferred to the developing fetuses as early 9710 as 24-h post-treatment with concentrations increasing from 45 on PND15 9713 and PFNA concentrations, although five-fold less, exhibited a similar trend. Immediately after birth, pups 9714 were cross-fostered with dams that had been treated during gestation with 8:2 FTOH or vehicle in order 9715 to investigate exposure through lactation. At both PND3 and PND15, PFOA and PNDA were detected in 9716 serum and liver from neonates exposed pre- and/or postnatally, indicating that maternal exposure to 9717 8:2 FTOH results in both in utero and lactational exposure to PFOA and PNDA. 9718 In vitro data (Table C.4) suggest that hepatocytes from rats, mice and humans have the ability to 9719 biotransform 8:2 FTOH into several PFCAs (Nabb et hepatocytes produced about 20- 9720 and 12-fold less and respectively. 9721 PAPs biotransformation proceeds via the hydrolysis of the phosphate linkage, yielding the 9722 corresponding FTOH, which is then available oxidation. Both mono-AP and di-PAP congener uptake, 9723 biotransformation and elimination were in rats (see Table C.4). 9724 Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered a single dose of 200 mg/kg by oral gavage of mono-9725 phosphate ( 8:2 taken over 9726 15 days post-dosing (D'Eon and Mabury, 2007). Both compounds were synthesised by the authors and 9727 were 97% pure and contained < 0.01% PFOA. Upon completion of the time-course study, the animals 9728 were redosed using an identical dosing procedure, with sacrifice and necropsy 24 h after the second 9729 dosing. Increased levels of PFOA, along with both 8:2 PAPs congeners, were observed in the blood of 9730 the dosed animals. In the 8:2 monoPAPS-dosed animals, 8:2 monoPAPs and PFOA blood concentrations 9731 peaked 7900 \u00b1 1200 ng/g and 34 \u00b1 4 ng/g, respectively. In the 8:2 diPAPS-dosed animals, 8:2 9732 diPAPS concentration peaked at 32 \u00b1 6 ng/g, and 8:2 monoPAPs and PFOA peaked at \u00b1 200 ng/g 9733 and 3.8 \u00b1 0.3 ng/g, respectively. As indicated in Table C.4, in addition to PFOA, PFHpA was also 9734 observed in the animals dosed with monoPAPs. Consistent with other fluorinated contaminants, the 9735 tissue distributions showed increased levels of both PFOA and the 8:2 PAPs congeners in the liver 9736 relative to the other tissues measured. 9737 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 301 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN A subsequent study by the same authors carried out in rats administered by gavage or by iv injection a 9738 single dose of various congeners of mono-PAPs or di-PAPs (see Table C.4), mono- di-PAP congeners were estimated to be in the d range. 9741 (D'Eon and Mabury, 2011). 9742 Dagnino et al. (2016) investigated the metabolism of 8:2 diPAP in male Sprague Dawley rats (see above 9743 experimental details). PFOA and PFNA highest concentrations in serum of animals dosed at 50 mg/kg 9744 dosed animals were 36.1 ng/mL and 1.5 ng/mL, respectively. In urine, PFOA and PFNA concentrations 9745 were approximately 6 and 0.6 ng/mL, respectively. Other PFCAs were not examined (Table C.4). 9746 Ross et al. (2012) investigated the isomer specific of perfluorooctane sulfonamide ( FOSA) in male 9747 SpragueDawley rats exposed to commercial FOSA (purity not indicated) via food for 77 days (83.0 9748 ng/kg bw per day), followed by 27 days of depuration. Elimination half-lives of the two major branched 9749 FOSA isomers (2.5 \u00b1 1.0 days and 3.7 \u00b1 1.2 days) were quicker than for linear FOSA (5.9 \u00b1 4.6 days), 9750 resulting in a depletion of branched FOSA isomers in blood and tissues relative to the total dosed FOSA. 9751 A significant enrichment of 5m-PFOS and a significant depletion of 1m-PFOS were observed in serum, 9752 relative to authentic electrochemical PFOS. The results confirm that in vivo exposure to commercially 9753 relevant PFOS-precursors can result in a distinct PFOS isomer profile. 9754 Female Sprague Dawley rats were administered EtFOSE (purity > 99%) by gavage for 3 weeks, at 5 9755 mg/kg bw per day and several putative metabolites were analysed in liver and serum (Xie et al., 2009). 9756 Levels of EtFOSE and FOSE in serum and liver were in the low \u00b5g/kg range, whereas EtFOSA was not 9757 detected in either matrix. In contrast, levels of EtFOSAA were in the low mg/kg range in the liver and 9758 serum. FOSA hepatic levels were also in the low mg/kg range, but were approximately one order of 9759 magnitude lower in serum. The major metabolite detected in both liver and serum was PFOS (Table 9760 C.4), with levels that were at least 10 times higher compared to the five perfluorooctanesulfonamides. 9761 The liver-to-serum ratios ranged from 1.3 for EtFOSAA to 10.1 for FOSA and decreased in the order 9762 FOSA>FOSE>PFOS>EtFOSAA. The formation of EtFOSAA, FOSA and PFOS was also observed in rat 9763 liver slices incubated with EtFOSE (Xu et al., 2004; data not presented in Table C.4). 9764 9765 Perfluoroalkyl in food C.4 Summary of perfluorinated FTOH NE NE NE NE Plasma ND NS Hagen et al., 1981 Male rats (single ip injection) 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Plasma, Liver Kidney Plasma, Liver Kidney NE Martin et al., 2005 Rats (gavage, single dose) 14C-8:2 FTOH ND ND Plasma Urine Feces Plasma Plasma Urine Feces Plasma ND Fasano et al., 2006 Rats (gavage, repeated doses) + 14C-8:2 Tissuesc, Urine Plasma, Tissuesc, Urine ND Fasano et al., 2009 Male and female rats (inhalation) 8:2 FTOH NE ND Plasma Plasma Plasma Plasma NE Himmelstein et al., 2012 Male rats (gavage, single dose) 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Serum Urine Feces Serum Urine Feces NE Dagnino et al., 2016 Male and female rats (single i.v. dose) 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Serum NE NE Huang et al., 2019b Male and female rats (gavage, single dose) 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Serum, liver, kidney Huang et al., 2019b Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 303 doses) 8:2 monoPAPs 8:2 diPAPs NE NE ND Bloodd Blood Liver Kidney ND NE D'Eon and Mabury, 2007 Male rats (single iv injection or gavage, single dose) Mixtures of 4:2, 6:2, 8:2, 10:2 monoPAPs or diPAPs Blood Urine Bloode Urine Blood Urine Blood Urine Blood Urinef Blood Blood D'Eon and Mabury, 2011 Male rats (gavage, single dose) 8:2 diPAP NE NE NE NE Serum Urine Feces Serum Urine Feces NE Dagnino et al., 2016 Female rats (gavage, repeated doses) EtFOSE NE NE NE NE NE NE NE Liver Serum Xie et al., 2009 Male rat hepatocytes 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Major PFCAg Traces NE Martin et al., 2005 Rat NE et al., 2007 Male mice (dietary exposure) 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Liver Liver NE Kudo et al., 2005 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajournal 304 GD8) 8:2 FTOH NE NE NE NE Liver, serum (dams) ; Liver, serum (pups) ; Placenta Liver, serum (dams) ; Liver, serum (pups) ; Placenta NE Henderson & Smith, 2007 NE LOQ < LOQ NE Nabb et al., 2007 9768 a present in liver, kidney and thyroid 9769 b present in liver > kidney > thyroid > adipose tissue skin 9770 c present in liver > kidney > thyroid > adipose tissue bone marrow skin thymus 9771 d detected in animals exposed to 8:2 monoPAPS 9772 e not detected in blood from animals exposed via oral gavage 9773 f not detected in urine from animals injected intravenously 9774 g After 4 h incubation with 18\u00b5M 8:2 FTOH, 78% of the parent been biotransformed, PFOA representing 1.4% and PFNA <0.2% of the formed products 9775 h Values are reported as percent of incubated dose following 120 min incubations. 9776 i Values are reported as percent of incubated dose following 30 min incubations 9777 ND: Not 305 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Luebker et al.

They found that PFOS exhibited the highest level of inhibition of DAUDA-L-FABP binding in 9784 the competitive binding assays, followed by IC50s, 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Appendix D - Effects following acute exposure Due to the limited number of published data, studies were considered even if PFASs were not applied 9787 via water or food or by gavage (oral exposure). Reports on acute exposure effects were identified for 9788 PFHxA, PFDA, EtFOSE (as listed in Table D1) and 8:2 FTOH. Studies on effects following acute exposure 9789 to PFOS and PFOA, which have been published between 2008 and 2016, are documented in the previous 9790 opinion (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018). An additional study on PFOS has been published. 9791 For PFHxA, Loveless et al. (2009) reported that the LD 50 ranged between 1750 and 5000mg/kg bw in 9792 female rats. 9793 For PFDA, Harris et al. (1989b) determined an oral LD 50 of 120 mg/kg bw in female C57BL/6N mice and 9794 bw for female C57BL/6J mice. 9795 Adinehzadeh et al. (1999) studied the impact of PFDA (Sigma-Aldrich, commercial source,) at single i.p. 9796 doses mg/kg bw in male F344 rats/group). At of < 20 mg/kg bw, PFDA was less 9797 toxic than above, as indicated by measurements of daily food intake. At 50 mg/kg bw, serum 9798 concentrations of tumor Hepatic fatty bw. At 15 or 50 mg/kg bw there 9800 were increases in hepatic phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine concentrations. Both 9801 doses, however, did not alter liver ATP content. 9802 Cheng and Klaassen (2008a) investigated major 9804 transporters for the uptake of bile acids and other organic compounds into the liver. Male C57BL/6 mice 9805 received a single i.p. administration of PFDA at 0.5, 1, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg bw. The highest dose of 9806 PFDA elevated serum bile acid concentrations about 3-fold. mRNA and protein expression of all four 9807 transporters were lowered after PFDA exposure. The subsequent use of PPAR-/- mice indicated that 9808 the down-regulation of the transporters appears to involve PPAR. 9809 Cheng and Klaassen (2008b) treated male C57BL/6 mice with a single i.p. administration of PFDA at 9810 0.5, 1, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg bw. Two days after treatment the expression of Cyp2B10, Cyp3A11, 9811 and Cyp4A14 was increased significantly. By using CAR-, PXR-, PPAR-, or FXR-knockout mice, it was 9812 determined that PPAR and CAR contribute to the induction of Cyps by PFDA. 9813 Maher et al. (2008) treated male C57BL/6 mice with single i.p administrations of PFDA at 0, 0.25, 0.50, 9814 1, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg bw. PFDA elevated the liver/body weight ratios and mRNA of the PPAR-9815 target gene Cyp4a14 at all doses tested. The transporter proteins Mrp3 and Mrp4 were induced by 10 9816 and 20 mg/kg bw, respectively. Single application of 80 mg/kg bw and bile acids, 9818 indicating that PFDA interferes the transporters for hepatic of bilirubin and bile acids (2017) wild-type and 129/Sv mice with a dose of PFDA at 80 9821 mg/kg bw. Five days after treatment, metabolomic analyses of blood and liver tissue samples revealed 9822 elevated direct and indirect bilirubin levels, increases in liver enzymes ALP, ALT and AST in the serum, 9823 and weak hepatocellular injury and inflammation in wild-type mice, associated with adaptive regulations 9824 of bile acid synthesis and transport. While both wild-type and PPAR-null mice exhibited elevated 9825 liver/body weight ratios, there was no disruption of bile acid homeostasis, hepatocellular injury or 9826 inflammation in the knock-out animals. 9827 Berthiaume and Wallace (2002) treated male Sprague-Dawley rats with a single i.p. injection of 100 9828 PFOS at bw served as positive control. Animals were 9829 sacrificed on the third day post treatment. Peroxisome proliferation was determined by lauroyl CoA 9830 oxidase activity, reduction of serum cholesterol concentration, and relative liver weights were recorded 9831 as well. The degree of mitochondrial biogenesis was estimated by measurements of cytochrome activity, cytochrome content and In to EtFOSE exhibited potency as peroxisome and no effects. 9834 Chang et al (2017) treated cynomolgus monkeys with a single dose of 9 mg PFOS/kg bw by gavage and 9835 reported on an insignificant reduction of serum cholesterol in the post treatment phase. No further 9836 alterations could be observed. 9837 Finlay et al. (2008, cited from CLH, 2012) treated male and female SD rats with 8:2 FTOH by single 9838 gavage with 2000 and 500 mg/kg bw, respectively.

(2012) examined the association between maternal serum concentrations of PFHxS 9929 (median: 1.6 ng/mL) with gestational age or preterm in 447 singleton female infants from 9930 the ALSPAC cohort. No differences in PFHxS concentrations were observed among preterm cases and 9931 non-cases. In a cohort of 638 pregnant women from Denmark, providing blood samples between 9932 gestation weeks 8 to 16, Lind et al. (2017) examined differences in maternal serum and non-cases. Non-significant differences were observed. 9935 Similarly, Hamm et al. (2010) found no association with preterm delivery for PFHxS (mean 2.1 ng/mL) 9936 among 252 pregnant women in Canada. Chen et al. (2012) examined, among 429 pregnant women 9937 from Taiwan, the association between cord blood concentrations (means) of PFNA (2.4 ng/mL) and 9938 PFUnDA (10.3 ng/mL) with preterm delivery. No associations were observed. Bach et al. (2016) 9939 examined associations between serum concentrations 9941 from Aarhus with preterm delivery. No associations were observed. 9942 9943 Time to pregnancy 9944 Bach et al. (2015a) observed no association between maternal serum concentrations ng/mL) with time to pregnancy, among 1,372 women from the Aarhus Birth Cohort (2008-2013). 9947 Serum samples were drawn during pregnancy prior to week 20 of gestation and time to the current 9948 pregnancy was recorded through questionnaires in early pregnancy. 9949 In another study, 222 Danish women, planning their first time pregnancy (1992-1995), were followed 9950 for six menstrual cycles or until conception. No associations between pre-pregnancy serum et al., 2012) were observed. 9953 J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2014) examined the relationship between serum concentrations (medians) of PFHxS 9954 (1.9 ng/mL) and PFNA (0.6 ng/mL) with time to pregnancy in 938 pregnant women from Greenland 9955 (48%), Poland (22%) and Ukraine (30%). Time to pregnancy in the current pregnancy was based on 9956 self-report and serum samples were drawn in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. PFNA was significantly 9957 associated with time to pregnancy of more than 13 months. No association was observed for PFHxS. 9958 Velez et al. (2015) examined associations between maternal serum concentrations of PFHxS (median 9959 1.0 ng/mL) and subfecundity and infertility (defined as time to pregnancy >12 months or infertility 9960 treatment for the current pregnancy) among 2,001 women recruited before week 10 of gestation in 9961 10 cities across Canada in 2008-2011. Blood samples were drawn during the first trimester. Maternal 9962 PFHxS concentrations were associated with longer time to pregnancy, that was also reflected in 9963 increased odds of infertility (OR for infertility per 1-SD increase in PFHxS: 1.3 (95%: 1.1, 1.5)). Results 9964 stratified by parity were not reported in this study, and no adjustment was made for parity. 9965 A cohort of 501 US couples who were followed over a 12-month period (Buck Louis et al., 2013) 9966 showed a significant association between maternal pre-pregnancy concentrations of PFOSA (mean: 9967 0.1 ng/mL) and longer to substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 417 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN As explained in the opinion on PFOS and PFOA (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018), studies relying on 9969 samples drawn in the current pregnancy as proxy for pre-pregnancy exposure are prone to reverse 9970 causation. The one study relying on pre-pregnancy samples (Vestergaard et al., 2012) did not observe 9971 any association with time to pregnancy for PFHxS and PFNA. Longer time to pregnancy for PFOSA in 9972 the study by Buck Louis et al. (2013) needs to be confirmed in an independent setting before any 9973 reliable conclusions can be drawn. Based on the small number of studies reviewed above there is little 9974 to suggest that PFNA, PFHXs or PFOSA are associated with reduced fertility in terms of time to 9975 pregnancy. 9976 Miscarriage 9977 Using a case-control design nested within a prospective cohort of 2,874 women from Odense 9978 Denmark, Jensen et al. (2015) examined the association risk of miscarriage. Of the 9980 women recruited into the cohort, 88 suffered miscarriage and 56 of them had stored serum samples 9981 drawn prior to week 12 of gestation. These 56 cases were compared with 336 randomly selected 9982 controls from the cohort who also had serum drawn prior to week 12 of gestation. In addition, 51 9983 miscarriage cases were compared to 204 controls that were matched on parity and gestational day of 9984 serum sampling. In serum samples drawn before week 12 of gestation (prior to miscarriage), higher 9985 serum concentrations were observed for miscarriage cases compared to non-cases for PFNA (1.16 vs 9986 0.68. ng/mL) and PFDA (0.33 vs 0.26 ng/mL). In terms of risk, both compounds showed a dose-9987 related increase in risk with an odds ratio of around 38 (95% CI: 10, 145) and 3.7 (95% CI: 1.6, 8.6) 9988 when comparing the highest to the lowest tertile of exposure to PFNA and PFDA, respectively. 9989 Buck Louis et al. (2016) examined, in a cohort of 501 US couples, the association between pre-9990 pregnancy serum concentrations of several PFASs and pregnancy loss. Concentrations of (mean or (1.2 ng/mL) were quantified. Of these 501 women, 344 became pregnant and 9993 98 of them suffered pregnancy loss. However, information on 24 out of the 344 pregnancies was 9994 missing due to loss to follow-up. Concentrations of Me-PFOSA-AcOH showed, by linear trend test, an 9995 inverse (protective) association with pregnancy loss. For other compounds no association with 9996 pregnancy loss was observed. 9997 J.2 and PFNA 9999 Neurodevelopment 10000 Liew et al. (2014) studied the association between plasma PFAS levels in pregnant women and the 10001 risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in their children in a case-control study (156 CP cases and 550 controls) 10002 from the Danish National Birth Cohort (N=1400) recruited between 1996 and 2002. Cases were 10003 collected from a National CP register with validated diagnoses. A number of potential confounders 10004 were taken into account. Median PFHxS and PFNA levels were 0.9 and 0.4 ng/mL and not associated 10005 with risk of CP. 10006 Liew et al. (2015) also performed a case-control study of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 10007 (ADHD) and autism in the same cohort. Cases of ADHD (N=220) and autism (N=220) were randomly 10008 selected among cases identified in the cohort by linking with national disease registries, and 515 10009 random controls were selected from the cohort, frequency-matched for sex. A number of potential 10010 confounders were adjusted for. Median PFHxS and PFNA levels in maternal plasma were 0.9 ng/mL 10011 and 0.4 ng/mL. Relative risks in the fourth quartile of PFHxS and PFNA were 0.6 (95% CI 0.4 - 0.7) 10012 and 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 - 2.1) for ADHD, respectively and 1.3 (95% CI 0.8 - 1.1) and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6 10013 - 1.6) for autism, respectively. 10014 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 418 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Braun et al. (2014) examined associations between PFHxS and PFNA in pregnant mothers (N=175) in 10015 Ohio (the HOME study), and autistic behavior (a Social Responsiveness Scale, SRS, based on 10016 questionnaires to mothers) in their children at 4-5 years of age. The median levels were 1.6 ng/mL 10017 for PFHxS and 0.9 ng/mL for PFNA in the women (mostly at 16 weeks), recruited in 2003 - 2006. A 10018 number of potential confounders were adjusted for. There were no statistically significant associations 10019 between PFHxS or PFNA and results from the SRS scale. 10020 The HOME cohort was also used to study associations between maternal serum PFHxS/PFNA (levels 10021 as above) and executive function (flexibility, goal planning, and information processing), as estimated 10022 from a parent-reported questionnaire (named BRIEF) in about 200 children at 5 and 8 years of age 10023 (Vuong et al., 2016). There were no consistent significant associations between maternal PFHxS or 10024 PFNA and executive functions in children. 10025 In a Taiwanese cohort of 430 pregnant women, serum PFHxS and PFNA levels were measured in the 10026 third trimester (year 2000 - 2001) and then 120 children were followed up at 5 and 8 years of age 10027 for assessing IQ (Wang et al., 2015b). The median maternal serum PFHxS was 0.7 ng/mL and for 10028 PFNA the median was 1.4 ng/mL. After adjustment for a number of potential confounders, no 10029 statistically significant associations were found between maternal PFHxS/PFNA and children's IQ at 5 10030 or 8 years of age. 10031 Two Taiwanese birth cohorts were used to examine the association between PFNA in cord blood and 10032 ADHD-related symptoms (parental questionnaires) in 282 children at 7 years of age (Lien et al., 2016). 10033 The response rate for follow-up was low. The mean PFNA levels were 4.4 ng/mL. A number of potential 10034 confounders were adjusted for. Several scores for hyperactivity and inattention were positively 10035 associated with PFNA. 10036 Oulhote et al. (2016) studied associations between maternal serum PFHxS and PFNA at the end of 10037 pregnancy and child behavior (parent-reported scales) in 539 Faroese children (born 1997 - 2000) at 10038 7 years of age. In addition, associations between children's behavior and their PFHxS/PFNA levels (at 10039 age 5 and 7) were examined. No associations between behavioral problems and maternal (medians 10040 PFHxS 4.5 ng/mL, PFNA 0.6 7 (PFHxS 0.5, PFNA 1.1 ng/mL) were 10041 found. There was, however, a significant association between serum PFNA levels (but not PFHxS) in 10042 the children at age 5 and unfavourable behavioural changes (see Section 3.3.4.2). 10043 Dutch children were examined by Quaak et al. (2016) for associations between the sum of PFASs 10044 (including PFHxS and PFNA) in cord scales for ADHD and \"externalizing 10045 behavior\" (attention problems and aggressive behaviour) in 59 children. A number of potential 10046 confounders were taken into account. No adverse associations were found. 10047 Growth in infancy and childhood, overweight, metabolic risk factors, and timing of puberty 10048 Halldorsson et al. (2012) performed a longitudinal study of the association between PFNA in serum in 10049 665 pregnant women, recruited in 1988-1989 from the Aarhus cohort, Denmark, and risk of 10050 overweight (BMI, waist circumference, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin) in their offspring at 20 years 10051 of age. The median PFNA level was 0.3 ng/mL. After adjustment for PFOA no significant associations 10052 with these outcomes were reported. 10053 Maisonet et al. (2012) studied the association between prenatal PFHxS (serum levels in pregnant 10054 mothers; median 1.6 ng/mL) and birth weight and weight at 20 months in 448 girls from Avon, UK 10055 (ALSPAC study). The girls were selected for another study (of menarche, see Christensen et al. (2011) 10056 below). A number of potential confounders were adjusted for. Findings on birth weight are reported 10057 in Section 3.3.4.1.1. No association was found with maternal PFHxS. 10058 A Faroese mother-child cohort (recruited 2007 - 2009) was used by Karlsen et al. (2016) to study the 10059 associations between maternal PFHxS and PFNA levels and overweight at 18 months and 5 years of 10060 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 419 EFSA Journal age. Median PFHxS and PFNA levels 2 weeks post-partum were 0.2 and 0.7 ng/mL. A number of 10061 potential confounders were adjusted for. There were no significant associations between these 10062 maternal PFAS levels and risk of overweight. 10063 Associations between maternal plasma PFHxS/PFNA in early pregnancy and adiposity in children were 10064 examined by Mora et al. (2016) in a US birth cohort. BMI, waist circumference, and skinfold thickness 10065 were measured at about 3 and 8 years of age (1006, and 876 children, participation rate 61 and 53% 10066 of children with prenatal PFHxS/PFNA levels). At 8 years, also fat mass was estimated (using DXA). A 10067 number of potential confounders albumin and estimated pre-pregnancy 10068 eGFR were also taken into account. Median maternal PFHxS and PFNA levels were 2.4 and 0.6 ng/mL. 10069 No consistent associations were found between maternal PFHxS/PFNA and adiposity at about 3 years 10070 of age or adiposity in boys at about 8 years. In girls there were significant associations between 10071 PFHxS/PFNA and measures of adiposity at 8 years. Positive associations with PFHxS/PFNA remained 10072 after further adjustment for eGFR and albumin, but were 10073 (PFOS, PFOA, were all included in the models. 10074 Fleisch et al. (2016) studied associations between prenatal (maternal plasma at about 10 weeks of 10075 gestation in 1999- 2002) PFHxS and PFNA (glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR), 10076 leptin and adiponectin in about 500 children from Boston at the median age of eight years. A number 10077 of potential confounders were adjusted for. GM maternal PFHxS and PFNA were 2.5 and 0.7 ng/mL. 10078 Associations between prenatal PFHxS and PFNA and insulin resistance, leptin and adiponectin were 10079 null. As mentioned in section 3.3.4.6.2, associations examined cross-sectionally using PFASs in 10080 children's plasma showed an inverse association between PFNA and HOMA-IR. 10081 Associations between prenatal PFHxS and PFNA exposure (serum levels in mothers at week 16) and 10082 adiposity at the age of 8 in 204 US children from the HOME study, were examined by Braun et al. 10083 (2016). GM for PFHxS and PFNA were 1.5 and 1.0 ng/mL. A number of potential confounders were 10084 adjusted for. There were no associations between PFHxS/PFNA and adiposity. 10085 Using a nested case control design Christensen et al (2011) examined the association between 10086 maternal concentrations of PFHxS (median 1.6 ng/mL), PFNA (median 0.6 ng/mL), and FOSA (median 10087 0.2 ng/mL) with age of menarche in the British ALSPAC cohort. They selected 218 early menarche 10088 cases, which reported age at menarche before 11.5 years (median 11.1 years) and 230 random 10089 controls (mean age at menarche 12.6 years). Age at menarche was assessed through self-reported 10090 questionnaires administered with 2-year intervals between the age of 8 to 13. Serum PFAS 10091 concentrations were quantified in archived serum samples taken during pregnancy (1991-1992). No 10092 significant association was observed with early age of menarche with odds ratios centered around 1. 10093 In the same cohort, Hartman et al. (2017) studied the association between prenatal PFHxS and PFNA 10094 (serum levels in pregnant mothers; median 1.6 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL) and body fat (measured by 10095 DXA) at age 9 years in 359 girls from Avon, UK (ALSPAC study). The girls were selected for a study 10096 of early menarche. A number of potential confounders were adjusted for. No associations were found 10097 between body fat and maternal PFHxS or PFNA. 10098 In a Spanish mother-child associations between 10099 maternal PFHxS and PFNA and various outcomes at age 6 months, and/or 4 and 7 years (BMI, waist 10100 circumference, blood pressure, blood lipids, and a cardiovascular risk score based on these factors) in 10101 their children (N=1086 - 1230). Maternal GM levels of PFHxS and PFNA were 0.6 and 0.7 ng/mL. No 10102 significant associations were found with BMI, waist circumference or blood pressure, or total 10103 cholesterol. The metabolic score at age 4 years was positively associated with maternal PFNA. 10104 Other PFASs 10105 Some of the above-mentioned studies also examined associations between the same outcomes as 10106 mentioned above and prenatal exposure to other PFASs than PFHxS and PFNA. This was the case for 10107 Perfluoroalkyl www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal al., et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015, Karlsen 10108 et al., 2016, Fleisch et al., 2016, Berg et al., 2017), PFUnDA (Wang et al., 2015; Lien et al., 2016; 10109 Berg et al., 2017), PFDoDA (Wang et al., 2015), and PFHpS (Berg et al., 2017). None of these studies 10110 showed significant associations between prenatal exposure to PFDA, PFUnDA, or between and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and learning 10114 problems in children were investigated by Stein and Savitz (2011). This was a cross-sectional study in 10115 the C8 cohort exposed to PFOA from contaminated drinking water. Apart from levels of PFOS and 10116 PFOA, also PFNA and PFHxS were measured 2005-2006 in 10,000- 11,000 children aged 10117 5-18 years. The median PFNA and PFHxS levels were 1.5 ng/mL and 5.2 ng/mL. Classification of ADHD 10118 was based on interviews (diagnosis made in the health sector, or medication against ADHD). A number 10119 of potential confounders were adjusted for. There was no association between PFNA and ADHD. The 10120 OR was significantly increased in the three upper quartiles of PFHxS (upper limit of Q1 = 2.9 ng/mL) 10121 with ORs of 1.3 - 1.5, based on about 1300 cases. The ORs were also increased in Q2 - Q4 (ORs 1.4 10122 - 1.6) for ADHD with medication (about 500 cases). \"Learning problems\" were not more prevalent in 10123 the upper quartiles of PFNA or PFHxS. 10124 In the C8 cohort, associations between PFNA and PFHxS and self-reported memory 10125 impairment were examined in 21,000 adults 50 years of age (Gallo et al. 2013). The GM PFNA and 10126 PFHxS levels in 2005 - 2006 were 1.4 and 3.2 ng/mL. A number of potential confounders were 10127 adjusted for. About 20% reported some memory impairment. Statistically significant inverse 10128 (\"protective\") associations were found between PFNA as well as PFHxS and memory impairment. The 10129 OR for memory impairment was 0.89 (95% CI 0.80 - 0.99) for Q5 versus 10130 the OR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.79 - 0.99). The authors discuss anti-inflammatory effects of PFNA/PFHxS 10131 (via PPAR) or residual confounding as possible explanations. 10132 Gump et al. (2011) studied the association between PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, and FOSA, and impulsivity 10133 in a cross-sectional study of 83 children aged 9 - 11 years from north-west USA. Impulsivity was 10134 assessed by a procedure reinforcing delayed response in a computer task, which could be learned 10135 during the task. Median PFNA and PFDA levels were 0.7 and 0.3 ng/mL. Median PFHxS and FOSA 10136 levels were 3.7 and 0.6 ng/mL. A number of potential confounders were taken into account. Higher 10137 levels of these four compounds were inversely associated with the (reinforced) response, which was 10138 assumed to indicate less ability to inhibit the optimal delay in response, and thus increased impulsivity. 10139 Power et al. (2013) performed a cross-sectional study on the associations between serum levels of 10140 PFNA and PFHxS and self-reported memory problems or confusion periods in about 1800 individuals, 10141 aged 60 - 85 years, from the U.S. NHANES 1999 - 2008. A number of potential confounders were 10142 taken into account. The GM for PFNA was 1.0 ng/mL and for PFHxS 2.1 ng/mL. The authors found no 10143 significant associations between PFNA or PFHxS and these cognitive symptoms. The OR for memory 10144 problems or confusion was 0.91 (0.79 - 1.04) for a doubling of serum PFNA and 0.93 (95% CI 0.82 10145 - 1.06) for a doubling of serum PFOA. The OR for memory problems was significantly below 1.0 in 10146 some sub-analyses of diabetics both for PFNA and PFHxS. 10147 Berk et al. (2014) studied the cross-sectional association between self-reported depressive symptoms 10148 in NHANES surveys 2005 - 2010. Levels 10150 are not presented. There were relatively strong inverse (\"protective\") associations between levels of 10151 PFNA, PFDA, and PFHxS and depressive symptoms after adjustment some potential confounders: 10152 OR 0.62 (95% 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN As mentioned above, Oulhote et al. (2016) studied associations between PFHxS and PFNA at age 5 10155 and 7 and child behavior (parent-reported scales) in 539 Faroese children (born 1997 - 2000) at 7 10156 years of age. No associations between behavioral problems and children's levels at age 7 (PFHxS 0.5, 10157 PFNA 1.1 ng/mL) were found. There was, however, a significant association between serum PFNA 10158 levels (but not PFHxS) in the children at age 5 and unfavourable behavioral changes. 10159 In a nested case-control from the Danish National Birth Cohort Long et al. (2019) examined 10160 associations between relation to autism spectrum disorders (75 cases 10162 and 135 matched controls). Concentrations in amniotic fluid were much lower (<LOQ up to ~1 ng/mL 10163 for the median) compared to levels observed in maternal serum from the same cohort (Ernst et al. 10164 2019). No increase in risk of autism spectrum disorders were observed. If anything, the associations 10165 suggested a modest reduction in risk. 10166 J.4. Immune outcomes 10167 Asthma and allergies in children and adults 10168 Prospective studies - New publications not reviewed in the 2018 opinion (EFSA CONTAM 2018) 10169 Manzano-Salgado et al. (2019) examined associations between maternal concentrations (means) of 10170 PFOS (6.1 ng/mL), (0.7 ng/mL) and certain 10171 outcomes. Blood samples were drawn during the first trimester. Information on the occurrence of 10172 lower respiratory tract infections, wheezing, asthma, and eczema was obtained by parental report at 10173 ages 1, 1.5, 4 and 7 years (n=1,071 to 1,188). Lung function was also assessed at age 4 years 10174 (n=992). Overall, no associations between PFASs and any of the outcomes reported were observed. 10175 PFOS was significantly inversely associated with eczema. 10176 Based on the 641 mother-child pairs from the Environment and Childhood Asthma Study from Oslo, 10177 Impinen et al. (2018) examined the association between cord blood concentrations (medians) of PFOA PFOSA (0.4 ng/mL) and offspring lung function at birth, and asthma and allergy at 2 and 10 years. 10180 Information on offspring asthma, allergy and lung function (spirmotetry test) at ages 2 and 10 years 10181 were based on parental report and clinical examination. Of the 100 different comparisons made for 10182 asthma and allergies (17 different outcomes with 6 substances), only four comparisons reached formal 10183 significance, which is not more than what would be expected by chance. 10184 In a study from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort, Impinen et al. (2019) examined associations 10185 between maternal concentrations (median) of PFOS PFHpS ng/mL) and offspring risk of allergies and asthma 10187 (doctor diagnosed and parental reports) at 3 years (n=1,270) and 7 years (n=972). Overall, no 10188 association of an association with asthma or allergies was observed. 10189 In a Faroese birth cohort (1997-2000) of 559 mother-child pairs with prospective follow-up, 10190 Timmerman et al. (2017) examined the association of (medians) 10191 (0.6 ng/mL), PFDA (0.3 ng/mL) and PFHxS ng/mL) and asthma and allergies in the offspring 10192 assessed by parental report at ages 5 and 13 years. Associations with immunoglobulin E and A (IgE, 10193 IgA) levels measured at age 7 years were also explored. In addition, the offspring's own 10194 concentrations at age 5 of (medians) (0.3 ng/mL) and PFHxS (0.6 ng/mL) 10195 and age 13 years (similar median concentrations as at age 5) were examined in relation to asthma 10196 and allergies at ages 5 and 13 years. In short, neither maternal concentrations of PFNA, PFDA and 10197 PFHxS, nor the offspring's own concentrations at age 5 were associated with asthma, allergy or 10198 immunoglobulin levels at age 7 and no association was observed cross-sectionally at age 13. The 10199 authors also performed secondary analyses among those 22 subjects that had not been vaccinated to 10200 measles, mumps, and rubella prior to age 5 and observed elevated risk of asthma and allergy with 10201 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 422 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN higher PFAS concentrations at age 5 and 13 years. Although interesting, those analyses were based 10202 on far too few subjects to allow for any meaningful conclusions. 10203 In a cohort of 675 Norwegian adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years, Averina et al. (2019) examined both 10204 cross-sectionally and prospectively the association between concentrations (medians) of the sum of 10205 18 PFASs (1 ng/mL) and asthma and 10206 allergies. Outcome assessments were based on both self-report and clinical examinations. Cross- 10207 sectionally, both the sum of 18 PFASs and PFOS were positively associated (linear trend test) with 10208 self-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma. A positive but non-significant association was observed for 10209 PFOA and PFHxS. No consistent associations were observed for other PFASs. Prospectively, similar 10210 elevated odds ratios for asthma were observed for the sum of 18 PFASs and PFOS in a follow-up 3 10211 years later, although a test for linear trend did not reach formal significance. In that follow-up, the 10212 sum of 18 PFASs and PFHxS were positively associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation (defined 10213 as FeNO >25 ppb). For all compounds, no consistent associations were observed for self-reported 10214 pollen allergy, food allergy and atopic eczema (cross-sectional analyses). 10215 Prospective studies - Papers previously reviewed only for PFOS and PFOA (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018) 10216 Wang et al. (2011) examined the association between serum cord blood concentrations (median) of 10217 PFNA (2.3 ng/mL)) with both cord blood levels (cross sectional) and offspring levels (prospective) of 10218 IgE and atopic dermatitis at age 2 years (n=244). No associations were observed in cross-sectional 10219 or prospective analyses. 10220 Okada et al. (2014) examined 2,063 mother-child pairs from the Hokkaido Study on Environment and 10221 Children's Health (2003-2009) for associations between and 10224 allergic diseases in the offspring at 12 and 24 months postpartum. Allergic diseases were defined 10225 using a modified part of the Japanese version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in 10226 Childhood (ISAAC) and associations with allergic diseases and eczema were reported. No positive 10227 associations between any of the PFAS quantified and allergic disease or exzema were observed. If 10228 anything, the observed associations were in some cases inverse (protective). 10229 In a cohort of 1,558 mother-child pairs form Japan with offspring follow-up at 4 years of age, Goudarzi 10230 et al. (2016) examined associations between pregnancy concentrations of PFHxS 10232 (0.2 ng/mL) and prevalence of allergic diseases in the offspring (wheezing, eczema and 10233 rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms). Prevalence of offspring allergy was assessed based on maternal report 10234 using a modified section of the Japanese version of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies 10235 in Childhood (ISAAC). No increase in risk for total allergic diseases or wheeze was observed with 10236 higher concentrations of these compounds. If anything, the associations were in the direction of being 10237 protective. 10238 Cross sectional studies - Papers previously reviewed only for PFOS and PFOA (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 10239 2018) 10240 Dong et al. (2013) examined associations between serum concentrations in 10 to 15-year-old Taiwanese children. The study recruited 231 10244 children who had received doctor diagnosis of asthma in the previous year and 225 non-asthmatic 10245 controls. Significant and positive dose-response associations with asthma (p for trend<0.05) were 10246 observed for PFOA, PFDA, PFDoDA and PFNA. For these acids the odds ratios when comparing the 10247 highest to the lowest quartile ranged from 1.6 to 4.1. Significant associations were also observed for 10248 the three sulfonates, PFOS, PFHxS and PFBS (corresponding odds ratios ranging between 1.9 to 3.8). 10249 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 423 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Among asthmatic cases, mean serum concentrations of immunoglobulin E, absolute eosinophil counts 10250 and eosinophilic cationic protein concentrations also tended to increase across quartiles of PFAS 10251 concentrations. Severity of asthma also appeared to increase with higher concentrations. The 10252 Spearman correlation coefficient between individual PFASs Using a subset (300 out of 456) of the children from this study, Qin et al. (2017) measured lung 10255 function by spirometry in 168 controls and 132 asthma cases. In line with previous findings from this 10256 cohort, positive associations between PFOS, PFHxS, PFOA, PFDA and PFNA and asthma were 10257 observed. In contrast to findings by Dong et al. (2013), no association was observed for PFBS and a 10258 positive association was observed for PFTeDA. Among asthmatic cases, PFOS, PFNA and PFHxS were 10259 associated with reduced pulmonary function in terms of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced 10260 expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), while PFOA was only associated with FEV 1. Compared to 10261 their previous study, these inconsistencies may, at least partly, relate to lower participation rate. 10262 Buser and Scinicariello (2016) examined in adolescents aged 12-19 years from the NHANES (2005- 10263 2006) study, the cross-sectional association between of PFHxS (2.1 10264 ng/mL) and PFNA (0.9 ng/mL) with food sensitisation (defined as having at least one food-specific 10265 IgE level 0.35 kU/L) and and food allergies (self-reported yes to the question 'What foods are you 10266 allergic to')in 637-701 participants. Non-significant associations were observed and PFHxS with food sensitisation and self-reported food allergies. 10268 A US study examined between ng/mL) with respiratory conditions among 458 New York State (NYS) employees and 10270 National Guard personnel working near the World Trade Centre after its collapse (Tao et al., 2008). 10271 Non-significant differences in concentrations for PFNA and PFHxS were observed among subjects 10272 classified as having symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory conditions. 10273 In a study of 12- to 19-year-old children and young adults (n=640) from the US NHANES, Stein et al. 10274 (2016) examined the associations between (means) PFNA (0.9 ng/mL) 19 different allergens was also measured (plants, dust mite, pets, cockroach, shrimp, rodents, mould 10277 and food). No consistent associations were observed between the different PFAS quantified and 10278 outcomes for asthma and allergies. 10279 In a pregnancy cohort of 1,258 women, Ashley-Martin et al. (2015) examined the cross-sectional 10280 association between cord blood concentrations of Endocrine Effects PFNA 10285 PFHxS and PFNA are the most studied compounds (apart from PFOS and PFOA). Therefore, they are 10286 summarised first (listed in Table J.1). 10287 Adults 10288 Bloom et al. (2010) compared serum PFHxS/PFNA levels, cross-sectionally, with levels of thyroid 10289 hormones in 31 New York anglers. No significant associations were found. 10290 Chan et al. (2011) performed a cross-sectional study of pregnant (15 - 20 weeks) Canadian women 10291 subject to prenatal screening. Out of 974 maternal sera, the authors selected all women (N=96 'cases') 10292 Age-matched controls (N=175), were selected 10293 among women with normal TSH and free T4 levels between the 50th and 90th percentiles. PFHxS 10294 substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN was measured in these sera. The a priori hypothesis was that PFHxS would cause hypothyroxinemia 10295 (still with normal TSH) but no such association was found. 10296 Ji et al. (2012) examined the association between serum concentrations of PFHxS/PFNA and total T4 10297 and TSH among 633 Koreans aged <12 years. serum levels were 1.5 ng/mL for PFHxS and 10298 2.1 ng/mL for PFNA. A number of potential confounders were adjusted for. No associations were 10299 found with TSH or T4. 10300 Jain (2013) examined associations between PFHxS/PFNA (levels not reported) and thyroid hormones 10301 in 1540 individuals 12 years from the NHANES survey 2007 - 2008. Those with thyroid problems or 10302 medications, current pregnancy or missing variables had been removed. A number of potential 10303 confounders were taken into account. No associations were found with free T3, free T4 or TSH. 10304 Wen et al. (2013) studied associations between PFHxS/PFNA levels and thyroid hormones in adults in 10305 US NHANES 2007 - 2010. Subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism was defined from low and high serum 10306 TSH, respectively. There was a positive association between PFHxS and both hyper- and 10307 hypothyroidism but this was not supported by any association between PFHxS and TSH, with the latter 10308 as a continuous variable. 10309 Wang et al. (2013b) examined the association between PFHxS/PFNA and TSH in 903 pregnant women 10310 (about 18th week of gestation) in the Norwegian Mother and Child cohort, MoBa. About half of the 10311 women had been selected due to subfecundicity. Those who reported previous thyroid disease were 10312 excluded. The GM of serum PFHxS and PFNA were 0.6 and 0.4 ng/mL, respectively. Several potential 10313 confounders were adjusted for. PFHxS was positively associated with free T4, but not with TSH. No 10314 associations were found between PFNA and thyroid hormones. 10315 Lin et al. (2013a) examined associations between PFNA (GM 1.5 ng/mL) and thyroid hormones (TSH, 10316 free T4) in 567 Taiwanese individuals aged 12 to 30 years. A number of potential confounders were 10317 adjusted for. PFNA was positively associated with free T4, but not with TSH. 10318 Wang et al. (2014d) performed a cross-sectional study of PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones (TSH, 10319 T3, T4 and free T4) in 285 pregnant women (third trimester) in Taiwan with no known thyroid disease, 10320 and thyroid hormones were also measured in cord blood in 116 of their neonates. The median 10321 maternal PFHxS and PFNA concentrations were 0.8 and 1.5 ng/mL, respectively. Several potential 10322 confounders were adjusted for. In women, PFHxS was positively associated with TSH, but not with 10323 free T4, total T4 or total T3 and not with thyroid hormones in the newborns. PFNA was inversely 10324 associated with free T4 and total T4 but not with TSH. Maternal PFNA was inversely associated with 10325 total T4 and total T3, but not with free T4 or TSH. 10326 Webster et al. (2014) examined associations between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones (free T4 10327 and TSH) in 152 pregnant (measured twice in early 2nd trimester) Canadian nonsmoking women. The 10328 median serum PFHxS and PFNA levels were 1.0 and 0.6 ng/mL. Analyses were adjusted for week of 10329 gestation and presence of TPO antibodies (positive in 14 women, indicating possible autoimmune 10330 thyroid disease). There was a positive association between PFNA and TSH, but no association with 10331 free T4, and no associations between PFHxS and thyroid hormones. 10332 Lewis et al. (2015) studied associations between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones (TSH, T4, free 10333 T4, T3, free T3) in 1682 individuals 12 - 80 years enrolled in NHANES 2011 - 2012. Median serum 10334 PFHxS and PFNA levels were, respectively, 0.8 - 1.8 ng/mL and 0.7 - 1.1 ng/mL (in various age groups 10335 in men and women). There were no overall associations between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones. 10336 In results stratified by sex and four age groups, there were a few significant findings for the most 10337 important hormones (TSH, free T4 and free T3): a positive association between PFNA and TSH in 10338 male adolescents, and a positive association between PFNA and free T4 in women 20 - 39 years. But 10339 many (24) such associations were tested. 10340 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 425 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Berg et al. (2015) examined associations between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones in 375 pregnant 10341 women in Norway. PFHxS/PFNA were measured around gestation week 18, and thyroid hormones 10342 (TSH, free T4, T4, free T3, T3), as well as thyroid hormone binding proteins were measured in the 10343 same samples, and also 3 days and 6 weeks postpartum. Median PFHxS and PFNA levels were 0.4 10344 and 0.6 ng/mL. Some potential confounders were adjusted for and also binding proteins in repeated 10345 measures analyses (mixed effects models). No significant associations were found with hormone 10346 levels. 10347 Berg et al. (2017) also reported on associations between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones in these 10348 pregnant women in Norway and TSH in their infants at birth. Heel prick TSH in infants was measured 10349 three days after birth. Some potential confounders were adjusted for. No significant associations were 10350 found with maternal thyroid hormones or infant TSH. 10351 Webster et al. (2016) studied associations between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones (TSH, T4, free T3) in 1525 adults from NHANES 2007 - 2008, excluding those with a history of thyroid 10353 disease. GM PFHxS and PFNA levels were 1.9 and 1.5 ng/mL. Several confounders were adjusted for, 10354 and results were also stratified for the presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOab, present in 10355 9%, suggesting possible autoimmune thyroid disease) and urinary iodine classified as low (< 100 10356 \u00b5g/L) in 26%. In individuals with normal urinary iodine and no TPOab there were no associations 10357 between PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones. However, in 26 individuals with TPOab and low urinary 10358 iodine, there were positive associations between PFHxS/PFNA and TSH, and free T3, and an inverse 10359 association with free T4 (PFHxS only). The authors suggest that the results could support a 'multiple 10360 hit' hypothesis with those who have TPO antibodies and low urinary iodine (about 1% of the US 10361 population) being a sensitive group. 10362 In a study of 157 mother-infant pairs, Yang et al. (2016) examined cross-sectional associations 10363 between maternal concentrations of PFHxS/PFNA and maternal and infant thyroid hormones (TSH, 10364 0.5 ng/mL for both 10365 compounds, while cord serum levels were 0.2 ng/mL for PFHxS and 1.2 ng/mL for PFNA. In analyses 10366 adjusted for potential confounders, there was an inverse association between maternal PFNA and 10367 maternal TSH. There were no associations between maternal or infant PFHxS/PFNA and infant thyroid 10368 hormones. 10369 Crawford et al. (2017) studied associations between PFHxS/PFNA (GM 1.6 and 0.8 ng/mL) and thyroid 10370 hormones (in 99 US women attempting to conceive. There was a positive association between PFNA 10371 and free T4, but no association with TSH, and no association between PFHxS and thyroid hormones. 10372 Only age was adjusted for. 10373 Li et al. (2017) examined associations between PFHxS (median 0.2 ng/mL) and thyroid hormones in 10374 202 persons (mainly adults, but two infants and ten adolescents, which had been selected in order to 10375 include both participants with normal (N=62) and \"abnormal\" levels (N=140) of thyroid hormones 10376 (TSH, free T4 or free T3). In analyses adjusted for age and sex but not for region there were no 10377 significant associations between PFHxS and thyroid hormones. 10378 In summary, for PFHxS, only one of 13 studies in adults showed an overall positive association with 10379 TSH (Wang et al. 2014d) and no studies showed any overall association with free T3 or free T4. In 10380 addition, in a small study subgroup with positive TPO antibodies and low iodine (Webster et al., 2016; 10381 N=26) there was a positive association with TSH, and free T3, and an inverse association with free 10382 T4. There were few studies in newborns/infants and no consistent findings. For PFNA, out of 12 10383 studies in adults there was one study in pregnant Chinese women (Yang et al., 2016) sampled just 10384 before delivery that showed an inverse association with TSH, while a study in pregnant Canadian 10385 women (Webster et al., 2014) showed a positive association with TSH. In addition, the small study 10386 subgroup with positive TPO antibodies and low iodine by Webster et al., (2016) showed a positive 10387 association with both TSH and free T3. Two small studies (Lin et al., 2013a, Crawford et al., 2017) 10388 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 426 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN showed positive associations with free T4, while another (Wang et al., 2014d) showed an inverse 10389 association. Most studies showed no significant associations. There were few studies in 10390 newborns/infants and no consistent findings. 10391 Newborns and children 10392 Lopez-Espinosa et al. (2012) examined cross-sectional associations between PFNA (median 1.5 10393 ng/mL) with total T4 and TSH among about 12,000 children in the C8 cohort aged 1-17 years. A 10394 number of potential confounders were adjusted for. There was no significant association with parent- 10395 reported thyroid disease with serum PFNA, but the number of cases was small (N=39). 10396 As mentioned above, Wang et al. (2014d) found no significant associations between PFHxS/PFNA in 10397 maternal serum and cord blood free T4 or TSH. 10398 Shah-Kulkarni et al. (2016) examined PFHxS/PFNA and thyroid hormones (TSH, 10399 T4, T3) in cord blood of 279 newborns from Seoul, Korea. GM levels were 0.4 (PFHxS) and 0.2 (PFNA) 10400 ng/mL. Several potential confounders were adjusted for. In girls, but not in boys, there was an inverse 10401 association between PFNA and TSH. There were no associations between PFHxS and TSH. 10402 Kim et al. (2016) compared serum concentrations of PFHxS/PFNA between 27 cases of infants with 10403 congenital hypothyroidism and 13 control infants. Concentrations of PFNA (median: 1.9 versus 0.6 10404 ng/mL) were significantly higher in the cases compared to controls, while PFHxS levels were similar 10405 (1.2 ng/mL for both groups). Maternal PFOS/PFOA levels were not available. 10406 As mentioned above, Yang et al. (2016) found no associations between between maternal or infant 10407 levels of PFHxS/PFNA and infant thyroid hormones. 10408 The above-mentioned studies are summarised in Table E.1. 10409 Other PFASs 10410 There are eleven studies on PFASs other than PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, and PFNA 10411 and thyroid disease or function, namely Bloom et al. (2010), Ji et al. (2012), Jain (2013), Wang et al. 10412 (2013), Lin et al. (2013a), Wang et al. (2014d), Berg et al. (2015), Shah-Kulkarni et al. (2016), Kim 10413 et al. (2016), Yang e al. (2016), and Li et al. (2017). For PFASs examined, see Table E.1. There were 10414 no consistent associations (reported in more than one study) between these other PFASs and thyroid 10415 disease or function. 10416 Table J.1 Reports on associations between serum levels of PFHxS and/or PFNA and thyroid 10417 disease or thyroid hormones.

A sign denotes a positive association and a '-' denotes an 10422 inverse association 10423 10424 Male fertility and puberty 10425 Di Nisio et al (2019) examined the association between exposure PFOA and fertility males from the 10426 Veneto region in Italy. The study was conducted within routine reproductive health survey and 10427 included 383 subjects (median age 18 y, range 18-24 y), which were clinically examined and provided 10428 semen samples. A Sub-set of these participants (n=212) were living in areas with known 10429 environmental PFOA contamination. To verify differences in exposure serum samples from 50 subjects 10430 from non-contaminated area (controls) and 50 subjects form the contaminated areas (exposed) were 10431 quantified. The median concentrations for PFOA among exposed versus controls was 7.4 and 4.7 10432 ng/mL, respectively. For the full sample anogenital distance, testicular volume and penis length were 10433 smaller among subjects in the exposed versus controlled area (p<0.001). Sperm concentrations and 10434 subjects with % normal morphology were also lower among subjects form the exposed area. When 10435 restricting the analyses to subjects with quantified PFOA levels (n=50/50) similar differences were 10436 observed for genital development while significant differences were not observed for semen quality. 10437 Serum PFOA concentrations were also positively associated with testosterone. Even through these 10438 results suggests that residential exposure may affect semen quality this simple ecological comparison 10439 between subjects presumed to be exposed versus controls is prone to confounding. The exposure 10440 gradients between controls and exposed as reported from a sub-sample of study participants was also 10441 modest, and no associations based on actual individual measured concentrations were reported for 10442 comparison. Differences in penis length, testicular volume and anogenital distance reflect different 10443 genital development during earlier years and are difficult to interpret in relation to current adult 10444 exposure to PFOA. 10445 In a sample of 105 Danish men from the general population Joensen et al. (2009) examined 10446 associations between several PFAS and semen quality and reproductive hormones. Serum PFAS 10447 concentrations were (medians in ng/mL) 6.6 for for PFHpA, 0.8 PFNA, reviewed 10449 (EFSA 2008) the sum of PFOS and PFOA was associated with reduced normal spermatozoa. No results 10450 were, however, reported for other PFAS. Concerning reproductive hormones, PFOSA was associated 10451 with higher testosterone concentrations while no associations were observed for other PFASs. 10452 Toft et al. (2012) examined associations between PFHxS (1.1 ng/mL) and PFNA (1.2 ng/mL) and 10453 semen quality in a cohort of 588 men from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine. Overall no consistent 10454 associations with semen quality were observed. 10455 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 430 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN In cross-sectional analyses among 103 Chinese males living in an area with high industrial activity 10456 Song et al (2018) examined correlations between several PFAS measured in blood and semen quality. 10457 Blood concentrations (medians in ng/mL) were 3.0 for PFBA, 0.6 for PFPrA 3.0 for PFPeA, 29 for 10458 PFHxA, 0.2 for PFHBS, 0.4 for PFHpA and 3.9 for PFHxS. PFAS concentrations in blood and semen 10459 were not correlated with sperm concentrations. Blood concentrations for individual PFAS showed 10460 varying concentrations (positive and inverse) with progressive sperm motility. Overall no consistent 10461 associations were 10463 In a sub-cohort within the Danish National birth cohort Ernst et al. (2019) examined the associations 10464 between maternal concentrations of PFAS and pubertal development in 455 mother-child pairs. 10465 Median (in ng/mL) serum concentrations (1st or 2nd trimester samples) were ~1 PFHxS, ~0.5 for 10466 PFNA and ~0.2 for PFDA. Outcomes assessment was based on self-report and covered questions on 10467 Tanner stages 2-5 for pubic hair, breast and genital development, as well as axillary hair growth and 10468 acne. In addition, information on age at first ejaculation and voice break (for boys) and age at 10469 menarche (for girls) was reported Overall maternal concentrations of different PFAS appeared to 10470 suggest slightly slower pubertal development in both boys and girls. However, few associations 10471 reached formal statistical significance, consistency with different outcomes measures was in many 10472 cases absent, and clear dose response was not observed. 10473 10474 Female fertility, menstrual cycle and puberty 10475 In a cohort of 495 women aged 18-44 scheduled for laparoscopy in Salt Lake City US, Buck Louis et 10476 al. (2012) examined associations between PFNA, PFDA and PFHxS and endometriosis (mean or median 10477 concentrations not reported). The same associations were also examined among 131 women from 10478 the same area who were not seeking clinical care. After adjustment for covariates a non-significant 10479 increased risk was observed for PFNA and PFDA among women seeking clinical care (n=495). In the 10480 smaller sub-sample of women not seeking clinical care (n=131), similar non-significant associations 10481 were also observed but with much more imprecise/wide confidence intervals. 10482 With a case-control design, Zhang et al. (2018) examined associations between (medians ng/mL) and PFBS (0.05) and 10484 primary ovarian insufficiency among 120 diagnosed cases and 120 healthy controls. A significant and 10485 positive association was observed between PFHxS and primary ovarian insufficiency. No association 10486 was observed for other PFASs. Associations between individual PFASs and reproductive hormones 10487 (FSH, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and prolactin) were also explored among cases only. In those 10488 analyses an inverse association was observed between PFHxS and estradiol. 10489 In a cohort of 2731 women form the NHANES study Taylor et al. (2014) examined associations 10490 (median: ~1.1 ng/mL) and at natural menopause 10491 among women aged 20-65 years. Positive association with PFHxS and PFNA for age at natural 10492 menopause was observed. Much stronger association was also observed between these two 10493 substances and rate of hysterectomy. In addition, the authors noted that the concentrations of these 10494 two substances increased with time since natural menopause. Those findings strongly suggest that 10495 the association between PFNA and PFHxS and natural age at menopause are driven by reverse 10496 causation. 10497 Singer et al. (2018) examined in a cohort of 1977 Norwegian pregnant women, the associations 10498 between several PFAS and menstrual cycle characteristics. Medians (in ng/mL) levels of PFAS in 10499 maternal serum drawn around gestation week 17 was 0.33 PFNA, 0.09, 0.13 for PFDA, 0.21 0.65 for PFHxS, and 0.15 for PFHpS. Overall no consistent associations were observed 10501 between individual PFASs and irregular menstrual cycles. Using a case-control design, Heffernan et al. (2018) examined the associations between several PFAS 10504 and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) among 29 cases and 30 controls matched for age and BMI. 10505 Mean serum concentrations (in ng/mL) were 1.0 for 0.6 for PFNA and 0.41 for PFDA. No 10506 associations were observed for these substances. In this study associations with biomarkers of glucose 10507 homeostasis (fasting glucose, insulin HbA1 (testosterone, 10508 SHBG, FAI, androstenedione and oestradiol) were also explored for cases and controls separately. 10509 Some inconsistent associations were observed among cases and controls. Given the modest statistical 10510 power (n~30) limited conclusions can be drawn. 10511 10512 Using a case-control design Wang et al. (2019b) examined the associations between PFASs and 10513 polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in Chinese women. A total of 180 infertile PCOS cases and 187 10514 healthy controls were recruited into the study. Medium (ng/mL) plasma PFAS concentrations were 10515 10516 for PFDoDA and 12.16 sum of all PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA. PFDoDA was significantly 10517 associated with increased odds of PCOS-related infertility, while PFUnDA showed a significant inverse 10518 association. 10519 10520 With a nested design the UK ALSPAC cohort was used by Christensen et al. (2011) to examine the 10521 association between different PFAS and age at menarche. Maternal pregnancy samples among 218 10522 female cases who had age at menarche before the age of 11.5 y and 230 randomly selected controls 10523 were quantified. Median concentrations (in ng/mL) in pregnancy serum were 0.2 for PFOSA, 0.6 for 10524 Et-PFOSA-AcOH, 0.4 for Me-PFOSA-AcOH, 19.8 for PFOS, 1.6 for PFHxS, 3.7 for PFOA, 0.6 for PFNA. 10525 Overall no consistent associations with age at menarche were observed. 10526 Regarding puberty in girls, see also the study by Ernst et al. (2019) in section 3.3.4.5.2. 10527 Other endocrine effects 10528 In a cohort of 349 Chinese pregnant women, Yao et al. (2019) examined cross sectional associations 10529 between several PFAS in cord blood and reproductive hormones and testosterone) and 10530 steroidogenic 10531 were 0.2 for PFBS, 0.2 for PFDA, 0.1 for PFDoDA, 0.1 for PFHpA, 0.2 for PFHxS, 0.3 for PFNA, 0.1 for 10532 PFOSA, and 0.1 for PFUnDA. PFHxS positively associated with estradiol while PFUnDA and PFNA 10533 were positively associated with testosterone. PFHxS was positively associated with P450arom, 3 - showed a positive association with P450arom. On their own, the biological relevance 10536 of these cross-sectional association in cord-blood is far from clear. Replication in an independent data 10537 would be needed to draw any meaningful conclusions on causality. 10538 In a study of 80 mother child pairs form the Faroese Islands, Shelly et al. (2019) examined the 10539 association between maternal and childhood (age 5, 7 and 9 y) exposures to PFHxS, PFDA and PFNA 10540 (median or mean concentrations not reported) and adipokine hormone levels at these same ages. For 10541 these substances no consistent associations were observed. 10542 Limited conclusions can be taken on the basis of these two studies. 10543 J.5 Metabolic Outcomes 10544 Diabetes 10545 Lin et al. (2009) examined cross-sectional associations between PFOS, PFOA, PFNA (GM 0.7 ng/mL), 10546 and glucose homeostasis and metabolic syndrome in 1443 adults and 10547 adolescents (12 - 19 years) from US NHANES samples 1999 - 2004. Data were available on fasting 10548 plasma glucose and insulin, and beta cell function and insulin resistance were assessed. Plasma 10549 glucose, blood lipids, waist, blood pressure and medications were used to define metabolic syndrome. 10550 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 432 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN There was an inverse association between PFNA and metabolic syndrome in adolescents, but null 10551 findings in adults. Also for PFHxS the point estimates for the odds ratio of metabolic syndrome were 10552 below 1. 10553 The study by Nelson et al. (2010) (see also Section 3.3.4.6.1. above), found no consistent associations 10554 between PFNA (median 1.0 ng/mL) or PFHxS (median 1.8 ng/mL) and body weight, BMI or insulin 10555 resistance (HOMA-IR). 10556 The study by Lin et al. (2011) (see Section 3.3.4.6.1) found no consistent associations between PFNA 10557 or PFUnDA and indicators of metabolic syndrome, but few details were given. 10558 The study by Fisher et al. (2013), see Section 3.3.4.6.1, found no consistent associations between 10559 PFHxS and indicators of metabolic syndrome. 10560 Lind et al. (2014) studied the association between diabetes, insulin secretion, and insulin resistance, 10561 10562 rates >90%; seven other PFASs were determined but had lower detection rates and were not 10563 considered). For PFNA, but not for the other PFASs, there was a significant (nonlinear) association 10564 with prevalent diabetes. There were no associations between PFASs and insulin resistance. 10565 A cross-sectional study of associations between PFOS, PFOA, PFNA (mean 3.8 ng/mL) and PFUnDA 10566 (mean 6.4 ng/mL) and glucose homeostasis among 571 Taiwanese adults from outpatient cardiology 10567 clinics (but free of self-reported coronary heart disease, stroke or diabetes) was reported by Su et al. 10568 (2016). The odds ratio for diabetes was decreased with increasing PFNA and PFUnDA (i.e. \"protective\" 10569 association). 10570 PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS (GM 1.0 ng/mL) levels in early pregnancy and 10571 development of GDM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) at the end of pregnancy was examined in 10572 a prospective study of 1259 women in Canada (Shapiro et al., (2016). The odds ratio for IGT and 10573 GDM was increased in quartile 2 of PFHxS, but not significantly increased in Q3 or Q4. 10574 Cardenas et al. (2017) examined associations ng/mL), and glycemic indicators at 10577 baseline and during 5 years of follow-up in 957 individuals with high risk of diabetes. PFHxS, Et- 10578 PFOSA-AcOH, and Me-PFOSA-AcOH were positively associated with resistence (HOMA-IR) and 10579 insulin response (HOMA-beta), and HbA1c at baseline, but three were no associations between 10580 baseline levels of any of the afore-mentioned PFASs and incident diabetes changes or in changes in 10581 glycemic indicators during follow-up. 10582 J.6 Kidney PFHxS and PFNA and eGFR (Schwarz formula) was examined in 9660 children 10584 and adolescents aged 1 - 18 years (mean 12 years) from the C8 cohort by Watkins et al. (2013). The 10585 median serum levels of PFHxS and PFNA were 5.2 and 1.5 ng/mL in 2005 - 2006. There was a 10586 significant inverse association with eGFR both for PFHxS and PFNA. For PFNA most of this difference 10587 was found already between Q1 and Q2. The change in eGFR per interquartile range of PFHxS and 10588 PFNA was about 1 mL/min/1.73 m2, which was similar to what was found (per IQR) for PFOS and 10589 PFOA. When the analysis for PFOA was repeated but using estimated S-PFOA (from drinking water), 10590 there was no association between estimated S-PFOA and eGFR. The authors conclude that reverse 10591 causation is a likely cause of the association between (measured) S-PFOA and eGFR, i.e. that lower 10592 GFR causes higher S-PFOA, rather than vice versa, and this argument is valid also for PFHxS and 10593 PFNA. 10594 Kataria et al. (2015) studied, cross-sectionally, the association between PFHxS/PFNA and kidney 10595 function (and uric acid) among 1960 adolescents in the US NHANES 2003 - 2010. Median PFHxS and 10596 Perfluoroalkyl food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 433 Journal PFNA levels were 2.0 and 1 ng/mL. A number of potential confounders were adjusted for. No 10597 significant associations were found with eGFR (Schwartz formula) or uric acid. 10598 Lin et al. (2013b) examined associations between PFNA and PFUnDA and serum uric acid in a cross- 10599 sectional study of 644 young people from Taiwan, who had been subject to a mass urine screening. 10600 The focus of the study was carotid intima-media thickness. Most of them were in the age 20 - 30 10601 years and the GM PFNA and PFUnDA levels were about 1.1 and 5.9 ng/mL. No significant associations 10602 were found between PFNA/PFUnDA and urinc acid in adjusted models including a number of potential 10603 confounders. 10604 In the cross-sectional study by Gleason et al. (2015), mentioned above in the Liver section (Section 10605 3.3.4.6.3), associations between serum PFHxS/PFNA and serum uric acid examined in about 10606 4300 individuals from US NHANES surveys 2007 - 2010. The median levels of PFHxS and PFNA were 10607 1.8 ng/mL and 1.2 ng/mL. A number of potential confounders were adjusted for. A significant positive 10608 association was found between ln serum PFNA (but not PFHxS) were examined in a cross-sectional study of 225 Taiwanese children (12 - 15 years) 10611 by Qin et al. (2016). There was a significant positive association between ln serum PFHxS (but not 10612 the other PFASs) and uric acid in a model adjusted for potential confounders. 10613 J.7. Carcinogenicity outcomes 10614 In a nested case-control study frrm France, Mancini et al (2019) examined the association between 10615 serum PFOS (median ng/mL) and PFOA (median ng/mL) with breast cancer risk. Blood samples were 10616 drawn between 1994-1999 and cancer cases were prospectively identified until 2013. PFOS and PFOA 10617 were not associated with overall breast cancer risk (all cases). PFOS was, however, positively 10618 associated with estrogen receptor-positive and progesterone receptor-positive tumors. However, the 10619 effect estimates did not indicate a clear dose response as all estimates were similarly elevated above 10620 the referent quartile. No consistent associations were observed for PFOA. 10621 In another nested case-control design Cohn et. al. (2019) examined the association between 10622 pregnancy concentration of PFAS with breast cancer risk in the female offspring after 54 years of 10623 follow-up. Out of 9300 daughters born in 1959 to 167 archived maternal samples drawn during 10624 pregnancy whose daughters had been diagnosed (cases: n=102) and matched controls (n=310) were 10625 selected. Maternal concentrations were (median in ng/mL) 0.3 for EtFOSAA, and 2.0 for PFHxS. No 10626 association with breast cancer was found for these two substances. In a sub-set of women with high 10627 maternal cholesterol, EtFOSAA was positively associated with later offspring risk of breast cancer. 10628 Without further replication this study provides limited evidence for a link between in utero exposure 10629 to EtFOSAA and PFHxS and later breast cancer risk. 10630 In a nested case-control (902 breast cancer cases and matched 858 controls) design of US women 10631 Hurley et al (2018) examined association between baseline concentrations (median in ng/mL) of PFNA 10632 (0.9), PFUnDA (0.1), PFHxS (1.6) and MeFOSAA (0.2) and later breast cancer risk over 10-19 years 10633 of follow-up time. No increased risks of breast cancer were observed. If anything, the observed 10634 associations tended to show a modest reduction in risk. 10635 J.8 Cardiovascular disease and mortality 10636 Lin et al. (2013b) studied, cross-sectionally, the association between intima-media thickness (as a 10637 measure of atherosclerosis) in the carotid artery (CIMT) and serum levels of and PFUnDA (in 10638 addition to PFOS and PFOA) in 644 individuals from Taiwan, aged 12 - 30 years, recruited at a mass- 10639 screening of urine for glucose and protein. S-PFNA and S-PFUnDA were about 1.1 and 5.9 ng/mL. No 10640 positive associations were found between PFNA or PFUnDA and CIMT after adjustment for potential 10641 confounders Similar results were found be the same authors (Lin et al., 2016) when analysing some 10642 additional subjects and performing some subanalyses. 10643 food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 434 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Mattson et al. (2015) performed a case-control study (nested in a Swedish cohort) of the association 10644 between several PFAS (apart from PFOS/PFOA): PFHpDA (median at recruitmen 1990 0.05 (median 0.02 ng/mL), and PFHxS (median 1.6 ng/mL) and incident coronary heart disease (CHD, fatal 10647 or non-fatal). Cases and age-matched controls (231 pairs) were obtained from a cohort of 1782 men 10648 living in rural Sweden. For part of the age-control pairs still alive, blood samples were collected also 10649 in 2002 - 2003, and then levels had decreased about 10%. An association with risk of CHD was found 10650 only for PFHpA (OR for Q3 of S-PFHpA 2.6 (95%CI 1.4 - 4.8) and for Q4 OR=1.7, 95% CI 0.9 - 3.2). 10651 Lind et al. (2017) studied cross-sectional associations between several PFASs (apart from PFOS and 10652 PFOSA (mean 0.1 ng/mL) in serum in about 1000 elderly 10654 Swedish individuals (see Lind et al. 2014, Section 3.3.4.6.2 on diabetes, obesity, and metabolic 10655 syndrome. The authors found a positive association between ln PFNA and echogenicity (a marker of 10656 plaque vulnerability) of the intima-media complex, but only in women, and a positive association 10657 between PFUnDA and prevalence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques, but again only in women. 10658 Bao et al. (2017) examined associations between PFASs in serum and blood pressure among 1612 10659 adult government employees or residents in Shenyang, China. Apart from PFOS and PFOA, also PFBA 10662 ng/mL), PFHxS (median 0.7 ng/mL) could be quantified in >50% of the participants. After 10663 adjustment for relevant potential confounders, statistically significant positive associations were found 10664 between PFNA and PFBA and prevalence of hypertension as well as blood pressure. For a three-fold 10665 increase in PFNA the adjusted OR was 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 - 1.36). For PFBA the corresponding adjusted 10666 OR was 1.1 (95% CI 1.04-1.17). Adjusted models indicated increase in systolic and diastolic blood 10667 pressure with 3 mm Hg for a three-fold increase in PFNA and 1 mm Hg for PFBA. Associations with 10668 hypertension and blood pressure were stronger (and statistically significant) for PFOS and 10669 PFOA.Huang et al. (2018) studied associations between number of PFASs in serum and self-reported 10670 physician-diagnosed occurrence of cardiovascular disease (about 1200 cases) in seven rounds of the 10671 US NHANES (1999 - 2014) including about 11 000 participants. Apart from PFOS and PFOA, PFHpA 10672 be in >50% of participants. A large number of 10674 potential confounders and cardiovascular risk factors (including serum cholesterol) were adjusted for. 10675 There were significant associaitons between PFNA, PFUnDA, and PFDoDA and the odds ratios for any 10676 cardiovascular disease. This was also the case when all PFASs (including PFOS and PFOA) were 10677 summed up. Regarding specific cardiovascular diseases, positive associations were found for coronary 10678 heart disease and associatoons were also found between PFASs and cardiovascular risk factors, such 10679 as serum cholesterol. 10680 Mastrantonio et al. (2018) studied mortality in an ecological study of 24 municipalities with drinking 10681 water contaminated by PFASs (from a manufacturing company operating since 1964), and 56 10682 municipalities with non-contaminated drinking water, all of them in the Veneto region of Italy. 10683 Selection of municipalities with contaminated drinking water was based on water levels of PFOS>30 10684 ng/L, PFOA>500 ng/L or 10685 = 10687 144 000 inhabitants and the uncontaminated had 588,000 inhabitants. Age- and sex-standardized 10688 mortality (SMR) rates for 1980 - 2013 were based on mortality for Italy. The specific causes of death 10689 examined were selected a priori, based on previous literature. Apart from sex and age, no individual 10690 potential confounders could be assessed, but a deprivation index and municipality-based smoking 10691 habits were adjusted for. Increased relative risks (RR) in contaminated municipalities were found for 10692 total mortality (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.10 - 1.12), myocardial infarction (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.18), 10693 substances in food urnal 435 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN cerebrovascular disease (RR=1.21, 95% CI 1.17 - 1.25), diabetes (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17 - 1.37), 10694 and Alzheimers disease (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.43). The RR for liver cancer was significantly 10695 decreased (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 - 0.94). 10696 In summary, six studies report findings on cardiovascular disease in relation to exposure to other 10697 PFASs than PFOS and PFOA. Regarding the study by Lin et al. (2013b), it should be noted that CIMT 10698 is not a good marker of atherosclerosis at this young age. The findings by Lind et al. (2017) on 10699 atherosclerosis (PFNA and PFUnDA) were restricted to women and have not yet been replicated. For 10700 associations with blood pressure/hypertension (Bao et al., 2017), replication in other studies is lacking. 10701 The same is true for the longitudinal study by Mattsson et al. (2015) - PFHpA has rarely been studied 10702 in relation to cardiovascular disease. The study by Huang et al. (2018) is large and has good 10703 confounder-control. Self-reported diseases is a limitation, but on the other hand information bias is 10704 not likely since the parricipants were unaware of their PFASs levels. Therefore, it supports the 10705 hypothesis that the aforementioned PFASs (PFNA, PFUnDA, and PFDoDA) contribute to the risk of, 10706 especially coronary heart disease, the major outcome reported. The findings have, however, not been 10707 replicated. 10708 The longitudinal ecological study by Mastrantonio et al. (2018) is relevant for all PFASs since it used 10709 drinking water contamination as exposure instead of serum levels. Without individual data, it is, 10710 however, difficult to know if established cardiovascular risk factors differ between municipalities (apart 10711 from smoking and socioeconomy, which could be taken into account on area level). The large size, 10712 and the fact that results were averaged over many (contaminated and uncontaminated) municipalities 10713 are strengths of this study and it does provide some support for associations between PFASs and 10714 cardiovascular disease. This is true also for PFOS and PFOA (this paper was published after the 10715 literature deadline for the PFOS/PFOA opinion, (EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018). For Alzheimers disease 10716 and diabetes, data on morbidity are more appropriate than data from death certificates, and there is 10717 no corresponding support from morbidity studies (see sections 3.3.4.6.2 (Diabetes) and 3.3.4.3 10718 (Neurotoxic EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Appendix K - Additional information on the study from Abraham et al.

(2011), with some 10772 modifications provided by a co-author of the original paper (see EFSA CONTAM Panel, 2018) 10773 Model description 10774 10775 The original Loccisano model was slightly modified by integrating a growth equation based on a French 10776 survey. This study (EAT for French total Diet Study) includes 4,078 subjects with age between 3 and 60 10777 years, and 703 subjects of less than 3 years). The reported data (weight, age) from this study allow 10778 building an equation describing the increase in weight according to age. 10779 Briefly, PFOA and/or PFOS are taken up into the plasma (i.v.) or into the gut (oral). From the gut, PFOA 10780 and/or PFOS are transported to the liver by the portal blood. Only the free fractions of PFOA and/or 10781 PFOS in plasma are assumed to be available for partitioning into tissues. PFOA and/or PFOS is eliminated 10782 through the filtrate compartment to storage into urine, while in the filtrate compartment, PFOA and/or 10783 PFOS can be reabsorbed back into the plasma through a saturable process with a transporter maximum 10784 constant (Tmc) and affinity constant (Kt). The Qs indicate blood flows into and out of tissues. Qfil is not 10785 a blood flow - it is a clearance (L/h) from the plasma to the filtrate compartment. 10786 Model validation 10787 The model was applied in a case study of human individuals living in Little Hocking (Ohio, USA) and 10788 Arnsberg (Germany), and exposed to relatively high concentrations of PFOA through consumption of 10789 drinking water. For PFOS data from occupational exposure were used. The result was a PBPK model 10790 reasonably capable to estimate the concentration of PFOS and PFOA in the human body. Coding and 10791 simulations for both the PFOA and PFOS models was performed in the Berkeley Madonna program 10792 (Macey et al., 2000). 10793 10794 Sensitivity analysis 10795 Sensitivity analysis (SA) provides a quantitative assessment of the degree of influence of input 10796 parameters on the model results. According WHO guidance (WHO/IPCS, 2010), sensitivity analysis 10797 results can be summarised as: 10798 high (absolute value greater than or equal to 0.5) 10799 medium (absolute value greater than or equal to 0.2 but less than 0.5) 10800 low (absolute value greater than or equal to 0.1 but less than 0. 10801 10802 The highest values of sensitivity analysis results (p > 0.1) were obtained for the following parameters: 10803 Cardiac output, elimination parameters (glomerular filtration rate and resorption maximum parameters), 10804 the free fraction and the haematocrit. For PFOA and PFOS, the parameter with the highest contribution 10805 to the SA was free fraction, and Kt followed by oral intake, Tm, Q. kidney. In general terms, the cardiac 10806 output and volumes of tissues showed the smallest contribution, with the only exception of Q. kidney. 10807 The reason of the high sensitivity of Q. kidney might be due to the fact that kidney is the elimination 10808 tissue, and it has been reported that Q. kidney is a physiological parameter with a low uncertainty. 10809 Perfluoroalkyl substances in food www.efsa.europa.eu/efsajo urnal 445 EFSA Journal 20YY;volume(issue):NNNN Model codes applied in the PBPK model used in this Opinion 10810 The codes are based on model codes in Loccisano et al. (2011), with slight modifications by the EFSA 10811 CONTAM Panel in 2018. Explanation of the modifications from the original model were given in notes in 10812 the respective model codes (see EFSA opinion 2018). 10813 10814 In the present opinion, the PFOA and PFOS human PBPK models were used to estimate maternal 10815 exposure (daily intake) to PFOA/PFNA and PFOS/PFHxS for women corresponding to a critical serum 10816 and corresponding milk level at 35 years, and were also able to simulate PFAS concentrations in the 10817 infant at 1 years after 12 months of breastfeeding. These models were run for 35 years in order to 10818 calculate the serum and milk concentrations at 35 years which were used as starting concentrations at 10819 the end of pregnancy (at delivery); then these concentrations were used as starting concentrations for 10820 the new born infant and the breastfeeding. To perform these simulations, constants (e.g. placental 10821 transfer, transfer from blood to milk and decline of PFASs in milk per month) have been added to the 10822 model code to allow estimation of the serum level of PFASs at birth, and exposure during breastfeeding. 10823 They are indicated in red in the text code. 10824 10825 General constant 10826 These line codes represent the placental transfer, ratio for milk concentration/maternal serum PFAS 10827 concentration, the decline of PFASs in milk due to transfer to the infant, and these allow the calculation 10828 of initial amount at birth and intake via breastfeeding: 10829 10830 BWbirth=3.68 ; Body weight at birth in kg new add opinion 2020 10831 PT=; placental transfer, new add opinion 2020 10832 Ratio=; concentration/maternal serum concentration, new add opinion 2020; for PFOA a ratio of 10833 0.03 was used based on previous studies 10834 DECLINE =; decline of PFAS concentration in milk per month, new add opinion 2020 10835 10836 Line code for the initial amount at birth (example for PFOA) 10837 These line codes allow the calculation of the initial amount of PFOA in several compartments at birth 10838 according to the maternal level at delivery and the placental transfer. The number (e.g. AGbirth= 10839 APlasbirth* 0.99) represent the ratio between the initial amount at birth in a specific compartment 10840 (here the gut) /initial amount in plasmatic compartment. They have been calculated by running a 10841 simple PFOA PBPK model with different exposure, and are constant.
