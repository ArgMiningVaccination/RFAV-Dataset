Barth, PhD ABSTRACT. Healthy Steps (HS) represents a signifi- cant innovation in the way pediatric primary care can bedelivered. Based on the standards and principles ofBright Futures and the American Academy of PediatricsHealth Supervision Guidelines, HS enhances and ex-pands traditional pediatric care by including a child de-velopment specialist (Healthy Steps specialist) as part ofthe pediatric practice team. Services offered by this per-son, typically a nurse, early childhood educator, or socialworker, include more time to spend discussing preven-tive issues during well-child visits, home visits, a tele-phone information line exclusively addressing develop-mental and behavioral concerns, new written materials,and more seamless linkages to community resources andparent support groups. The original HS cohort consisted of 15 pediatric prac- tices in a variety of settings (private practices, health centers, pediatric training programs). Evaluated for theeffects of HS on their family were 3737 intervention andcomparison families. HS families received significantlymore preventive and developmental services, comparedto families in the control group. HS families were alsoless likely to be dissatisfied with their pediatric primarycare. Additionally, HS had a positive impact on parent-ing in many areas including adherence to health visits,nutritional practices, developmental stimulation, appro-priate disciplinary techniques, and correct sleeping posi-tion. Other outcome measures (such as initiation orduration of breastfeeding, child development knowl-edge, sense of competence, and reports of child languagedevelopment at 2 years of age) did not differ betweenintervention and comparison group. Compared to other early childhood intervention ef- forts, HS offers a comparable positive impact on parent- ing at a relatively inexpensive cost: an estimated $400 perfamily per year (compared to $4500 from Early HeadStart). Approximately 3 years after the evaluation of HSended, 10 of the original 24 sites are still in operation,and an additional 24 sites have started up. Althoughfunding and reimbursement remain an important bar-rier, continued growth of HS suggests an abiding interestin this approach to expand and enhance preventive anddevelopmental care in pediatric primary care.

Healthy Steps represents a significant innova- tion in the way pediatric primary care can bedelivered. Its goal is to enhance and expand preventive pediatrics around developmental, behav-ioral, and psychosocial issues for families with chil- dren 0 to 3 years old and to enhance compliance withthe American Academy of Pediatrics Health Super-vision Guidelines 1and Bright Futures.2Although there are many components of Healthy Steps de- signed to achieve this goal, most important is theaddition of a professional, the Healthy Steps special-ist (HSS), to the pediatric team. The goal of this article is to inform the pediatric community aboutthis ongoing effort, including its background, imple-mentation, results of an outcome evaluation, andfuture plans. BACKGROUND Prevention and anticipatory guidance have been the hallmark of pediatric care for decades. The de- velopment of the American Academy of PediatricsGuidelines for Health Supervision, first in 1987 andupdated in 2002, was an attempt to delineate these efforts as a standard of practice for physicians, insur-ers, and policy makers. Decisions were made basedon limited data and current best practices. The goalof Bright Futures, funded by the Maternal and ChildHealth Bureau, was broader and included a publichealth perspective on child health promotion: otherhealth and community providers (schools, child carecenters, and parent groups) are asked to provideservices in a community-based effort to promotechildren's health. The opportunity and challenge ofthese 2 pediatric guidelines has acquired increasing urgency in the context of the rapid pace of socialchange, better understanding of brain development,an increasing emphasis on school readiness, growingawareness of the link between parental health andchild health, and a national focus on improving thequality of health care. The Current State of Parenting The increased number of working mothers with infants and family economic concerns present a spe- cial stress on families. At the same time, extendedfamily and neighborhood support for young parentsaround child rearing has declined over the past de- cades. Parents have been left to seek more informa-From the *Department of Pediatrics, Boston University School of Medicine/ Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts; and ICF Consulting, Fair-fax, Virginia.Accepted for publication Mar 15, 2004.DOI: 10.1542/peds.2003-0999-L Address correspondence to Barry Zuckerman, MD, Department of Pediat-rics, Boston Medical Center, 771 Albany St, Suite 02118.E-mail: barry.zuckerman@bmc.orgPEDIATRICS 4005).

The Com-monwealth Fund survey of parents with young chil-dren identified many unmet needs and concerns ofparents. 3For example, 4 of 5 parents surveyed ex - pressed a need for more information and support on common child-rearing issues such as sleep issues, responding to crying, toilet training, discipline, andhow to \"encourage children to learn. \"Although the vast majority expressed satisfaction with their pedi-atric clinician, most parents felt that additional ser-vices such as home visits by a nurse or a special telephone advice line would be useful. Approxi- mately half of the parents said they were havingdifficulty coping, and 40% said that they felt frus-trated by the child 's behavior or that their child \"got on their nerves \"at least once a day. Not surprisingly, parents in the study were also more likely to reportnegative disciplinary practices such as spanking, hit- ting, and yelling. Another survey conducted by Zero to Three 4 found that parents and other adults had, to some extent, limited or inappropriate understanding ofyoung children based on their developmental stages.Specifically, 2 important child-development conceptsare not well understood by parents: 1) more than halfthought that the more caregivers a child has beforethe age of 3, the better the child will be at adaptingand coping with change and 2) that the more stim-ulation a infant receives, the better. Neither is true.Infants need continuity with a limited number ofcaregivers to develop relationships, and too muchstimulation can be overwhelming. Finally, parentsdid not fully understand the connections betweenhealthy child development and their own parentingpractices. Beyond basic child rearing, many parents express feeling insecure and worried about just how to raise their children in a world that little resembles that oftheir own childhood. 4,5Should they try to raise a child who is friendly and cooperative, or should their focus be on fostering academic skills such as early reading? What should they make of their toddler 's unwillingness to share toys? Which is more impor-tant, cognitive or emotional development? Additionally, the litany of potential new threats to children 's well-being seems to be expanding (such as media violence and sexual content, community and domestic violence, sex, mothers 'early return to work, the adverse effects of less-than-high-qualitychild care, and the threats of living in unhealthyhome or community environments). As society grap-ples with new values and new challenges to childrenand the media and the Internet present an increasingarray of \"experts \"to advise parents (each with a different message and a different agenda), it is a small wonder that many mothers and fathers havebecome confused and would like to utilize their pe-diatric clinicians to help them make sense of thecacophony of mixed messages they are receivingfrom more sources than in the past. 5Better Understanding of Brain Development and the Importance of School Readiness New technologies have provided an understand- ing of brain development in children that empha- sizes, to a degree not recognized previously bymany, the importance of experiences in the first de-cade of life. To summarize: to a significant degree, the structure (architecture) of the adult brain isetched by early experiences. Studies (eg, positronemission tomographic scans, magnetic resonance im-aging, and counting synaptic density in pathologicspecimens) have demonstrated that the full comple-ment of neurons ( /H11011100 billion) is formed before the third trimester of gestation. The synapses betweenthese neurons, on the other hand, form largely afterbirth and are the result of an exquisitely complexinteraction of genetic controls and environmental in-put. The power of environmental factors to promote both the development and \"pruning \"of synaptic location and density had been previously underesti-mated. 6Additionally, emerging research has out - lined how cortisol, in response to stress, modifies neural connections needed for learning.7-11Even de - pression among mothers can alter the electroenceph-alogram of infants. 12It has been this emerging un - derstanding of the importance of the child 's experience for early brain development that has fu- eled newer federal efforts such as Early Head Start aswell as 2 White House conferences and numerous state initiatives to promote early childhood develop- ment and school readiness. The Importance of Parental, Especially Maternal, Health on Children 's Health and Development Advances in scientific knowledge have high- lighted the importance of maternal health (not lim- ited to health during pregnancy) on children 's health and development. Parental mental health problems,especially alcoholism, substance abuse, and/or de- pression, are associated with childhood behavior andlearning problems and childhood injuries. 13,14Paren - tal cigarette smoking (prenatally or after birth) can be associated with respiratory, learning, and behavior problems and an increased likelihood of the childsmoking during adolescence. 15Unsafe parental sex, for example, may lead to human immunodeficiencyvirus or other sexually transmitted diseases in new-borns. Unplanned, unwanted pregnancy can be as-sociated with child abuse and behavior problems. 16 The development of effective treatments17,18for many of these parental problems requires new strat-egies, especially by pediatric practices, and measuresto ensure that parents have access to health care forthe benefit of their own and their children 's health. Quality of Care More recently, the Institute of Medicine report ti- tled Crossing the Quality Chasm 2001 emphasized the importance of quality health care.19This presents a special challenge for pediatric care, for which, histor-ically, quality indicators have been limited to com-pliance with the periodicity schedule of visits andimmunizations. However, many studies of deliver- SPECIAL ARTICLES 821 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from ing developmental screening, individual anticipa- tory guidance items, or a combination of preventiveservices has demonstrated significant deficits inquality or \"opportunities for improvement. \" 20-22Sig- nificant barriers to enhancing the quality of care include staff time constraints, lack of reimbursement, and inadequate training of physicians. For example,a recent study indicated that it is not feasible, be- cause of the amount of time required, to deliver all preventive services recommended by the US Preven-tive Services Task Force. 23 Intervention in Early Childhood Can Matter Information continues to accumulate about the ef- ficacy of intervention efforts to improve parenting and promote children 's development. The results of many published interventions demonstrate positivechanges in child development as a result of early intervention, including and perhaps most importantan altered developmental pathway that leads togreater completion of school, decreased use of spe-cial education services, and, still later, fewer arrests,episodes of running away, sex partners, and alcoholconsumption in at-risk populations. 24-28Based on these data, pediatricians have been challenged to adapt some of these strategies and efforts to thepediatric practice, thereby augmenting other com-munity-based efforts to promote the health and de- velopment of young children. It was in this context that Margaret E. Mahoney, then president of the Commonwealth Fund, decided to operationalize her long-held vision that pediatricpractices could make more of a difference in the livesof children by better supporting the mothers andfathers of young children. She initiated HealthySteps as a large-scale, innovative, pediatric-based ef-fort to help mothers and fathers raise happy, healthy,successful, and productive children. We translatedher challenge into promoting maternal/paternal- child interaction and social-emotional developmentin the context of pediatric primary care basing theapproach, in part, on our previous work at BostonMedical Center. 14,29 -33 THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY STEPS Description of Healthy Steps Healthy Steps was designed to enhance the ability of pediatric practices to address the promotion of child development and family relationships moreeffectively. To meet these goals, traditional services offered in a pediatric and family practice are expanded in a Healthy Steps practice to include: \u007fThe addition of a professional, the HSS, to the pediatric team. The professional backgrounds of the HSSs have been varied and included earlychildhood education, nursing, and social work. \u007fEnhanced well-child visits, which emphasize the promotion of children 's development, including strategies to improve \"the goodness of fit \"be- tween parent and child, closer attention to paren-tal questions and concerns, and the use of \"teach- able moments \"to support better parentalunderstanding of their child 's behavior. An en- hanced Healthy Steps visit may be conducted jointly or sequentially by the pediatric clinicianand HSS. Reach Out and Read, an evidence-basedstrategy 30to promote book sharing and language development, is included as part of the enhanced visit. \u007fHome visits by the HSS, timed to specific devel- opmental needs in young children. dedicated mation line. \u007fChild-development and \"family health \"check-ups including developmental screening. \u007fWritten materials for parents that emphasize pre- vention and health promotion within the context of their relationships with family, pediatric, andcommunity resources. \u007fParent support groups. \u007fTighter linkages to community resources. Enhanced well-child visits with a pediatric clini- cian and an HSS allow for more time to be spent withfamilies. For example, the HSS might spend 15 to 30minutes after the pediatric clinician has finished with the examination to further explore salient develop-mental, behavioral, or psychosocial issues, or theHSS might choose to offer a home visit to further thework started in the office. Another key strategy has been the emphasis on the use of teachable moments 33by the pediatric team. Teachable moments involve using experiences and questions that occur in the context of the visit toprovide an opportunity for discussion, the explora-tion of parental feelings, modeling positive interac- tions, reframing negative parental attributions about their child, and providing specific information. Ateachable moment capitalizes on the parent 's imme- diate issues and concerns, when there is an increaseddesire to learn, rather than a preset list of anticipa-tory guidance issues, which may or may not coincidewith parental priorities. Many teachable momentsoccur in response to a parent 's questions but can also be found in the child 's office behavior or in responses to written materials such as prompt sheets. Teach-able moments provide a clinically effective and effi-cient approach to anticipatory guidance so that par-ents can prevent problems. The family health check-ups emphasize a 2-gener- ation approach to health care, attempting to identifyparental depression, family violence, drug and alco-hol use, and cigarette smoking in a more systematicway. Two new information sheets (available atwww.healthysteps.org) were developed. The first,called a Link Letter, is sent to parents before eachpediatric visit to describe the content and focus ofthat visit, emphasizing emerging developmental is-sues. The second is a prompt sheet (adapted fromwork done by Carol Lannon, MD), which is given to parents at the time of the visit. It contains commonquestions pertinent at each age involving safety, nu-trition, child development, etc. The goal of these 2written materials is to promote parental participationin the visit and make information-gathering moreefficient. 822 A CASE STUDY OF INNOVATION IN PEDIATRIC PRACTICE at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Implementation of Healthy Steps A National Advisory Committee consisting of 15 members including pediatricians and others with re- lated scientific clinical, policy, and business expertisewas appointed to provide oversight and leadership.A special funding strategy involving a national foun- dation (the Commonwealth Fund) and local funderswas developed to support and implement theHealthy Steps model. Typically, the local funder (eg,a community foundation) would identify a pediatricpractice with potential interest in implementingHealthy Steps. The national Healthy Steps programstaff investigated the interest and quality of the prac-tice as well as its ability to meet the data collection,sample size, and control/comparison-group require-ments of the rigorous evaluation outcomes. Site visitswere conducted to ensure adequacy of sites to par- ticipate in the program and evaluation. Sites wererequired to anticipate a patient base of /H11011200 new- borns within a 6- to 9-month period and be able toprovide a random-assignment control group or com-parison site. Fifteen sites were chosen to participate in the na- tional evaluation. Sites not chosen for the nationalevaluation were supported to become \"affiliate sites \" (data not included in outcome evaluation), of whichthere were 9 (6 of these sites implemented HealthySteps but did not include a comparison group fortheir evaluation, 2 implemented controlled evalua-tions, and 1 implemented a local evaluation). Sitesstarted providing services between 1996 and 1998, and the evaluation data collection at the last site was concluded in 2001. Training in Healthy Steps Healthy Steps staff (lead pediatric clinician and other pediatric clinicians who would be seeing Healthy Steps families, HSSs, lead practice adminis-trator, and other office staff when available) partici-pated in a 3- to 5-day intensive training sponsored by the multidisciplinary training team at Boston Univer-sity School of Medicine. The training institute care-fully infused team-building and organizational strat-egies into discussions of child and family behaviorand development, using case-based approaches tohelp practices develop their implementation strate-gies and learn techniques for better teamwork be-tween the HSS and pediatric clinicians. With support from the Gerber and Harris Founda- tions, a training videotape was made to improveclinicians 'observational skills of children 's behavior, developmental competencies, and parent-child inter- action. The training tape, along with a training man-ual,Strategies for Change: Child Development in Primary Care for Young Children , was designed to help the pediatric practice to individualize the care of eachchild, to focus on the whole child and the wholefamily, and to help clinicians and families build asupportive relationship. Group technical assistanceaddressing implementation strategies, best practices,etc was provided by monthly telephone conferencecalls with Boston University School of Medicine stafffrom the time of initiation of the project to the end.Members of the Healthy Steps administrative andtraining staff conducted quality-improvement sitevisits at /H110116 and 18 months after initiation. EVALUATION Sites The 15 national evaluation sites represented a range of practice settings including community- based group practices, health centers, primary careclinics within academic medical centers, and staff-model health maintenance organizations. The sub- jects recruited at birth from the 15 sites included 5565children and their parents. Eighty-eight percent ( N/H11005 4896) and 67% ( N/H110053737) of the original cohort were evaluated at 2 to 4 months and 3 years of age, re-spectively, which is favorable relative to other eval-uations tracking diverse samples. The final sampletended to have higher income and fewer age-appro-priate visits and vaccinations than the sample re-cruited at birth. There was, however, no selectiveattrition by intervention or control-group designa-tion among the nonresponders, suggesting validity of findings among the 67% completion rate. Methods The Women 's and Children 's Health Policy Center of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health conducted an independent evaluation of theeffectiveness of Healthy Steps in improving out-comes for families with young children. Although a randomized, controlled trial was generally to be pre-ferred, logistics and potential spill-over effects fromthe intervention to the control group made that prob-lematic in some sites. The result was a mixed designthat involved randomization in 6 sites in which itcould be done feasibly (ie, families within the samepractice randomized to a Healthy Steps model ver-sus routine care) and a \"quasi-experimental \"design for the 9 other sites (ie, an entire practice providesHealthy Steps care and is compared with a separatebut matched practice in the community that delivers their usual care). 34 Results HSSs kept logs of their contacts with families. These data demonstrate that services were fully im- plemented. Although there was variability amongsites in the number of contacts, the average familywho participated in the program to at least 15 months received the following services from theHSS: 9 office visits, 6 telephone calls, and 2 homevisits. However, only 20% of families attended atleast 1 parent group during the program. TABLE 1. Likelihood of Receipt of Services: Healthy Steps Versus Control Families 20 times more for receiving /H113504 of the Healthy Steps services 16 times more for a home visit 10 times more for discussing /H113506 age-appropriate topics with someone from the pediatric practice 8 times more for receiving a developmental assessment4 times more for receiving information and community resources 29 times more for receiving books to read to their children SPECIAL ARTICLES 823 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from Data on additional outcomes were collected by telephone interview with parents and show that Healthy Steps families received significantly morepreventive and developmental services comparedwith families in the control group (see Table 1). 35Not only did families receive more of the services, butHealthy Steps families were 2 times more likely toreport that someone in the practice \"went out of their way for them. \"Healthy Steps families were also less likely to be dissatisfied with the care they received from the child 's physician or nurse practitioner. 34 More important for pediatric clinicians is that Healthy Steps had a positive impact on parenting in many areas including adherence to health visits,nutrition, developmental stimulation, using appro-priate discipline techniques, and correct sleep posi- tioning (see Table 2). 35,36Among mothers with de - pressive symptoms (or who need help with sadness) or restricted their activities because of anxiety or depression, a larger percentage of Healthy Stepsmothers than control mothers discussed sadness with someone in the practice. The positive effects of the program were identified for all parents regard-less of their income, parity, or maternal age, suggest-ing a universal impact. Study limitations have beenpublished. 37 An\"embedded observations \"study supports and expands these findings. Intervention mothers at the second assessment point (age: 3 years) but not at thefirst assessment point (age: 16 -18 months) were more sensitive to their child 's signals during play and were more likely to match their interactions to their child 's developmental level, interests, and ca- pabilities, compared with comparison-group moth-ers. For those who participated in the home obser-vation at both assessment points, Healthy Stepsfamilies demonstrated greater security of attach-ment, 34which is associated with enhanced social and emotional development and serves as a source of resilience in the face of stress.38 Other measured outcomes showing no significant differences between the Healthy Steps and compar-ison groups include initiation or duration of breast-feeding, development knowledge, sense of compe-tence, self-report of nurturing behavior and expectation of children, or reports of children 's lan-guage development at 2 years of age. 35Mothers 'use of safety practices was fairly high overall, and no differences were found between Healthy Steps and control parents at 3 years. Maternal reports of behav-ioral problems fell within the normal range for re-ported behaviors in both groups. Interestingly,Healthy Steps mothers were more likely than com-parison mothers to report aggressive behaviors and sleep problems in their children, which could bebecause children in the Healthy Steps families actu-ally have more behavioral problems, compared withchildren in the control group. A more likely expla-nation, however, is that the Healthy Steps group feltmore comfortable in discussing a child 's behavior, particularly negative behaviors, with the team in aHealthy Steps practice. Cost Compared with other early childhood interven- tions, Healthy Steps achieved a relatively compara- ble positive impact on parenting (less overall impactcompared with Early Head Start but more short-termimpact on parenting compared with nurse home vis-iting) with less cost because of a less-intense level ofservices. 39,40For example, Early Head Start provides daily to weekly contact with low-income families at a cost of approximately $4500 per year. The Elmira Nurse Home Visiting Intervention provided an av-erage of 32 home visits from the fourth month ofpregnancy through the child 's second year at a cost of $6000 per year per family. These compare toHealthy Steps families who received 11 well-child visits, 2 home visits, and telephone access, costingapproximately $900 per year during the evaluation.Postevaluation experience with a population whosesize is not constrained by evaluation rules suggeststhat the cost of a comparable level of care per familyper year is approximately $400. Perhaps it is thespecial attributes of the pediatric clinician-patientrelationship that enhances the effectiveness of suchinterventions compared with similar strategies pro-vided in other settings. Studies of early childhoodinterventions show more significant outcomes inlater childhood that can result in savings on publicexpenditures, especially for high-risk children. 28,40 Whether Healthy Steps will show a similar pattern will be known after future follow-up reports. Limitations A significant methodologic challenge to the study involved the increased cost and logistics of outcomesmeasured by direct observation, compared with lessexpensive parent report and medical record reviews.Concern was raised, for example, about the lack ofsensitive instruments to assess social emotional de-velopment in very young children, especially byquestionnaire. The compromise involved using par-ent report of this outcome measure, coupled with an\"embedded study \"that allowed for direct observa- tion of parent-child interaction in 2 of the random-ized sites.TABLE 2. Likelihood of Parenting Outcomes: Healthy Steps Versus Control Families 27% less likely to report using severe physical discipline (slapped a child in the face or spanked him/her with abelt or other object) at 3 y 22% less likely to rely on other harsh strategies such as yelling, threatening, slapping a child 's hand, or spanking with their hand at 3 y 24% less likely to place their newborns (2 -4 mo) on their stomachs to sleep 70% more likely to bring child in for age-appropriate vaccines by or before 3 y 60% more likely to be sure child is up-to-date on their vaccinations by age 2 50-200%* more likely to bring child to age-appropriate well- child care visits at 3 y 20% less likely to give their newborns (2 -4 mo) water * Results vary depending on the age of the child. 824 A CASE STUDY OF INNOVATION IN PEDIATRIC PRACTICE at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from THE FUTURE OF HEALTHY STEPS Some 3 years after the evaluation phase of Healthy Steps ended, 10 of the original 24 sites (15 national evaluation and 9 affiliate) continue to provide Healthy Steps services. Based on direct contact with the sites, we know several things. First, virtually allwould have strongly preferred to continue withHealthy Steps. Second, the impediment to doing so isreimbursement for the HSS or specific services pro- vided. Recent approval by the Center of Medicareand Medicaid Services for a relative value for Cur-rent Procedural Terminology code 96110 (develop-mental screening, limited) for $13.81 to nonphysi-cians such as an HSS, nurse, etc will offset the cost ofan HSS 's salary. The long-term solution to this con- straint is to gain reimbursement for Healthy Stepsservices within the standard health care reimburse- ment systems (ie, health maintenance organizations,health insurers, and Medicaid). The current climatein the health care field is to reduce outlays unlessthese outlays can pay for themselves during the sameperiod in which the outlays are made. As a result, along-term preventive program such as Healthy Stepsfinds great interest but little reimbursement. Third,the 10 sites that continue to provide services and theadditional 24 sites that have begun to do so since theevaluation phase ended are funded in a variety ofways. Most sites receive philanthropic support, andseveral receive state funding from tobacco taxes andsettlement monies and also from grants from the state 's Medicaid program. Several sites receive funds from the health care institutions of which they are apart, suggesting that some in health care see thebenefits of Healthy Steps. Two sites creatively devel-oped strategies that pay for the program and can bereplicated. One pediatric practice substitutes HSStime for that of the physician for well-children visits.In this practice, pediatricians shorten a previouslyscheduled 30 minutes for well-child care to 20 min-utes with the HSS, spending time beyond 20 minuteswith parents. This allows the pediatrician to see onethird more patients, which helps pay for the HSS.Another strategy is using direct mail to allied obstet-rics practices to market Healthy Steps to first-timepregnant women, with dramatically positive resultsin terms of new patients. 41 What will it take to gain reimbursement for Healthy Steps? First, the societal concerns with the national issues discussed at the beginning of this article will have to rise in the national consciousness. Second, Healthy Steps has clear short-term benefits35 and, based on a significant amount of literature on the long-term benefits of early childhood interven-tions, the strong prospect of material, long-term ben-efits. 28,39,40At present, it will take pressure from parent-employees, the employers who pay the bulkof health care bills, and the Federal/State Medicaidprogram to force the health system to value long- term benefits. New sites are considering our recommendation of an adapted version of Healthy Steps, which includes community outreach by the HSS. In this model, theHSS will continue to be based in the practice but willalso provide outreach consultation and training to local Head Start, child care, and social service sites.The goal of this approach is to increase child-devel-opment expertise and capacity in community-basedorganizations and to foster the development of asystem of developmental services or connectivityamong many organizations serving young childrenand their parents. Additionally, a community-basedcomponent may be eligible for a variety of publicfunding streams as a means of supporting the HSS.In a similar vein, some communities are linking pub-lic health nurses and counselors to the medical prac-tice system. Another adaptation to reduce costs is totrain a current staff member to perform many but notall tasks of an HSS. The Healthy Steps approach has shown itself to be highly flexible and capable of adapting to a broadrange of community needs, population groups, andstaffing patterns (eg, training an existing staff mem-ber to perform the function of the HSS). Also, be-cause of fiscal constraints, some practices have re-duced the intensity of the program such asdecreasing the number of home visits or HealthySteps contacts at office visits. The use of HealthySteps within pediatric residency programs has been aserendipitous result of the program, providing a wayto meet residency board requirements for develop-mental and behavioral pediatrics. Healthy Steps hasdeveloped a training kit consisting of 9 videos andmultimedia CD-ROM (available through www.healthysteps.org), the use of which brings continuingmedical education credit, which replaces the need for3- to 5-day intensive training, although 1- to 2-daytraining is recommended. At the present time, $42 million has been invested to develop, implement, evaluate, and expandHealthy Steps to improve pediatric care and repre-sents a specific approach to related pediatric initia-tives such as the medical home, community pediat-rics, and collaborative care. Additional areas of studyinclude longer-term follow-up, cost-effectiveness, cost/benefit analysis, and identifying and refiningessential components. We are optimistic that its on-going expansion over the next decade will prove tobe an efficacious and cost-effective approach to rais-ing the level of quality of care that pediatricians andother child health professionals can offer to mothersand fathers of young children.
