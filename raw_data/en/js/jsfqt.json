Self-heal is an herb. The parts that grow above the ground are used to make medicine. Self-heal is used for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), diarrhea, colic, and stomach upset and irritation (gastroenteritis). It is also used for mouth and throat ulcers, sore throat, and internal bleeding. Some people use self-heal for HIV/AIDS, fever, headache, dizziness, liver disease, and spasm. It is also used to kill germs (as an antiseptic), loosen phlegm (as an expectorant), and tighten and dry skin (as an astringent). Self-heal is applied directly to the skin for vaginal discharges and other disorders of women's reproductive systems, as well as for wounds and bruises. Be careful not to confuse self-heal with another plant called sanicle. Sanicle is sometimes referred to as self-heal, but it's different. How does it work? Self-heal contains vitamins C and K, and thiamine. It also contains chemicals called tannins that might help reduce skin swelling (inflammation) and have a drying (astringent) effect on the tissues.
