Royeen, PhD, OTR/L, FAOTA, was appointed dean of the College of Health Sciences. She previously held the position of dean from 2003 to 2012 at the Edward and Margaret Doisy College of Health Sciences at Saint Louis University. As dean, she spearheaded the development of new programs and the expansion of several existing programs. Before being recruited by Saint Louis University, she held faculty leadership positions at Creighton University and Shenandoah University. Royeen received her master's degree in occupational therapy at Washington University School of Medicine and her doctorate from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. She has received many honors and awards for her work in the field of occupational therapy, including the Eleanor Clarke Slagle Lectureship Award - the highest scholarly award bestowed by the American Occupational Therapy Association. She has published more than 40 books and book chapters, as well as 75 journal articles. Royeen brings a wealth of leadership experience to the College of Health Sciences and to the entire Rush community. Fall 2015 Notes from the Chair It is hard to believe that summer is over and that we are preparing to fully immerse ourselves in the new academic year. As we prepare for the academic year I would like to acknowledge the work of our faculty and clinicians to make our practitioner -teacher -investigator model a reality. We are fortunate to have faculty who are experts in their practice areas and clinicians that are eager to provide didactic and clinical education to our students through assisting in labs, guest lecturing, serving as a course director and supervising various clinical opportunities such as Level I and II Fieldwork and clinical practicum experiences. It has been estimated that the clinicians at Rush University Medical Center provide approximately 2,304 hours to the academic preparation of our students. As a way of acknowledging the clinicians for all their work, the faculty recently held a clinician appreciation luncheon. During this luncheon a slideshow was presented that not only highlighted all the clinicians' contributions but contained special messages of thanks from our students for each of the clinicians at Rush. We are looking forward to many years of partnering with our clinicians to prepare the next generation of occupational therapists. This academic year brings with it planning for a major change that will be occurring at Rush with the implementation of the Student -focused Educational Excellence through the Design of an innovative curriculum (SEED) project. Through the SEED project, the College of Health Sciences will transition from quarters to semesters, pending Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) approval. We will also take this opportunity to move forward with our plans to apply for IBHE approval and candidacy with ACOTE to transition from an entry -level master's program to an entry -level doctoral program. Although a formidable task, it provides an excellent opportunity to look at our curriculum and make changes that will further enhance our academic program and immerse our students in clinical practice opportunities. Finally, I would like to extend my personal welcome to Dr. Charlotte Royeen as she assumes the role of the dean for the College of Health Sciences. It is very exciting to have an occupational therapist at the helm of the college, and we are all eager to work with her as we continue to build upon our excellent aca- demic and clinical programs here at Rush. -Linda M. Olson, PhD, OTR/L, FAOTA Amy Wagenfeld, PhD, OTR/L, SCEM, CAPS, Assistant Professor, held a book signing for her recently published, collaborative work titled, \" Design for Healing Spaces: Therapeutic Gardens\" at the AOTA conference held in Nashville this year. How to use gardens to promote physical and psychological health is easily translated in this book by using the principles of therapeutic design. Wagenfeld also nurtures her passion for OT and gardening by working on research with the Growing Solutions Farm in the Illinois Medical District. The farm is part of the Julie and Michael Tracy Family Foundation, whose mission is to better the lives of young adults with autism. She also assists the residents at the Self Help Home in Uptown on a garden related study. Wagenfeld's passion and drive to combine the art of gardening and occupational therapy using a therapeutic approach is also helping others outside of Chicago and the medical district. Working with the Els for Autism Foundation, she helped write and is presently managing a $500,000 Florida Cultural Facilities Grant to design and install a sensory garden and pavilion on the campus of the Els Center of Excellence. Her commitment to educate others on how gardens can support learning, movement, reconciliation and memorialization has been an educating and enlightening exposure for our students. We are excited about the opportunities Wagenfeld is giving our students along with the chance for them to be a part of the upcoming healing garden that is still in the conception and development stages at Rush. Book Signing Awards and Recognition Molly Bathje, MS, OTR/L, Academic Coordinator was awarded of the All -University Graduate Research and Creative Scholar Award in recognition of her scholarly efforts as a student in the PhD in Interdisciplinary Health Sciences at Western Michiga n University. This is the most significant honor that Western Michigan bestows upon its graduate students. It truly highlights Bat hje's dedication to her studies and to the profession of occupational therapy. She was recognized at a special reception at Western Michigan University, earlier this year. We are proud of Bathje for her professional achievements and the excellent example she sets for our students as she continues to further her education and advance her career.

Points of Interest Congratulations Class of 2015 2015 has proven to be a busy year for Rush's Student Occupational Therapy Association (SOTA). Between studying for exams, observing neurosurgery, kicking off research projects and completing Level I fieldworks, our SOTA members have also managed to squeeze in activities that help spread the good word about the field of OT and Rush University. At the annual AOTA conference in April SOTA Vice President Karie Carbone attended the Assembly of Student Delegates and was proud to represent both Rush and her peers as she accepted a certificate awarded to our OT students for participating in the AOTPAC Student Challenge. On July 23, 2015 our student SOTA organization sponsored a University Health Professionals Job Fair at Rush University. This fai r was open to all health professionals at the university and medical center. Proceeds from this event were distributed to Shriners Children's Hospital, the Rush University SOTA Conference Scholarship Fund and to the Class of 2016 for their efforts to raise money for the St. Catherine's Challenge. SOTA hosted ILOTA president Lisa Mahaffey to speak on her priorities for the upcoming year. Members also volunteered at the Best Buddies walk at the Brookfield Zoo and organized a \"Welcome Week\" of events to warmly greet the new Class of 2017. This year marked the 25th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act . Rush University 's OT students organize d a group to participate in the 2015 Disability Pride Parade in downtown Chicago on July 18 . SOTA member, Megan Doherty , wrote in an article for the ILOTA Communique, \"It is important for future OT's as well as practicing clinicians to get involved in the community to advocate not only for the profession, but those we provide services to.\" SOTA has significantly added to the many experiences OT students have at Rush, helping to create a well -rounded student experience at Rush.
