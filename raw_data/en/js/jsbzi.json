We've gone back and forth between treating the internet like a virtual town square on Twitter, revisiting our teenage archives on Tumblr, finding new identities on TikTok, and abandoning old ones on Instagram. Unshockingly, [last year's \"top\" memes](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-memes-2020)reflect the breadth of this range.

Through \"dark times\" \u2014 be they high school or a pandemic \u2014 that repetition can make us feel less alone. No matter what, as long as you get the memes, you're laughing with somebody. At this point in 2021, viral memes are a cacophony of [laugh-crying](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2021/02/10314024/gen-z-millennials-laugh-cry-emoji)moments. We were projectiled into 2021 with the same level of messiness that pulled us through 2020. Since we still don't know where exactly we'll end up, once again, we're going to keep a record of the most viral and impactful memes, one month at a time, to help us along on this journey. 1 of 10 my theater kid uncle meeting a counter-insurgent anti-communist cia agent during the cold war (1947)\u2014 read groundings with my brothers by walter rodney (@queersocialism) [pic.twitter.com/ORAzCIMKxt] [April 7, 2021] 2 of 10 10 [@chifunirobongani] what smacks harder??? lmk [#troyesivan] [#noHashtag] [ Dont be surprised if one day I - God] 5 of 10 6 of 10 7 of 10 AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT 8 of 10 9 of 10 GameStop is a cutting edge gaming and electronics retailer firm out of Texas, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of online merchandise stores...\u2014 Alex Wice (@AWice) [pic.twitter.com/3zWruYf753] [January 27, 2021] 10 of 10 He said some of us have a JOB\u2014 Lakyn "}
