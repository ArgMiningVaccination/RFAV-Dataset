No matter what kind of birth a woman has had, there is modern research and ancient traditions that use herbs to restore and support the body during the postpartum. Afterpains & Perineum Healing Post birth, the uterus contracts to prevent future bleeding and to eventually return to its pre-pregnancy state 6 weeks later. As the uterus contracts the mother may feel discomfort in the abdominal and pelvic areas - like intense period pain. Breastfeeding can reduce the length of time that a woman experiences afterpains. In addition to afterpains, the perineal area can feel tender, inflamed and bruised particularly if woman experienced any tears. Herbs: Raspberry Leaf: as with the lead up to birth, raspberry leaf tea balances the tone and contractions of the uterus, supporting it back to its normal size and also provides some nutrient support. Motherwort: best used in your herbal formula prescribed by your naturopath, this herb nourishes the mother in many ways, specifically with its antispasmodic actions on the womb - easing afterpains. Oats, Witch Hazel & Calendula: place oats, witch hazel and calendula in a warm bath to provide external healing of the perineum, ensuring at least the waist down is emerged in the water & herbs. Dry herbs can easily be purchased from a local health food, bulk food store or online (I use Austral Herbs). Breastfeeding Oestrogen and progesterone dramatically drop after childbirth allowing the hormone prolactin to begin milk secretion. For the first few days postpartum, prior to the initial milk letdown the nutrient rich substance colostrum nourishes baby which requires more effort on their part since it is a thicker consistency than breastmilk but ultimately that is what stimulates the milk letdown reflux to initiate breastfeeding. Insufficient milk supply is one of the most common breastfeeding challenges and the herbs below have been known to assist. Herbs: Fennel & Fenugreek: these two aromatic herbs have a galactagogue action known to promote the letdown reflex and stimulate milk production, they can also help baby when experiencing colic - add as fresh herbs in meals (in cookies even!), consume as a tea, or part of your herbal formula prepared by your naturopath. Chamomile: Since anxiety, depression & pain all inhibit the letdown reflex it is important for mama to have support, while chamomile won't do the dishes or laundry it is a beautiful nervous system tonic that is safe while breastfeeding. Breastfeeding Helpline 1800 686 268 Hormone Balancing Being pregnant is the biggest hormone high of a woman's lifetime. Elevated levels of oestrogen and progesterone are imperative to sustaining a healthy pregnancy. During labour and birth, the love-hormone oxytocin is front and centre giving mama all the strength to bring life into the world. Oxytocin stays a while as mama bonds with baby and begins her breastfeeding journey. Post birth, oestrogen and progesterone drop dramatically and oxytocin slowly fades. This can bring feelings of overwhelm. Recommendations: [Mothers Blend](https://www.lucyfitzgibbons.com/store/p/the-mothers-blend): a powdered blend containing high amounts of iron, iodine and probiotics. It is incredible for improving energy and resilience as it restores a lot of the nutrients that are commonly depleted from birth and breastfeeding. I highly recommend this product to all of my patients going through pregnancy & post-partum. Nervous System Nourishing As oestrogen & progesterone return to their pre-pregnancy levels, sometimes lower since ovulation can be inhibited by breastfeeding - understandably the dramatic drop can leave mama feeling low, overwhelmed and tired. In addition to the hormonal shifts, you're also adapting to your new role within the family system, adjusting to new sleep routines (or lack thereof), are on your own breastfeeding journey, oh and have just given birth! All of this will have an impact on the nervous system, here are some herbs to nourish it. Herbs: Withania: this loved adaptogen helps build resilience in times of stress. Passionflower: a hero herb for anxiety & stress. Gotu Kola: an all-rounder for new mamas as it is known for its connective tissue restoration (everything on the inside that's made room for baby), reduces nervous exhaustion and promotes mental clarity without stimulating. Raspberry Leaf, Motherwort, Oats, & Chamomile: all of these herbs that were mentioned are indicated in varying parts of the postpartum also nourish the nervous system. [TOTUM ~ Ground Me Tea](https://www.lucyfitzgibbons.com/store/p/ttum-ground-me-tea): a naturopathically formulated tea to nourish the nervous system and provide gentle support for daily stress. The herbs within this blend have been traditionally used by herbalists to promote relaxation, calm nervous tension, regulate sleep and balance moods. Take a moment to enjoy the fresh and sweet aromatic flavours of Ground Me tea to balance out your day and ease the mind. Every mamas journey is different, what is true is they have all recently worked through a huge physical, emotional, mental and spiritual transition that can take a real toll on the mind & body.

A special note to any woman experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety during their post-natal phase (even if your children are grown) .... please book an appointment. Post-natal depression and/or anxiety is often driven by underlying nutritional factors or hormonal imbalances. Naturopaths can help you. Reach out. xx "}
