Lumbar spondylosis is a condition where one of the vertebrae in your spine slips out of place, causing pain and discomfort. Many people have this condition without ever knowing it. In extreme cases, you might need medication or even surgery to correct the condition. However, most doctors prefer a more natural approach first. They'll probably recommend an exercise, stretching, rest, and physical therapy regimen to build strength and flexibility in your back. Many people see improvement after completing these steps. If these methods don't work, then contact your doctor for the next steps in your treatment. Steps Relieving Pain and Stiffness Whether your spondylosis is just acting up or has been painful for a while, there are several things you can do to relieve the discomfort. By applying heat or cold to the affected area and staying active, you can improve the pain significantly. If this doesn't work, then taking an NSAID pain reliever can also relieve the pain. If your condition doesn't improve after a week of treatment at home, then you should visit a doctor for more treatment options. - 1Apply ice to sharp or recent pains. If your pain acts up suddenly, then ice is the best treatment. Wrap an ice pack in a towel and hold it on the painful spot for 15-20 minutes at a time. Repeat this 2-3 times per day. [[1]](#_note-1)X Research source - Ice is also good for sharp pain in a small area. Even if you've had the pain for some time, you can still use ice in this case. - 2Use heating pads on older pains or dull soreness. If you've had the pain for more than a few days or it's more of a dull pain, then heat is a better option. Hold a heating pad onto the area for 15-10 minutes 3 times per day. [[2]](#_note-2)X Research source Advertisement - Don't fall asleep with an ice or heating pad on yourself. This could damage your skin. - 3Rest for a day or two if the pain is bad. While staying active is best, a bit of rest could help. Try laying on the couch or in bed for a few hours at a time to relax your back.
