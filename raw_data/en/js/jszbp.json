One-hundred fifty-two students took the solemn Oath of Hippocrates, signifying their commitment to the ancient tradition of healing, and pledging to serve humanity. This oath has stood the test of time, and represents the gold standard of moral and ethical behavior to which all physicians are bound. Our graduating medical students join the ranks of some 17,000 alumni, who have profoundly transformed medicine and science and who have brought honor to the profession and to this institution. Convocation is a time of celebration and reflection. As I look back over these last few years, I am struck the ability of our medical and graduate students to balance an intense desire to achieve personal and professional goals and a strong determination to make a difference in the lives of others. Our medical, graduate and allied health students have been taught and mentored by exceptional faculty members. They have been exposed to rigorous curricula, preparing them to become outstanding physicians, scientists, physical therapists and medical technologists. This year's medical school keynote speaker was Dr. Darrell Kirch, president and chief executive officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). A distinguished physician, educator, and medical scientist, Dr. Kirch is an expert on the nation's health care system, and how academic medicine can transform that system for the better. Pointing out that 50 million American's don't have health insurance, Dr. Kirch urged the graduates to help address disparities and injustice in the nation's healthcare system. He also voiced support for the \"medical home\" concept of care in which high functioning teams across the health professions are focused on the patient, not on the convenience of the clinic or hospital. I am proud to say that the University of Maryland is pioneering the medical home model of care through a strong collaboration with Johns Hopkins University and the state health department. Since 1807, the University of Maryland School of Medicine has produced some of the most outstanding physicians, scientists and educators of our time. In fact, 22 School of Medicine graduates have served as deans of medical schools. Among the many respected graduates, there are several prominent examples: - In 1948, Dr. Theodore Woodward, Class of '38, was part of a team that discovered the initial therapeutic cure for scrub typhus fever and was a Nobel Prize nominee. - In 1968, Dr. R Adams Cowley, Class of '44, directed the opening of the world's first Shock Trauma Center, which serves as the world's leading trauma center. - In 1985, Dr. Morton Mower, Class of '59, was co-inventor of the implantable automatic defibrillator, a life saving device used today by many. - In 2006, Dr. Melvin Sharoky, Class of '76, and a member of our Board of Visitors, received FDA approval for the first transdermal patch for the treatment of major depressive disorder. As we appreciate the accomplishments of the past, we must look to future. The health care landscape is changing rapidly and in ways that could not have been imagined even a decade ago. Our graduates will have the opportunity to participate in the transformation of health care, to shape its delivery, and to harness its potential to relieve suffering and illness. It is a daunting challenge, but the members of the Class of 2012 have shown that they have the dedication and determination to truly make a difference. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the Class of 2012, and to our entire academic community, which made their achievements possible. In the relentless pursuit of excellence, I am Sincerely yours, [E. Albert Reece](http://medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Reece-E.
