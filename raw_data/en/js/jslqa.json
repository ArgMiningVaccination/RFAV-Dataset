We are running clinics throughout June. We are currently working on vaccinating our housebound patients as a priority. ________________________________________________________ Full Record Access - 1st February 2023 The NHS wants to give people better ways to see their personal health information online. We know that many people would like easier access their health records, including test results and consultation details. You are now able to access the information within your health record automatically. If you are over 16 and have an online account, such as through the NHS App, NHS website, or another online primary care service, you will now be able to see all future notes and health records from your doctor (GP). Some people can already access this feature, this won't change for you. This means that you will be able to see notes from your appointments, as well as test results and any letters that are saved on your records. This only applies to records from your doctor (GP), not from hospitals or other specialists. You will only be able to see information from 1st November 2022. For most people, access will be automatic, and you won't need to do anything. Your clinician (eg GP or PA) may talk to you to discuss test results before you are able to see some of your information on the app. Your clinician may also talk to you before your full records access is given to make sure that having access is of benefit to you. There may be some sensitive information on your record, which in certain circumstances may have the potential to cause detriment to your health and wellbeing so you should talk to your clinician if you have any concerns. This could be for example if you are fearful of an abuser forcing you to disclose access to your record. These changes only apply to people with online accounts. If you do not want an online account, you can still access your health records by requesting this information through reception, by a Subject Access Request (SAR). The changes also only apply to personal information about you. If you are a carer and would like to see information about someone you care for, speak to reception staff. The NHS App, website and other online services are all very secure, so no one is able to access your information except you. You'll need to make sure you protect your login details. Don't share your password with anyone as they will then have access to your personal information. If you do not want to see your health record, or if you would like more information about these changes, please speak to your clinician or reception staff. ________________________________________________________ First Contact Physiotherapists Please see below a short film on First Contact Physiotherapists and the care they offer.

It is also shared with other organisations to support health and care planning and research. If you do not want your personally identifiable patient data to be shared outside of your GP practice for purposes except your own care, you can register an opt-out with your GP practice. This is known as a Type 1 Opt-out.
