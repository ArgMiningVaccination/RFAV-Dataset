Many of us are seeking answers both inside and outside of ourselves and it is through our connection to Spirit that we do this. Be it prayer, church, meditation, yoga, dream work, ritual, or spellwork; herbs can be used as a catalyst to improve and deepen your relationship with your divine source (whatever/whomever that may be). While many of us seek answers, getting them is not always easy! The human mind is a busy place with constant questioning, to-do lists, multi-tasking and random thoughts. It can be difficult, without years of practice and possibly training, to quiet this constant storm of consciousness. We are also in a constant battle with the ego part of our mind. The ego part of us loves to be louder than our heart and instincts. Unfortunately, Spirit does not communicate through ego. In fact, if you do receive intuitive thoughts, feelings or even messages, the ego will quickly tell you to dismiss them. So between the chaos that is the human mind and the pesky ego that thinks it knows everything, what is the spiritual person to do? For me, this is where herbs can come in as a trusty ally. I will be very clear here and state that they do not do the work for you, nor should they. A deeply fulfilling spiritual practice is often fulfilling because of the work we put into it. There is not easy or fast path to answers, enlightenment, ascension and the like. They can however, help to pave the way to a quieter mind and deeper connection.

The Herbs In absolutely no particular order, I will cover some of my favourite plant allies for depending your spiritual connection. Many can be grown in my area (USDA zone 4) either as perennials or annuals. Following this list I will cover some of the preparation methods you can use to utilize these herbs in your spiritual practice. I will not be covering any herbs that are considered dangerous and poisonous, for obvious reasons. While many of these herbs can be safely used to enhance spiritual connection, I do not have experience with it and therefore cannot speak on this in an educational way. If you choose to work with allies such as these, please proceed with caution. Please understand something. Herbs that are harvested or cultivated in any way that abuses the land or the plant will not produce the results you desire. If cultivating connection is the end goal, abusing a portion of this ecosystem and cosmic web we call life is not the way to do it. Remember; always set the intention that whatever works are you doing should bring no harm and be for your highest good. If you believe in past lives, your soul may have had a very long life thus far. Some things are better left buried in the subconscious or Akashic records. To set the intention for your highest good ensures that whatever visions, dreams, intuitions, thoughts or memories you bring forth will be for your own personal growth and for good.
