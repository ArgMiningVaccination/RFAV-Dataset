Easy to apply and easily absorbed, lightweight leaving my skin feeling so smooth. Love this product! - Soothing I love this product, especially the smell and the smooth silky feeling my skin has after using it. I don't recommend using it for this purpose, but it is mild enough to remove eye makeup at a pinch. - Absorbs well This oil absorbs really well into the skin when used right before bed, but i would have preferred a stronger scent as i'm used to using undiluted lavender essential oil - Perfect for night time I rub this oil in my chest every night before I go to bed. The oil absorbs really quickly and your left with a light scent that you can drift off to sleep with. Highly recommend! 5 stars! - Very relaxing I love this product, I use it after using the lavender bath milk as my 'go to' routine when I need to relax. It's a great alternative to moisturiser, as it soaks into the skin easily without feeling greasy. I also use it as a massage oil for my legs, shoulders and neck when they're feeling a bit sore.
