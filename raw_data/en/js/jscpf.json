CRYSTAL is now bringing innovation into the oral care whitening category with the launch of True Minerals, a naturally formulated mineral-enriched teeth whitening line providing a safe alternative to harsh strips & trays. \"Most people want whiter teeth, but research shows relatively few individuals whiten daily out of the fear of damaging their enamel or putting harsh toxins in their mouth. Crystal True Minerals solves that problem and gives retailers and consumers a trusted option in a growing category,\" said Martin Floreani, CEO. \"The new True Minerals line includes two unique, clinically proven whitening sets, both featuring clean vegan ingredients that are gentle, sulfate-free, and enamel-safe.\" CRYSTAL True Minerals Advanced Dental Whitening System safely whitens teeth with an easy three-step process. The priming Brightening Rinse and stain-lifting Whitening Serum are designed to remove stains gently and effectively. The whitening process is accelerated with the power of heat and light provided by the CRYSTAL patented dual-energy Xenon & LED Light. Results can be improved and maintained by brushing regularly with the included Mineral-Enriched Whitening Toothpaste, packed with replenishing minerals and clean ingredients to gently remove surface stains for a whiter, brighter smile. True Minerals is clinically proven to help teeth look six times whiter than with brushing alone. ($34.99) CRYSTAL True Minerals Daily Teeth Whitening Kit & Refill is a safe and simple two-step process with priming Brightening Rinse and stain-lifting Whitening Serum for a smile that shines brightly every day, naturally. For even more brightening benefits, brush with included Mineral-Enriched Whitening Toothpaste, which is rich in minerals to softly remove surface stains for a whiter, brighter smile.
