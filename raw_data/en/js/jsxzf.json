Vaccine Effectiveness Overview - A large body of evidence suggests that vaccines are safe and effective against COVID-19. - All viruses evolve over time through genetic variations. These changes can cause the emergence of new \"variants\" of the original virus and may have different properties than the original virus, such as increased transmissibility or the ability to cause more severe disease. Omicron, along with its sub-variants, is the currently circulating variant of concern (VOC) in Alberta. - Omicron has demonstrated increased transmissibility and capacity to evade the body's immune response compared to previous versions of the virus. This occurs whether this immunity was generated by infection, vaccines, or both. - The protection that vaccines provide against severe disease continues to be strong even many months after immunization. Two doses of a COVID vaccine dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization or death, and a third dose will offer even more protection. A booster dose is recommended at 5 months after the second dose, and at least 3 months following infection with COVID-19, to increase the level of protection against severe outcomes. - COVID vaccines are not always able to provide protection against infection by Omicron or one of its subvariants. Immunity against infection wanes over time, but can be boosted with a third or fourth dose of an mRNA vaccine. - Fourth doses, or second boosters, are most important for those at high risk of severe outcomes. For considerations on these doses, see [https://www.alberta.ca/article-choosing-a-second-vaccine-booster.aspx](https://www.alberta.ca/article-choosing-a-second-vaccine-booster.aspx) The Evidence A [systematic review](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00409-1/fulltext#:~:text=Primary%20vaccine%20series%20effectiveness%20against,6%20to%2060%C2%B72%5D%20during) of the evidence published between December 2021 and April 2022 in The Lancet Infectious Diseases found that the VE of a primary series (for most people, this is two doses) against severe outcomes remained high and stable over time at over 80%. [1, 2] VE against infection by Omicron was lower than for previous variants and waned over time with most protection against infection lost by 4-6 months post second dose. However, boosting with a third dose increased the VE against infection with Omicron (to about 60%) and against severe outcomes (to 90%). [1, 2] The figure on page 20 of [this document](https://www.thelancet.com/cms/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00409-1/attachment/f96cafe0-f6e1-4d00-b08d-a5b5786c7f5b/mmc1.pdf) helps to illustrate the results from the evidence, for both the primary series as well as for a booster dose. Another [evidence review](https://www.mcmasterforum.org/docs/default-source/product-documents/living-evidence-syntheses/covid-19-living-evidence-synthesis-6.38---what-is-the-efficacy-and-effectiveness-of-available-covid-19-vaccines-in-general-and-specifically-for-variants-of-concern.pdf?sfvrsn=be5dca50_5), published by McMaster University on June 22, 2022, also examined the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Omicron variant. It found that in general, people with a primary series continue to have a good level of protection against hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 for 7 to 8 months after being vaccinated. A third (booster) dose increases this protection against COVID-19 related hospitalisations, with a very minimal degree of waning after several months. [3] In addition to reviews that assess the VE of second and third doses, there is emerging evidence on the benefit of a fourth dose. A recently published study in healthcare workers from Israel found that only 7% of those with a fourth dose became infected with Omicron, versus 20% of those with only three doses, demonstrating increased protection against infection. Infections were either asymptomatic or mild and no severe outcomes were seen. [4] Note that this data is current up to August 5, 2022 and will be updated periodically as new information emerges.

Scores are separated into 3 categories, with -1 to 1 being close to the provincial average, >1 being higher than average, and < -1 being lower than the provincial average. Laboratory Testing Variants Summary NOTE: People are identified as COVID-19 cases prior to variant of concern identification. As such, variant of concern reporting is delayed compared to date the case was reported to Alberta Health. Due to the large number of positive COVID-19 cases, the lab screened a sample of positive cases between May 1, 2021 and May 31, 2021, September 9, 2021 and November 23, 2021, and December 23rd, 2021 and February 9, 2022. As of February 2, 2023 the laboratory transitioned from variant screening to whole genome sequencing (WGS) only. Note: As of February 2nd, 2023 the laboratory transitioned from variant screening to whole genome sequencing (WGS) only. Note: Genotype classification is based on the most specific typing available at time of reporting, either sequencing or screening results. As of February 2nd 2023, all samples preferentially undergo sequencing instead of screening. Note: Genotype classification is based on the most specific typing available at time of reporting, either sequencing or screening results. Wastewater surveillance Project Details The Alberta Wastewater Surveillance Program is a collaboration between the University of Calgary, University of Alberta, Alberta Precision Labs, and Alberta Health. SARS-CoV-2 virus has been demonstrated to be passed in the feces of a significant proportion of infected individuals, individuals infected with COVID-19 may pass the virus in their feces before they become asymptomatic. As such wastewater can provide an early indication of infection trends in a community. Wastewater monitoring is one of many tools in understanding the overall burden of infection in a community, and provides a broad picture of infection in a community. More details on this project and additional wastewater data can be viewed on the University of Calgary's Centre for Health Informatics' [COVID-19 wastewater dashboard](https://covid-tracker.chi-csm.ca/wastewater) Click on your community's Zone below to view its' wastewater data Wastewater Data is updated with the most current data delivered to Alberta Health. This data is received around the same time data is updated on the University of Calgary's CHI Health tracker Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons. These data are incorporated into Alberta Health wastewater reporting on the next scheduled reporting date. As such, there may be short and temporary discrepancies between the wastewater data displayed between the two websites. For more information on wastewater data interpretation, see the [Data Notes](#data-notes) tab. Data Export Data are subject to change. Fluctuations are expected as cases are investigated and updated. Data are provided for export in csv format. Summary data starting March 6, 2020 Data included up to end of day July 24, 2023. Geospatial data Data included up to end of day July 24, 2023. Vaccine data Data included up to end of day July 24, 2023. Data Notes Data sources The Provincial Surveillance Information system (PSI) is a laboratory surveillance system which receives positive results for all Notifiable Diseases and diseases under laboratory surveillance from Alberta Precision Labs (APL). The system also receives negative results for a subset of organisms such as COVID-19. The system contains basic information on characteristics and demographics such as age, zone and gender. The Communicable Disease Reporting System (CDRS) at Alberta Health and the Communicable Disease Outbreak Management (CDOM) system at Alberta Health Services contains information on COVID-19 cases. Data Integration and Measurement Reporting (DIMR) database at Alberta Health Services contains up to date information on people admitted and discharged from hospital in Alberta. Information such as hospitalizations and ICU admissions are received through enhanced case report forms sent by Alberta Health Services (AHS). COVID-19 vaccinations and AEFIs are reported to the Provincial Immunization and Adverse Reaction to Immunization (Imm/ARI) repository. In Alberta, all health practitioners are required by law to report Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) to Imm/ARI. The reporting requirements are outlined in the Immunization Regulation, under the Public Health Act. Case definitions are further defined in the AEFI Policy. As of January 1, 2021, all health practitioners are required to report all (both provincially funded and privately purchased) vaccinations electronically to Imm/ARI. Wastewater surveillance data Due to differences in Wastewater composition across the province, data should not be compared between municipalities. Instead, good practice when analyzing wastewater data is to look at the general trend within a community. Two SARS CoV-2 gene targets, the N1 and N2 genes, are tested for in the wastewater. The average signal in gene copies/mL is presented. Definitions COVID-19 Deaths A death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death identified (e.g., trauma, poisoning, drug overdose). A Medical Officer of Health or relevant public health authority may use their discretion when determining if a death was due to COVID-19, and their judgement will supersede the above criteria. A death due to COVID-19 may be attributed when COVID-19 is the cause of death or is a contributing factor. Lab Positivity COVID-19 percent positivity in Alberta is calculated using the Test Over Test method, which is the same method employed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The calculation is as follows: Daily Number of Positive Tests / (Daily Number of Positive Tests + Daily Number of Negative Tests) Q/RT-PCR tests are the only COVID-19 tests included in this calculation. Pre-existing Conditions The following pre-existing conditions are included in respective analyses: diabetes, hypertension, COPD, cancer, dementia, stroke, liver cirrhosis, cardiovascular diseases (including IHD and congestive heart failure), chronic kidney disease, and immuno-deficiency diseases. Vaccine coverage Individuals who received at least one dose was calculated as (# of individuals who received at least one dose) / (population estimate). Those who received two doses was calculated as (# of individuals who received two doses) / (population estimate). As of January 19, 2022 all doses administered in First Nations communities are submitted directly into Imm/ARI and the data reconciliation resulted in the removal of approximately 20,000 doses. Outbreaks Reporting for outbreaks vary by site/location and time, please visit [here](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/coronavirus-covid-19) for more details on the latest definitions.
