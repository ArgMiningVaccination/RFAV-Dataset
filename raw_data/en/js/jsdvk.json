Hitzig conceived the idea of commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of The Mount Sinai Hospital by honoring Mount Sinai physicians for distinguished achievement in the field of medicine or for extraordinary service to the alumni. Dr. Abraham Jacobi, after whom the medallion is named, was one of the early presidents of The Mount Sinai Hospital Medical Board and eventually became President of the AMA. He is credited with founding the specialty of pediatrics and, together with his wife Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, established the first pediatric clinic in the United States. A man of broad interests, humanistic philosophy, investigative acumen, and clinical skill, he stands as a model not only for Mount Sinai, but for the entire medical profession.The Jacobi Medallion WELCOME Eric M.

Marin, MD, MSSM '842Message from the President and Chief Executive Officer Welcome to the 2020 Jacobi Medallion ceremony. The Mount Sinai Alumni Association bestows its highest honor, the Jacobi Medallion, upon members of the Mount Sinai community who have made outstanding contributions to the field of medicine, whether through clinical excellence, biomedical research, or medical education. In many cases, our honorees have excelled in all three arenas\u2014the clinic, the laboratory, and the classroom. The Alumni Association may also award a Jacobi Medallion for exceptional contributions to the Mount Sinai Health System, and this year our longtime T rustee Michael Minikes is honored for his dedication and generosity in helping build Mount Sinai into one of the nation's leading academic medical centers. The Alumni Association's honorary medallion is named for Abraham Jacobi, MD, a pioneer in the field of pediatric medicine, who was affiliated with Mount Sinai for 59 years. In 1878, he established the nation's first inpatient department of pediatrics at The Mount Sinai Hospital. For this and numerous other achievements, Dr. Jacobi is considered \"the father of pediatrics.\" Our 2020 medallion honorees have distinguished themselves by following in Dr. Jacobi's tradition of excellence through extraordinary service to the Mount Sinai Health System, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Alumni Association. They are Joshua B. Bederson, MD; Nina Bhardwaj, MD, PhD; Douglas T. G. MBA, MSSM '77; and Samuel Waxman, MD, MSH '64. This year, we will also have the passing of the Gold-Headed Cane from Jerome D. Waye, MD, MSH '63, to Michael L. Marin, MD, MSSM '84. The Gold-Headed Cane award is the pinnacle to which a Mount Sinai physician may aspire. This award is rarely presented, and only then to the physician who best represents the professional and personal traditions of Mount Sinai. Congratulations to the 2020 Jacobi Medallion and Gold-Headed Cane recipients.Thank you for joining the Alumni Association in celebrating Mount Sinai's commitment to academic and medical excellence. Sincerely, Kenneth L. Davis, MD, MSSM '73 President and Chief Executive Officer, Mount Sinai Health System3 Message from the Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a leader in medical education and research because of the highly talented physicians and scientists we attract to our faculty. Thanks to their dedication, our graduates are equipped to make great contributions in clinical medicine and biomedical research. It is an exceptional distinction to be honored among Mount Sinai educators and graduates. T o be chosen for an award by the alumni of the School of Medicine is an even higher accolade. This year the Mount Sinai Alumni Association is bestowing its highest honor, the Jacobi Medallion, upon innovators who have challenged the status quo in medicine, expanded our understanding of biomedical science through significant basic and translational research, devised new approaches to patient treatments, and shared their passion and knowledge with students to improve the practice of medicine. Congratulations to our 2020 Jacobi Medallion recipients: Joshua B. '01; G. MSSM '77; and Samuel Waxman, MD, MSH '64. The Alumni Association is also bestowing a Jacobi Medallion upon Trustee Michael Minikes for his years of dedication to Mount Sinai and his role in enabling our physicians and students' success. And for the first time since 2014, the Gold-Headed Cane will be passed, to Michael L. Marin, MD, MSSM '84, from Jerome D. Waye, MD, MSH '63. Rarely presented, and only to those who best represent the professional and personal traditions of Mount Sinai, the Gold-Headed Cane is the pinnacle to which a Mount Sinai physician may aspire. During their years of service, the Jacobi Medallion and Gold-Headed Cane recipients of 2020 have raised the bar of excellence at Mount Sinai. We are proud of their achievements and the contributions they have made to the Icahn School of Medicine, the entire Mount Sinai Health System, and the field of medicine. Sincerely, Dennis S. Charney, MD Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Dean, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai President for Academic Affairs,Mount Sinai Health System 4Message from the President of the Mount Sinai Alumni Association It is my pleasure to welcome you to the 68th annual Jacobi Medallion Reception and Awards Ceremony. I am honored to be your new President of The Mount Sinai Alumni Association and thank my predecessor, Dr. Burton Cohen, for his leadership. And a special note of gratitude to Dr. Sandra Masur, Chair of the Jacobi Medallion Selection Committee, for ensuring the success of tonight's event. The Jacobi Medallion, established in 1952 commemorating the 100th anniversary of The Mount Sinai Hospital, honors extraordinary service to Mount Sinai, the Icahn School of Medicine, and the Alumni Community. This year, the Alumni Association is proud to award nine of Mount Sinai's finest with the Jacobi Medallion: Joshua B. G. MBA, MSSM '77 and Samuel Waxman, MD, MSH '64. Additionally, tonight in a presentation rarely seen, we'll also be celebrating the passing of the Gold-Headed Cane. The Gold-Headed Cane Award is the pinnacle to which a Mount Sinai physician may aspire, and this year the Cane will be passed from Jerome Waye MD, MSH '63 to Michael L. Marin, MD, MSSM '84. The Mount Sinai Alumni Association's founding mission is to support lifelong education and mentorship among former house staff and the attending physicians of The Mount Sinai Hospital. With the establishment of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the Alumni Association expanded to welcome members of its first graduating class. We now also welcome members of its growing health care system. As faculty and mentors at the Icahn School of Medicine, we have the opportunity to provide students and trainees with all of the resources they need to thrive in medical school and their future careers as physicians and scientists. The Enhanced Scholarship Initiative (ESI) strengthens our ability to recruit outstanding students while making a meaningful difference as they begin their careers in science and medicine without the burden of debt. T oday, the vision of Mount Sinai is remarkable as we dramatically advance the art and science of medical care through an atmosphere of intense collaboration, learning, scholarly inquiry, and social concerns. We thank you all for being a part of Mount Sinai and the School of Medicine's legacy and future. Congratulations to all recipients and enjoy tonight's program. Sincerely, Eric M. Genden, MD, MBA, MSSM '92, MSH '99 President, The Mount Sinai Alumni Association Senior Associate Dean for Clinical AffairsIsidore Friesner Professor and System Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 5Message from the 2020 Jacobi Medallion Selection Committee Chair We celebrate the 2020 Jacobi Medallion winners tonight. They exemplify the highest ideals of our community. The range and quality of their contributions have enriched our knowledge, our workplace, our patients, our students and trainees, and beyond. We celebrate them all; Joshua B. Bederson, Nina Bhardwaj, Douglas T. Dieterich, Carol R. Horowitz, Yasmin S. Meah, Miriam Merad, Michael Minikes, David G. Nichols, and Samuel Waxman, and we look forward to the continuing impact of their contributions to Mount Sinai and to the larger biomedicine community. The Jacobi award was established in 1952 on the 100th anniversary of the founding of The Mount Sinai Hospital. The award is equally meaningful 52 years after the founding of our medical school in 1968. In the earlier years, the Jacobi honored physicians who were so outstanding that they were known as physicians' physicians, many of whom made seminal clinical observations that defined syndromes and diseases. And today we continue to honor these outstanding physician colleagues as well as outstanding clinician educators and scientists who are part of our Mount Sinai community. It was my honor to chair the Jacobi Medallion committee again. The number of truly excellent nominations we receive is ever more impressive. Each nominee is notable for their contributions to biomedicine or their extraordinary service especially to the Hospital, the School, or the Alumni Association. The quality of these candidates made us, the committee members, feel very proud and it also made our task very challenging. The nominees' depth and breadth indicated the extraordinary pipeline of talent connected with our institution. So let us honor this year's Jacobi Medallion winners who reflect the diversity of our community and contributions, and look forward to celebrating many more of our extraordinary colleagues in the future.

Masur, PhD, FASCB Chair, Jacobi Awards Committee Professor, Ophthalmology and Pharmacological SciencesChair, Committee on Special Awards Director, Office for Women's Careers Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai 6Message from the Office of Alumni Relations On behalf of the Mount Sinai Office of Alumni Relations, a sincere congratulations to the 2020 Jacobi Medallion recipients! Thank you for your contributions to science, medicine and to Mount Sinai. This evening is for you, your loved ones, and for the many patients whose lives your work has impacted.

This unique honor celebrates your excellence and our alumni community is thrilled to see this tradition continue. I would like to recognize with gratitude the many alumni who are no longer with us. These men and women dedicated themselves to the practice of medicine, and Mount Sinai will honor their legacies for generations to come.

This award is rarely presented, and only then to the physician who best represents the professional and personal traditions of Mount Sinai. This award was established in 1941 by Dr. Bernard S. Oppenheimer (H. 1904), Chief of the First Medical Service. The cane, which is passed on to succeeding generations, is a replica of a cane that is in the library of the Royal College of Physicians in London. In remarks given when he passed the golden cane to Dr. Arthur H. Aufses, Jr., MSH '56 in 1982, Dr. Morris B. Bender, MSH '35 described the meaning of the original cane: The history of the Gold-Headed Cane, which was carried by a series of distinguished physicians, began in London in the 17th century. It was first carried by a Dr. Radcliffe from 1689 to 1714 and it accompanied him on many consultations. He was one of the most renowned physicians of his day and was sought by royalty for his medical skills. He treated King William III for asthma with success, but he could not cure the fatal small pox of Queen Mary. Radcliffe explained the medical failure with the excuse, which is used to this day, ' I have been called too late.\" He was not the most learned physician but he was the most popular- a situation not unknown in our times. In 1714 Radcliffe passed his cane to Dr. Mead, an accomplished and liberal scholar. He was the most illustrious practitioner of the mid- eighteenth century. Among his patients was Sir Isaac Newton, who he treated for bladder stone in 1726. He was also physician to King George II and other members of the royal family. Subsequently, the cane was passed on to other eminent physicians. The last recipient was Dr. Matthew Baillie, a distinguished practitioner and pathologist who died in 1823. Two years later his window donated the cane to the Royal College of Physicians in London where it has remained until this day. Dr. Oppenheimer, a former Alumni President, appreciated the value of tradition, and had the replica cane made. On February 10, 1942, Dr. Oppenheimer presented the cane to Dr. Eli Moschcowitz (H. 1903), then Chief of the First Medical Service. It became the custom that the cane is passed along when retirement age is met, or in medical school terms, when Emeritus status is reached. The new recipient is chosen by the current holder and any former honorees still living. Holders of the Golden-Headed Cane: Eli Moschcowitz, MD - awarded 1941 D avid B.

Nichols, MD, MBA, MSSM '7729 Samuel Waxman, MD Founder and CEO of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation (SWCRF), is an oncologist/hematologist and a physician scientist. In collaboration with scientists in Shanghai, China, Dr. Waxman found a cure for acute promyelocytic leukemia, which once had a 100 percent fatality rate but now has a 95 percent survival rate. He received the Friendship Award from the Chinese government for this work in 2018. Convinced that ongoing collaboration brings faster cures to patients, Dr. Waxman founded the SWCRF and the concept of the Institute Without Walls to more rapidly bridge the gap between the bench and bedside. Scientists funded by the SWCRF have made significant breakthroughs in cancer research by identifying pathways to deliver drugs and novel therapies to treat cancer. The SWCRF is dedicated to finding cancer treatments that reprogram cancer cells so they behave like normal, healthy cells. SWCRF scientists have demonstrated that this approach results in less toxic treatments that can cure cancer. Since its inception in 1976, the SWCRF has awarded over $100 million to support the work of more than 200 researchers. The SWCRF is leading a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute and National Institute on Aging to understand and prevent the rising incidence of cancer due to aging. Dr. Waxman has published more than two hundred and fifty peer-reviewed scientific papers and was among the first scientist to identify folate binding proteins and their function, and pioneered the use of leucovorin to enhance 5-FU treatment of colon cancer. He was the first to demonstrate differentiation as a cancer therapy. He has also contributed chapters to textbooks on hematology, chemotherapy, and nutrition and authored two books: Differentiation Therapy and The Leukemia Cell. Recently, Dr. Waxman and members of his lab, with NIH funding, have identified a targeted adjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer based on phenotypic reprogramming.
