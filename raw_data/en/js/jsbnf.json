If you're unsure how to get started in eating to lose weight, this meal plan will provide you with a variety of meals that contain a balance of fat, carbohydrates and protein. Any one meal or plan is not going to result in dramatic weight loss. The purpose of this plan is to help you control your calorie intake and eat macro nutrients in balanced proportions. While we do have a dietitian on our staff, we do not specifically prescribe this program to any individuals. The weight loss meal plan is meant to provide you with a variety of meals that would be consistent with Recommended Daily Allowances outlined by the FDA. Each customer should consult a physician before beginning a diet program. By purchasing our Weight Loss Meal Plan, you will receive a variety of meals that we select for you that will average the following parameters: 500 calories or below per meal 45g of carbohydrates or below per meal 20g of fat or below per meal The Weight Loss Meal Plan is going to have more carbohydrates in general than the [Keto Meal Plan](/products/keto-meal-plan-delivery). Why? If you're not accustomed to eating a keto diet, which is low in carbohydrates and high in fat, you could be left feeling hungry shortly after your meal, which may lead you to eat more unhealthy food to feel full. Therefore, the weight loss meal plan is intended to be an introduction to healthy eating. It contains more carbohydrates so that you will not consistently be hungry after eating a meal. In this meal plan, you can not select which meals you would like. If you know what meals you'd like to order, please use the [Build Your Meal Plan](/products/build-a-meal-plan) option to order. For every 6 weight loss meals you order, 1 of those meals will be a breakfast meal. The weight loss meal plan is intended to provide you an introduction to our meals through a lot of variety.
