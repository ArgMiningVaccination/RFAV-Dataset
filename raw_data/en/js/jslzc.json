To evaluate the ingestion ofprocessed placenta as a puerperal remedy, the potential risks(trace elements, microorganisms) and possible benefit (hor-mones in the placental tissue) of such a practice are discussedin this article based on a literature review. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die -852GebFra Science | Review after parturition, or the tissue is heated, dried and then pulver- ized. Placenta encapsulation, whereby the placenta is processedinto capsules, is a common practice in the Anglo-American world.It entails the filling of placental tissue as a dried powder into gela-tin capsules for everyday consumption [2] ( Fig. 1 ). Placenta capsules have to be destinguished from placental auto-nosodes produced in pharmacies according to the specifica- tions of the homeopathic pharmacopoeia. Methodology A systematic search for literature was conducted in PubMed andthe Web of Science Core Collection databases human placentophagy pub-lished between 1918 and 2018, and animal studies relevant toclinical assessment, were included ( Table 1 ). In addition, a selective review of gynaecological, anthropological and legal liter-ature was undertaken. The development of the placenta Fertilisation leads to the development of the blastocyst, whichconsists of the embryoblast (cell mass from which the embryo de-velops) and trophoblast (from which the fetal membranes and fe- tal elements of the placenta develop). The embryonic pole of theblastocyst is connected to the endometrium of the uterus duringimplantation and completely penetrates the maternal connectivetissue, where there is a plentiful supply of blood. The placenta be-gins to develop once the endometrium starts exerting metabolic and secretory activity in response to the presence of the blasto- cyst. The syncytiotrophoblast develops from the outer layer ofthe blastocyst and is the basis for development of the placenta. Aclose connection between the maternal and embryonal blood cir-culation facilitates the exchange of gases and metabolites by dif-fusion. This does not result in direct contact between the mater-nal and fetal blood -functions as a barrier, regulating the passage of substances. The physiological role of the placenta during pregnancy is ex- tremely complex: metabolism, excretion, respiration and immu-nological processes such as hormone synthesis ensure and regu-late the survival and growth of the fetus and the adaptation ofthe mother s body to pregnancy and childbirth. Hormones such as oxytocin, human placental lactogen, (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), some of them are produced exponentially during pregnancy [3].

Shortly before parturition,the progesterone concentration reaches a plateau. Fetal DHEAand DHEA S is converted in the placenta to estrogens; hence, the estrogen-progesterone gradient shifts towards the end of preg-nancy, resulting in estrogen dominance [5]. After delivery of the placenta, the concentration of placental hormones drops very rapidly. Massive hormone withdrawal is the result. Evolutional aspects of placentophagy The ingestion of the afterbirth, consisting of the placenta, amnionand amniotic fluid, immediately after parturition is a behaviourubiquitous in mammals [6]. This applies equally to herbivoresand carnivores as well as nidifugous and nidicolous birds. More than 4000 species of mammals consume their placenta; only in humans and camelids has it been noted that the afterbirthis not routinely ingested [7]. Placentophagia relates to afterbirthconsumptions by animals, placentophagy refers to the humanpractice [1]. Two hypotheses attempt to explain the behaviour behind placentophagia: keeping the nest clean and predator avoidance.These theories are contestable, however [8]. For example, mam- mals such as tree squirrels that give birth in trees also consume their placenta rather than discarding it from the nest on thegrounds of cleanliness. In various cloven-hoofed animals of the horse family, placentophagia does not significantly alter the mor-tality rate in the offspring. It is therefore assumed thatplacentophagia has no influence on the avoidance of predators [8]. The discussion of whether there is an evolutionary biological explanation for placentophagy in humans is inconclusive [7, 8].Placentophagy is widespread among apes and non-human pri-mates. This suggests that placentophagy in humans is a traditionthat was lost with evolution [7]. There are diverse reports of tradi-tional cultures and different ethnicities who consumed placentaraw, cooked, or dried and pulverised [9]. Since the 1970s a trend has been observed, starting in the USA, with respect to processing and consuming one s own placenta [10]. The desire for a natural lifestyle and an individual, self-determined approach to childbirth,associated with an interest in placenta-based remedies, has beendescribed [11]. As eating one s own placenta is considered a social taboo, placentophagy is frequently practiced unofficially and sel-dom communicated. Whereas ingestion of the placenta in the animal world is cer- tainly of nutritional benefit, it can be assumed that women in in- dustrialized nations who have just given birth have access to a var-ied, healthy diet. Given its composition, therefore, dried placentacan be regarded as a nutritional supplement. Effects of placentophagia in the animal kingdom In mice, ingestion of the placenta resulted in increased serum pro-lactin and decreased serum progesterone levels compared to the non-placenta group [12].Table 1 Overview of selected publications on placentophagia and their results.

There is no evidence that the neonate is at increased risk from maternal placentophagy. 846 -852GebFra Science | Review Similarly, there have been reports of lactation being triggered in mammals acting as wet nurses following the ingestion ofplacenta [13]. The existence of a factor that influences pain processing after placenta ingestion was investigated in the rat model [14]. Opioid-mediated was potentiated by a placental In addition, the onset of so-called maternal be-haviour towards the offspring was accelerated in the animals of the placentophagia group [14]. Effects of placentophagy in humans A historical study from 1918 describes the influence of desiccated placenta on lactation: increased amounts of protein and lactosewere thereby measured in the breast milk [46]. Weight gain wasalso more rapid in the babies breast-fed exclusively by the moth-ers in the placenta ingestion group [15]. Further benefits reported from the ingestion of placenta cap- sules are a stable mood post partum, faster convalescence follow-ing parturition, increased milk production, and feel-ing of having \"more energy \"post partum [2]. double-blind studies[17-19] and historical publications [15, 20] related primarily to the content of trace elements and hormones in placental prepara-tions offer indications for clinical assessment. In the USA, almost a third of all mothers from community birth ingest the placenta either raw or dried: in more than 70% of cases,prevention of postpartum depression is given as the reason [21]. Composition of the placenta A single placenta weighing 450 g contains an average of 234 calo-ries, 4 g of fat, 899 mg of cholesterol, 513 g of sodium, 48 g ofprotein, plus significant quantities of the trace elements iron and selenium [22] along with calcium, copper, magnesium, phospho- rus, potassium and zinc [23]. Furthermore, it contains the essen-tial and non-essential vitamins B 1,B2,B5,B6,B7,B9,B12.C y - tokines and growth factors (e.g. G CSF, GM CSF) are likewise found in the placenta, facilitating intracellular endocrine and para-crine signalling and thus regulating the growth, proliferation, mi- gration and differentiation of cells [24]. The placenta as a therapeutic agent In traditional Chinese medicine, dehydrated placenta powder is used to stimulate lactation as well as treat fertility disordersamong a host of other ailments [25]. In Argentina, native ethnicgroups use the powder of the dried umbilical cord to treat sickchildren; the indigenous Kol people of central India use the placenta as a remedy for improving reproductive function [9]. Aside from taking placenta extracts orally, they can also be in- jected -offering an anti-inflammatory effect, for instance, in polyarthritis a regenerative and growth-promoting effecton nerve lesions [27]. The use of placental or amniotic preparations has likewise been described in ophthalmology, for burns and wound-healing disor-ders [24].Trace elements Dehydrated placenta powder contains the essential trace ele-ments iron (mean value 565.0 mg/kg) and selenium (mean value850.0 [28]. The intake of placenta capsules does not adequately double-blind clinical studyit no significant change in the maternal iron status[19]. Very low concentrations of the potentially toxic elements such as arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury were found and were below the toxicity threshold [23,28]. Hormones Placental tissue contains various hormones, including oxytocin,estrogens, progesterone, human placental lactogen, ACTH andCRH. These hormones were detected both in raw placenta and inthe dehydrated powder [28, 29]. The hormone concentrations are drastically reduced by steam- ing and dehydration, however [28]. Distinct effects on maternal bonding, fatigue and mood post partum were not demonstrated in one randomised, placebo-con-trolled, double-blind clinical pilot study (n = 27) after steamed anddehydrated placental tissue was consumed [18]. The intake ofplacenta capsules in this study led to a minor yet significantchange in the maternal hormonal status [17]. Microorganisms Though it was long assumed that the placenta remains sterile inthe womb, recent studies demonstrate a similarity between themicrobiological composition of the oral cavity and the placenta.The latter has its own microbiome of [30]. It is assumed that during pregnancy bacteria from the maternal gastrointestinal tract pass through the placenta to the fetus [31]. A single case published by the American Center for Disease Control describes a late-onset infection in a neonate from groupB streptococci (GBS) [32]. The mother had consumed her ownplacenta post partum in the form of capsules. Group B streptococ-ci were identified both in the dried placental tissue and the bloodof the newborn infant, but not in the breast milk. In case of mater- nal, oral ingestion it is assumed that the stomach functions as a barrier against bacteria, including streptococci. The maternal in-take of placenta as a route for infection is therefore debatable.Prenatal transmission of bacteria, colonization of the maternalgastrointestinal tract with GBS, and transmission due to closepostpartum contact between mother and child, can more likelybe assumed in this case. As placental tissue is not sterile, contamination from poten- tially pathogenic microorganisms cannot be ruled out. Dehydrat- ing the tissue at over 54 degrees Celsius leads to a significantly re-duced number of microbiological species and eliminates Candidaalbicans [28]. In legal terms, who owns the placenta? Whereas separating the maternal and fetal tissue of the placentais not possible macroscopically, it can be done in legal terms: the maternal part of the placenta belongs to the mother and must 849Johnson SK Placenta -Worth ...Geburtsh Frauenheilk 2018; 78: 846 -852 therefore be handed over to her by the maternity unit if re- quested. According to prevailing legal opinion in Germany, a sep-arated body part remains the property of the person from whomit has been taken. Along these lines, the fetal part of the placentathus belongs to the newborn baby (as does the umbilical cord)given that it is attributable to the infant s body. Mother and father may determine what happens to it, in the interest of the child, andtherefore also demand that it be released by the hospital [33]. Production of placenta capsules The processing of a placenta to powder is described in traditionalEuropean and Asian pharmaceutical compendia [25, 34]. Organi-zations that have specialized in producing capsules from placenta(placenta encapsulation) employ standardized protocols in whichhygiene measures and processing steps are specified [35]. Pro-cessing usually takes place in a clean kitchen under semi-sterile conditions. The placenta is processed within a few hours after parturition. Firstly, it is cleaned under cold running water and removed ofblood and blood clots. The organ is then cut with scissors intoslices 0.5 cm thick; during this process, the fetal membranes andumbilical cord are often removed. The slices are then dried in adehydrator for eight hours at 54 degrees Celsius [28]. Thereafter,the dehydrated slices are minced in a food processor to produce a powder that is filled into gelatin capsules (filled volume approxi- mately 500 mg). Reports describe that two capsules are takenthree times a day during the first 14 days post partum, corre-sponding to approximately 3000 mg placenta powder daily. Discussion The content of various hormones in the placental tissue has been demonstrated both before and after production of the powder [28,29]. Based on knowledge so far, it must be assumed that pro-teolysis takes place in the gastrointestinal tract. This has an influ-ence on the structure of the protein hormones and, in turn, theiravailability [36]. If absorbed through oral mucosa, an effect fromthe hormones can be hypothezised due to bypassing the first-passeffect of the liver [37]. This may be the case for oxytocin, a rela-tively small protein hormone (length of 9 amino acids) that can be applied in obstetrics through the mucosa and exhibits a rapid central effect (for example, nasal \"Syntocin \"for lactation disor- sedative effects, human help and be effective incase of insufficient lactation [39]. The theories concerning thehormonal activity of placenta preparations have not yet been ad-equately explored by clinical studies, however. The hormone concentrations measured in the individual placentas vary considerably. Hence, no statement can be madewith respect to the individual composition of the constituentsand content of active substances [28]. Factors that could influ-ence the individual hormone concentrations are the duration ofpregnancy and the associated endocrine activity of the placenta,mode of delivery, stress, interventions, and use of medication.What are the potential risks of placentophagy? A viral or bacterial infection in the mother and/or neonate is a con-traindication to placenta ingestion [28]. Likewise, the placentashould not be consumed following a general anaesthetic as itmay have absorbed opioids and other anaesthetic agents. Smoking during pregnancy increases the concentration of cad- mium in the placental tissue [40] and thus also poses a risk in caseof ingestion. The intake of placenta preparations in the presence of mastitis and/or blocked ducts is likewise contraindicated due to the stim-ulating effect on milk production [25]. An analysis of medical data from women giving birth outside of hospital in the USA (n = 23 242) revealed that placentophagy wasnot associated with adverse effects in the neonate; admissions tohospital or neonatal critical care and deaths were considered inthis analysis [21]. The risk associated with ingesting one s own placenta follow- ing a spontaneous, non-interventional delivery without long-termpharmacological treatment during pregnancy is relatively low[28]. What is the possible benefit of placentophagia? Depressive disorders are the most common postpartum psychiat-ric manifestation, though this is not to be mistaken for the \"baby blues \"of postpartum depression (PPD) [41]. The latter is not only a peripartal health risk to the mother but will also lead to dimin-ished health in the child [42]. The acute withdrawal of the signifi-cantly increased am ounts of circulating (neuro)hormones around the time of parturition and the sudden cessation of hormone syn-thesis by the placenta is suggested as a cause for the emotionalimbalance [43]. To counteract the fluctuations in the reproductivehormones, allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite, is sub- stituted as a therapeutic approach to postpartum depression [44]. As small quantities of progesterone are detectable in both raw and dried placenta, ingestion could likewise exert an effect on themental health of the mother. Hence, the indication for puerperalapplication of one s own placenta as a hormonal substitute may be derived in the case of prior postpartum depression or pro-nounced premenstrual syndrome with marked mood swings. It is debatable, however, whether the hormones become bio- logically available after intake as steroid hormones are poorly ab- sorbed when taken orally. Concentrations of 18.76 \u00b5g/g of pro-gesterone-active substances have been measured in driedplacenta [28]. The dose of 1 g placenta powder three times dailyrecommended by birth attendants (doulas, midwives) [19] con-tains an average of 56.3 \u00b5g of progesterone-active substance. A much higher concentration of human placetal lactogen (hPL) is found in raw placenta, namely a mean value of 17.58 mg/g [28]. A stimulatory effect on milk production and early onset of primary lactogenesis has been reported [45]. Even if the described effects of placenta ingestion were attrib- utable to a placebo effect [2], mother and child could in certaincases benefit from improved well-being and better health whilebeing exposed to a low individual risk [10]. -852GebFra Science | Review Summary Placental tissue is a source of natural hormones, trace elements and essential amino acids -the ingestion of raw or dehydrated placenta could influence postpartum convalescence, lactation,mood and recovery. The risk of intoxication from individual intake appears to be low in terms of microbiological contamination and the content of po- tentially toxic trace elements. However, the mother should be ad-vised that the processing and use of the placenta is her responsi-bility and that the transmission of infections cannot be ruled out. Further studies focusing on the bioavailability of the hormones after oral ingestion and their potential physiological effect arenecessary to evaluate the use of placental preparations. Patientswith an interest in placentophagy should be informed about the potential risks and effects. Conflict of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.
