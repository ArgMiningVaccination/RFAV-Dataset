(March 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .11(March 24, 2021 / 11:15:41) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .12- 1 - Article 1 - PURPOSE 1.01 The general purpose of this Agreement is to establish mutually satisfactory relations between the City and its employees; and to provide for the prompt and equitable disposition of grievances, and to establish and maintain safe, satisfactory working conditions, hours of work and wages for all employees who are subject to the provisions of the Agreement. Article 2 - RECOGNITION 2.01 The City recognizes the Union as the sole bargaining agent for all employees of the City of Toronto who occupy the positions set forth in Schedule \"A\", including positions as determined by the OLRB decision dated the 16th of November 1998. 2.02 (a) In this Agreement the word \"employee\" means a person hired by the City for either Permanent or Temporary employment in a position which comes within the bargaining unit described in clause 2.01. 2.02 (b) A temporary employee is one who is employed for any of the following reasons: (i) Seasonal work: to work on a seasonal basis to meet seasonal needs; Prior to hiring new temporary employees to perform seasonal work, the provisions of clause 23.01(a)(i) (Superior Duties) or Article 28 (Layoff and Recall) shall apply. If work continues to be available after these provisions are fulfilled, the position(s) will be posted on a bargaining unit wide basis. The City shall have the ability to advertise externally in conjunction with the internal posting process with the understanding that qualified Local 416 internal applicant(s) shall have first claim to the work. (ii) Non-seasonal work: to replace an employee who is absent for any reason; to work on a special project or undertaking; to meet unexpected workload demands of a temporary nature. Prior to hiring new temporary employees to perform non-seasonal work, the provisions of clause 23.01 (a)(i) (Superior Duties) or Article 28 (Layoff and Recall) shall apply. If, after applying the provisions of clause 23.01, no employee is available to perform the work, and the available work is anticipated to last for more than one (1) month in duration, the recall provisions of Article 28 (Layoff and Recall) shall apply. If work continues to be available after these provisions are fulfilled, the position(s) will be posted on a bargaining unit wide basis. The City shall have the ability to advertise externally in conjunction with the internal posting process with the understanding that qualified Local 416 internal applicant(s) shall have first claim to the work. While in effect, prior to hiring a new temporary employee, the Letter of Agreement - Temporary Work Opportunities/Assignments shall apply. (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:41) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .13- 2 - LETTER OF AGREEMENT The Letter of Agreement - Temporary Work Opportunities/Assignments shall apply for the filling of seasonal and identified non-seasonal work under the terms of that Letter. The applicable provisions of clause 2.02 (b)(i) and clause 2.02 (b)(ii) shall apply to temporary opportunities/assignments that are not filled in accordance with the Letter of Agreement - Temporary Work Opportunities/Assignments. When this Letter of Agreement is in effect, and temporary opportunities/assignments continue to be available after the provisions of clause 2.02(b) (Article 23 and Article 28) are fulfilled, and the temporary opportunity/assignment is expected to last twenty-five (25) weeks or more, then the Letter of Agreement - Interim Alternate Processes for Article 19 (Part C) shall apply to the temporary posting. 2.02 (c) \"Permanent employees\" are employees who have satisfactorily completed the probationary period under Article 5 and occupy a job classification set out in Schedule \"A\". 2.03 Whenever the City establishes a new non-union position, the Director of Employee and Labour Relations will provide the Union with thirty (30) calendar days written notice prior to the implementation of said position. In the event that the Union is of the opinion that the position may come within the 416 Unit, the Union shall so notify the Director of Employee and Labour Relations within five (5) calendar days of the Union's receipt of the notice from the City. If requested, the City shall meet with the Union forthwith for the purpose of discussing the matter. The question as to the position's inclusion in or exclusion from the 416 Unit shall be determined by mutual agreement or, in the absence of an agreement, the Union may file a grievance under Article 21. Such grievance shall be initiated at Step 3 of the grievance procedure. 2.04 The Union and the employees recognize and acknowledge that it is the exclusive function of the City to: (a) maintain order, discipline and efficiency; (b) hire, discharge, layoff, direct, classify, transfer, re-assign, schedule hours of work, promote, demote and suspend or otherwise discipline any employee provided that a claim that any such employee has been discharged or disciplined without reasonable cause, may be the subject of a grievance and dealt with as hereinafter provided; and (c) generally to manage the operation and undertakings of the City and without restricting the generality of the foregoing to select, install and require the operation of any equipment, plant and machinery which the City in its discretion deems necessary for the efficient and economical carrying out of the operations and undertakings of the City. 2.05 The City agrees that it will act in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and will not act in an arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable manner. 2.06 Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, no employee shall be required or permitted to make written or verbal agreements with the employer which would conflict with the Collective Agreement. (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:41) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .14- 3 - Volunteers 2.07 Nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed to prohibit the City from using volunteers provided such volunteers do not perform bargaining unit work and shall not displace any bargaining unit employee. LETTER OF AGREEMENT ANNUAL REVIEW OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES (1) The parties agree that there will be an annual review, as described below. (2) The City and the Union will undertake a review for the purposes of determining if any temporary employee has been continuously employed for longer than one (1) year as of May 14th of each year. To be clear, the review will be backward looking and will be for the purposes of identifying those temporary employees who have been continuously employed from May 15th, through May 14th inclusive each year. Such a review will commence annually on May 14th. (3) The following criteria must be met for the position in question to be posted and will be used in the above-noted review: (i) No permanent employee has a claim to the position in question; (ii) The applicable Division intends to continue to fill the position; (iii) The position will not be eliminated in the near future; (iv) The position is not \"seasonal\" in nature; and (v) The position is not being utilized for a \"special project\" or \"undertaking\". (4) If all of the above noted criteria, as outlined in point (3) are met, then the position in question will be posted as a permanent position pursuant to the Collective Agreement. (5) The Union reserves its right to file a grievance and arbitrate any allegation that the City has failed to follow this process.

If there are still not sufficient numbers of employees who accept the overtime, the City will assign the overtime in reverse order of seniority to those employees who normally perform the work and have signed the overtime list in the work location. If there are still insufficient numbers of employees to work the overtime, the City will assign the overtime to those employees who normally perform the work within the work location.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT RE: STUDENT SUMMER EMPLOYMENT This Letter of Agreement shall replace all provisions of the Collective Agreement related to summer employment for Students, for the term of the Collective Agreement effective July 31, 2009. The parties are interested in providing summer employment for students who are registered full-time at a recognized and accredited educational institution (\"Students\"). The parties recognize that students have special circumstances owing to their attendance at school that will be considered, while balancing the needs of the diverse operations within the City. The parties agree that in addition to the Temporary Work Selection process (\"Work Selection\"), a process specific to the provision of student summer employment will be implemented. The provision of such summer employment shall be limited to the Labourer 3/Student classification as outlined below. The parties agree as follows: 1. Students will be contacted each year at the same time as all other temporary employees are contacted with regard to their participation in Work Selection. Students will be advised that they have the option to participate in Work Selection, or if the student provides the documentation identified in paragraph 3 below, he/she will be placed on the list of students available for recall (\"Student Recall List\") and will be eligible to participate in that process. Work Selection 2. If a Student elects Work Selection, he/she shall be subject to all the terms and conditions of the Work Selection process for that season. For clarification, Students that provide the documentation identified in paragraph 3 below will not, prior to their selection in the following year's Work Selection, be offered recall to temporary work opportunities after the completion of their spring/summer work opportunity unless he/she confirms he/she is no longer registered full-time at a recognized and accredited educational institution. (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:44) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .97- 86 - Student Recall Process 3. In circumstances where a Student is unable or unwilling to participate in Work Selection, he/she will be placed on the Student Recall List. The list will be compiled by the City each year for the upcoming summer. In order to be placed on the Student Recall List, a Student shall provide written proof to the City, by March 15th of each year, of his/her current full time registration at a recognized and accredited educational institution. In addition, the Student shall also provide written notification of the first date of his/her availability for recall and the approximate last date of his/her availability for summer employment, as well as contact information where he/she can be reached. It is the Student's responsibility to immediately provide any updates to his/ her: contact information, first available start date and last available end date. 4. The City will determine if there is summer employment available in the Labourer 3/Student classification. The number of student recall opportunities will not be more than fifty (50) in any given year. Such summer work may commence no earlier than May 1st and end no later than August 31st, and will reflect the duties of the Labourer 3/Student Job Profile. In the event there is such employment identified by the City, it will be offered in seniority order to Students who have provided the documentation as required in paragraph 3 above, and are on the Student Recall List, provided such employment is consistent with the Student's stated available date(s). Should a Student be unavailable for recall when work becomes available, due to his/her full-time attendance at a recognized and accredited institution, he/she may, when available, use his/her aggregate hours or seniority, as applicable, to displace the most junior Labourer 3/Student in the workplace. 5. Should a Student no longer be registered full-time in a recognized and accredited educational institution, he/she shall immediately notify the City, in writing, of his/her change of status and, henceforth, he/she shall no longer be eligible for Student Recall and shall only be eligible to participate in Work Selection as a temporary employee. He/she shall be subject to all of the rights, obligations and conditions of employment pursuant to the Collective Agreement. 6. A temporary employee who enrols full-time in a recognized and accredited educational institution, and who provides the documentation identified in paragraph 3 above, will be eligible to participate in the Student Recall process. 7. In the event that a Student cannot be reached or does not respond to a recall, the City will not be required to offer the student any further recall opportunities for that year. Subject to 27.06, he/she shall remain on the seniority list. 8. In the event that a Student does not provide all the documentation noted in paragraph 3 above, he/she will not be eligible for recall pursuant to the Student Recall process, but he/she shall, subject to 27.06, remain on the seniority list as a temporary employee. 9. It is understood that the terms of this Letter of Agreement do not diminish any Collective Agreement rights other than those provisions that may be affected by this Letter of Agreement. 10. The parties recognize the need for the expeditious resolution of disputes that may arise under this Letter of Agreement. In this regard, both parties will make every effort to resolve any dispute arising from the interpretation (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:44) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .98- 87 - or implementation of this Letter of Agreement as quickly as possible. Should a resolution not be reached, the Union or the City may process the matter directly to mediation or arbitration in accordance with the terms of the Collective Agreement and both parties will make every effort to expedite the arbitration process. LETTER OF AGREEMENT PERMANENT WORK OPPORTUNITIES OF 10 MONTHS OR MORE WITHIN PARKS, FORESTRY & RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES - 10 MONTHS OR MORE JOBS 1. The positions identified below provide employees with opportunities for permanent work lasting approximately ten (10) months or more. 2. In the event that an opportunity combines different classifications, the applicable rate of pay for each classification will apply to work performed in each classification. SHUTDOWN PERIOD(S): 3. Periods of shutdown, based on the requirements of the operations, will be confirmed, as soon as practicable after it is known by the City but in no case will the number of weeks of work be less than forty-two (42) weeks. The City will endeavour to find alternative work for an employee during the aforementioned shutdown period. In the event that no work is identified, vacation, lieu time or authorized leaves of absence will be used by employees to bridge such periods of shutdown between work opportunities and there shall be no loss of service or seniority during such periods of leave. In addition, employees in the 10-Month or more jobs will be eligible for the benefits outlined in Article 16. 4. Options for pension contributions will be provided to employees in a no pay status during shutdown periods. VACATION AND ABSENCES: 5. An employee must use vacation, lieu time, leave without pay, etc., to bridge the periods of time when no work is available. During the shutdown periods, where an employee has insufficient vacation or lieu time, he/she shall be deemed to be on an approved leave of absence without pay. If an employee becomes ill or injured during the shutdown period, he/she will commence illness or injury leave on the day he/she would otherwise have returned to work after the shutdown period. 6. An employee will receive vacation pay for vacation, sick leave, paid holidays, etc., at the rate applicable to his/her base classification on the day prior to the absence, unless he/she is eligible to receive a higher or lower rate of pay in accordance with clause 23.03. 7. In circumstances where an employee's periods of available work are such that he/she has more vacation available than the period of time between work opportunities, such excess vacation will be scheduled in accordance with Article 13.

The full net pay of an employee shall be determined by deducting from the employee's gross earnings the probable Income Tax, Canada Pension Plan premiums, and Employment Insurance premiums. 30.03 (b) If the employee's claim is denied and the employee has otherwise qualified for Sick Pay, (in accordance with Article 14A (Sick Pay Plan) or Article 14B (Illness or Injury Plan)), the denial of the claim shall not act as a bar to the employee claiming benefits in accordance with the provisions of Article 14A or Article 14B. 30.04 Where the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board approves the claim, and for as long as the employee is receiving a full loss of earnings benefit in accordance with section 43 of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, the employee shall continue to receive the full net pay amount as defined in (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:44) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .101- 90 - clause 30.03. Such full net pay shall include benefit payments approved by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. 30.05 If the employee is unable to return to work after a claim is approved, he/she shall receive: (a) the benefit payments approved by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board directly from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board; (b) for those who qualify for Sick Pay, (in accordance with Article 14A (Sick Pay Plan) or Article 14B (Illness or Injury Plan)), receive the remainder of the net pay amount from the City. From the portion the employee is receiving from the City the following deductions shall be made: (i) the employee's pension contribution; (ii) if applicable, the employee's Optional Life Insurance premiums; (iii) and any further deductions required by law. If an employee continues on WSIB after the first day of the fifth month following the date of disability, the employee shall select one of the following Pension options: Option A - Continue enrolment in OMERS as if the employee was at work and make the necessary Pension contributions from the remaining amount paid to the employee by the City. (NOTE: This will leave a net balance approximately equal to an employee's normal take home pay, and the employee's pension will be the same as if the employee had been actively at work throughout the period.) Option B - Select the OMERS disability waiver of contributions and therefore the City and the employee shall not make OMERS contributions on the employee's behalf. (NOTE: this may increase the employee's take home pay. However, for pension calculation purposes, the deemed waiver earnings and the year's maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE) are indexed like the OMERS pensions. The annual increases to the deemed earnings may not match the negotiated increases received.) No deductions will be made from the sick bank or from the Illness or Injury Plan hours, as applicable, of an employee who received payments under clauses 30.03 (a) and 30.05. 30.06 An employee in receipt of a loss of earnings benefit in accordance with section 43 of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act who is not on layoff shall be considered to be an employee on the active payroll and; (a) Continue to accrue seniority, service, vacation and sick pay credits; and (b) Continue to be entitled to benefit coverage which shall be maintained by the City in the same manner as though the employee was at work; and (c) The foregoing shall have no effect on any permanent partial disability pension, which an employee may be receiving. 30.07 Where the claim is not approved the City shall provide the employee with a copy of the denial letter from WSIB. Where an employee receives monies in excess of his/her appropriate net pay amount, such excess shall be treated as an overpayment and the City shall make recovery from the employee's wages. (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:44) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .102- 91 - The employee may, within five (5) working days of notification of the overpayment, request to have the overpayment recovered from his/her: (a) Wages; and/or (b) Vacation bank, subject to Division approval; and/or (c) Accumulated lieu time; and/or (d) Sick bank or IIP, provided that the employee would have been qualified to use his/her sick bank/IIP as per Articles 14A and 14B of the Collective Agreement and the absences are substantiated and is subject to Division approval. Such request and/or Divisional approval shall not be unreasonably denied. This does not preclude the employee from making a full or partial payment. If approval is granted to deduct the overpayment from the employee's vacation bank, accumulated lieu time, and/or sick bank/IIP, and if the amount of overpayment is greater than the vacation bank, accumulated lieu time, and/or sick bank/IIP, or if no request is made within five (5) working days or approval is not granted, the City shall recover the excess from the employee's wages. In the event that the employee elects to repay the City through a deduction from wages, clause 7.06 of the Collective Agreement will apply. The affected employee must provide the City with any recovery consents required by law. In the event that the employee disagrees with the recovery of any wages, the City may utilise the process outlined in the LETTER OF AGREEMENT - INTERIM ALTERNATE PROCESSES FOR CLAUSE 7.06. 30.08 Employees who have not qualified for Sick Pay, (in accordance with Article 14A (Sick Pay Plan) or Article 14B (Illness or Injury Plan)), shall, if their Workplace Safety and Insurance Board claim is approved, receive their benefit payments from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. 30.09 An employee, who sustains a compensable injury and, as a result, must leave work before the end of his/her shift, on the day the injury occurred shall be paid to the end of the shift. 30.10 Where an employee sustains a workplace injury, the employee is entitled to make the initial choice of health professional for the purpose of obtaining necessary and appropriate health care. Notwithstanding this entitlement, the parties recognize that the injury may require immediate health care from the first available health professional. 30.11 Where an employee is requested to meet with a representative of the City with respect to an illness or injury, the employee shall be advised they may be accompanied by a representative of the Union. LETTER OF AGREEMENT 'GRANDPARENTING' OMERS DISABILITY PREMIUM WAIVER The City and Local 416 agree that, notwithstanding language changes in the Collective Agreement effective January 1, 2005, the following terms shall apply to those employees who have been or are currently in receipt of an OMERS disability waiver of premium benefit as of July 20, 2005: (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:44) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .103- 92 - 1. When an employee retires, if the employee was in receipt of Workplace Safety and Insurance Benefits and a disability waiver of premium benefit at any time during the employee's employment with the City and if the effect of that disability waiver of premium benefit is to reduce the employee's pension entitlement, the City will provide the difference between the employee's pension and the pension to which the employee would have been entitled had the employee not been on said disability waiver of premium benefit; 2. If the employee is unable to return to work after a claim is approved, he/she shall receive the benefit payments approved by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board directly from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board and for those who qualify for Sick Pay, (in accordance with Article 14A (Sick Pay Plan) or Article 14B (Illness or Injury Plan)), receive the remainder of the net pay amount from the City.

No deductions will be made from the IIP hours/sick pay or capped sick pay credits of an employee who received payments under clauses 30.03 (a) and 30.05 (Note: This will leave a net balance approximately equal to an employee's normal take home pay.) LETTER OF AGREEMENT THIRD PARTY ASSESSMENT FACILITIES The City agrees to establish a Joint Committee, comprising of three (3) representatives from the City and three (3) representatives from the Union, to discuss and develop protocols for the referral of employees to third party medical/ functional assessments by the employer.

The policy applies to all City divisions with employees who are members of the Local 416 bargaining unit. It is agreed that the City of Toronto will provide employees with personal protective equipment (PPE) as prescribed by the hazards of the job or workplace. In addition, the City will provide protective work clothing and other wearing apparel where required by job demands and as outlined in this policy. It is agreed that employees who are issued PPE and/or protective work clothing will use and/or wear this PPE and/or protective work clothing at all times when it is needed for their protection or by regulation. They are responsible for complying with the division's PPE and protective clothing requirements, properly maintaining PPE and reporting any defective PPE. Notwithstanding the provisions outlined in this policy, the Union and the City reserve the right to address any additional PPE, protective clothing or wearing apparel issues that may arise during the term of the Collective Agreement. 32.03 (a) Personal Protective Equipment and Protective Clothing Definitions Personal protective equipment (PPE) is defined as equipment or devices worn or used to control exposure to hazardous substances or conditions or to prevent accidental injuries or serious harm to employees working in hazardous or potentially hazardous conditions or areas. PPE includes, but is not limited to head protection, hearing protection, eye and face protection, body protection, hand protection, foot protection, respiratory protection and fall protection. Protective work clothing is attire worn over or in place of regular clothing to protect the employee from hazards. Protective work clothing may include, but not be limited to coveralls, overalls, aprons, laboratory coats, rainwear, high-visibility clothing and, in some cases, shirts and pants, where such clothing is either high-visibility, ballistic and/or fire-retardant.

PPE and protective clothing will be in conformance with legislated requirements and the most recent version of the applicable industry standards, e.g. CSA, ANSI. It is understood that protective devices of a non-personal nature are needed for the performance of certain tasks (e.g., Animal Services' snare sticks, Toronto Water gas monitors, Parks Forestry and Recreation floatation devices). Such equipment can be shared, provided that it is readily available for use, when required, and employees are adequately trained in its use and limitations. Seasonal employees will be provided with PPE and protective clothing, as required by the nature of the work to be performed and appropriate to the season to be worked. Prescription safety eyewear from vendors located off City worksites will be acquired on the employee's own time. The City agrees to maintain the existing or equivalent boot truck service at City worksites, with employees having the same procurement rights as now exist. Where, because of special size or fitting requirements, or lack of boot truck service, employees cannot obtain safety boots from a boot truck, they shall be given a maximum of one hour of City paid time to purchase safety boots from City-contracted vendor's stores. Responsibilities Divisions will: in consultation with joint health and safety committees (JHSC), introduce, to the extent feasible, engineering and/or administrative hazard control measures to minimize the need for PPE. Such control measures may include: - eliminating the hazard from the workplace - substituting or replacing a hazard or hazardous work practice with a less hazardous one - isolating/separating the hazard or hazardous work practice from workers, or - modifying tools or equipment, providing guarding, barriers or ventilation in consultation with joint health and safety committees, determine the need for PPE and protective clothing based on job hazards, and provide such equipment and/or clothing to employees ensure consistent practices are applied across their divisions when purchasing protective clothing, consider actual and potential hazards of the job, including traffic, electricity, cold, heat, fire, UV radiation, biological hazards and the West Nile Virus.

It is agreed that, if selected, they will only be issued when hard hats are next needed. Hearing protection Appropriate hearing protection will be provided to all employees whose daily noise exposure exceeds an eight hour time-weighted average of 85 dB(A) and employees will be required to use provided hearing protective devices.

Effective at 12:01 am on the day following the date of ratification by the City of Toronto of the amendments to the old collective agreement, the City of Toronto and the Toronto Civic Employees' Union, Local 416 (CUPE) agree that a new separate schedule applying solely to all full-time and part-time paramedic employees of the City of Toronto (Schedule P), shall come into effect. Developing Schedule P 2. For the purposes of this Memorandum and Schedule P to the collective agreement, \"full-time\" shall mean those paramedics who work an average of 40 hours per week; and \"part-time\" shall mean those paramedics who are regularly employed for such hours as are agreed to by the parties or determined by the mediation-arbitration process, as set out paragraphs 6 through 12 of this Memorandum. Schedule P to the collective agreement shall consist of all of the provisions of the new collective agreement in its totality. This Memorandum of Agreement shall not form part of the collective agreement except where expressly stated herein. 3. Within six weeks of the creation of Schedule P, the parties shall meet to discuss in good faith whether to eliminate any provision(s) in Schedule P on the basis that they have no application to full-time paramedics. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon the articles which do not apply (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:46) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .175- 164 - to full-time paramedics, the contents of Schedule P applicable to full-time paramedics shall be as described in paragraph 2 above, as amended by this process. Either party may raise any outstanding issues in the next round of negotiations at the expiry of the new collective agreement on December 31, 2015. Terms and Conditions for Part-time Paramedics 4. The parties have agreed to establish a part-time paramedic classification within the bargaining unit. No employee shall be hired into the classification of part-time paramedic until the terms and conditions of their employment have been determined as set out herein. 5. Following ratification of the new collective agreement, each party shall identify those provisions which they wish to address concerning the terms and conditions of employment for part-time paramedics which are to be included in Schedule P. The parties shall meet and negotiate an agreement in good faith. 6. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon the terms and conditions for the part-time paramedics by August 1, 2012, either party may refer the outstanding matter(s) to a mediation-arbitration for a final and binding determination. The Board will be composed of a single arbitrator 7. The parties shall appoint Larry Steinberg. In the event that he is unable to conclude this matter within the time frame set out below, William Kaplan will be asked to serve as arbitrator. The parties agree to share the costs of arbitrator. 8. The parties will co-operate to ensure that the hearing before the Board will be held as soon as possible. To this end, the parties will ask the Chair, immediately upon appointment, to schedule at least four (4) days for hearing over the months of September 2012 to November 2012, inclusive. 9. The powers of the Board of Arbitration and all other matters in relation to the arbitration shall be as set out in 20 to 22 of the Ambulance Services Collective Bargaining Act, 2001, amended by this agreement to accommodate the mediation-arbitration process, save that all references to a \"collective agreement\" shall be deemed to be reference to the terms and conditions for part-time -time paramedics to be included in Schedule P. Those provisions will be deemed to form part of this agreement. 10. Any resolved matters will be agreed upon in writing and signed by the designated representatives of the parties. No such matters shall be referred to the Board of Arbitration for determination. Positions taken by either party during negotiations that are not the subject of such a written agreement shall not be in any way whatsoever disclosed to or used by any Board of Arbitration appointed to resolve such dispute. The decision of the Board will be delivered to the parties as expeditiously as possible following the conclusion of the hearings. The decision of the Board shall incorporate any resolved matters previously agreed upon in writing and signed by the designated representatives of the parties and shall, together with any matters determined by the board, thereafter, form part of Schedule P. (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:46) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .176- 165 - Collective Agreement Provisions 11. The parties agree that the ratio of part-time paramedics to full-time paramedics in the bargaining unit shall not exceed one (1) part-time paramedic for every five (5) full-time paramedics. 12. The parties agree that, at the expiry of the new collective agreement on December 31, 2015 and each subsequent collective agreement (which, for greater clarity, includes Schedule P) any outstanding issues relating to the terms and conditions of full-time and part-time paramedics under Schedule P that are not resolved through collective bargaining shall, following the earlier of the ratification of the terms and conditions of employment for non- paramedics or following the issuance of any future No Board Report, or at such other time as the parties may agree, be settled through mandatory tripartite interest mediation-arbitration conducted in accordance with the procedures settled through mandatory tripartite interest mediation-arbitration conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 20(2) to 22 of the Ambulance Services Collective Bargaining Act, 2001, as amended, save that all references to a \"collective agreement\" shall be deemed to be reference to the terms and conditions for paramedics to be included in Schedule P, and with any necessary modifications as appropriate for a three person interest mediation-arbitration board. The parties agree, however, that the duration of the application of Schedule P shall be the term of the collective agreement negotiated between the parties and shall not be a matter referred by either party to mediation-arbitration. 13. The parties agree that they will not seek any alterations to the dispute resolution mechanism set out herein during negotiations for the renewal of each subsequent Collective Agreement. The parties further agree that they will jointly ask the Board of Arbitration to include the dispute resolution mechanism, as set out in paragraphs 12 to 17 of this Memorandum, in its Award. 14. The Board will be composed of one person nominated by each of the parties and a Chair. The parties agree to share the costs of the Chair. The interest arbitration procedure shall utilize a three person board of arbitration. The powers of the Board of Arbitration and all other matters in relation to the arbitration shall be as set out in 20(2) to 22 of the Ambulance Services Collective Bargaining Act, 2001, as amended as appropriate for a three person interest arbitration board. Those provisions will be deemed to form part of this agreement, save that all references to a \"collective agreement\" shall be deemed to be reference to the terms and conditions for paramedics to be included in Schedule P, and subject to any necessary modifications as appropriate for a three person interest mediation-arbitration board. 15. Both parties will name their nominees to the Board of Arbitration within ten (10) calendar days of the referral, or such later date as the parties may agree in writing. The nominees will agree on a chair of the Board of Arbitration within an additional ten (10) calendar days, failing which either party may ask that the Office of Arbitration appoint the chair. The parties will co operate to ensure that the hearing before the Arbitrator will be held as soon as possible following ratification of the collective agreement. For greater certainty, the parties agree that the hearing before the board of arbitration will not commence until the renewal of the TCEU Local 416 bargaining unit collective agreement containing terms and conditions of employment covering non-paramedic employees has (March 24, 2021 / 11:15:46) 119423-1_TorontoCivicEmployees_CBA.pdf .177- 166 - been ratified by both parties and will ask the Chair, immediately following ratification, to schedule at least three (3) days for hearing over the three (3) month period following the date of ratification. 16. The terms and conditions of employment of paramedics set out in schedule P and any rights, privileges or duties of those employees or the City or TCEU, Local 416 in relation to those employees continue in effect until the Board of Arbitration renders its decision unless the parties agree otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) the City shall not, except with the consent of TCEU, Local 416, alter the rates of wages or any other term or condition of employment or any right, privilege or duty of the City or the paramedics; and (b) TCEU, Local 416 shall not, except with the consent of the City, alter any term or condition of employment or any right, privilege or duty of the City, TCEU, Local 416 or the paramedics. 17. Any resolved matters will be agreed upon in writing and signed by the designated representatives of the parties. No such matters shall be determined by the Board of Arbitration. Positions taken by either party during negotiations that are not the subject of such a written agreement shall not be in any way whatsoever disclosed to or used by any Board of Arbitration appointed to resolve such dispute. The decision of the Board will be delivered to the parties as expeditiously as possible following the conclusion of the hearings. The decision of the Board shall incorporate any resolved matters previously agreed upon in writing and signed by the designated representatives of the parties and shall, together with any matters determined by the Board, thereafter form part of the collective agreement. Essential Services Agreement 18. The parties agree that this paragraph 18 shall constitute their essential services agreement and shall be incorporated into their collective agreement. The parties further agree that paramedics shall not strike and the City shall not lock out the paramedics. Further to this agreement that all paramedics will work during any future labour disruption, the parties agree that neither party shall make an application before the Ontario Labour Relations Board under the Ambulance Services Collective Bargaining Act, 2001 to reduce the number of paramedics working during any future labour disruption to less than 100% of all paramedics. The parties agree that they will make no submissions in any interest arbitration proposing changes, amendments and/ or modifications to this paragraph 18 and that no interest arbitrator or Board of Arbitration appointed by them shall have jurisdiction to award any changes, amendments and/or modifications to this paragraph 18. 19. Paragraphs 12 to 17 of this Memorandum of Agreement shall be incorporated by the parties as an article in Schedule P to the new collective agreement. Dated at Toronto this 4th day of February, 2012.
