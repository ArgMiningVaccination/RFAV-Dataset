Criteria for inclusion Individuals eligible for vaccination with LAIV in accordance with national recommendations for 201 9/20 including: children and adolescents from 2 years to under 18 years of age who are in a clinical risk group category listed in Chapter 19 of 'The Green Book ' (see Appendix A ) children aged 2 and 3 years on 31 August 201 9 (with a date of birth between 1 Septembe r 201 5 and 31 August 201 7 inclusive) children of appropriate age for reception class and school years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 (that is 4 to 11 year olds, with a date of birth between 1 September 2008 and 31 August 201 5 inclusive) regardless of whether they attend school o some children in reception class and school years 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 and 6 might have a date of birth outside of these date ranges (for instance if a child has been accelerated or held back a year) , it is acceptable to offer and provide immunisations to these children with their class peers under this PGD children and adolescents from 2 years to under 18 years of age who are household contacts of immunocompromised individuals, such as individuals who expect to share living accommodation on most days over the winter and therefore for whom continuing close contact is unavoidable ( Note: contacts of very severely immunocompromised individuals should receive inactivated influenza vaccine an d not LAIV, see Inactivated Influenza PGD ) Criteria for exclusion4 (continued over page) Criteria for exclusion LAIV must not be given under this PGD to: individual s for whom no valid consent has been received (see DH Reference guide to consent for examination or treatment ) children and infants under 2 years of age adults aged 18 years and over individuals who have received a dose of influenza vaccine for the current season, unless they are individuals aged 2 to less than 9 years in a clinical risk group category listed in Chapter 19 of the 'The Green Book ' who should, in the first season they are vaccinated against influenza, receive a s econd dose of LAIV at least 4 weeks after the first dose individuals with a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of influenza vaccine individuals with a confirmed anaphylactic reaction to any component of LAIV (such as gelatin e) or residue fr om the manufacturing process ( such as gentamicin), with the exception of egg proteins (see Additional information section ) individuals with severe anaphylaxis to egg which has previously required intensive care individuals with severe asthma who have previously required intensive care for asthma exacerbation or who require regular oral 4 Exclusion under this PGD does not necessarily mean the medication is contraindicated, but it would be outside its remit and another form of authorisation will be required . 01/09/201 9 Expiry: 31/03/20 20 Page 8 of 18 (continued) steroids for the maintenance of asthma control , for example children who are currently taking oral steroids or who have been prescribed oral steroids in the past 14 days , unless LAIV is advised by their respiratory specialist individuals receiving salicylate therapy (other than topical treatment for localised conditions) because of the association of Reye's syndrome with salicylates and wild -type influenza infection individuals with unrepaired craniofacial malformations pregnant individuals, see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD Note: There is no need to specifically test eligible girls for pregnancy or to advise avoidance of pregnan cy in those who have been recently vaccinated. individuals who are clinically severely immunodeficient due to a condition or immunosuppressive therapy such as: o acute and chronic leukaemias o lymphoma o HIV infection not on highly active antiretroviral therap y (HAART) o cellular immune deficiencies o high dose corticosteroids (prednisolone at least 2mg/kg/day for a week or 1mg/kg/day for a month or equivalent ) see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD individuals for whom close contact with very severely immunocompromised patients ( for instance, bone marrow transplant patients requiring isolation) is likely or unavoidable (for example, household members) , see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD Temporary exclusion LAIV administration should be postponed for individuals who: are suffering from acute febrile illness until completely recovered are suffering from heavy nasal congestion which may impede delivery of the vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa until congestion has resolved have a history of active wheezing in the past 72 hours or those who have increased their use of bronchodilators in the previous 72 hours, see Action to be taken if the patient is excluded received treatment with influenza antiviral agents in the last 48 hours until 48 hours following the cessation of treatment with influenza antiviral agents Cautions including any relevant action to be taken Individuals who have immunosuppression and HIV infection may not make a full antibody response to the vaccine . Consideration should be given to the influenza vaccination of household contacts of immunocompromised individuals. Action to be taken if the patient is excluded Continued over page Where individuals are excluded and are in a routine cohort with no clinical risk factors, no further action will be required. Children and adolescents with clinical risk factors who are excluded from receiving LAIV should be considered for an appropriate alternative inactivated influenza vaccine , see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD . Children and adolescents with a history of severe anaphylaxis to egg which has required intensive care, and who require protection against influenza because they are in a clinical risk group, should be referred to specialists for immunisation in hospital. LAIV remains the preferred Valid from: 01/09/201 9 Expiry: 31/03/20 20 Page 9 of 18 Action to be taken if the patient is exclud ed (continued) vaccine for this group and the intranasal route is less likely to cause systemic reactions. JCVI has advised that, e xcept for those with severe anaphylaxis to egg which has prev iously required intensive care, children with an egg allergy can be safely vaccinated with LAIV in any setting (incl uding primary care and schools). Individuals who have previously required intensive care for asthma exacerbation or who require regular oral steroids for the maintenance of asthma control should only be given LAIV on the advice of their specialist. As these children are a defined risk group for influ enza, those who cannot receive LAIV should receive an inactivated influenza vaccine , see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD . All pregnant individuals should be offered inactivated influenza vaccine unless otherwise contraindicated , see the PHE I nactivated Influenza PGD . Vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine should be considered for immunosuppress ed individuals excluded from receiving LAIV and those who are contacts of individuals who ar e very severely immunocompromised , see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD . Individuals temporarily excluded may be offered LAIV at a later date. In case of postponement arrange a future date for vaccination. Individuals who have a history of active wheezing in the past 72 hours or those who have increased their us e of bronchodilators in the previous 72 hours whose condition has not improved after a further 72 hours should be offered an inactivated influenza vaccine to avoid delaying prot ection in this high-risk group , see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD . Seek appropriate advice from the local Screening and Immunisation Team, local Health Protection Team or individual 's clinician as required . The risk to the individual of not being immunised must be taken into account. Document the reason for exclusion and any action taken in the individual's clinical records. In a GP practice setting, inform or refer to the GP or a prescriber as appropriate. Action to be taken if the patient or carer declines treatment Informed consent, from the individual or a person legally able to act on the individual 's behalf, must be obtained for each administration. Advise the individual/ parent/carer about the protective effects of the vaccine, the risks of infection and potential complications. Document the advice given and decision reached.

Description of Treatment Name, strength & formulation of drug Live attenuated influenza vaccine nasal spray suspension (0.2 ml) (Influenza vaccine, live attenuated) , for instance : Fluenz Tetra nasal ml) in pre -filled nasal applicator (influe nza vaccine, live attenuated) Legal category Prescription only medicine (POM) Black t riangle No Off-label use Fluenz Tetra SPC states \" For children who have not previously been vaccinated against seasonal influenza, a second dose should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks.\" However, JCVI has advised that children who are not in a clinical risk group, only require a single dose of LAIV irrespective of whether they have received influenza vaccine previously. Fluenz Tetra is contraindicated in children and adolescents receiving salicylate therapy because of the association of Reye's syndrome with salicylates and wild -type influenza infection . However, LAIV may be administered off -label to individuals receiving topical salicylate treatment for the management of localised conditions , in accordance with Chapter 19 of the 'The Green Book '. JCVI has advised that, except for those with severe anaphylaxis to egg which has prev iously required intensive care, children with an egg allergy can be safely vaccinated with LAIV in any setting (incl uding primary care and schools). Vaccine should be stored according to the conditions detailed in the Storage section below. However, in the event of an inadvertent or unavoidable deviation of these conditions refer to PHE Vaccine Incident Guidance . Where vaccine is assessed in accordance with these guidelines as appropriate for continued use this would constitute off-label administration under this PGD. Where a vaccine is recommended off -label consider, as part of the consent process, informing the individual/parent /carer that the vaccine is being offered in accordance with national guidance but that this is outside the product licence. Route / method of administration Continued over page If the PGD is used for \"supply only\", subsequent self - administration or administration by another healthcare worker is outside the remit of this PGD and should only take place in well - defined local circumstances covered by protocols and training. Administ ration under this PGD must be directly by the registered health professional named in section 7. LAIV is for intranasal application only. Single application in each nostril of 0.1ml . The individual can breathe normally during vaccine administration and there is no need to actively inhale or sniff. LAIV PGD v08 .00 Valid from: 01/09/201 9 Expiry: 31/03/20 20 Page 11 of 18 Route / method of administration (continued) Instructions for administration Remove protective tip cap.

Children in clinical risk g roup s Children aged 2 to less than 9 years who are in a clinical risk group category listed in Chapter 19 of the 'The Green Book ' and who have no t received influenza vaccine before, should receive a second dose of LAIV at least 4 weeks after the first dose. Second dose of 0.2ml of LAIV administered as 0.1ml in each nostril . Duration of treatment See section on Dose . Quantity to be supplied / administered 0.2ml dose to be administered as 0.1ml in each nostril . OR 0.2ml of LAIV to be supplied to the individual for immediate self- administration or administration by an appropriately trained healthcare support worker (HCSW) within the clinic setting. Vaccine supplies which are not legally over -labelled for individual use must be administered prior to the individual leaving the immunisation session . Note: The act of administration by anyone other than the registered professional named in Section 7 is outside the remit of this PGD and should only take place in well -defined local circumstances covered by protocols and training. Children aged 2 years to less than 9 years old in a clinical risk category and receiving influenza immunisation for the first time This dose (0.2ml) should be repeated after a 4 -week interval . Supplies LAIV has been purchased centrally for children in the annual routine cohorts and for children aged 2 years to under 18 years of age in clinical risk groups. These vaccines should be ordered as per the usual mechanisms for the routine childhood immunisation programme. Protocols for the ordering, storage and handling of vaccines should be followed to prevent vaccine wastage (see Green Book Chapter 3 ). Storage Store at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. Store in original packaging in order to protect from light. LAIV PGD v08 .00 Valid from: 01/09/201 9 Expiry: 31/03/20 20 Page 12 of 18 Continued over page Storage (continued) Do not freeze . Before use, the vaccine may be removed from the cold -chain , without being replaced, for a maximum period of 12 hours at a temperature not above 25\u00b0C. If the vaccine has not been used after this 12 -hour period, it should be disposed of. In the event of an inadvertent or unavoidable deviation of these conditions vaccine that has been stored outside the conditions stated above should be quarantined and risk assessed for suitability o f continued off -label use or appropriate disposal. R efer to PHE Vaccine Incident Guidance . Disposal Equipment used for immunisation, includin g discharged or partially discharged vaccines in an applicator, should be disposed of safely , as medicinally -contaminated clinical waste for incineration, in a yellow UN-approved waste receptacle (this is usually a sharps box) , according to local authority regulations and guidance in the technical memorandum 07 -01 (Department of Health, 2013). Drug interactions There is a potential for influenza antiviral agents to lower the effectiveness of the LAIV. Therefore, influenza antiviral agents and LAIV should not be administered concomitantly. LAIV should be delayed until 48 hours following the cessation of treatment with influenza antiviral agents. Administration of influenza antiviral agents within the 2 weeks following administration of LAIV may adversely affect the effectiveness of the vaccine. Children and adolescents younger than 18 years of age: Do not administ er LAIV if receiving salicylate therapy (other than topical treatment for localised conditions) and do not use salicylates for 4 weeks after vaccination. LAIV can be given at the same time as other live or inactivated vaccines. Although it was previously recommended that, where vaccines cannot be administered simultaneously , a 4-week interval should be observed between live viral vaccines, JCVI have advised that no specific intervals need to be observed between LAIV and other live vaccines. A detailed list of drug interactions is available in the SPC, which is available from the electronic Medicines Compendium website: www.medicines.org.uk Identification and management of adverse reactions The most common adverse reactions observed after administration of LAIV are decreased appetite, headache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, malaise. Less common reactions include myalgia and pyrexia and uncommon reactions include hypersensitivity reactions, epistaxis and rash. A detailed list of adverse reactions is available in the SPC, which is available from the electronic Medicines Compendium website: www.medicines.org.uk Reporting procedure of adverse reactions Healthcare professionals and individuals /parents/ carers are encouraged to report suspected adverse reactions to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) using the Yellow Card reporting scheme on: 31/03/20 20 Page 13 of 18 Any adverse reaction to the vaccine should be documented in the individual's record and the individual's GP should be informed. Written information to be given to patient or carer Manufacturer 's packaging is required to include a patient information leaflet (PIL) which should accompany the supply of vaccine under this PGD. When LAIV is administered there is no legal requirement to provide the manufacturer 's PIL to the individual at the time of administration, although this may be considered good practice. Patient advice / follow up treatment Inform the individual /parent/ carer of possible side effects and their management. The individual /parent/ carer should be advised to seek medical advice in the event of a severe adverse reaction. When applicable, advise the individual/parent/carer when the subsequent dose is due. The individual/parent/carer should be informed that LAIV has the theoretical potential for transmission to immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid, whenever possible, close association with very severely i mmunocompromised individuals ( such as bone marrow transplant recipients requiring isolation) for 1-2 weeks following vaccination. If the PGD is used for supply only, advise the individual/parent/carer of the process they need to follow for subsequent administration , for instance refer them immediately to an appropriately trained HCSW within the clinic setting. When administration is postponed advise the individual/parent/carer when to return for vaccination. Special considerations / additional information As with most vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the administration of LAIV. Ensure there is immediate access to adrenaline (epinephrine ) 1 in 1000 injection and access to a telephone. For children under the age of 16 years, those assessed as Gillick competent can self -consent (see DH Reference guide to consent for examination or treatment ). Minor illnesses without fever or systemic upset are NOT valid reasons to postpone immunisation. If an individual is acutely unwell, immunisation may be postponed until they ha ve fully recovered. This is to avoid confusing the differential diagnosis of any acute illness by wrongly attributing signs or symptoms to adverse effects of the vaccine. LAIV contains a highly processed form of gelatine (derived from pigs). Some faith gro ups do not accept the use of porcine gelatine in medical products. Only those who are in clinical risk groups are able to receive an inactivated injectable influenza vaccine as an alternative (see the PHE I nactivated Influenza PGD) . JCVI has advised that, except for those with severe anaphylaxis to egg which has prev iously required intensive care, children with an egg allergy can be safely vaccinated with LAIV in any setting (incl uding primary care and from: 01/09/201 9 Expiry: 31/03/20 20 Page 14 of 18 Continued over page Special considerations / additional information (continued) LAIV is not contraindicated for use in child ren or adolescents with stable HIV infection receiving antiretroviral therapy; or who are receiving topical corticosteroids, inhaled corticosteroids, low -dose systemic corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy (such as for adrenal insufficiency ) or low -dose immunosuppressive therapy. This PGD may be used for these individuals. In more than 300 case reports in the AstraZeneca safety database of vaccine administration to pregnant women, no unusual patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal outcomes were observed. While animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, and post -marketing data offer some reassurance in the ev ent of inadvertent administration of the vaccine, LAIV is not recommended during pregnancy . Inactivated influenza vaccine should be offered to pregnant individuals (see the PHE Inactivated Influenza PGD). In accordance with Appendix A and the Seasonal Influenza Direct ed Enhanced Service , morbidly obese adults (aged from 16 years) with a BMI > 40kg/m2 should be offered influenza immunisation. Individuals with learning disabilities may require reasonable adjustments to support vaccination (see https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flu -vaccinations -for- people -with-learning -disabilities ). A PSD may be required. If the PGD is used for supply only for subsequent administration by an appropriately trained HCSW , the registered practitioner named in Section 7 of this PGD must supply the vaccine to the individual /carer. The HCSW cannot supply the medicine. Exposure of healthcare professionals Very severely immunosuppressed individuals should not administer LAIV. Other healthcare workers who have less severe immunosuppression or are pregnant, should follow normal clinical practice to avoid inhaling the vaccine and ensure that they themselves are appropriately vaccinated. Records Record: that valid informed consent was given name of individual , address, date of birth and GP with whom the individual is registered clinical risk group indication for immunisation if applicable name of immuniser name and brand of vaccine date of administration or supply dose, form and route of administration of vaccine quantity administered or supplied batch number and expiry date advice given ; including a dvice given if excluded or declines immunisation details of any adverse drug reactions and actions taken whether supplied only or supplied and administered via PGD Records should be signed and dated ( or password -controlled immunisers record on e -records ). All records clear, legible 31/03/20 20 Page 15 of 18 Continued over page Records (continued) It is important that vaccinations given either at a general practice or elsewhere (for example, at schools or community pharmacies ) are recorded on appropriate health records for the individual (using the appropriate clinical code) . If given elsewhere, a record of vaccination should be re turned to the individual 's general practice to ensure a complete health record is held by the GP, allow clinical follow up and to avoid duplicate vaccination. A record of all individuals receiving treatment under this PGD should also be kept for audit purp oses in accordance with local policy Valid from: 01/09/201 9 Expiry: 31/03/20 20 Page 16 of 18 6.

Clinical risk category Examples (this list is not exhaustive and decisions should be based on clinical judgement) Chronic respiratory disease Asthma that requires continuous or repeated use of inhaled or systemic steroids or with previous exacerbations requiring hospital admission. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including Children who have previously been admitted to hospital for lower respiratory tract disease. Chronic heart disease Congenital heart disease, hypertension with cardiac complications, chronic heart failure, individuals requiring regular medication and/or follow -up for ischaemic heart disease. Chronic kidney disease Chronic kidney disease at stage 3, 4 or 5, chronic kidney failure, nephrotic syndrome, kidney transplantation. Chronic liver disease Cirrhosis, biliary atresia, chronic hepatitis . Chronic neurological disease (included in the DES directions for Wales) Stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Conditions in which respiratory function may be compromised due to neurological disease (e .g. polio syndrome sufferers). Clinicians should offer immunisation, based on individual assessment, to clinically vulnerabl e individuals including those with cerebral palsy, learning disabilities, multiple sclerosis and related or similar conditions; or hereditary and degenerative disease of the nervous system or muscles; or severe neurological disability. Diabetes Type 1 dia betes, type 2 diabetes requiring insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs, diet controlled diabetes. Immunosuppression (see contraindications and precautions section on live attenuated influenza vaccine) Immunosuppression due to disease or treatment, including patients undergoing chemotherapy leading to immunosuppression, bone marrow transplant, HIV infection at all stages, multiple myeloma or genetic disorders affecting the immune system (e.g. IRAK -4, NEMO, complement disorder) . Individuals treated with or likely to be treated with systemic steroids for more than a month at a dose equivalent to prednisolone at 20mg or more per day (any age), or for children under 20kg, a dose of 1mg or more per kg per day. It is difficult to define at what level of immunosuppression a patient could be considered to be at a greater risk of the serious consequences of influenza and should be offered influenza vaccination. This decision is best made on an individual basis and left to the patient's clinician. Some immunocompromised patients may have a suboptimal immunological response to the vaccine. Asplenia or dysfunction of the spleen This also includes conditions such as homozygous sickle cell disease and coeliac syndrome that may lead to splenic dysfunction. Pregnant women Pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy (first, second or third trimesters). Morbid obesity (class III obesity) Adults with a Body Mass "}
