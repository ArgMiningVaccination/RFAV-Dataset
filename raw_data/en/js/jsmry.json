Qi (also known as chi) is considered the \"vital life essence,\" It is created and sustained with the understanding that everything is interconnected and interdependent. If all parts of a system are in harmony, then the whole system will more or less be in balance. Disturb one thing, and you create a ripple effect that will likely disrupt the entire system. Life, it is said in the Chinese medical classics, is a gathering of qi. This principle applies to all organized systems in life. It applies equally to an individual as it does to a family, community, or the environment. With this understanding, you quickly realize the importance of considering how your actions today affect the whole picture in the future. Stemming from the roots of qi, and Chinese Medicine, are yin and yang. Yin and yang symbolize \"the complex harmony of all opposing forces that make up existence.\" It is energy, which is neither created nor destroyed; it simply changes through constant manifestation. Given the importance of \"taking everything as a whole,\" everything is relative in the Chinese perspective. Everything that is yin contains some element of yang, and everything that is yang includes some aspect of yin. There is nothing so solid or material (yin) that does not have some energetic vibration (yang), and nothing so kinetic or immaterial (yang) that does not also contain some material substance (yin). This constant state of change is illustrated in the image of the \"yin-yang symbol.\" When all of the yin and yang aspects of qi are in harmony with one another, there is health, [well-being](https://www.gulfcoastacupunctureandfertility.com/post/acupuncture-can-boost-your-immune-system), and contentment. When yin and yang are in disharmony, as there is too much or too little of one aspect of qi relative to another, there is an illness, [pain](https://www.gulfcoastacupunctureandfertility.com/post/acupuncture-as-a-non-narcotic-pain-relief-1), and [suffering](https://www.gulfcoastacupunctureandfertility.com/post/anxiety-stress-you).
