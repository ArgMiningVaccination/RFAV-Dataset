The 2012 National Health Interview Survey showed that about 11 percent of U.S. adults have pain every day and more than 17 percent have severe levels of pain. Chronic pain is more common among women than men, and it becomes more common as people grow older. One reason why older people are more likely to have chronic pain is that health problems that can cause pain, such as arthritis, become more common with advancing age. Not all people with chronic pain have a health problem that has been diagnosed by a doctor, but among those who do, the most frequent conditions by far are low-back pain or osteoarthritis. Other common conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, carpal tunnel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Chronic pain may result from a disease or injury, medical treatment (such as surgery), inflammation, or a problem in the nervous system, or the cause may be unknown. Pain can affect quality of life and productivity, and people who have pain may also have difficulty moving around, trouble sleeping, anxiety, depression, and other problems. What Are Complementary Health Approaches? This eBook discusses a variety of complementary health approaches that have been studied for pain. But what exactly are complementary approaches, and how do they differ from standard medical care?Complementary Health Approaches: Health care approaches developed outside of mainstream Western, or conventional, medicine. Most complementary approaches fall into one of two categories\u2014mind and body practices, or natural products. Jeremy PerkinsPain: Considering Complementary Approaches5 Chapter 1 About Pain and Complementary Health Approaches The term \"complementary\" refers to health care approaches developed outside of mainstream Western, or conventional, medicine. Most complementary approaches fall into one of two categories: \u2014 Mind and body practices. Mind and body practices include a varied group of techniques administered or taught by a trained practitioner or teacher. Examples include acupuncture, massage therapy, meditation, and yoga. \u2014 Natural products. Natural products include herbs, vitamins and minerals, and probiotics. They are often sold as dietary supplements. Complementary Versus Alternative People often use the words \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: \u2014 \"Complementary\" generally refers to using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine. \u2014 \"Alternative\" refers to using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. Most people use non-mainstream approaches along with conventional health care. Integrative Health Care You may have heard of \"integrative\" health care and wondered what that term means. Integrative health care emphasizes a holistic, patient-focused approach to health care and wellness\u2014often including mental, emotional, functional, spiritual, social, and community aspects. Integrative health care often brings conventional and complementary approaches together in a coordinated way. For example, cancer treatment centers that have integrative health care programs may offer services like acupuncture and meditation to help manage symptoms and side effects for patients who are receiving conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy.

This is an important question, and it doesn't have a simple answer. Safety depends on the specific approach, and each complementary product or practice should be considered on its own. \u2014 Complementary health approaches that are safe for healthy people may not be safe for people with some medical conditions . This may be because of the condition itself or because of the treatment the person is receiving. If you have pain, you have at least one health problem. You might have others as well. So it's important to find out whether a complementary approach is safe for you. \u2014 Always talk with your doctor or other health care provider before starting a new complementary approach. If the approach involves working with a practitioner or taking classes with an instructor, discuss your health conditions with that person, too. Your health care provider and the complementary health practitioner can help you decide whether the approach is appropriate for you. Mind and Body Practices As you will see in the following chapters, mind and body practices\u2014 like acupuncture, massage therapy, meditation, relaxation techniques, spinal manipulation, tai chi, and yoga\u2014generally have good safety records when done properly by a trained professional or taught by a well-qualified instructor. Serious side effects are rare. Angel SinigerskyPain: Considering Complementary Approaches7 Chapter 2 Safety of Complementary Health ApproachesHowever, just because a practice is safe for most people doesn't necessarily mean it's safe for you. Your medical conditions, the medicines you take, or other special circumstances (such as pregnancy) may affect the safety of a complementary health approach. That's why it's so important to talk with your health care provider and with the complementary health practitioner or instructor. Dietary Supplements and Other Natural Products Although many dietary supplements come from natural sources, \"natural\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" For example: \u2014 Some products that have been sold as dietary supplements, including the herbs comfrey and kava and some products used for bodybuilding, can cause serious liver damage. \u2014 St. John's wort can interact with a variety of drugs, making the drugs less effective. \u2014 Getting too much vitamin A can cause headaches and liver damage, reduce bone strength, and cause birth defects. \u2014 Vitamin K supplements can reduce the effectiveness of the anticoagulant (blood thinning) medicine warfarin (Coumadin). There are many unknowns about the safety of dietary supplements. For example, there's little safety data on most herbal supplements, and it's hard to test the safety of these products because they may contain hundreds of substances. It's important to tell all of your health care providers about all dietary supplements and other natural products you take. The health history form you filled out on your first visit to the provider's office probably included questions about dietary supplements, but you may have started or stopped using some supplements since then. Make sure to keep your health care providers up to date about your supplement use. Dietary Supplements: Federal law defines dietary supplements as products that you take by mouth; are made to supplement the diet; have one or more dietary ingredients, including vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, enzymes, tissues from organs or glands, or extracts of these; and are labeled as being dietary supplements. Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches8 Chapter 2 Safety of Complementary Health ApproachesUsing Complementary Approaches Appropriately Another important aspect of safety involves how you use a complementary approach. Even if the approach is safe in itself, using it inappropriately could be harmful. \u2014 N ever use a complementary approach as a reason to delay seeing your doctor or other health care provider about pain or any other health problem. You might have a medical condition\u2014such as an infection\u2014that needs to be treated promptly. If you wait to see your health care provider while trying complementary approaches, your condition could get worse. \u2014 I f you're thinking about stopping (or not starting) conventional care for your health problem, discuss it with your health care provider. In some instances, going without conventional care can lead to serious problems. Rheumatoid arthritis is an example. Conventional treatments can stop or slow damage to the joints in rheumatoid arthritis. Going without conventional care could lead to permanent joint damage. To Find Out More \u2014 You can learn more about the safety of specific complementary health approaches in the chapters in this eBook that discuss those approaches. \u2014 For more detailed information, visit NCCIH's resources on Safe Use of Complementary Health Products and Practices (https://nccih.nih. gov/health/safety).Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches9 Chapter 3 Acupuncture Acupuncture Chapter 3 Acupuncture involves the stimulation of specific points on the body\u2014most often by inserting thin needles through the skin. It's a practice used in traditional Chinese medicine. According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, more than 3 million U.S. adults had used acupuncture in the previous year. Is Acupuncture Safe? Acupuncture is generally considered safe when it's done by an experienced practitioner using sterile needles. But it may cause serious harm (such as infections or punctured organs) if it's not done properly. Does Acupuncture Help To Relieve Pain? Studies suggest that acupuncture may help relieve low-back pain and knee pain associated with osteoarthritis. It may help reduce the frequency of tension headaches and prevent migraine headaches. It may also help relieve some fibromyalgia symptoms. Scientists don't fully understand how acupuncture works in the body to relieve pain. The effect may not be entirely due to the needles. The patient's expectations and beliefs about acupuncture may play important roles in how it may help relieve pain. \u2014 Low-Back Pain. Acupuncture may lead to a slight improvement in low-back pain. W hen health care providers need to make decisions about the best ways to treat their patients, they often rely on clinical practice guidelines\u2014science-based recommendations for patient care. A clinical practice guideline issued by the American College of Physicians, a national organization of doctors who specialize in internal medicine, recommends acupuncture as one of several nondrug approaches physicians should consider for people with low-back pain. Acupuncture: A technique in which practitioners stimulate specific points on the body\u2014most often by inserting thin needles through the skin. It is one of the practices used in traditional Chinese medicine. Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches10 Chapter 3 Acupuncture\u2014 Osteoarthritis. Acupuncture may relieve pain in people with knee pain due to osteoarthritis, but its effects seem to last for only a short time. \u2014 Headaches. Acupuncture may be helpful for tension-type headaches. Adding acupuncture to other migraine treatment may help reduce frequency of migraines. \u2014 Neck Pain . There's some evidence that acupuncture may be helpful for neck pain, but only a small amount of research has been done on this type of pain. \u2014 Fibromyalgia. Recent studies have provided encouraging evidence that mind and body practices, including acupuncture, may help relieve some fibromyalgia symptoms.

It was one of the earliest tools that people used to try to relieve pain. There are many different types of massage therapy, but in general, they all involve manipulating the soft tissues of the body with the goal of helping to manage a health condition or enhance wellness. According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, 15.4 million U.S. adults and 385,000 U.S. children had received massage therapy in the previous year. Is Massage Therapy Safe? The risk of harmful effects from massage therapy appears to be low. However, there have been rare reports of serious injuries. Some of the reported cases involved vigorous types of massage, such as deep tissue massage. Your massage therapist may have to take special precautions if you have special needs. For example: \u2014 If you take an anticoagulant (blood-thinning) drug such as warfarin, vigorous massage may not be safe for you. \u2014 If you have a weakened area on your body, such as a wound that's healing, you shouldn't be massaged in that area. \u2014 If you have cancer, the massage therapist may need to take special precautions to ensure that massage is safe for you.Massage therapy: A practice that encompasses many different techniques in which therapists press, rub, and otherwise manipulate the muscles and other soft tissues of the body. They most often use their hands and fingers, but may use their forearms, elbows, or feet. Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches12 Chapter 4 Massage TherapyYou can help to make sure that massage therapy is safe for you by talking to your health care providers to find out if any special precautions are needed, choosing a well-qualified massage therapist, and explaining your medical conditions and treatments to the massage therapist. You can find out about the training, licensing, and certification of massage therapists in NCCIH's massage therapy fact sheet (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/massage/massageintroduction.htm). Does Massage Therapy Help To Relieve Pain? Research suggests that massage therapy may help relieve several kinds of pain, but in most instances, the evidence isn't strong. If massage therapy does help, the effects may last for only a short time. \u2014 Low-Back Pain. There's some evidence that massage may lead to slight improvements in chronic low-back pain. It's uncertain whether some types of massage are more effective than others. \u2014 Neck and Shoulder Pain. Massage therapy may be helpful for neck and shoulder pain, but it seems to provide only short-term relief. \u2014 Cancer Pain. Massage therapy can be part of supportive care for cancer patients who want to try it, but the evidence that it can relieve pain and anxiety is not strong. \u2014 Arthritis. Some evidence suggests that massage therapy may be helpful for arthritis pain. More research has been done on osteoarthritis than on rheumatoid arthritis. \u2014 Headaches. Only a small number of research studies have looked at whether massage therapy is helpful for headaches, and their results have been inconsistent. \u2014 Fibromyalgia. Massage therapy may be helpful for some fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain, if it's continued for at least several weeks.

Most meditation techniques started in Eastern religious or spiritual traditions. \u2014 Some types of meditation, such as Transcendental Meditation, involve maintaining mental focus on a particular sensation (such as breathing), a sound, a silently repeated word or phrase, or a visual image. \u2014 Other practices, such as mindfulness meditation, involve keeping attention or awareness on the experience of the present moment and being open or accepting toward that experience. Meditation and mindfulness may be practiced for many reasons. This chapter discusses only one of their many uses: helping to manage pain. There's a link to more comprehensive information on meditation and mindfulness, including information on its other health-related uses, at the end of the chapter. According to the 2017 National Health Interview Survey, 14.2 percent of U.S. adults and 5.4 percent of U.S. children practiced meditation in the previous year. Are Meditation and Mindfulness Safe? Meditation and mindfulness are usually considered safe for most people. However, because only a few studies of these techniques have looked for harmful effects, it isn't possible to be absolutely sure about their safety. Meditation: A mind and body practice that has a long history of use for increasing calmness and physical relaxation, improving psychological balance, coping with illness, and enhancing overall health and well-being. Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches14 Chapter 5 Meditation and MindfulnessPeople with physical problems may not be able to participate in meditative practices that involve movement. Meditative practices that involve long periods of sitting still may be painful for some people, such as those with arthritis. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people with mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder or schizophrenia. If you have a physical or mental health problem, talk with your health care providers before starting meditation or mindfulness, and tell your instructor about your condition. Do Meditation and Mindfulness Help To Relieve Pain? \u2014 There's only been a small amount of research on meditation or mindfulness for pain. Studies have shown that mindfulness meditation isn't more effective than cognitive-behavioral therapy (a type of psychotherapy) for chronic pain, but it could be another option to try. \u2014 Learning mindfulness may lead to a small short-term improvement in low-back pain.

Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches15 Chapter 6 Relaxation Techniques Relaxation Techniques Chapter 6 Relaxation techniques include a number of practices such as progressive relaxation, guided imagery, biofeedback, self-hypnosis, and deep breathing exercises. The goal is similar in all: to produce the body's natural relaxation response, characterized by slower breathing, lower blood pressure, and a feeling of calm and well-being. Some people use relaxation techniques to release tension and counteract the ill effects of stress. Relaxation techniques are also used to induce sleep, calm emotions, and reduce pain. This chapter only discusses the use of relaxation techniques to reduce pain. There's a link to information on other uses of relaxation techniques at the end of the chapter. Are Relaxation Techniques Safe? Relaxation techniques are generally considered safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that certain relaxation techniques might cause or worsen symptoms in people with certain mental health conditions, or those with a history of abuse or trauma. People with heart disease should talk to their health care providers before doing progressive muscle relaxation.Relaxation Techniques: Practices such as progressive relaxation, guided imagery, biofeedback, self-hypnosis, and deep breathing exercises, that share the goal of producing the body's natural relaxation response, characterized by slower breathing, lower blood pressure, and a feeling of increased well-being.

Is Spinal Manipulation Safe? Serious harmful effects associated with spinal manipulation are rare. However, it's not unusual for people to have discomfort in the parts of the body that were treated, temporary headaches, or tiredness after spinal manipulation. To find out more, see the NCCIH fact sheets Headaches: In Depth (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/pain/headachefacts. htm) and Spinal Manipulation for Low-Back Pain (https://nccih.nih.gov/ health/pain/spinemanipulation.htm) . Does Spinal Manipulation Help To Relieve Pain? \u2014 Low-Back Pain. Spinal manipulation can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain. It appears to work as well as conventional treatments such as applying heat, using a firm mattress, and taking pain-relieving medications. T he American College of Physicians, a national organization of doctors who specialize in internal medicine, has recommended spinal manipulation as one of several nondrug treatments that patients with chronic low-back pain may want to consider. \u2014 Headaches. Spinal manipulation may help people with chronic tension-type or cervicogenic (neck-related) headaches and may also be helpful in preventing migraines. \u2014 Neck Pain. There's some evidence that spinal manipulation may help to relieve neck pain, but much of the research on this technique has been of low quality. Spinal Manipulation: A practice performed by health care professionals (such as chiropractors, osteopathic physicians, naturopathic physicians, physical therapists, and some medical doctors) in which practitioners use their hands or a device to apply a controlled fore to a joint of the spine. The goal of the treatment is to relieve pain and improve physical functioning.

Tai chi involves moving the body slowly, gently, and with awareness, while breathing deeply. Many people practice tai chi to improve their health and well-being. Tai chi has also been studied for certain health problems. Is Tai Chi Safe? In general, yes. However, as with all complementary approaches, \"safe\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe for you.\" If you have any chronic health conditions, if you take medication, or if you are pregnant, talk with your health care provider before starting tai chi, and make sure that your tai chi instructor is familiar with your health situation. Does Tai Chi Help To Relieve Pain? Tai chi has been studied in people with osteoarthritis, low-back pain, and fibromyalgia. \u2014 Osteoarthritis. In research studies, tai chi was better than an education and stretching program and comparable to physical therapy in relieving pain in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. The American College of Rheumatology's guideline for treating knee osteoarthritis mentions tai chi as one of several nondrug approaches that might be helpful.Tai Chi: A centuries-old mind and body practice that involves certain postures and gentle movements with mental focus, breathing, and relaxation.

Although classical yoga also includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States typically emphasizes physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation. Many people who practice yoga do so for reasons related to general health and well-being. Yoga is also used for specific health conditions, some of which involve pain. According to the 2017 National Health Interview Survey, about one in seven U.S. adults practiced yoga in the previous year. Among U.S. children age 4 to 17, it was about 1 in 12. Is Yoga Safe? Yoga is generally considered safe for healthy people when performed properly, under the guidance of a qualified instructor. However, as with other types of physical activity, injuries can occur\u2014most commonly, sprains and strains. Serious injuries are rare. People with health conditions, older adults, and pregnant women may need to avoid or modify some yoga poses and should discuss their individual needs with their health care providers and the yoga instructor. Different situations call for different restrictions. For example, people with conditions that weaken their bones should avoid forceful forms of yoga, and people with glaucoma should avoid upside- down positions.Yoga: An ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy, that originated several thousand years ago and has become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.

Natural products are widely marketed and often sold as dietary supplements. Different natural products have been studied for different pain conditions. This chapter summarizes the research on dietary supplements and other natural products for several pain conditions and discusses important issues to consider if you're thinking of using these products. Pain Conditions for Which Dietary Supplements and Other Natural Products Have Been Studied \u2014 Low-Back Pain. There is some evidence that short-term use of the herbs devil's claw and white willow bark (taken by mouth), and cayenne, comfrey, and Brazilian arnica (applied on the skin) might be helpful for low-back pain, but it's uncertain whether these herbs are safe or effective when used for longer periods of time. \u2014 Osteoarthritis. Although there's been a lot of research, it's still uncertain whether glucosamine and chondroitin have a meaningful impact on osteoarthritis symptoms. Anastasia DulgierPain: Considering Complementary Approaches24 Chapter 10 Dietary Supplements and Other Natural Products\u2014 Rheumatoid Arthritis. Omega-3 fatty acids of the types found in fish oil may have small beneficial effects on rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. N o other dietary supplement has shown clear benefits for rheumatoid arthritis, but there is preliminary evidence for a few, particularly gamma-linolenic acid (contained in evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, and black current seed oil) and the herb thunder god vine. However, serious safety concerns have been raised about thunder god vine. \u2014 Headaches. The American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society have classified butterbur as \u2014 I rritable Bowel Syndrome. Probiotics may be helpful for symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, such as bloating and flatulence, but it's still not possible to draw firm conclusions about specific probiotics for IBS because different studies have used different types. Studies on peppermint oil have suggested that it may be helpful, but the quality of much of the research is poor. Using Natural Products Wisely As mentioned earlier, natural products used in complementary health are often sold as dietary supplements. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements, but the regulations are different and less strict than those for prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Unlike drugs, which must be approved by the FDA before they can be sold, dietary supplements do not need FDA approval before they can go on the market. Although the supplement company is responsible for having evidence that their product is safe and the label claims are truthful and not misleading, the company doesn't have to give this evidence to the FDA before selling the product. Once a dietary supplement is on the market, the FDA evaluates safety by doing research and keeping track of any side effects reported by consumers, health care providers, and supplement companies. If the FDA finds a product to be unsafe, it can issue a warning or require that the product be removed from the marketplace.Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): A health condition that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints. Conventional medical treatments are highly effective for RA; however, researchers are also studying complementary health approaches as possible additions to RA treatments. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): A chronic disorder that interferes with the normal functions of the colon. IBS is characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches25 Chapter 10 Dietary Supplements and Other Natural Products\"Natural\" Doesn't Always Mean \"Safe\" Although many dietary supplements come from natural sources, \"natural\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" Natural products may contain ingredients that have strong effects in your body. A product's safety depends on many things, such as the chemicals in it, how it works in the body, how it's prepared, and the dose you take. Research has been done on a variety of dietary supplements, but in many instances there isn't enough scientific evidence to show whether they're effective and safe. More needs to be learned about the effects of these products in the human body. Problems With Supplement Ingredients and Marketing Problems have occurred with the safety and marketing of certain dietary supplements. Some products have been found to contain unsafe or illegal ingredients, and some have been promoted improperly. \u2014 The Federal Government has taken legal action against certain dietary supplement promoters or websites that promote or sell dietary supplements because they have made false or deceptive statements about their products or because the products are unsafe. \u2014 The FDA has warned the public that some products marketed as dietary supplements contain illegal and potentially harmful ingredients, such as prescription drugs and related substances. Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches26 Chapter 10 Dietary Supplements and Other Natural Products\"Safe\" May Not Mean \"Safe for You\" Even if the dietary supplement you're planning to take is generally considered safe, that doesn't necessarily mean it's safe for you. For example: \u2014 Some supplements may be unsafe for people who have particular medical conditions. For example, it's not safe for people with hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease in which too much iron builds up in your body) to take iron supplements. \u2014 S ome supplements may cause problems if you have surgery. They may increase the risk of bleeding or affect your response to anesthesia. \u2014 Some dietary supplements interact with medicines. For example, the herbal supplement St. John's wort interacts with many medicines, making them less effective, and supplements containing vitamin K may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants (blood thinners). \u2014 Most dietary supplements have not been tested in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or children. Therefore, it is not known whether they're safe for these groups of people. Communication Is Crucial In Chapter 2, we talked about the importance of telling all of your health care providers\u2014and any complementary health practitioners that you see\u2014about everything you're doing to manage your pain, including both conventional and complementary approaches. It's especially important to tell them about any dietary supplements or other natural products you take. These products may have special issues\u2014such as contamination or drug interactions\u2014that don't apply to other complementary approaches. To Find Out More \u2014 To learn more about using dietary supplements safely and appropriately, visit NCCIH's Dietary and Herbal Supplements page (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/supplements) and the website of NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements (https://ods.od.nih.gov/) . \u2014 F or information on contaminated or fraudulent dietary supplements, visit the FDA's webpage of consumer information on dietary supplements (https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ dietary-supplements) .Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches27 Chapter 11 Other Complementary Health Approaches Other Complementary Health ApproachesC h a p t e r 11 In addition to the complementary health approaches discussed in previous chapters, several other approaches have been studied for pain, at least to a limited extent. \u2014 Balneotherapy. The terms \"balneotherapy\" or \"spa therapy\" refer to bathing in mineral water for health purposes and related techniques such as mud packs. Some preliminary research has been conducted on balneotherapy for symptoms of fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, but the evidence is too limited to allow any conclusions to be reached about whether it's helpful. \u2014 Homeopathy. Homeopathy was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago. It is based on two unconventional ideas: the notion that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people, and the notion that the lower the dose of the medicine, the greater its effectiveness. The key ideas of homeopathy aren't consistent with fundamental concepts of science. There's little evidence to support homeopathy as an effective treatment for any health condition. Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches28 Chapter 11 Other Complementary Health Approaches\u2014 Magnets. Several types of magnets have been studied for various painful conditions. -Static magnets have magnetic fields that don't change. They're put into products such as shoe insoles, bracelets, and headbands.Research results don't support their use for pain relief. -Electromagnets become magnetic when an electrical current charges the metal. They may have some effect on osteoarthritispain, but it's unclear whether the effect is large enough to make adifference to patients. -Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique in which a magnetic pulse is applied to the head to stimulate part of thebrain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved aTMS device to treat migraines. \u2014 Music. Studies have shown that music can reduce self-reported pain and depression symptoms in people with chronic pain. \u2014 Prolotherapy. Prolotherapy (a treatment involving repeated injections of irritant solutions) has been studied for low-back pain, but research results have been inconsistent. \u2014 Reiki. Reiki is a complementary health approach in which practitioners place their hands lightly on or just above the person, with the goal of facilitating the person's own healing response. There isn't enough high-quality research to evaluate whether Reiki is helpful for relieving pain.

Take charge of your health by being an informed consumer. The information in this chapter can help. Topics discussed in this chapter include: \u2014 Evaluating complementary health information on the Internet \u2014 Finding reliable sources of health information \u2014 Selecting a complementary health practitioner Complementary Health Information on the Internet Many people look for health information on the Internet. The number of websites, social media sites, and mobile apps offering information about complementary and integrative health grows every day. Some online sources are useful, but others are inaccurate or misleading. If you're visiting an online health site for the first time or downloading a new app, these five questions may help you check it out: \u2014 Who runs or created the site or app? Can you trust them? \u2014 What is the site or app promising or offering? Do its claims seem too good to be true? \u2014 When was the information written or reviewed? Is it up-to-date? \u2014 Where does the information come from? Is it based on scientific research? \u2014 Why does the site or app exist? Is it selling something? Getty ImagesPain: Considering Complementary Approaches30 Chapter 12 Be an Informed ConsumerRather than searching the Internet, it's often easier to find reliable health information online by visiting U.S. Government health websites where all the information has been checked to make sure it's accurate. The following online Federal Government collections of high-quality, up-to-date resources may be particularly helpful: Resources on Complementary Health Approaches \u2014 NCCIH's website (www.nccih.nih.gov) \u2014 NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements website (https://ods.od.nih. gov/) Resources on All Health Topics \u2014 M edlinePlus (https://medlineplus.gov/) , a collection of resources maintained by NIH's National Library of Medicine \u2014 Healthfinder.gov (https://healthfinder.gov/) , a collection of resources maintained by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 Know the Science (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/know-science) , NCCIH's collection of tools to help people better understand complex scientific topics related to health research Mobile Health Apps There are thousands of mobile apps that provide health information you can read on your smartphone or tablet. Keep these things in mind when using a mobile health app: \u2014 The content of most apps isn't written or reviewed by medical experts and may be inaccurate and unsafe. In addition, the information you enter when using an app may not be secure. \u2014 There's little research on the benefits, risks, and impact of h ealth apps, such as the many mindfulness meditation apps that a re now available. \u2014 It's not always easy to know what personal information an app will access or how it will store your data. \u2014 Before you download an app, find out if the store you get the app from says who created it. Don't trust the app if contact or website information for the creator isn't available. Some reliable health apps created by Government agencies can be found by visiting: \u2014 U.S. National Library of Medicine (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mobile/) \u2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/mobile/generalconsumerapps.html)Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches31 Chapter 12 Be an Informed ConsumerIf you're interested in herbs, you may want to consider downloading HerbList (https://nccih.nih.gov/Health/HerbListApp) , NCCIH's app for research-based information about the safety and effectiveness of herbal products. Where To Find Reliable Information The Internet, when used carefully, can be a good source of information about complementary health approaches, but other resources are also available. Your health care providers and your pharmacist are good resources for learning about complementary health approaches. You can ask them about safety, effectiveness, and possible interactions with medicines, and they can help you understand scientific reports. Another good information source is the NCCIH Clearinghouse. The information specialists at the Clearinghouse can respond to inquiries in English and Spanish, send you publications on complementary health approaches, and search Federal databases of scientific and medical literature for you. However, they cannot provide medical advice, treatment recommendations, or referrals to practitioners. You can reach the Clearinghouse in three ways: \u2014 By phone.

Selecting a Complementary Health Practitioner Some of the practices described in this eBook, such as acupuncture, massage therapy, and spinal manipulation, involve working with a practitioner. When you're looking for a complementary health practitioner to help treat a health problem, it's important to be as careful and thorough in your search as you are when looking for conventional medical care. Here are some tips: \u2014 If you need names of practitioners in your area, first check with your doctor or other health care provider. A nearby hospital, professional organizations, or your health insurance provider may also be helpful. NCCIH cannot refer you to practitioners. \u2014 Find out as much as you can about any potential practitioner, including education, training, licensing, and certifications. The credentials required for complementary health practitioners vary tremendously from state to state and from discipline to discipline.Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches32 Chapter 12 Be an Informed Consumer\u2014 Find out whether the practitioner is willing to work together with your conventional health care providers. For safe, coordinated care, it's important for all of the professionals involved in your health to communicate and cooperate. \u2014 Explain all of your health conditions to the practitioner, and find out about the practitioner's training and experience in working with people who have your conditions. Choose a practitioner who understands how to work with people with your specific needs. And remember that health conditions can affect the safety of complementary approaches. \u2014 Don't assume that your health insurance will cover the practitioner's services. Coverage varies for different approaches, and it may be partial rather than complete. It's wise to contact your insurance provider and ask what coverage you have. To Find Out More \u2014 The NCCIH website has a collection of resources on being an informed consumer (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/decisions) . \u2014 N CCIH's fact sheet, Finding and Evaluating Online Resources (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/webresources) , provides tips on how to evaluate health information on the Internet. MedlinePlus (https://medlineplus.gov/healthywebsurfing.html) also provides useful information on healthy web surfing. \u2014 Read about credentials and licensing (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/ decisions/credentialing.htm) of complementary health practitioners and paying for complementary health approaches (https://nccih.nih.gov/health/financial) on the NCCIH website.Pain: Considering Complementary Approaches33 Chapter 13 Research on Complementary Approaches for Pain Research on Complementary Approaches for PainChapter 13 Research on pain is a high priority for NCCIH and the larger agency we're part of, the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Here are some highlights of current research: \u2014 NIH has launched an aggressive effort to speed scientific solutions to the opioid crisis called the HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term) Initiative. One part of HEAL is research to prevent addiction by improving pain management. This includes research on nondrug and integrated therapies for pain. \u2014 With NCCIH as the lead agency, NIH is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on large-scale research on nondrug approaches for pain management in the military and veteran health care delivery systems. \u2014 NCCIH does research at the NIH laboratories in Maryland on the role of the brain in perceiving, modifying, and managing pain. Some of the research projects involve finding out how factors such as emotion, attention, environment, and genetics affect the perception of pain. Others involve learning about the cells and molecules involved in the brain's ability to detect pain and other sensations. These efforts may lead to the development of better ways to treat pain. To Find Out More \u2014 Visit the NIH Pain Consortium's website (https://www.painconsortium.nih.gov/) to learn more about pain-related research activities throughout NIH. \u2014 F or the latest news on the HEAL Initiative, visit the HEAL webpage (https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative) . \u2014 G o to the NCCIH Pain page (www.nccih.nih.gov/health/pain) for information about NCCIH's pain research projects.
