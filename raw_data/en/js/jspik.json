Today,aside from the Netherlands, Germany is the most importantmarket for such products. The regulatory framework for theapproval of medicinal cannabis and its distribution to patients in the EU member states is, however, not harmonized at all, and there are distinct national regulations. Regarding thequality of such products, the general requirements for herbalmedicinal products as defined in the European Pharmaco-poeia, national pharmacopoeias, and the EMA guidance docu-ments in place beside GMP requirements in the EU are appli-cable. However, for a couple of aspects, every EU memberstate follows its own interpretation of these requirements. To facilitate free distribution of such products between EU mem- ber states in future and to harmonize requirements for qualityand GMP, an EU-wide approach is needed. As a first step, thisshould be realized by implementing monographs for cannabismedicinal products in the European Pharmacopoeia.Quality Requirements for Medicinal Cannabis and Respective Products in the European Union -Status Quo# #Dedicated to Professor Dr. Gerhard Franz on the occasion of his 85th birthday.Reviews 808Veit M.

The cannabi- noids are accumulated in high concentrations in glandular hairs,which occur particularly densely on the underside of the bracts of female flowers along the leaf veins and the leaves in the in- florescence area [3]. Genuinely, cannabinoids are accumulated ascarboxylated compounds, these compounds are therefore calledcannabinoid acids; to make this clear, an A for \"acid \"is then added to their abbreviation ( Fig. terpene phenols as cannabidiol (CBD), psychoactive effects are completely absent [4]. In addition to these activities, which are mediated via the hu-man endocannabinoid system, numerous other pharmacologicalactivities are now known, including the modulation of various re-ceptors and the influencing of ion channels as well as influenceson enzymes and their gene regulation [5]. The main cannabinoidsare accumulated in the plant as pharmacologically non-active car-boxylic acids (e.g., THC Aand CBD A) be decarboxy- lated before they become pharmacologically active ( Fig. 1 ). The content of the two main cannabinoids THC and CBD in the in-florescences varies enormously between cultivars. There are ge-notypes that are almost free of THC, while others contain up to2% THC. The same applies to the CBD content. Medicinal Cannabis and Medicinal Cannabis Products Different products based on cannabis flowers and cannabis ex- tracts are marketed in the EU member states as herbal medicinalproducts without regular marketing authorizations. Patient -spe- cific prescription medicinal products manufactured in pharmaciesor medicinal products are available to individual patients based ondistinct national authorization or registration procedures. It is sur- prising that the conditions for making cannabis products available and for distributing them to patients in Europe are by no meansharmonized and that there are specific regulations in each EU member state due to different frameworks for narcotics and indi-vidual prescriptions, which will not be discussed here. Neitherdoes this article cover the aspects resulting for the status of me-dicinal cannabis as narcotics. This review is focused on quality as-pects. Cannabis and cannabis preparations are herbal active sub- stances or herbal medicinal products. Therefore, the definitions of Directive 2001/83/EC, the HMPC guidelines for herbal medici- nal products in Europe and the European Pharmacopoeia(Ph. Eur.) are relevant. Within the scope of these regulations andguidelines, the harvested cannabis inflorescences are to be de-fined as herbal drugs (starting materials), and the extracts pro-duced from them as herbal preparations, i.e., the active ingre-dient. This is then turned into an extemporaneous (magistral)preparation by essential manufacturing steps in the pharmacy or into a medicinal cannabis product by industrial production ( Fig. 2 ). Extemporaneous preparations are defined in the Euro- pean Pharmacopoeia as pharmaceutical preparations individuallyprepared for a specific patient or patient group, supplied afterpreparation; if they are prescribed regularly, they could be manu-factured in pharmacies as stock preparations, which are definedas pharmaceutical preparations prepared in advance and storeduntil a request for supply is received. In this context, trimmed can- nabis inflorescences are directly used as medicinal products ( \"me- dicinal cannabis \"). Trimming is performed by removing buds, leaves, and non-flowering branches from the Cannabis inflores-cence. Trimmed inflorescences or extracts obtained from canna-bis are used as active ingredients for the manufacture of distinctdosage forms, e.g., tablets, capsules, liquids, and preparations forvaping ( \"medicinal cannabis products \"). Medicinal cannabis is best compared with medicinal herbal teas, for which there are well-established concepts in Europe. If we apply these concepts to medicinal cannabis, we can define the harvested inflorescencesas herbal drugs (starting materials), the trimmed flowers as theherbal preparation, i.e., the active ingredient, which is thenturned into a extemporaneous preparation through essentialmanufacturing steps in the pharmacy, for example ( Fig. 2 ). Although this con cept is clearly established in Europe, the EU member states follow their own concepts, in which the purified flowers or even extracts are frequently already defined as extem- poraneous preparations and/or medicinal products. This has far-reaching consequences for the import into Europe, the manufac-ture, and the movement of goods into and within the EuropeanUnion as well as the authorizations required for these activities. Itis surprising that no harmonized concept is being pursued hereand that the European regulatory bodies, e.g., the Herbal Medici-nal Products Committee of the EMA, are not addressing this issue. As there are specific quality requirements for herbal medicinal products for the three different stages of the value chain, this alsohas consequences for the quality assurance and testing of medic-inal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products and intermediates.ABBREVIATIONS DAB \"Deutsches Arzneibuch \"(German Pharmacopeia) EMA European Medicines Agency EU European Union GACP Guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practices for Starting Materials of Herbal Origin GDP Good Distribution Practice GMP Good Manufacturing Practice HMP Herbal Medicinal Product HMPC Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products HPLC high-performance liquid | \u00a9 2022.

Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) In the manufacture of herbal medicinal products, the wild collec- tion or cultivation of plants as herbal starting material is the first step. In order to ensure that the quality of starting materials is as consistent as possible, there are GACP guidelines, such as the\"Guideline on Good Agricultural and Collection Practices for Start- ing Materials of Herbal Origin \"(EMEA/HMPC/246816/2005) of the EMA [6]. This guideline has been in force since 2006 and isbinding in Europe for the collection of herbal starting materials,as Annex 7 of the EU GMP Guide explicitly refers to them [7]. This guideline takes into account the special features of herbal starting materials and covers the entire processing of plants used for themanufacture of medicinal products. Annex 7 and the GACP guidelines define rules for the wild col- lection and cultivation of medicinal plants. This includes require-ments for:quality assurance personnel involved and their qualifications, as well as necessary hygiene measuresthe buildings and premises used for drying, initial processing steps, and storage, equipment and devices to be used documentation the production of seeds, cuttings, and other plant material for propagation purposes cultivation and harvest (for medicinal plant cultivation) or col- lection (for wild collection) drying and initial processing of the plant materials packaging, (intermediate) storage, transport, and distribution. Within the framework of an audit, it is the responsibility of the dis- tributor in the European Union to verify whether the requirementsof GACP are fulfilled. The activities, according to GACP, are fol- lowed by the manufacture of the herbal preparation or the herbal medicinal product, which must be carried out under quality assur-ance measures according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) The first part of the EU GMP Guideline outlines the requirementsfor medicinal products [8]. The second part serves as GMP guid- ance for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Part II is an internationally harmonized guidance that was origi- Fig. 1 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol acid THCA ( a) and Cannabidiol acid CBDA ( cannabinoids in medicinal cannabis.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. nally published as ICH Guideline Q7A [9] and was then imple- mented in the European legal framework as Part II of the EU GMPGuide [10]. Table 1 of the EU GMP Guideline Part II provides an overview of the application of the Guideline to the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients and highlights which stepsof a manufacturing type (including plant-based active pharma-ceutical ingredients) are GMP and which are GACP. A similar butnot identical table is provided in the Annex of the EU GMP Guide( Fig. 3 ). According to Annex 7 of the EU GMP Guideline, the re- sponsibility for performing an appropriate demarcation lies withthe medicinal product manufacturer. Only active ingredients that have been manufactured in accordance with the EU GMP require- ments may be used, both for production in a company or for fur-ther processing in the pharmacy. In Europe, GMP supervision ofmanufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients (EU GMP PartII) and of finished medicinal products (EU GMP Part I) is the re-sponsibility of the national competent authorities of the EU mem-ber states. When importing active ingredients from countries out-side the EU, a \"written confirmation \"is required from the local authorities of the country in which the production takes place. In the \"written confirmation \", local authorities confirm that the standards of GMP applicable to the respective manufacturingplant are at least equivalent to those laid down in the EU; the man-ufacturing plant is subject to regular, strict, and transparent con-trols, and to the effective enforcement of good manufacturingpractice, including repeated and unannounced inspections. Thisensures a protection of public health at least equivalent to that in the EU, and that in the event of findings relating to non-compli- ance, information on such findings is supplied by the exportingthird country to the EU without delay. This certificate must be is-sued for each active substance of a manufacturing site; e.g., foreach singular batch of cannabis extract to be imported. A copy ofthe relevant certificate is a mandatory part of the delivery docu-ments of each consignment to the EU. These requirements onlyapply to those countries not included in the list published by the European Commission according to Art. 111b of Directive 2001/ 83/EC ( \"White List \"). Currently listed are the USA, Canada, Japan,Brazil, Australia, Israel, Switzerland, New Zealand, and South Korea. Even for these importing countries, not all of them issuesuch GMP certificates for medicinal cannabis and/or medicinal cannabis products, e.g., in Canada and Israel such certificates are not issued (so far) -neither for extracts or other preparations nor for flowers as active ingredients, because their production is notsubject to GMP supervision in these countries. If the competentauthority of the country of origin does not issue a \"written confir- mation \", the competent authority of an EU member state must issue a corresponding GMP certificate for the active substancesto be imported. This requires an on-site GMP inspection of the active ingredient production by an EU medicines competent authority. Even the external testing laboratories, which may beresponsible for quality control, in Canada, for example, must beinspected -even if they have a GMP certificate from Health Cana- da-as the analysis of active herbal ingredients is not subject to the agreement between the EU and Canada on the mutual recog-nition of GMP certificates ( \"White List Country \"). If cannabis flowers or preparations made from them are cate- gorized as medicinal products by an EU national competent au- thority, an EU import permit is required. This requires a GMP cer-tificate from the non-European manufacturer. If this is not avail-able, such a certificate must be issued in the EU and the compe-tent authority of a Member State must certify that the GMP re-quirements are met. This also requires an inspection in the thirdcountry concerned. This is also the case for MRA countries (MRAstands for \"mutual recognition agreement \"and refers to agree- ments between the EU and third countries on the mutual recogni- tion of GMP certificates or quality standards), such as Canada, be-cause cannabis is not subject to local medicinal product legisla-tion there and a certificate is therefore not issued by the local au-thority. In the non-European countries from which cannabis hasbeen imported to date (e.g., Israel, Canada, Colombia, Australia,Jamaica, Lesotho, Uruguay, Uganda) or from which an import isintended (e.g., Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe), the extraction of cannabis flowers has so far been carried out with a correspond- ing local manufacturing license, but not under GMP.

Delimitation of the Quality Assurance Systems GACP, GMP Part I, and GMP Part II For herbal medicinal products, concepts have been developed as to when production should be carried out under GMP (as distinctfrom GACP) and which processing steps should be carried outunder GMP Part II or GMP Part I. Such a concept exists, for exam-ple, for the manufacture of medicinal teas, which has been suc-cessfully practiced in the EU for many years and is recognized bythe authorities. Here, the cultivation of the herbal starting materi-al as well as the initial drying and comminution are performed under GACP. The production of the actual herbal preparation, in particular the fine cutting and the homogenization, is carried outaccording to EU GMP Part II and its packaging and labelling, ac- cording to EU GMP Part I or local requirements for pharmacies. Such a concept can easily be transferred to purified cannabisflowers ( Fig. 2 ). If cannabis flowers are used as herbal starting materials for the manufacture of herbal preparations, i.e., extracts, the equally well-established concept for the production of herbal medicinalproducts with herbal preparations as active ingredients applies. The cultivation and the first processing steps of the herbal startingmaterial are carried out under GACP. The production of the activeingredients (preparations, e.g., extracts) is carried out under EUGMP Part II, whereas the production of the medicinal product iscarried out under EU GMP Part I. The GMP manufacturing stepsare also covered by the manufacturing authorization of a phar-macy ( Fig. 2 ). The responsibility for GMP supervision of the production of medicinal products in manufacturing facilities in- cluding pharmacies lies with the respective competent authoritiesof the EU member states, which also issue the corresponding GMPcertificates in which the production of herbal medicinal productsmust be explicitly stated. In the case of cannabis flowers as active ingredients for the preparation of flower-based prescription or magistral medicinalproducts in the pharmacy, the situation is complex and the re- quirements of the authorities regarding demarcation between EU GMP Part II and Part I are not harmonized between the EUmember states. National peculiarities apply when it comes to thestage of production at which cannabis flowers are consideredstarting materials, active ingredients, or (intermediate) medicinalproducts. Today, three distinct concepts are followed ( Fig. 4 a - c). This also results in the problem that the existing requirements in pharmacopoeias in Europe are partly applied to cannabis flow- ers as active substances and partly as medicinal products. Partic- Fig. 4 Concepts followed by local competent authorities in the EU for the different stages of the manufacture of medicinal cannabis (A: Liquid medicinal preparations, B and C: Flowers) with different demarcation between EU GMP Part I and II. Some of these concepts are in conflict with existing concepts for the manufacture of herbal medicines in the EU and the demarcations as provided by ICH Q7. For imports of medicinal can-nabis as flowers in bulk in the EU, concept B follows the requirements for the import of APIs and thus only a notification together with a \"written confirmation \"is required; concept C follow the requirements for medicinal products and thus an import permit and wholesale licence are required. The latter also applies in the case of liquid bulk extracts under concept A. Data partly from [30]. 812Veit M. Quality Requirements rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. ularly disconcerting is the position of individual authorities in Europe who consider the monograph for cannabis flowers in theGerman Pharmacopoeia (DAB) to be also applicable when extractsare produced from cannabis. For cannabis medicinal products imported into the EU, a full EU release is required, which must be done by a \"Qualified Person (QP) \". This release is often carried out for purified ( \"trimmed \") cannabis flowers and cannabis extracts (as far as they are covered by the monograph), on the basis of the DAB monographs. This re- lease testing can also be carried out in an external laboratory withan EU manufacturer s authorization. Formally, the release requires the verification of all GMP obligations in the entire value chain;this normally also includes audits. Compliance with the GACP re-quirements must be guaranteed by the distributor of the medici-nal product. For the manufacturing steps that must be conducted under GMP, it is quite a complex project to integrate in detail steps such as harvesting, drying, and trimming into a GMP-compliant qualityassurance concept. This is made even more difficult by the factthat cultivation and further processing are currently carried outin the countries of origin, such as Canada or Israel, under canna-bis-specific quality assurance concepts but not under GMP. In thiscontext, some requirements of the EU GMP Guide are notmapped, others differ. It will usually be the case that essential re- quirements of the EU GMP Guide have to be established locally before an inspection by European inspectors can take place. Preparation of GMP Inspections for Medicinal Cannabis The implementation of GMP specifications and requirements for the manufacture of preparations from cannabis flowers, in partic- ular extracts, follows established standards based on many yearsof experience with GMP concerning the production of herbalpreparations and herbal medicinal products. However, such gen-erally recognized standards are lacking for the production of me-dicinal cannabis. The inspections carried out in the meantime bythe European competent authorities, especially in Canada andIsrael, prove that it is certainly possible to also map corresponding standards for the production of medicinal cannabis. The underly- ing process, in the course of which several inspections are usuallycarried out, begins with a supplier qualification. At the end, theresponsible person of the importing company must give a positivevote before an inspection can be applied for at the competentauthority of an EU member state. When implementing the GMPrequirements, challenges arise especially in the following areas: Batch definition and batch homogeneity: In the GMP environ- ment, the definition of a batch affects the resulting activities in many ways. This concerns the control strategy, in-process con-trols, release testing, and traceability, as well as cleaning and pro-cess validations. It must first be decided what is to be defined as abatch. This will usually be based on propagation and cultivationcycles, origin and age of clones or cultivars, and defined cultiva-tion areas or spaces. In each case, a set of plants obtained in thesame form must be defined. As the inflorescences are not cut and further crushed when producing the flowers as medicinal canna-bis, complete homogenization is not possible, and therefore a cer- tain variability of the cannabinoid contents must be expected.This from \u00b1 10 to 20% for the cannabinoids THC and CBDto be declared. However, this is only possible if the plants arespread, cultivated, and harvested under strictly controlled condi-tions and stable clones are used as cultivars and, so far, usuallyonly when cultivation takes place indoors. This variation has anumber of consequences that need to be taken into account in quality control and stability testing. Central to this is an appropri- ate sampling schedule for quality control and the examination ofappropriate samples in stability studies, as the mean content ofcannabinoids of packaged stored stability samples may well differby 10 to 20% from pack to pack. Distinct from medicinal cannabis,cannabis (flowers) used for the manufacture of extracts representherbal starting material. They need not be obtained under GMP;the manufacture under GMP (Part II) starts with the initial commi- nution before extraction. Risk management system: Manufacturing under GMP requires the establishment of a pharmaceutical risk management systemwith a risk-based approach for all GMP activities. This requirementis often difficult to communicate to medicinal cannabis manufac-turers in third countries and is not infrequently part of deficitsidentified during audits and inspections. Zone concepts: The individual manufacturing zones must clearly be separated from one other. This particularly applies to the demarcation between the GACP and GMP areas in the produc-tion of purified ( \"trimmed \")c a n n a b i sf l o w e r s .T h eG M Pa r e ar e - quires appropriate clean room concepts. This represents an areaof tension in the manufacture of medicinal cannabis insofar asharvested and dried cannabis flowers always have an inherentmicrobial contamination, which at the same time represents acritical quality attribute. Supply systems: All supply systems (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, water, lighting, waste) must be adequately de-signed, qualified, and maintained. Hygiene concepts: Due to the inherent bioburden of cannabis, appropriate hygiene concepts must be established. Part of suchconcepts must also be the rooms as well as equipment and facili-ties, their cleaning, and equipment storage before and aftercleaning. Control strategy: The control strategy includes all measures that ensure quality and batch conformity required under GMP. Suffi-cient controls must be defined for this purpose. These include,among others, in-process and material controls, controls of envi-ronmental conditions, the control of cleaning, and the control ofprocesses. Process validation: The GMP manufacturing process is subject to validation according to the requirements of Annex 15 of the EU GMP Guide. Cleaning validation: The cleaning of surfaces in contact with the product and, where appropriate, rooms, must be validated. In thecase of cannabis flower production, this includes the drying facili-ties and rooms, machines used to clean (trim) the inflorescences,vessels used for bulk storage, and equipment used in packaging. Qualification: All equipment and instruments used in the GMP process must be qualified according to the requirements of Annex 15 of the EU GMP Guideline. If processes are computer-controlled 813Veit M. Quality Requirements | \u00a9 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. (e.g., drying), the GMP requirements for software and computer validation must be observed. To ensure qualification, life cycleconcepts are required that also depict maintenance and repairs. Analytical test methods (thin-layer chromatography, microscopy): In third countries, there is often no experience with microscopictests or thin-layer chromatographic test methods, which are wellestablished in Europe. The establishment of such test methods inthe third country can be associated with considerable effort, so that it may be necessary to forego the use of these methods in the release test for shipment. The corresponding tests are thencarried out downstream as part of the EU release. Analytical test methods and analytical method validation: It must be assumed that not only the manufacturing plants (possibly inthe third country) are inspected, but also external control labora-tories. This also applies if the external control laboratories are sub-ject to local GMP supervision and they are third countries with which mutual recognition agreements exist (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, USA), since herbal active substancesand/or medicinal products are not included in these agreements. Documentation and document management: GMP-compliant documentation must be ensured. All GMP documents must bemanaged and appropriate processes for the creation, approval,management, distribution, and archiving of documents must beestablished. In this context, many aspects of data integrity are also touched upon. Supplier qualification: All suppliers must be qualified. This also applies to all outsourced activities and often includes externaltesting facilities. All quality control and stability testing must becarried out in GMP-supervised testing facilities. Certificates: After a GMP inspection by an EU-competent au- thority, a certificate is issued to the inspected establishments, fa-cilities, or persons if the inspection has shown that the correspond- ing principles and guidelines are complied with. The period of va- lidity of the certificate shall not exceed 3 years and will be with-drawn if it subsequently becomes known that the requirementswere not met, and revoked if the requirements are no longer met.The certificates issued by the inspecting EU authorities in case ofsuccess are uploaded to the public GMDP database of the EMA. Good Distribution Practice (GDP) GDP is a GMP-analogous quality assurance system for the area of active pharmaceutical ingredient or medicinal product distribu-tion. It comprises the following aspects to be covered by the dis-tributors:requirements for the quality and risk management system requirements for instruments, rooms, transport vehicles, or containers and facilities requirements for personnel documentation requirements tasks of the person responsible for distribution appropriate procedures for handling complaints, returns, and recalls, as well as precautions to prevent counterfeiting outsourced activities transport requirements specific rules for intermediariesThe GDP requirements for active pharmaceutical ingredients [11] apply to the transport of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a(manufacturing facility or for the production of medicinal prod-ucts in the pharmacy. Trade in active ingredients in the EU internalmarket is subject to notification, i.e., pharmaceutical manufac-turers and pharmacies may only purchase active ingredients fromappropriately registered active ingredient distributors and mustcover the required GDP specifications in their quality assurance system. Additional obligations from national legislations on nar- cotics must be followed, which are not explained in detail here. In the event that authorities categorize cannabis and prepara- tions made from it as medicinal products, the GDP specificationsfor medicinal products apply [12]. These are mapped within theframework of the wholesale license that is then required. The manufacturing authorization for finished medicinal prod- ucts also includes the authorization to distribute the medicinal products it covers Manufacturers who also distribute their own products must therefore also comply with good distribution prac-tice. Quality Requirements for Cannabis Flowers General quality requirements for herbal drugs in Europe The herbal drug batch in question must be suitable for the in- tended use. This intended use is their further processing intopreparations or their use as starting material for the extraction ofingredients. The pharmaceutical quality of a drug batch is ensuredif it complies with the requirements of the European Pharmaco-poeia or the national pharmacopoeias of a member state of theCouncil of Europe (e.g., DAB and Ph. Helv.) or other EU national pharmacopoeias. If no corresponding requirements exist in a spe- cific case, the pharmaceutical manufacturer or distributor mustdraw up their own quality specifications. Relevant specificationsfor this can be found in the Ph. Eur. monograph \"Herbal drugs \" and in the guideline \"Test procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Herbal Substances, Herbal Preparations and Herbal MedicinalProducts/Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products \"[13]. In the monograph \"Herbal drugs \",o ft h eP h .E u r . ,t h ec r i t i c a l steps in drug production are mentioned in the section \"Produc- tion\"and appropriate procedures are required. Furthermore, the reference is also included here that when a decontaminatingtreatment has been used, it must be demonstrated that the con-stituents of the herbal drug are not affected and that no harmfulresidues remain. The use of ethylene oxide is prohibited for thedecontamination of herbal drugs. The following quality attributesare specified (references to the corresponding chapters of Ph. Eur. in brackets): Foreign matter (2.8.2): A test for foreign matter shall be carried out unless otherwise specified or except in justified and approvedcases. The content of foreign matter shall not exceed 2% (m/m)unless otherwise specified or except in justified and approvedcases. Appropriate specific testing of a dried herbal drug may berequired to exclude possible adulteration. Loss on drying (2.2.32): The determination shall be carried out unless otherwise prescribed or justified and authorized. 814Veit M. Quality Requirements for rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Water (2.2.13): For dried herbal drugs with a high essential oil content, a determination of the water content may be carriedout instead of a determination of the loss on drying. This is rele-vant for cannabis. Ash (2.4.16) and hydrochloric acid insoluble ash (2.8.1): The de- termination serves in particular to detect mineral impurities. Inthe case of cannabis flowers, this is of little relevance, as mineralimpurities do not play a role. Thus, with appropriate justification these tests might be omitted. Pesticide residues (2.8.13): Dried herbal drugs shall comply with the requirements of the test. The requirements take into accountthe type of plant, the preparation for which the plant is intended,if necessary and, if information is available, full documentation onthe treatment of the batch. The mandatory scope of testing for pesticides in the EU and Switzerland is given in Ph. Eur. monograph 2.8.13. As cannabis cultivation is carried out under strict application of the GACP rules, the scope of testing can be limited to the pesticides thatare actually used and documented. Not all limits for pesticides inherbal drugs are specified in the Ph. Eur.; thus, the requirementsof Regulation 396/2005/EC with all its annexes and updates areadditionally applicable. If a certain pesticide is not listed thereeither, a corresponding acceptable limit value must be calculatedvia the acceptable daily intake (ADI). In order to obtain a meaning- ful result, sampling and sample preparation are at least as impor- tant as the actual determination. Sampling must be carried outaccording to the specifications of Ph. Eur. m onograph 2.8.20. In the food sector, standardized procedures for sample preparationhave been developed and published for all conceivable situations.In Ph. Eur. monograph 2.8.13, reference is made to the validatedanalytical methods of the EU ( \"Quality control procedures for pes- ticides residues analysis \"), namely to document N\u00b0 SANCO/ 10232/2006 and subsequent revisions of this document, sented by document N\u00b0 SANTE/11312/2021 (implemented on01.01.2022) [14]. Heavy (2.4.27): Unless otherwise specified in the individ- ual monograph or ex cept in justified and authorized cases, the fol- lowing limits apply:cadmium: maximum 1.0 ppm lead: maximum 5.0 ppm mercury: maximum 0.1 ppm If necessary, limit values for other heavy metals may be specified. If needed, dried herbal drugs must comply with further tests. Relevant for cannabis flowers are: Aflatoxins (2.8.18) and other mycotoxins: The Ph. Eur. mono- graph \"Herbal drugs \"indicates that the establishment of a limit may be necessary, in particular for aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin B. Determining whether a test is needed must be based on a risk as- sessment and on experience with batch results available. As can-nabis is known for possible contamination with mycotoxins, afla-toxins and ochratoxin A should be tested. In the risk assessment,the type of drying and the residual water content or water activityalso play an essential role; if the water content is below 10% andthe drying process guarantees a fast and homogeneous drying ofthe plant material, a low risk can be assumed. If this low risk is re- flected in the respective batch results, skip testing might be used.When assessing the risk of contamination, the determination of water activity can also provide valuable data. The generallyaccepted limit below which germ growth is very unlikely isa w= 0.60. Because of their special risk potential, there is a whole series of national regulations specifically for aflatoxin contamination, in ad-dition to the pharmacopoeia, with the aim of establishing limitsfor food. According to Ph. Eur. monograph 2.8.18, a limit value of 2 mg/kg applies to aflatoxin B1 for herbal drugs. In addition, it is stated that the total am ount of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 can be set at 4 mg/kg by the authorities. Herbal drugs that may becontaminated by aflatoxins must be tested by a validated method.The method described in the Ph. Eur. has been shown to be suit-able for devil s claw root, ginger, and senna and is given as an ex- ample. Its suitability for other herbal drugs, including cannabisflowers, must be demonstrated, or a different validated method must be used. Sampling should be carried out according to mono- graph 2.8.20 of Ph. Eur. If the herbal drugs are used for the pro-duction of preparations, e.g., extracts, the test is usually not onlycarried out on the herbal drugs used for extraction only. Due tothe formation of nests, which cannot be detected with reasonableeffort during a sampling procedure, it may be necessary to per-form this test on the extract as well. Microbial contamination: In the case of dried herbal drugs that are part of a medicinal product in whole, cut, or powdered form, microbial contamination must be controlled (5.1.8. Microbiologi-cal quality of herbal medicinal products for oral use and extractsused in their preparation, or 5.1.4. Microbiological quality ofnon-sterile pharmaceutical preparations and substances for phar-maceutical use (e.g., for cutaneous use). Fumigants: Treatment with ethylene oxide is not allowed in EU member states. This is also stated in the Ph. Eur. monograph \"Herbal drugs \". If other fumigants are used, appropriate residue studies must be carried out. Overall, the \"Reflection paper on the use of fumigants \"of the HMPC (EMEA/HMPC/125562/2006) [15] should be taken into a ccount. Specific Quality Requirements for Cannabis Flowers in Europe The specific quality requirements in Europe result from the mono- graphs of the German Pharmacopoeia (DAB 2020), the SwissPharmacopoeia (Ph. Helv.) and requirements defined by theDanish [16] and Dutch cannabis authorities [17]. In the lattercase, this is a testing regulation for the varieties traded in theNetherlands. There is also a rather extensive monograph by theWHO [18]. A panel of the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) has also prepared a commentary-like publication with numerous details [19], and draft monographs for the USP have been pub-lished in the Pharmacopoeial Forum [20]. In EU member stateswhere no national specifications exist, the DAB monograph is fre-quently used for the definition of quality requirements. The definition provided in the DAB is: \"Whole or cut dried flow- ering growing tips of female plants of Cannabis sativa L. (Can- nabaceae). | \u00a9 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Content : 90.0 per cent to 110.0 per cent of the declared amount of cannabinoids, such as 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, and cannabinoid-carboxylic acids, such as 9-tetra- hydrocannabinolic acid and cannabidiolic acid, as 9- tetrahydrocannabinol (C 21H30O2;M r314.5) or cannabidiol (C21H30O2;Mr314.5), based on the dried drug. \" The definition in the DAB approximately corresponds to that in the Ph. Helv.; in the Danish monograph a content corridor of 80.0 to 100.0% is given for THCA/THC and CB DA/CBD; in the Dutch monograph and the WHO monograph defined content rangesare missing. Identification The identification is carried out by a combination of microscopy,thin-layer chromatography and color reactions. Microscopic examination: DAB, Ph. Helv. and the Danish monograph contain detailed macroscopic and microscopic de- scriptions, which allow clear identification of the drugs and arealso suitable for detecting adulterations. The latter, however, areof little importance, as medicinal cannabis must always comefrom controlled cultivation. A comprehensive description of mac-roscopic and microscopic characteristics can also be found in theUSP publication. Thin-layer chromatographic determinations: Identical thin- layer chromatographic included in the DAB and Ph. Helv. monographs. These are separations on RP phases;detection is with vanillin reagent. They focus on the identificationof the bands for THC and CBD and do not represent fingerprints,not least because the extraction is not exhaustive. The use of THCacid and CBD as reference substances has proven to be problem-atic from the pharmacies point of view in this thin-layer chroma- tographic test. Procurement is difficult and cost-intensive in prac- tice. For this reason, in October 2018, the German Medicines Codex (DAC/NRF) [21] published an alternative test method moresuitable for pharmacy practice, the advantage of which resultsfrom the use of Rf-marker substances (menthol and bornyl ace-tate) instead of the reference substances. However, this methodcan only be used for THC-type flowers. Other tests for THC basedon color reactions and immune assays are available [22], whichcan be used in addition, or alone if sufficiently selective. For CBD- type flowers, a TLC test is currently standard, although here, too, ELISA-based tests have meanwhile come to market. The Dutchmonograph describes a TLC on normal phase, followed by detec-tion using fast blue salt. Fast blue salt, however, should no longerbe used as a detection reagent because of its toxicity. In none ofthe monographs is an HPTLC method described, although itwould be obvious to use one in everyday pharmacy. Details of anHPTLC method that actually also enables a fingerprint and with which individual chemotypes and cultivars can be distinguished can be found in the USP publication. In the Danish monograph, a UHPLC DAD fingerprint (ultra- high-performance liquid chromatographic-diode array required to detect THCA/THC and CBDA/CBD. As an additionalcriterion, a comparison of the online UV spectra with the respec-tive reference standards is required. Color reactions and immunoassays: There are a number of color reactions that are specific for cannabinoids and are also ap-plied for forensic identification (p-dimethylaminobenzaldehydes, DMAB; true blue salt B and Duquenois or Duquenois-Levine reac-tion) [22]. In addition, more and more specific immunoassays forcannabinoids are available, which are used in various commercialrapid tests. For identification testing in the pharmacy as incomingtesting, immunoassays with test strips or kits with color reactionsfrom qualified suppliers (with corresponding proof of validation)can replace the TLC test. Purity The purity tests listed above generally applicable for herbal drugsare also binding for cannabis flowers, according to the Ph. Eur.Specific requirements exist in the monographs for the followingparameters: Foreign matter (2.8.2): Not more than 2% (DAB, Ph. Helv., Danish monograph) Loss on drying (2.2.32): Not more than 10% (DAB), not more than 15% (Ph. Helv.) Ash (2.4.16): Maximum 20% (Danish monograph)Heavy metals (2.4.27): As specified in the monograph \"Herbal drugs \". In the Dutch test guideline, limit values deviating from Ph. Eur. are found. Water (2.2.13): Not more than 10% (Danish monograph, as an alternative to Ph. Eur. 2.2.32) Loss on drying (2.2.32): Maximum 10 per cent (DAB, Danish monograph), maximum 15 per cent (Ph. Helv.). Pesticides (2.8.13): As specified in the monograph \"Herbal drugs \". As cannabis flowers for medicinal purposes are always ob- tained under controlled conditions, it is possible to limit the scopeof testing to the pesticides used in cultivation. Aflatoxins (2.8.18): As specified in the monograph \"Herbal drugs \". Microbiological quality The monographs do not contain specific requirements for micro- biological quality. The Danish monograph states that, dependingon the route of administration, the requirements of Ph. Eur.monographs 5.1.4 or 5.1.8 must be met. If cannabis flowers aredispensed in pharmacies for oral use, and this is done by preparinga decoction, only in this case is it possible to specify the microbio- logical quality of such flowers. This would be based on category A of monograph 5.1.8 of Ph. Eur., as a treatment resulting in a germreduction takes place during application. Monograph 5.1.8 strictlyapplies to oral herbal medicinal products only. However, cannabisflowers are often administered as vape or smoke, which is also as-sociated with germ reduction. In the absence of specific require-ments for this application, some authorities now require compli-ance with the requirements of the category \"inhalation products according to Ph. Eur. monograph 5.1.4 (special requirements ap- ply to liquid preparations for nebulization) \". These are the strict- est requirements that exist for non-sterile medicinal products be-cause the aerosols depicted in this monograph are associated witha high risk due to their direct entry into the respiratory tract andthe lungs. However, due to the heat-induced germ reduction, thisrisk does not exist in this form when cannabis flowers are admin-istered as vape or smoke, so that this requirement is not appropri- ate. This is especially important because the strict microbiological 816Veit M. Quality Requirements rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. requirements for medicinal products to be administered by inha- lation can usually only be met by treating the cannabis flowerswith gamma-radiation. For such treatments, specific rules exist insome EU member states. In Germany, for example, a formal au-thorization is needed for such a treatment. Applications must besubmitted by the person placing the product on the market. Thisleads to the paradoxical situation that each importer has to sub-mit an independent application, even if identical varieties coming from the same producer are imported. An interesting constella- tion in Germany arises in the administrative area of the Govern-ment of Upper Bavaria, where cannabis flowers are classified asactive substances, while in other parts of Germany local author-ities classify cannabis flowers as a(n) (intermediate) medicinalproduct. Only for the latter case is the authorization needed.Apart from the administrative effort associated with irradiation,the authorities accept the risk that the irradiation of the flowers may lead to changes that negatively influence the risk-benefit ra- tio. In a multi-substance mixture, such as in cannabis flowers, it isimpossible to definitely ascertain whether radiolysis products donot have an influence on efficacy and/or safety, and whether thedata to be generated in the context of the irradiation authoriza-tion are actually representative. The m onograph \"Pharmaceutical preparations non-sterile pharmaceutical prepara- measures are taken to ensure the microbiolog- ical quality of the preparation. Recommendations in this respectare given in General Texts 5.1.4 'Microbiological quality of non- sterile pharmaceutical preparations and of substances for phar-maceutical use , and 5.1.8 'Microbiological quality of herbal me- dicinal products for oral use and of extracts for their prepara-tion .\"Accordingly, these are strictly spoken binding specifica- tions, but recommendations. It is therefore up to the manufac- turer or distributor to set appropriate specifications for cannabis flowers, which may not require irradiation of the flowers. The lim-its of category B of Ph. Eur. chapter 5.1.8. seem appropriate forthis purpose. However, the risk of contamination with Aspergillus spp. should be considered. Inhalation of cannabis contaminatedwith Aspergillus spp. can have serious effects, if the germs are not killed, especially in immunocompromised patients [23]. It is to behoped that with the development of a m onograph for cannabis flowers in the European Pharmacopoeia, the requirements for mi- crobiological quality will also be adequately defined and thus aproper handling of this quality attribute can be achieved. It is un-disputed that the microbiological quality should be optimized byappropriate measures during cultivation, processing, and storage,as well as by the selection of suitable packaging materials andtransport conditions. This also corresponds to the requirementsof the \"Reflection paper on microbiological aspects of herbal me- dicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products \"[24]. Degradation products Cannabinol: Not more than 1.0% (DAB 2020; Ph. Helv.). Cannabi- nol is the main degradation product of THC. The cannabinol con-tent correlates with the degradation of THC in the flowers. It isthus also an indirect quality attribute that gives indications of ap-propriate processing, packaging, and storage of cannabis flowers.Assay The content of the target cannabinoids 9 -THC and CBD is deter- mined by HPLC or UHPLC. The methods described in the variousmonographs differ with regard to the specified columns and gra-dients, and sometimes also with regard to the mobile phasesused. It is not uncommon for testing laboratories to use in-housemethods that have been optimized and cross-validated with theDAB or Ph. Helv. method. As a rule, the content of cannabis flow- ers is determined without a complete decarboxylation of the pure acids in the course of sample preparation. Therefore, the sums ofCBDA/CBD and/or THCA/THC are evaluated. In the DAB mono-graph, three types distinguished: THC >> inAnnex 3 volatile terpenoids is methods can also be used for finger- print analysis. They are therefore very well suited to distinguish orcharacterize individual cultivars. Stability The processing of cannabis flowers has an influence on the poten- tial degradation of cannabinoids that should not be underesti- mated. In intact glandular hairs, these are well protected fromoxidative degradation as accumulation structures. The same ap-plies to the loss of terpenoids. Therefore, during processing, careshould be taken to ensure that the glandular hairs remain as intactas possible. Appropriate measures must therefore be taken to en-sure sufficient transport and storage stability. As a first step, the cannabinoid acids genuinely contained in the cannabis flowers can decarboxylate. This process depends on light and temperature. In dried drugs, 10 to 20% of the THCA isdecarboxylated. When stored at up to 25 \u00b0C, this proportionhardly increases [25]. Above 50 \u00b0C, the acids are completely decar-boxylated within a few hours. For medicinal cannabis, the decom-position of the cannabinoid acids is of little relevance, as the phar-macological activity comes from the decarboxylated cannabi-noids. The oxidative degradation of THC can be prevented or at least slowed by protection from atmospheric oxygen. This can be achieved, for example, by using suitable packaging materials aswell as transport and storage under protective gas. Oxidative deg-radation is thermodynamically controlled and slows down at lowstorage temperatures. The latter also slow down microbial growthand thus prevent secondary contamination of the dried cannabisflowers. However, storage temperatures at or below freezingpoint should be avoided, as the glandular hairs as accumulation structures are then destroyed, which may expose the cannabi- noids accumulated there to oxygen, which may result in increaseddegradation of THC. The same applies if dried cannabis flowersare stored too dry. Ideal storage conditions range between 55%and 62% relative humidity, which avoids drying out and brittle-ness of the glandular hairs. The water content, or better the wateractivity, also plays a decisive role in preventing secondary micro-bial growth; it should not exceed a w= 0.6. There is a method of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM method 817Veit M. Quality Requirements | \u00a9 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. no. D8196) [26] for determination. For the theory of the determi- nation and for practical aspects, please refer to the new USP chap-ters <922> and <1112>. Within the framework of the stability testing, all quality attrib- utes that can change during transport and storage should betested:content of the target cannabinoids cannabinol content microbiological quality water content water activity mycotoxins (at least at the end of the stability studies) and, if applicable, chromatographic fingerprints. Stability studies must be conducted strain-specifically. In the DAB monograph, astorage temperature below 25 \u00b0C is specified. The Ph. Helv. con- tains no specification in this regard. Based on the data obtained from the stability studies, a shelf life and, if necessary, a use-byperiod after opening, as well as suitable storage conditions, mustbe determined. Sampling In the qualitative and quantitative analysis of a batch of herbaldrugs to be tested, the composition of the sample used must be ensured to be representative for this batch, so that the sampling procedure used has as little effect as possible on the test results.This is a particular challenge for cannabis flowers, as the flowers orparts of the inflorescences are obtained as whole herbal drugs andare only crushed immediately before use, if necessary. Also, whentaking samples for validation of the manufacturing process (incl.drying) and for stability studies, it must be carefully evaluatedwhether the intended sampling leads to representative samples. These basic requirements are defined in Ph. Eur. chapter 2.8.20 \"Herbal drugs: sampling and sample preparation \". There, possible procedures for obtaining bulk samples are described, which repre-sent the minimum requirements for the sampling of herbal drugs: If the external inspection of the containers, markings, and la- bels of the batch shows that it can be assumed to be homoge-neous, sampling is carried out depending on the number of con-tainers, with the resulting number of containers then to be se- lected at random. In the case of larger containers, sampling is car- ried out at the bottom, in the middle, and at the top, and in thecase of bags in the middle. The minimum total mass to be takenis specified as a function of the mass of herbal drug per container,and a minimum mass of the samples is defined as a function of thesize of the drug batch. If a batch cannot be assumed to be homo-geneous (which might be the case for cannabis), it shall be dividedinto sub-batches, each as homogeneous as possible. Each sub- batch shall be treated as a homogeneous batch and samples shall be taken from at least the number of randomly selected contain-ers specified in Ph. Eur. This approach is hardly feasible for canna-bis flowers, as it can rarely be assumed that batches or even sub-batches are \"homogeneous \". Due to the high costs, increasing the number of samples and/or quantity is also not an option. Aminimum sample quantity of 20 g/kg batch size (2%) must beconsidered. It must therefore be decided on a case-by-case basis how representative samples can be obtained -ideally, based onvalidation data on batch homogeneity. In this context, samples for the determination of pesticides, aflatoxins and microbiologicalquality are particularly critical, as is the obtaining of representa-tive samples in the context of stability studies. It must always betaken into account that the variability of test results depends notonly on batch variability, but also on the quality attributes exam-ined in each case. Samples for the determination of pesticides, aflatoxins PAs and microbiological quality are particularly critical, as is the obtaining of representative samples in the context of stability studies. Itmust always be taken into account that the variability of test re-sults depends not only on batch variability, but also on the qualityattributes examined in each case. Sampling should be in accor- dance with Commission Regulation 401/2006/EC. The samples are to be combined in such a way that, ideally, several representative sub-samples are obtained. With these, it can be assessed during analysis to which extent the sampling was representative. During sample preparation and comminution,the instability of THC must always be taken into account; gr ound or powdered samples must be processed immediately and shouldnot be stored. Further information can be found in the ASTM guideline (No. D8334) \"Standard Practice for Sampling of Cannabis/Hemp Post- Harvest Batches for Laboratory Analyses \"[27]. General Quality Requirements for Herbal Preparations in Europe For herbal preparations, the Ph. Eur. contains the general mono- graph \"Herbal drug preparations \". They are defined as follows: \"Herbal drug preparations are homogeneous products obtained by subjecting herbal drugs to treatments such as extraction, distil- lation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration, orfermentation. \"In the case of medicinal cannabis and respective products purified ( \"trimmed \") cannabis flowers and cannabis ex- tracts are used as herbal preparations. For the extracts the Ph. Eur.contains a distinct monograph \"Extracts from herbal drugs \",i n which the following definition is provided: \"Herbal drug extracts are liquid (liquid extraction preparations), semi-solid (soft ex- tracts and oleoresins) or solid (dry extracts) preparations obtained from herbal drugs using suitable solvents. An extract is essentiallydefined by the quality of the herbal drug, by its production pro-cess (extraction solvent(s), method of processing, etc.) and by itsspecifications. \"Different types of extracts can be distinguished: Standardized extracts are adjusted to a defined content of one or more constituents with known therapeutic activity. This isachieved by adjustment of the extract with inert excipients or by blending batches of the extract. Quantified extracts are adjusted to one or more active markers, the content of which is controlled within a limited,specified range. Adjustments are made by blending batchesof the extract. Other extracts are not adjusted to a particular content of con- stituents. For control purposes, one or more constituents areused as analytical markers. The minimum content for these analytical markers is given in an individual monograph. 818Veit M. Quality Requirements rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Cannabis extracts are usually liquid extracts that are adjusted to a certain content of cannabinoids (so far THC and CBD) and there-fore belong to the group of standardized (= adjusted) extracts.The standardization, i.e., the adjustment to the specified content,is done by adding inert excipients. In the case of cannabis ex-tracts, medium-chain triglycerides are often used for this pur-pose, or the adjustment is made by mixing several (specification-compliant) batches of the native extracts. The deviation from the adjusted content to be specified corresponds to \u00b1 5% of the per- missible deviation for chemically-synthesized active substances. In the monograph \"Herbal drug extracts \", under the section \"Manufacture \", the critical points in the manufacture of extracts and requirements for the materials used in the process, includingthe herbal drugs used in the manufacture, are presented in anoverview. For example, the herbal drugs, solvents, and other ma-terials used in the manufacture of extracts must be of suitable quality and, where applicable, must comply with the require- ments of the relevant monographs of the European Pharmaco-poeia. In justified cases, herbal drugs used for the preparation ofextracts may exceed the limits for heavy metals laid down in themonograph \"Herbal drugs \", provided that the extract prepared therefrom complies with the test for heavy metals. This conceptcould be also applied to other requirements for the testing of con-taminants. Prior to extraction, different batches of the herbal drug, meet- ing the requirements of the relevant monograph or, in the ab-sence of a single monograph, appropriate specifications, may bemixed. This may be necessary, for example, to obtain the amountof drug required for the production process or, in the case of stan-dardized and quantified extracts, to ensure that the content ofone or more constituents of the herbal drug to be extracted lieswithin a certain range. The herbal drug may also be subjected to a pre-treatment, it may be comminuted or defatted, or certain enzymes may be inactivated. In addition, unwanted ingredients(e.g., toxic ingredients) or undesirable components (e.g., insolu-ble components) may be removed at an appropriate stage of themanufacturing process. Solvents already used in the productionprocess and subsequently recovered or recycled may be reused,provided that the recovery processes are controlled and moni-tored to ensure that the solvents meet appropriate specifications before being reused or mixed with other approved materials. Water for the preparation of extracts shall comply with the Ph.Eur. monograph \"Water for the preparation of extracts \". If appli- cable, extraction liquids (miscella) are thickened to the desiredconsistency using appropriate methods, usually under reducedpressure and at a temperature that minimizes the degradation ofthe ingredients. Essential oils that have been separated duringprocessing can be added back to the extract in a suitable manu- facturing step. This might be used to conserve terpenoids from cannabis, which can be lost in the course of the extraction and/or purification process. For technological r easons (for example, to simplify the drying process or to improve the homogeneity orconsistency of the extract), suitable excipients may be added atvarious stages of the manufacturing process. Appropriate inertexcipients may also be added to adjusted extracts to adjust oneor more ingredients to a defined level. Suitable stabilizers, anti-oxidants, and antimicrobial preservatives may also be added in justified and authorized cases. Extraction with a particular solvent results in a typical distribu- tion pattern of extracted ingredients in the extract. During theproduction of adjusted and quantified extracts, purification pro-cedures that increase the content of these ingredients comparedto the expected values may be used; such extracts are referred toas\"purified \". In the case of preparations from cannabis flowers, this is achieved by adding excipients as \"modifiers \"or by distilling the volatile cannabinoids. The following quality attributes are relevant for herbal drug ex- tracts: Identity Identification testing is performed using suitable methods.According to the DAB and Ph. Eur., TLC is almost exclusively used to check the identity of extracts. Other chromatographic tech- niques or specific reactions might also be used. The chromato-grams obtained could be used as fingerprints. Purity Depending on the analytical results of the herbal drug used for ex-tract production and the manufacturing process used, testing ofthe extracts for the following contaminants may be necessary (reference to the respective Ph. Eur. chapters in brackets): Heavy metals (2.4.27): Determination is only carried out in ex- ceptional cases if there is a risk of accumulation. It is usually suffi-cient to determine heavy metals only in the herbal drug to be ex-tracted. If an extract is tested for heavy metal content, the limitslisted in the monograph \"Herbal drugs \"shall apply, unless other values are given in an appropriate extract monograph, and exceptin justified and authorized cases. Aflatoxins (2.8.18) and other mycotoxins: Testing is usually done on the herbal drugs used for extraction. Because of the for-mation of nests, which cannot be detected with reasonable effortin a sample draw, it may be necessary to perform this test on theextract as well. Aflatoxins are also heat stable and soluble in hy-droalcoholic solvents and lipophilic extractants. There is thereforea potential risk of carry-over of aflatoxins from the herbal druginto the herbal preparation or medicinal product, which could lead to the presence of higher aflatoxin concentrations in the herbal preparation or medicinal product. This risk should be fullyassessed by validating the extraction process of a herbal prepara-tion. Pesticide residues (2.8.13): Testing is usually done at the herb- al drug stage. As part of the development of a preparation, itshould be demonstrated that no enrichment occurs as a result ofthe manufacturing process. In the case of the lipophilic extraction agents used for cannabis, there is at least such a risk. If this is con- firmed, the permissible limits must be ensured to be compliedwith. The limits set for dried or fresh plants are also applied topreparations made from them, taking into account the drug-ex-tract ratio. In the Ph. Eur. corresponding calculation formulae aregiven in chapter 2.8.13. Testing for solvent residues: The solvents used for extraction cannot be completely removed during extract manufacture, at least not wit hout immense technical effort. Small residual 819Veit M. Quality Requirements | \u00a9 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. amounts remain in the extract. It must be ensured that the resid- ual quantity is harmless. ICH guidelines (ICH: International Confer-ence on Harmonisation) on limits for organic solvents in activesubstances and medicinal products stipulate the maximum per-missible quantities for active substances, excipients, and finishedproducts. The central guideline CPMP/ICH/283/95 [28] (based onthe ICH Q3 guidance) has been implemented in Ph. Eur. chapter5.4. For the manufacture of cannabis extracts, the solvents etha- nol, hexane, cyclohexane, and n-heptane are used. In principle, it is only necessary to test for such solvents that are used for extrac-tion or in other production steps. In Ph. Eur. chapter 2.4.24 ageneral method \"Identification and determination of solvent resi- dues \"is given. This is a headspace gas chromatography method. This method must be validated for the substance or product to betested. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids: For some years now, pyrrolizidine alka- loids (PAs) have played a major role as possible contaminants in herbal medicines. They originate as secondary substances fromvarious weeds, especially from the Asteraceae family and herefrom Senecio species. There are about 400 known substances, about half of which are hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic[29].Their content is limited in the EU to a maximum of 1.0 \u00b5g/day for herbal medicinal products for oral or cutaneous use overa maximum of 2 weeks for adults (50 kg b.w.), and to a maximum of 0.5 \u00b5g/day for herbal medicinal products for oral or cutaneous use over a maximum of 2 weeks for children (20 kg b.w.) as well aspregnant women and nursing mothers. In the case of medicinalcannabis, contamination with PAs hardly plays a role, as the plantsource material is obtained from strictly controlled cultivation,whereby weediness with PA-containing weeds can be avoided.However, it is not excluded that cannabis flowers from field culti-vation are also used for the production of THC-free preparations. For this reason, a risk assessment of possible contamination with PAs is always required. As a rule, this is carried out within theframework of a GACP audit. If, on the basis of the available data,it can be verifiably demonstrated that the content of PAs in themedicinal product is usually 0.1 \u00b5g/day, the risk is categorized as low. The classification in this category is acceptable if the mea-sured value is below this limit in 90% of the samples tested and nosample is above a value of 0.35 \u00b5g pyrrolizidine alkaloids related to the daily dose. For this category, only random sampling is re- quired. The specific level is to be derived from the available data.In the case of in-house cultures, testing may be dispensed with al-together. A new general chapter 2.8.26 of Ph. Eur. describing 28 target PAs is implemented in the 10th edition. It allows for the use ofany method consisting of chromatography coupled with MS/MSor high-resolution MS for the determination that meets the val- idation requirements specified in the chapter. In addition, it con- tains validation requirements that must be met to demonstratethat the suitability of the method remains valid during routineanalysis. Microbiological quality According to Ph. Eur. chapter 5.1.8, \"Extracts \"must generally meet the acceptance criteria of category B for herbal medicinal products. However, if it can be demonstrated that the manufac-turing process does not achieve a sufficient reduction in the num- ber of microorganisms to meet the category B criteria, the ex-tracts must meet the requirements for category C herbal medici-nal products. The recommended acceptance criteria apply to ex-tracts that are part of herbal medicinal products for oral use. Forextracts that are part of pharmaceutical preparations for anotherroute of administration, more stringent acceptance criteria maybe required in order for such preparations to meet the criteria for the applicable route of administration (see General Text in Ph. Eur. Chapter 5.1.4). Where a risk of contamination may arise in certaincases during the course of extract manufacture, additional micro-biological monitoring should be provided as in-process controlsfor each major sub-operation. Testing for microbiological purityis then also part of the purity testing of the final product. If ex-tracts are used for vaping issues discussed above regarding the re-quired microbial quality of flowers is relevant in analogy for these extracts, too. Assay The content of the target constituents in extracts must be deter- mined using an appropriate method. Today, HPLC and GC meth-ods are preferably used for content determination. The contentof cannabis extracts is usually determined for cannabinoids, espe-cially for CBD and THC. However, it is conceivable that based on pharmacological and/or clinical data, other cannabinoids or other constituents are also defined as target constituents; for example,terpenoids or flavonoids. In this context, the establishment ofcontent corridors for a quantified extract would also be conceiv-able. Stability Stability tests are carried out on extracts with a focus on the target constituents and with regard to all parameters that can change during transport and storage. For extracts, these are usually:content of the target constituents degradation products microbiological quality water content water activity, if applicable chromatographic fingerprints Chromatographic fingerprints are important, as herbal prepara- tions are considered in their entirety as an active substance andas a complex multi-component system. This also applies in thecase of standardized extracts; thus, the study is not focused solelyon the standardized target constituents. Stability studies shouldalways be conducted in a packaging material that is equally pro-tective as the product-specific primary packaging material, if the packing material used for commercial shipment cannot be used. Specific Requirements for Preparations from Cannabis in Europe A DAB monograph \"Cannabis extract, standardized \"has also been published for extracts. 820Veit M. Quality Requirements rights reserved.Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. The definition provided in the monograph is: \"The standard- ized is extract made from the whole or comminuted, dried shoottips of the flowering female plants of L. 2% (m/m) for the extract and 90 to110% of the label specified nominal content. Cannabidiol (CBD;C 21H30O2;Mr314.5): 90 to 110% of the nominal content given in the label. \"The monograph appears to be in need of revision: Cur- rently the monograph only covers extracts adjusted to a content of 1 to 25% THC. In the meantime, however, extracts are availablein Europe that contain less than 1% THC and are adjusted to theactive ingredient CBD (CBD extracts). There are also extracts avail-able with contents above 25% THC (refined THC extracts obtainedby distillation with up to 85% THC). Those extracts are not yet cov-ered by the DAB monograph. Moreover, it is unclear whether themonograph specifies an active substance or an intermediate medicinal product. It remains unclear how the content corridor of 90 to 110% of the label specified in the monograph for THCand CBD is to be understood. Since pharmacopoeial monographsalways depict shelf-life specifications, it can be understood as acontent specification for the shelf life. This, according to theHMPC guideline on specifications for herbal preparations [13],would imply that 95 to 105% as content specification would thenbe an appropriate release specification. A different picture emerges if the monograph is also applied to preparations catego- rized as (intermediate) medicinal products. Here, the amount ofactive substance in the medicinal product would have to be speci-fied in any case with a content corridor of 95 to 10%. Thus, formagistral preparations, this would for example imply that phar-macists need to perform normalization using the assay value pro-vided in the certificate if they use a cannabis extract. Further as-pects which should be addressing in a revision will be addressed for other requirements provided in the monograph. The DAB monograph contains the following requirements: Manufacture The extract is stated to be extracted by a suitable extraction pro-cess, preferably a CO 2extraction, and that the obtained extract is optionally refined and adjusted to the defined content by suitableexcipients, preferably with medium-chain triglycerides. It is un- clear why the definition focuses on CO 2extracts, which do not have sole market significance in Europe as ethanol is also fre-quently used for extraction. It should be mentioned that stan-dardization could generally not only be achieved by using inert ex-cipients but also by mixing batches having the same specification. Identification In the DAB, the identity test is carried out by thin-layer chroma- tography. In the current version of the monograph, the identifica- tion test provided is not suitable for detecting counterfeit extracts(artificially mixed from cannabinoids). Purity Cannabinol: Maximum 2.5%. This specification is illogical, as can-nabinol is a degradation product of THC. The limit should be re-lated to the THC content. Otherwise, different limits would result, depending on the THC content.Water (2.5.12): Not more than 0.5%. A determination accord- ing to Ph. Eur. chapter 2.5.32 instead of 2.5.12 seems more ap-propriate here because of the small amount of water to be deter-mined; if this is even a critical quality attribute at all, becausewater is often absent in cannabis extracts, as they are manufac-tured with extracting agents that do not contain water. In thiscontext, the limit of 0.5% stated in the DAB monograph is irrele-vant. This limit actually generically applies to dry extracts as de- scribed in the European Pharmacopoeia and does not necessarily make sense for the cannabis extracts that occur as fluid extracts. Solvent residues: The residues must comply with the specifica- tions according to Ph. Eur. chapter 5.4. In the case of extracts that are pure CBD or THC extracts, con- sideration must be given to how the residual contents for CBD orTHC are specified in each case, respectively. This can be done, forexample, by following the specification for related substances as it is done for chemically defined active substances. It must also be taken into account that THC or CBD content of less than 1% maystill have pharmacological activities specific to the respective can-nabinoid; this applies in particular to THC. In any case, for the re-spective limit provided for the minor of both cannabinoids, a cor-ridor of 90 to 110% is not appropriate and could be impossible tobe established as this would constitute a two-fold standardization. Assay The content is determined by means of HPLC. For preparations that are not yet covered by the DAB mono- graph, the scope of testing is to be determined individually andin-house specifications must be established. For extracts not cov-ered by the DAB monograph, other cannabinoids and/or addition-ally terpenoids might be specified. Stability Storage conditions are defined in the DAB m onograph: Tightly closed, protected from light, below 25 \u00b0C, preferably at 2 to 8 \u00b0C. In any case, product-specific stability studies have to be carried out according to the European guidelines. For cannabis, thiswould imply that any strains used for an extract must be consid-ered. At least a risk assessment should be performed, if differentstrains used for the manufacture of a particular extract could con- stitute differences in the stability of the target compounds. Based on these data, a product-specific storage temperature and eithera retest date if the cannabis extract is categorized as an activesubstance or an expiry date in the case of categorization as a(n)(intermediate) medicinal product must be established. For canna-bis extracts, the following quality attributes are tested in the con-text of stability studies:THC/CBD content (or further cannabinoids) cannabinol content (if relevant, further degradation products) microbiological quality water content, if relevant chromatographic fingerprints leachables, if relevant (for plastic primary packaging materials) The consideration of fingerprints is relevant because the stability of the entire extract must be demonstrated. The fingerprint chro- 821Veit M. Quality Requirements | \u00a9 2022. Thieme. All rights reserved. This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. matograms obtained in the course of the stability study must match the initial chromatograms obtained for batch release. This is also relevant for development, e.g., in the evaluation of suitable packaging materials, evaluation of antioxidants, or inves-tigations on the influence of decontamination treatments (e.g.,ionizing radiation). The investigation of fingerprints is certainlyalso required when the comprehensive characterization of a prep-aration is necessary, e.g., to ensure the traceability of prepara- tions in pharmacological and clinical investigations. When determining the shelf-life specification, a content corri- dor of 90 to 110% should ensure that the preparations in the phar-macy still contain at least 95% of the declared active substancecontent for THC and/or CBD when dispensed to the patient. If plastic primary packaging materials or closure systems are used, the risk of extractables and leachables must be assessed,and confirmatory data collected on these aspects as part of the stability studies, if applicable. In addition, the requirements defined in other monographs of the pharmacopoeia apply; for example, for certain dosage forms,if medicinal cannabis preparations are used as specific dosageforms. It is worth mentioning that there is no monograph yet forvaporization (or smoking) products as a dosage form. Perspective for the Future Frequently the clinical data published for medicinal cannabis arenot accompanied by a complete characterization of the prepara-tions used. As far as flowers and preparations made from them areconcerned, these are mixtures of many constituents, includingcannabinoids, terpenes, and possibly also flavonoids. It is by nomeans sufficient to determine only the THC and CBD content asquality attributes, as other constituents can also be involved in the pharmacological activity and clinical efficacy. Clinical data without complete phytochemical characterization are thus worth-less or at most hypothesis-generating; they cannot be used forthe authorisation of medicinal products. The \"no-label use \"of cannabis flowers and other prescription drugs dispensed as pharmacy formulations in Germany is today,at least to a large extent, not based on sufficiently robust pharma-cological and clinical data. Its usage can be assumed to be often empirical. In the case of cannabis flowers, this applies not only to the posology, but also to the individually prescribed cultivars andthe corresponding THC and CBD contents and their mixing ratio.The THC content of medicinal cannabis flowers available in Ger-many ranges between < 1% and 22%, and the CBD content rangesbetween < 0.1% and 10%. The administration of flowers as medic-inal cannabis is increasingly criticized, for which the following rea-sons can be given: The rates of transition into a decoction are variable and gener- ally poor (only about 10% of cannabinoids pass into tea). The preparation of a decoction (15 minutes boiling time) are difficult to integrate into the daily routine of the patient witha rational administration (several times a day). Exact dosing is not possible. This is particularly true when flow- ers are delivered in multi-dose containers but is also becausedecarboxylation is not always complete during tea preparation.There is an increasing number of cultivars, which is confusing for the doctor, and there is no clinical evidence for the individ-ual cultivars. In the cultivars, the composition of cannabinoids is not consis- tent and sometimes not stable. The prescription of the cultivars does not follow any rationale but is at best empirical and is probably more often based onavailability, rather than on the actual spectrum of constituents. In the event of shortages of individual cultivars, supply is (again empirically) switched to other cultivars. Smoking of cannabis flowers is not included in the list above, as it must be considered not appropriate for medicinal purposes. Thus,it can be anticipated that medicinal cannabis in the form of flow-ers will decline in popularity in prescriptions and will increasinglybe replaced by extracts, which will be formulated in suitable dos- age forms, such as liquids, solid oral dosage forms, and products for vaporization. In these products, a much better consistencyand dosing, and thus robust and reliable safety and efficacy, canbe achieved for the patient. Quality requirements of such prepa-rations, which are relevant for batch-to-batch consistency, shouldalso comprise appropriate fingerprints of cannabinoids. This mustbe reflected in the monographs, which are needed in the Euro-pean Pharmacopoeia, for cannabis flowers as an herbal drug used as starting material for extract preparation, and in a separate monograph for medicinal cannabis as well as for different typesof cannabis extracts. In this context, it would be helpful for micro-bial quality attributes for such products to be established if usedfor vaporization. Regarding the quality assurance concepts, thereis a need for an EU-wide harmonized approach clearly defining atwhich stages of manufacture of medicinal cannabis GACP, GMPPart II and GMP Part I is applicable and which criteria must be con- sidered for demarcation. Normally it ought to be the role of the herbal medicinal product committee at EMA in cooperation withthe quality working party and GMP/GDP inspectors group to de- fine such criteria.
