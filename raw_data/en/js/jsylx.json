Violet flame meditation is a visualization meditation technique that harnesses the power of the violet flame. Violet flame has various other names, including the \"Flame of Transmutation,\" \"Flame of Mercy,\" \"Flame of Freedom,\" and \"Flame of Forgiveness. The Violet flame is the powerful [symbol of the spiritual](https://www.theyoganomads.com/om-symbol-meaning/) fire of self-transformation. It is a sacred fire with transformative spiritual energy that can help us move through many obstacles and challenges. It is believed that violet flame can heal many issues, including physical ailments, strong negative emotions, negative thoughts, and even relationship problems. The Three Violet Flames The Violet Flame is a three-fold flame consisting of pink, blue and gold light. Each color of light has different healing properties. - Pink - The pink light is the divine feminine ray of energy, which relates to the right side of our brain and our heart. It manifests as a crystalline pink shade and possesses a power of unconditional love and nurturance. It has several qualities related to the [heart chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/heart-chakra/), such as compassion and understanding for all beings. - Blue - The blue light is the divine masculine ray of energy, which relates to the left side of our brain, the throat, and the heart. It manifests as a sapphire blue shade and links to desire, inner resolve, and inner power. It provides us the will to follow our life purpose and gain leadership over ourselves. - Gold - The gold light represents the merging and balancing of the divine feminine and masculine energy rays. It is connected to a higher power and higher states of consciousness. The Power Of Sacred Fire Fire is a source of light, heat, and protection. As an element, it can quickly transform something into a different state. This is why in many spiritual traditions, fire represents transformation. Moreover, several religions, such as Christianity and Judaism, see fire as a [symbol of divinity](http://websites.umich.edu/~umfandsf/symbolismproject/symbolism.html/F/fire.html). It is the only element that humans can produce ourselves. Because of this, it is believed to bridge the connection between humans and god, allowing us to receive the highest frequency we are capable of. The Healing Properties Of The Color Violet For centuries, color has been a powerful tool for changing our emotions and mood. Moreover, like everything else in the universe, each color operates on a specific frequency. The color violet is one of the highest vibrational frequencies and is associated with [spiritual healing](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakra-waist-beads/) and transformation. It is also linked to the [crown chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crown-chakra/) (Sahasrara), which is responsible for our development of conscious awareness and ability to connect to divine wisdom. Violet color promotes universal love and selflessness while enhancing our imagination and creativity. It is also known to help speed out our body's natural healing process. How Violet Flame Meditation Works Violet flame meditation works by transforming and purifying negative energy such as \"karma\" or energetic blockages in the [chakras](https://www.theyoganomads.com/integrate-chakras-yoga-class/). The violet flame can blaze through any electron and awaken the pure divinity within it. The violet flame burns all negative energy and transmutes the electron back to its original state of pure love. This changes the [body's vibratory rate and the frequency of the energy field](https://www.theyoganomads.com/energy-flow/). Thus, through violet flame meditation, healing occurs on an atomic level. It doesn't just have the [power to heal](https://www.theyoganomads.com/healing-affirmations-for-letting-go/) physical illness; it goes deeper, removing negative energies from the mental, emotional, causal, and psychic levels. The meditation technique harnesses the [healing energy](https://www.theyoganomads.com/chakra-books/) of violet flame by combining two of the most potent healing properties; color and sound. Benefits Of Violet Flame Meditation As mentioned, practicing violet flame meditation can benefit all aspects of our being, bringing positive changes to our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Here are some potential benefits of working with violet flame. It raises your vibration When our atoms contain negativity, we vibrate on a low vibration, attracting more negativity. Violet flame meditation transmutes this negativity into love, which raises our vibration, creates more positive energy, and improves our general well-being. It opens your heart The meditation technique helps to open the [heart chakra](https://www.theyoganomads.com/green-chakra/) and cultivate positive qualities such as self-love, compassion, and forgiveness. This has powerful healing properties for emotional and energy healing, allowing us to move past painful emotions, bad memories, [grief](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-for-grief/), and heartbreak. It promotes spiritual growth As a transformational energy, this meditation technique can help you cultivate a deeper connection to the divine wisdom within you. This allows you to tap into your true purpose, meet your most authentic self, and hear messages from your intuition. Because the violet flame can discover and draw up our wounds, you may initially feel worse when [practicing this meditation](https://www.theyoganomads.com/intention-meditation/). However, this is a sign that you are entering a growth period and are currently healing (either consciously or unconsciously) something that has been holding you back. How To Do Violet Flame Meditation During a violet flame meditation session, you use visualization techniques to envision a sphere of white light, which then transforms into powerful violet flames. In addition, you combine sound with this color imagery by speaking aloud a mantra/affirmation. Here is a step-by-step guide to how to do a violet flame meditation session: - Settle In First, find a quiet place where you will not be disturbed and sit comfortably with a straight spine. I recommend using a meditation pillow to elevate your hips and reduce tension in the back. Alternatively, you can sit with your back against the wall. Rest your hands on your thighs and turn your palms to face upwards, relaxing your shoulders away from your ears. Close your eyes and focus on your breath by bringing your awareness to your heart center as you breathe naturally. - Choose An Intention Before you start the meditation, think about what you need healing in your life, such as a physical ailment, emotional hurt, or spiritual imbalance. Take a few minutes to focus on this intention, creating an image of the desired result in your mind. - Open With A Mantra You can open with a short mantra to help your mind become calmer and more present. This could be as simple as chanting Om or any Sanskrit mantra that appeals to you, such as \"Om Mani Padme Hum.\" - Visualize A Sphere Of Light When you are feeling centered, begin the visualization. Imagine a sphere in the center of your body radiating flames of white light. See the white flames grow stronger and brighter with each breath, and feel the warmth of the fire within your body. Expand the white light with each breath until the flames have become a bright white sun larger than your body. See the [white light surrounding your energy](https://www.theyoganomads.com/white-light-meditation/)field, extending past your feet and your head. - Transform It Into A Violet Flame Bring your attention to the center of this white sun. Start to envision a small violet flame sparking from the center and gradually growing larger and larger. Watch how it slowly transforms the white sun into a vibrant violet color. Keeping your focus on the flame, repeat the affirmation: \"I AM the Violet Flame of presence, blazing and transforming whatever within me that needs to be healed.\" Repeat this multiple times until you feel the powerful energy rise within you. If you do not resonate with this affirmation, change the words to fit your specific intention better. - Send It To Your Intention Focusing on your intention, hold your hands open in front of you with palms facing outwards like you are pushing away your problem. Watch the violet flame radiate its light from your body through your hands towards the situation, seeing how the [negative energy transforms into positive](https://www.theyoganomads.com/negative-energy-cleansing/). - Dissolve The Fire Once you feel like your problem has fully dissolved, let the fire die down, getting smaller and smaller with every breath. Close with the same mantra you opened the meditation session with, and take a few moments to rest in the positive feelings of [inner peace](https://www.theyoganomads.com/yoga-shanti-meaning/)and serenity. Because the violet flame meditation is pretty comprehensive, I recommend first trying it as a guided meditation. This [short meditation](https://insighttimer.com/resonantmind/guided-meditations/violet-flame-meditation-instant-energy-shift) on Insight Timer is an excellent introduction to the violet flame, allowing you to experience an instant energy shift. This violet flame [cleansing meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0WDN67Ost8) on Youtube is another great one to try as it follows the process detailed above yet is just 9 minutes long. Using Violet Flame Meditation To Heal Others Violet flame meditation doesn't just have the power to heal our own problems and illnesses. We can also use this potent energy to send healing to others, either an individual person or the collective. To do this, [set your intention](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-intentions/), focusing on who you want to heal. For example, if you are thinking of a loved one, visualize their face in your mind or use a visual aid like a photo. If you want to send healing to the collective, bring to mind a particular world issue you want to heal, such as poverty or equality. Learning More About Violet Flame The violet flame is a potent energy that can be challenging to understand, especially if you are new to energy healing. Thus, if you want to deepen your understanding of violet flame to experience it on the deepest level possible, read [Violet Flame: Alchemy for Personal Change](https://www.amazon.com/Violet-Flame-Alchemy-Personal-Change/dp/1609882741?tag=theyoganomads-20). This book by Elizabeth Clare Prophet explains the mysteries of the violet flame in an easy-to-understand way. First, Elizabeth explores how ancient mystics and spiritual teachers in the East and West have harnessed this energy and explains how it works. She then gives practical techniques for tapping into the power, including visualization, mantras, prayers, and affirmations. Final Thoughts On Violet Flame Meditation The sacred fire of violet flame is a [powerful spiritual](https://www.theyoganomads.com/spiritual-affirmations/) energy that we can use to aid our healing and the healing of others. However, the benefits of violet flame meditation come with regular practice, so I recommend committing to this meditation technique every day for one month. To increase the chance of success, stick to the same intention for every session. "}
