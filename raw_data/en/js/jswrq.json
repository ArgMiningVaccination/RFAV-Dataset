Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting is the product of the interaction between alternative medicine and syncretistic local knowledge.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-14", "cleaned_text": "2017](#B9-religions-14-00910)). This paper mainly discusses the medical practice and transformation of Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting in the context of Chinese 1971](#B20-religions-14-00910)) during the last two centuries. In the strict sense, the term \"shamanism\" was only applied for denoting the technique of ecstasy among indigenous Siberians and Central Asians for achieving various spiritual powers ( [Eliade 1964, p. 4](#B11-religions-14-00910)), but was later also used to describe in a more general sense religious practices among Arctic peoples, American Indians, Australian Aborigines, and even some African groups. Since the Manchu-Tungus word \"aman\" was introduced to Europe, shamanism was treated as a \"unitary and homogenous\" religious practice of those \"primitive peoples\". Therefore, one should stop referring to \"shamanism\", and instead use the plural form \"shamanisms\", or use terms like 'shamanary' or 'shamanizing' ( [Bumochir 2014](#B7-religions-14-00910)). In other words, as some postmodern anthropologists have argued, \"shamanism\" does not \"exist\" but is a Western Orientalist ( [Said 1977](#B26-religions-14-00910)) concept for purposes of constructing versus primitive \"others\" ( Shirokogoroff points out the formula\u2014\"shamanism stimulated by Buddhism\" in his Psychomental Complex of the Tungus ( [Shirokogoroff 1935](#B32-religions-14-00910)). However, Berthold Laufer, as early as 1917, questioned the Indian etymology of \"shaman\" by noting that \"tungusian saman, aman, xaman, etc., Mongol aman, Turkish kam and xam, are close and inseparable allies grown and nourished on the soil of northern Asia,\u2014live witnesses for the great antiquity of the shamanistic form the term \"shaman\" originated from the Manchu-Tungus word \"aman\", which has the literal meaning of \"one who knows\". The Manchu verb \"amaranbi\" and the Mongolian verb \"samarakh\" both mean to ladle up a liquid and let it drop back, which is consistent with a shaman's practice to achieve various powers through trance or ecstatic experience ( [Banzarov 2013, p. 66](#B5-religions-14-00910)). The root of the word \"aman\" is \"am\", which is synonymous with the Mongolian word \"sam\", meaning to stir up a liquid and make it diluted ( [Buyanbatu 1985, pp. denoting a Jurchen witch doctor who has abilities and power similar to a deity, is recorded in the Chinese chronicle The Compiled History of the Northern League of the Three Dynasties from the Southern Song Dynasty as early as the twelfth century CE ( [Liu 1995](#B22-religions-14-00910)). Therefore, most Chinese scholars believe that the word \"shaman\" originates from the Jurchen language, and has been inherited by the Manchu-Tungus ethnic groups ( [Guo 2015](#B12-religions-14-00910)). I concur with Mircea Eliade's emphasis on the fact that \"southern influences have, indeed, modified and enriched Tungus shamanism\u2014but the latter is not a creation of Buddhism.\" ( [Eliade 1964, p. 498](#B11-religions-14-00910)) [Bumochir 2014](#B7-religions-14-00910)) argues \"b\u00f6ge m\u00f6rgul\" (shamanism) and \"b\u00f6ge-yin ashin\" (shamanic religion) are recent introductions and generally used to construct the institutionalized \"shamanism\". Since the 1980s, after the implementation of China's Reform and Opening-up policy, Inner Mongolian scholars have been using the words \"b\u00f6ge m\u00f6rgul\" (which literally means \"shaman praying\") and 1985](#B8-religions-14-00910); [Kh\u00fcrelsha et shamanism of \"Mongol b\u00f6ge-yin ashin\" (Mongolian ( native religion) or 'yuanshi zongjiao' ( healing in Inner Mongolia, previous studies mainly focus on its psychiatric healing practices, that is the stimulation of patients' mental states through rituals, on legitimizing shamanism as cognitive science ( [Caijilahu 2017](#B9-religions-14-00910); [Wurenqiqige 2008](#B38-religions-14-00910)), and even attempted to illustrate that shamanic healing belongs to the category of psychiatry ( [Seyin 2014](#B29-religions-14-00910)). However, little attention has been paid to its physiotherapeutic healing method of bone-setting. [Narangoa and Altanjula 2006](#B23-religions-14-00910)) analyzed the experience of bonesetters in the socio-economic context of Inner Mongolia today and attributed the success of their practices to the transformation from shamanic healing to scientific medicine. In addition, Saijirahu Buyanchogla ( [Saijirahu 2020](#B27-religions-14-00910)) argues that the revitalization of shamanism is due to the suffering of both individuals and the community from cultural tensions, tradition losses, and identity crises in modern Inner Mongolia. The effectiveness of these healing practices or rituals is why they have survived in Inner Mongolia as the world has been modernized. However, there is still a huge research niche regarding the healing practice and transformation of Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting in the context of Chinese state ideology. 2. Bone-Setting: Shamanic Healing or Intangible Culture? [Narangoa and Altanjula 2006](#B23-religions-14-00910)). Traditionally, the practice of Mongolian \"bariyachi\" (i.e., bone setters, literal meaning: \"one who holds\") is a distinct form of traditional healing by means of massage, using no equipment but just the ten fingers, in order to treat broken bones, sprained and dislocated joints, pulled muscles as well as mild concussion (or \"brain shaking\") ( [Atwood 2004, p. 35](#B2-religions-14-00910)). \"Bariyachi\" are legitimatized not by a license or a diploma but by \"having ancestors\" or \"possessing the feeling or bio-energy\" and their \"healing power\" is linked to a spiritual power, identified as a \"bariyachi\" ancestor and believed to follow through the fingers ( [Atwood 2004, p. 35](#B2-religions-14-00910); [Hruschaka 1998](#B13-religions-14-00910)). In other words, the healing knowledge of a \"bariyachi\" comes from an ancestral spirit (ongon), and \"bariyachi\" are chosen healers following the family tradition, without any medical training. However, unlike shamans who focus on psychiatric healing practices, bonesetters mainly treat physical illnesses, without entering a trance when performing rituals. [Jigemude 1997](#B16-religions-14-00910)). One view is that the history of Mongolian bone-setting is connected with Inner Asian nomadic culture. Inner Asian nomadic people, including Mongols, often suffer from bone injuries in their daily nomadic life, thus initiating bone-setting experiences ( [Wangqinzhabu 2005, p. 2](#B36-religions-14-00910)). According to the Biography of Suwu in The Book of Han, after Suwu was cut, the Xiongnu (Hunnu) doctor quickly dug a hole and filled it with hot ash, and put him on it and massaged his back to heal his wounds ( [Ban 1962, p. 2461](#B4-religions-14-00910)). In addition, Daniel J. Hruschka citing C.K. Dev, notes that \"the authors of the early Chinese Nei-jing which described the practice of baria zasal (bone-setting) were actually Mongolian, and Yondon Gombo's medical encyclopedia (the Four Tantras) mentions the Mongolian technique of setting bones\" ( [Hruschaka 1998](#B13-religions-14-00910)). Another view is that the history of bone setting can be traced back to the healing of war wounds in the 13th century. Bone injuries and war wounds during successive years of cavalry campaigns directly contributed to the development of Mongolian bone-setting ( [Jigemude 1997, p. 33](#B16-religions-14-00910)). According to The History of Yuan, in 1262 AD, a Mongolian general had an arrow wound, and doctors had to dissect two prisoners to detect the exact position of shoulder blades and successfully pull out the arrows ( [Song and Wang 1976, p. 3873](#B33-religions-14-00910)). The third view is that, Mongolian bone-setting \"has always been regarded as an indigenous skill, practiced especially by the shamans, who are heirs to the oldest religious traditions of the Mongols\" ( [Narangoa and Altanjula 2006](#B23-religions-14-00910)). However, there is insufficient historical evidence so far to prove the indigenous origins of Mongol bone-setting. Of course, the origin of bone-setting is a very important topic, but when we try to investigate the origin of bone-setting by using historical literature, it may be easy to ignore its transformation under the context of contemporary Inner Mongolian social culture and China's state ideology. [Bao 2015, pp. 75-79](#B6-religions-14-00910)). Since Naran Abai, Khorchin bone-setting healing practices have been passed down to the fifth generation present. As a hereditary shaman lineage, Naran Abai's descendants were all recognized as respected powerful shamans until the third generation, and their healing power was passed on to the next generations in traditional ways through special shamanic rituals on the day of the ancestral sacrifice on 2 December of the lunar calendar ( [Bao 2015, p. 86](#B6-religions-14-00910)). context, shamanism and bone-setting practices were banned. With the implementation of China's Reform and Opening-up policy in the 1980s, the revitalization of Shamanism in China is understood as a cultural rebound after religions were suppressed for a long time during the \"Cultural Revolution\" and other political campaigns ( [Seyin 2015](#B30-religions-14-00910)). Different from the shamanic practice of spiritual healing hidden in rural areas, the practice of bone-setting gradually moved from the countryside to the cities, with a growing trend of revival. However, the inheritance of supernatural powers via dreams or special shamanic rituals has not been \"politically correct\". [Kleinman 1980, pp. 63-65](#B18-religions-14-00910)), identifying themselves both as doctors and shamans. In the cities, their patients' ethnicities and backgrounds have also become much more diverse, from solely rural Mongolians to urban Mongolians, Han, Hui, and representatives of many other ethnic groups. The causes of patients' diseases in cities are also very different, with most patients suffering from various bone injuries caused by car accidents, sports games, and cervical syndromes caused by long-term office work. Moreover, the importance of the patients rate the bonesetters' identity versus their treatment methods depends on their ethnicities. Generally, Mongolian patients emphasize shamanic healing power, while patients of Han and other ethnic groups highly rate effective bone-setting skills. This can be seen in the words written by patients on the silk banners given by them to Buren, a Khorichin shaman bone-setter, who runs a private clinic in Hohhot. The Mongolian words embody the supernatural healing power of the Mongolian shaman, while the Chinese characters often highlight his effective bone-setting art () ( [Figure 1](#religions-14-00910-f001)). [Bao 2015, pp. 110-11](#B6-religions-14-00910)). This healing concept is fundamentally different from surgical therapy in modern medicine. [3](#fn003-religions-14-00910)Chinese President Xi Jinping has issued an important directive on the protection of intangible cultural heritage, stressing that \"we will do a solid job in systematically protecting intangible cultural heritage and promote Chinese culture to the world\" [4](#fn004-religions-14-00910). Therefore, the protection and development of intangible cultural heritage have become a linking bridge between folklorized religious culture and policies for the protection of the national culture. As a result, shamanism has turned from \"feudal superstition\" to the essence of traditional folk culture and became a national intangible cultural heritage. Various \"folk\" cultures and arts originating from shamanism have been included in China's national Intangible Cultural Heritage list, such as: in 2006, the Mongolian Andai dance, as a traditional folk dance, was included in the National Intangible Cultural Heritage list; the Ewenki shaman dance and the Manchu shaman mythology were included in that list in 2011. However, in Chinese state ideology, shamanism is not regarded as a religion, but as a folk belief, and related customs and arts are all categorized as traditional folk customs. According to China's National Religious Affairs Administration, there are five recognized religions in China: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism, and Christianity. [5](#fn005-religions-14-00910)Shamanism-related practices are classified as folk cultures and arts, not religious activities. For this reason, China's official Chinese Folk Literature and Art Association established the Chinese Shamanic Cultural Inheritance Base in 2005, aiming at the protection and promotion of excellent folk cultures and arts. [6](#fn006-religions-14-00910) The Khorchin Left Wing Rear Banner of Inner Mongolia has a long history and profound culture. Bone-setting, as a Mongolian medical therapy, is representative of the rich cultural heritage of the banner. The Mongolian people are horse-riding people, and often encounter bone injuries caused by falling off the horses. Mongolian bone-setting therapy came into being to heal bone-related injuries. Mongolian bone-setting therapy is an important symbol of Mongolian medical achievements, which is filled with the scientific spirit and cultural creativity of the Mongolian people. [7] [8](#fn008-religions-14-00910)Mongolian traditional medicine is an inseparable part of traditional Chinese medicine, which is recognized by the state. Bone-setting is listed as Mongolian traditional medicine, which is an important representative of Chinese medical cultural heritage. Notably, the statement includes nothing about the close relationship between Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting and shamanism. In the state's ideological discourse, shamanism, and cultural features, arts, and medicines, which derived from it, were seen as forms of witchcraft, rather than scientific rational practices. Therefore, Khorchin bone-setting is legitimized as Mongolian traditional medicine with a scientific basis. 3. Bone-Setting: Scientific Medicine or Traditional Medicine? [Narangoa and Altanjula 2006](#B23-religions-14-00910)). Despite the described socio-political background, the bone-setting practice kept playing an important role, especially in the rural areas of Inner Mongolia. [Bao 2015, p. 107](#B6-religions-14-00910)). In this context, the spiritual treatment of shamanism was not recognized by the state, while bone-setting has become an accepted practice. Due to its good therapeutic effect and no visible \"superstition\" in religious rituals, it was called scientific. [Seyin 2015](#B30-religions-14-00910)). Local scholars in Inner Mongolia regard shamanism as the native religion of the Mongolian nationality, and consider it as the \"national religion\" before the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia in the 16th century. In the 16th century, the Mongols converted to Tibetan Buddhism for the second time, which resulted in the combination of the Mongolian aristocracy and the Buddhist clergy. Since then, shamanism has suffered from the persecution of Tibetan Buddhism, and only the Khorchin shamans in eastern Inner Mongolia have survived and they gave shelter to many shamans who fled to the region ( [Kh\u00fcrelsha et al. 2018, p. 8](#B17-religions-14-00910)). Therefore, Khorchin shamanism is considered to be the \"legacy\" of the native religion of the Mongolian people. Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting, which derived from shamanism, is regarded as a valuable national and religious cultural heritage, as Bao Jinshan, a famous Khorchin bonesetter and \"master of Chinese medicine\" (), notes \"it is not from Tibet, nor Western Europe, but a unique therapy invented and developed by the Mongolian people\" ( [Bao 2015, p. 69](#B6-religions-14-00910)). [Bao 2015, p. 108](#B6-religions-14-00910)). Today, Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting is combined with various kinds of medical knowledge, is constantly breaking traditional healing methods, adapting to the rapidly changing market economy, and is coexisting with other medical systems in Inner Mongolian society. The most important features of these combinations are the following. [Bao 2015, pp. 126-28](#B6-religions-14-00910)). At present, the influence of modern medical technology can be seen everywhere in both private and public hospitals. For example, bonesetters use X-ray or Computed Tomography (CT) to make a more accurate diagnosis, apply disinfection methods to prevent inflammation of injured parts of the bone, and intravenous injection to promote recovery. Moreover, Khorchin bonesetters' blowing of distilled alcohol and manipulation massage is influenced by combining \"yin\" () and \"yang\" () energies in the traditional concept of Chinese Qigong. Bao Jinshan believes that the bone injury of the patients is \"hot\" () and hence falls under the category of \"yang\", while the blown-out alcohol is \"cold\" () and hence belongs to the category of \"yin\", which quickly reduces the swelling and provides the energy for healing the patients ( [Bao 2015, p. 146](#B6-religions-14-00910)). In addition, based on the theory of Tibetan medicine, he also improved the ancestral secret herbal prescriptions\u2014\"shurt-urel\" (literal meaning \"coral pill\") and \"nomin-urel\" (\"sutra pill\"). These two herbal medicines are widely used in bone-setting treatments, and, as clinically verified, the therapeutic effect of these two drugs is considered significantly better than that of other prescriptions. [9](#fn009-religions-14-00910)Khorchin Mongolian bone-setting has gradually turned from a shamanic healing practice to a comprehensive scientific medicine based on syncretistic knowledge of several different medical systems. [Saijirahu 2020](#B27-religions-14-00910)). In today's Inner Mongolia, bonesetters are recognized as Mongolian traditional medical practitioners rather than shamanic healers. This is closely related to China's medical policy. The Constitution of China stipulates that \"the state develops medical and health services, and supports modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.\" [10](#fn010-religions-14-00910)The Law on Traditional Chinese Medicine stresses that \"the state should vigorously develop traditional Chinese medicine, put equal emphasis on traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and make full use of traditional Chinese medicine in medical and health undertakings.\" [11](#fn011-religions-14-00910)The traditional medicine here refers to Chinese medicine, but includes also Tibetan medicine, Mongolian medicine, Uygur medicine, Dai medicine, and other traditional medicines of China's ethnic minorities. The State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China established the Chinese Association of Ethnic Medicine in 2007, \"to actively explore, organize and promote ethnic medicine, and make full use of its role in protecting the health of the people of all ethnic groups.\" [12](#fn012-religions-14-00910)The association has set up a Mongolian Medicine Committee under the auspices of the Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities in Khorchin District, aiming to inherit and protect the culture of traditional Mongolian medicine and promote the innovation and development of the Mongolian medicine industry. According to the Tongliao (a prefecture of Khorchin region) Mongolian Medicine Bone-setting Protection Regulations, issued in 2020, bone-setting is defined as traditional Mongolian medicine, which \"refers to the treatment with ethnic characteristics of various fractures, joint dislocation, soft tissue injury and a series of other diseases, passed down from generation to generation and regarded as part of Mongolian cultural heritage.\" [13](#fn013-religions-14-00910)The regulations completely ignore the relationship between bone-setting and shamanism. As mentioned above, in the official discourse, shamanism and its derived medical skills are regarded as a kind of witchcraft practice, without any scientific basis, and bone-setting is classified as traditional Mongolian medicine. In this context of the national medical policy, almost all bonesetters in public hospitals deliberately hide the influence of shamanism, calling themselves traditional Mongolian physicians. [Kh\u00fcrelsha et al. 2018, p. 49](#B17-religions-14-00910)). Later, the shamans who compromised with Buddhism were known as \"tsagaan z\u00fcgiin b\u00f6ge\" (white shamans). They borrowed Buddhist beliefs and practices to consolidate and increase their influence in the Mongolian regions. Since then, the rituals, deities, spiritual possession, and healing arts of Khorchin shamanism have been influenced by Buddhism and Tibetan medicine. Therefore, the home-based shaman bonesetter Goa and the private clinic shaman bonesetter Buren also claim themselves as traditional Mongolian medical practitioners, and see the Tibetan Medical Buddha (Sanskrit: Bhaiajya guru) as their patron saint ( [Figure 2](#religions-14-00910-f002)). [Yutuo Ningmayundungongbu 1983](#B39-religions-14-00910)). To have good health, one needs to maintain a balance between the humors and elements. These fundamental theories fully reflect the influence of Ayurveda, which includes the three Doshas (vata, pitta, kapha) and the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) from which the human body is composed ( [Liao 2002](#B21-religions-14-00910)). After the Tibetan Four Tantras spread in Mongolian regions, it became the main literary source of the theoretical system of traditional Mongolian medicine. Bone-setters believe that the theoretical basis of bone-setting is the tripartite theory, that is, \"khii\" (wind), \"shar\" (bile) and \"batgan\" (mucus), which are the three body humors that make up the physiological system and are constantly supplemented by the five elements\u2014water, fire, earth, wood, and space () and maintain the overall balance of the human body ( [Bao 2015, p. 122](#B6-religions-14-00910)). This is the explanation of bone-setting within the framework of the Indo-Tibetan-derived Mongolian traditional medical theory, highlighting it as traditional medicine instead of the mysterious shamanic healing. Therefore, it is natural for bonesetters to say that bone-setting is a traditional Mongolian medicine recognized by the state. In conclusion, Khorchin bone-setting is a traditional Mongolian medical practice, based on Mongolian and Tibetan medical theory, to manipulate bones back to their proper position, that is, a treatment pertaining to a \"return to nature\" (). 4.
