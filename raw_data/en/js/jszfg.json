Italicized words may have different meanings in the certificate than in general. Please check the \"Glossary\" sections for the meaning of the italicized words as they apply to your plan. The certificate gives you information about your plan. It tells you what is covered and what is not covered. It also tells you what you must do and how much you must pay for services. Your plan covers many services, but it is important to remember it has limits. Be sure to read your certificate carefully before using your benefits. Covered and non-covered expenses We will provide coverage for services, equipment and supplies that are covered expenses . All requirements of the master group contract apply to covered expenses . The date used on the bill we receive for covered expenses or the date confirmed in your medical records is the date that will be used when your claim is processed to determine the benefit period. You must pay the health care provider any amount due that we do not pay. Not all services and supplies are a covered expense , even when they are ordered by a health care practitioner . Refer to the \"Schedule of Benefits,\" the \"Covere d Expenses\" and the \"Limitations and Exclusions\" sections and any rider or amendment attached to the certificate to determine when services or supplies are covered expenses or non-covered expenses. Continuity of care Continuity of care means covered expenses received from a terminated provider would be paid at the network provider level of benefits as shown on your schedule of benefits. A terminated provider cannot balance bill you for any amount they could not have received if they were still under contract. You may continue to obtain treatment for the medical condition from the provider if: You are actively undergoing a medically necessary course of treatment; and You and the provider agree that continuity of care is desirable. Continuity of care is available for up to 120 days from the date of termination of the network provider's contract while receiving treatment of a covered expense . Continuity of care is available for the duration of a pregnancy including 45 days postpartum, or if the pregnancy does not end in delivery, the date the pregnancy ends, if you were receiving treatment at the time of the termination of the network provider's contract. Continuity of care is not available if the network provider's contract was terminated due to: Medical incompetence or professional misconduct; and UNDERSTANDING YOUR COVERAGE (continued) UYCNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C We did not enter into another contract with th e provider after the contract was terminated. How your master group contract works You may have to pay a deductible before we pay for certain covered expenses . If a deductible applies, and it is met, we will pay covered expenses at the coinsurance amount. Refer to the \"Schedule of Benefits\" to see when the deductible applies and the coinsurance amount we pay. You will be responsible for the coinsurance amount we do not pay. If an out-of-pocket limit applies and it is met, we will pay covered expenses at 100% the rest of the year, subject to the maximum allowable fee . Our payment for covered expenses is calculated by applying any deductible and coinsurance to the net charges. \"Net charges\" means the total amount billed by the qualified provider , less any amounts such as: Those negotiated by contract, directly or indirectly, between us and the qualified provider ; Those in excess of the maximum allowable fee ; or Adjustments related to our claims processing edits. The service and diagnostic information submitted on the qualified provider's bill will be used to determine which provision of the \"Schedule of Benefits\" applies. (This text will be used for NPOS products.) [Your choice of providers affects your benefits We will pay a higher percentage most of the time, if you see a network provider, so the amount you pay will be lower. You must pay any copayment , deductible or coinsurance to the network provider . Be sure to check if your qualified provider is a network provider before seeing them. We may appoint certain network providers for certain kinds of services. If you do not see the appointed network provider for these services, we may pay less. We will pay a lower percentage if you see a non-network provider , so the amount you pay will be higher. Non-network providers have not signed an agreement with us for lower costs for services and they may bill you for any amount over the maximum allowable fee . You will have to pay this amount and any copayment , deductible and coinsurance to the non-network provider . Any amount you pay over the maximum allowable fee will not apply to your deductible or any out-of-pocket limit . Some non-network providers work with network hospitals. We will apply the network provider copayment, deductible and coinsurance to covered expenses received by non-network pathologists, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and emergency room physicians working with network hospitals . However, you may still have to pay these non-network providers any amount over the maximum allowable fee . If possible, you may want to check if all health care providers working with network hospitals are network providers .

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS COBNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C This \"Coordination of Benefits\" (C OB) provision applies when a person has health care coverage under more than one plan. The order of benefit determin ation rules below determine which plan will pay as the primary plan . The primary plan pays first without regard to the possibility another plan may cover some expenses. A secondary plan pays after the primary plan and may reduce the benefits it pays so that payments from all plans do not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense . Definitions The following definitions are used exclusively in this provision. Plan means any of the following that provide benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment. However, if separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered part of the same plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. Plan includes: Group insurance, closed panel or other forms of group or group-type coverage (whether insured or uninsured); Hospital indemnity benefits in excess of $200 per day; Medical care components of group long-term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; Medicare or other governmental benef its, as permitted by law; and A state plan under Medicaid . Plan does not include: Individual or family insurance; Closed panel or other individual covera ge (except for group-type coverage); Hospital indemnity benefits of $200 or less per day; School accident type coverage; Benefits for non-medical care components of group long-term care contracts; Medicare supplement policies; and Coverage under other governmental plans, unless permitted by law. Each contract for coverage is a separate plan. If a plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate plan. Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary, fo r the purposes of COB, prescription drug coverage under this plan, will be considered a separate plan and will therefore only be coordinated with other prescription drug coverage. Primary/secondary means the order of benefit determination stating whether this plan is primary or secondary covering the person when compared to another plan also covering the person. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) COBNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C When this plan is primary , its benefits are determined before those of any other plan and without considering any other plan's benefits. When this plan is secondary , its benefits are determined after those of another plan and may be reduced because of the primary plan's benefits. Allowable expense means a health care service or expense, including deductibles, if any, and copayments, that is covered at least in part by any of the plans covering the person. When a plan provides benefits in the form of services (e.g. an HMO), the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an allowable expense and a benefit paid. An expense or ser vice that is not covered by any of the plans is not an allowable expense . The following are examples of expenses or services that are not allowable expenses : If a covered person is confined in a private hospital room, the difference between the cost of a semi- private room in the hospital and the private room, (unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is medically necessary in terms of generally accepted medical practice, or one of the plans routinely provides coverage for hospital private rooms) is not an allowable expense . If a person is covered by two or more plans that compute their benefits payments on the basis of usual and customary fees, any amount in excess of the highest usual and customary fees for a specific benefit is not an allowable expense . If a person is covered by two or more plans that provide benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, any amount in excess of the highest of the fees is not an allowable expense . If a person is covered by one plan that calculates its benefits or services on the basis of usual and customary fees and another plan that provides its benefits or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the primary plan's payment arrangement shall be the allowable expense for all plans . The amount a benefit is reduced by the primary plan because a covered person does not comply with the plan provisions. Examples of these provisions are second surgical opinions, precertification of admissions and preferred provider arrangements. Claim determination period means a calendar year. However, it does not include any part of a year during which a person has no coverage under this plan, or before the date this COB provision or a similar provision takes effect. Closed panel plan is a plan that provides health benefits to cove red persons primarily in the form of services through a panel of providers that has contracted with or are employed by the plan, and that limits or excludes benefits for services provided by other pr oviders, except in the cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. Custodial parent means a parent awarded custody by a court decree. In the absence of a court decree, it is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year without regard to any temporary visitation. Order of determination rules COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) COBNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C General When two or more plans pay benefits, the rules for determining the order of payment are as follows: The primary plan pays or provides its benefits as if the secondary plan or plans did not exist. A plan that does not contain a COB provision that is consistent with a pplicable promulgated regulation is always primary . There is one exception: coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplem ent a part of a basic package of benefits may provide that the supplementary coverage shall be excess to any other parts of the plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are superimposed over base plan hospital and surgical benefits, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a closed panel plan to provide out-of-network benefits. A plan may consider the benefits paid or provided by another plan in determining its benefits only when it is secondary to that other plan. Rules The first of the following rules that describes which plan pays its benefits before another plan is the rule to use. Non-dependent or dependent . The plan that covers the person other than as a dependent , for example as an employee , member, subscriber or retiree is primary and the plan that covers the person as a dependent is secondary . However, if the person is a Medicare beneficiary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the plan covering the person as a dependent ; and primary to the plan covering the person as other than a dependent (e.g. retired employee ); then the order of benefits between the two plans is reversed so that the plan covering the person as an employee , member, subscriber or retiree is secondary and the other plan is primary . Child covered under more than one plan. The order of benefits when a child is covered by more than one plan is: - The primary plan is the plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year if: - The parents are married; - The parents are not separated (whether or not they have been married); or - A court decree awards joint custody without specifying that one part has the responsibility to provide health care coverage. - If both the parents have the same birthday, the plan that covered either of the parents longer is primary . - If the specific terms of a court decree state that one parent is responsible for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) COBNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C that plan is primary . This rule applies to claim determination periods or plan years commencing after the plan is given notice of the court decree. - If the parents are not married, or are separated (whe ther or not they ever have been married) or are divorced, the order of benefits is: - The plan of the custodial parent ; - The plan of the spouse of the custodial parent ; - The plan of the non- custodial parent ; and then - The plan of the spouse of the non- custodial parent . Active or inactive employee . The plan that covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is primary . The same would hold true if a person is a dependent of a person covered as a retiree and an employee . If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Continuation coverage . If a person whose coverage is pr ovided under a right of continuation provided by federal or state la w also is covered under another plan, the plan covering the person as an employee , member, subscriber or retiree (or as that person's dependent ) is primary , and the continuation coverage is secondary . If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Longer or shorter length of coverage . The plan that covered the person as an employee , member, subscriber or retiree longer is primary . If the preceding rules do not determine the primary plan , the allowable expenses shall be shared equally between the plans meeting the definition of plan under this provision. In addition, this plan will not pay more that it would have had it been primary . Effects on the benefits of this plan When this plan is secondary , benefits may be reduced to the di fference between the allowable expense (determined by the primary plan ) and the benefits paid by any primary plan during the claim determination period . Payment from all plans will not exceed 100% of the total allowable expense . If a covered person is enrolled in two or more closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel provide r, benefits are not payable by one closed panel plan , COB shall not apply between that plan and the other closed panel plan . Right to receive and release needed information Certain facts about health care coverage and ser vices are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benefits payable under this plan and other plans . We may get the facts we need from or give them to other organizations or persons for the pur pose of applying these rules and determining benefits payable under this plan and other plans covering the person claiming benefits. We need not tell, or get COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (continued) COBNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this plan must give us any facts we need to apply those rules and determine benefits payable. Facility of payment A payment made under another plan may include an amount that should have been paid under this plan. If it does, we may pay that amount to the organization that made the payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this plan. We will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means a reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. Right of recovery If the amount of the payments made by us is more than we should have paid under this COB provision, we may recover the excess from one or more of the persons we have paid or for whom we have paid; or any other person or organization that may be respons ible for the benefits or services provided for the covered person . The \"amount of the payments made\" includ es the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS FOR MEDICARE ELIGIBLES COBME 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C General coordination of benefits with Medicare If you are covered under both Medicare and this certificate , federal law mandates that Medicare is the secondary plan in most situations. When perm itted by law, this plan is the secondary plan. In all cases, coordination of benefits with Medicare will conform to federal statutes and regulations. If you are enrolled in Medicare , your benefits under this certificate will be coordinated to the extent benefits are payable under Medicare , as allowed by federal statutes and regulations. You are considered to be eligible for Medicare on the earliest date coverage under Medicare could have become effective for you. Coordination of benefits with Medicare Part B If you are eligible for Medicare Part B , the Medicare program that provides medical insurance benefits, but are not enrolled, your benefits under the master group contract may be coordinated as if you were enrolled in Medicare Part B . We may not pay benefits to the extent that benefits would have been payable under Medicare Part B , if you had enrolled. Therefore, it is important that you enroll in Medicare Part B if you are eligible to do so. CLAIMS CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C Notice of claim Network providers will submit claims to us on your behalf. If you utilize a non- network provider for covered expenses, you must submit a notice of claim to us . Notice of claim must be given to us in writing or by electronic mail as requi red by your plan, or as soon as is reasonably possible thereafter. Notice must be sent to us at our mailing address shown on your identification documentation or at our Website at www.humana.com. Claims must be complete. At a minimum a claim must contai n: Name of the covered person who incurred the covered expenses; Name and address of the provider; Diagnosis; Procedure or nature of the treatment; Place of service; Date of service; and Billed amount. If you receive services outside the United States or from a foreign provider, you must also submit the following information along with your complete claim: Your proof of payment to the provider for the services received outside the United States or from a foreign provider; Complete medical information and medical records; Your proof of travel outside of the United States, such as airline tickets or passport stamps, if you traveled to receive the services; and The foreign provider's fee schedule if the provider uses a billing agency. The forms necessary fo r filing proof of loss are available at www.humana.com. When requested by you, we will send you the forms for filing proof of loss. If the requested forms are not sent to you within 15 days, you will have met the proof of loss requirements by sending us a written or electronic statement of the nature and extent of the loss containing the above elements within the time limit stated in the \"Proof of loss\" provision. Proof of loss You must give written or electronic proof of loss within 90 days after the date of loss. Your claims will not be reduced or denied if it was not reasonably possible to give such proof. In any event, written or electronic notice must be given within one year after the date proof of loss is otherwise required, except if you were legally incapacitated. Claims processing edits CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C Payment of covered expenses for services rendered by a qualified provider is also subject to our claims processing edits, as determined by us . The amount determined to be payable after we apply our claims processing edits depends on the existence and interaction of several factors. Because the mix of these factors may be different for every claim, the amount paid for a covered expense may vary depending on the circumstances. Accordingly, it is not feasibl e to provide an exhaustive description of the claims processing edits that will be used to determine the amount payable for a covered expense, but examples of the most commonly used factors are: The intensity and complexity of a service; Whether a service is one of multiple services performed at the same service session such that the cost of the service to the qualified provider is less than if the service had been provided in a separate service session. For example: - Two or more surgeries during the sam e service session; or - Two or more radiologic imaging views performed during the same session; Whether an assistant surgeon, physician assistant, registered nurse, certified operating room technician or any other qualified provider , who is billing independently is involved; When a charge includes more than one claim line, whether any service is part of or incidental to the primary service that was provided, or if these services cannot be performed together; If the service is reasonably expected to be provid ed for the diagnosis reported; Whether a service was performed specifically for you; or Whether services can be billed as a complete set of services under one billing code. We develop our claims processing edits in our sole discretion based on our review of one or more of the following sources, including but not limited to: Medicare laws, regulations, manuals and other related guidance; Appropriate billing practices; National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC); American Medical Association (AMA)/Current Pro cedural Terminology (C PT); Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)/Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS); UB-04 Data Specifications Manual, and any successor manuals; International Classification of Diseases of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Medical and surgical specialty societies and associations; Our medi cal and pharmacy coverage policies; or Generally accepted standards of medical, behavioral health an d dental practice based on credible scientific evidence recognized in published peer reviewed medical or dental literature. Changes to any one of the sources may or may not lead us to modify current or adopt new claims processing edits. CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C Your qualified provider may access our claims processing edits and our medical and pharmacy coverage policies at the \"For Providers\" link on our website at www.humana.com . You or your qualified provider may also call our toll- free customer service number listed on your ID card to obtain a copy of a policy. You should discuss these policies and their availability with any qualified providers prior to receiving any services. Right to require medical examinations We have the right t o require a medical examination on any covered person as often as we may reasonably require. If we require a medical examination, it will be performed at our expense. We also have a right to request an autopsy in the case of death, if state law so allows. To whom benefits are payable If you receive services from a network provider, we will pay the provider di rectly for all covered expenses. You will not have to submit a claim for payment. All benefit payments for covered expenses rendered by a non- network provider are due and owing solely to the covered person . You may request that we direct a payment of selected medical benefits to the health care provider on whose charge the claim is based. Such payments will not constitute the assignment of any l egal obligation to the non- network provider. If any covered person to whom benefits are payable is a minor or, in our opinion, not able to give a valid receipt for any payment due him or her, such payment will be made to his or her parent or legal guardia n. However, if no request for payment has been made by the parent or legal guardian, we may, at our option, make payment to the person or institution appearing to have assumed his or her custody and support. Time of payment of claims Payments due under the master group contract will be paid no more than 30 days after receipt of written or electronic proof of loss. If we require additional information in order to make a determination, we will notify you within 20 days after receipt of written or electro nic proof of loss. Upon receipt of additional information, we then have 30 days to either pay or deny the claim. If the approved claim is not paid within that period, we will pay interest on the claim at a rate equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, immediately preceding the date on which the payment was due, plus 6%. The interest must be calculated from 30 days after the date on which the claim is approved until the date on which the claim is paid. The payment of interest may be waived if the payment was delayed due to an act of God or another cause beyond our control. CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C Right to request overpayments We reserve the right to recover any payments made by us that were: Made in error; Made to you or any party on your behalf, where we determi ne such payment made is greater than the amount payable under the master group contract ; Made to you and/or any party on your behalf, based on fraudulent or misrepresented information; or Made to you and/or any party on your behalf for charges that were di scounted, waived or rebated. We reserve the right to adjust any amount applied in error to the deductible or out-of-pocket limit or copayment limit , if any . Right to collect needed information You must cooperate with us and when asked, assist us by: Authorizing the release of medical information including the names of all providers from whom you received medical attention; Obtaining medical information or records from any provider as requested by us ; Providing information regarding the circumstances of your sickness, bodily injury or accident ; Providing information about other insurance coverage and benefits, including information related to any bodily injury or sickness for which another party may be liable to pay compensation or benefits; Providing copies of claims and settlement demands submitted to third parties in relation to a bodily injury or sickness; Disclosing details of liability settlement agreements reached with third parties in relation to a bodily injury or sickness; and Providing informat ion we request to administer the master group contract . If you fail to cooperate or provide the necessary information, we may recover payments made by us and deny any pending or subsequent claims for which the information is requested. Exhaustion of tim e limits If we fail to complete a claim determination or appeal within the time limits set forth in the master group contract , the claim shall be deemed to have been denied and you may proceed to the next level in the review process outlined under the \"C omplaint and Appeals Procedures\" section of this certificate or as required by law. Recovery rights CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C You as well as your dependents agree to the following, as a condition of receiving benefits under the master group contract . Duty to cooperate in good faith You are obligated to cooperate with us and our agents in order to protect our recovery rights. Cooperation includes promptly notifying us you may have a claim, providing us relevant information, and signing and delivering such documents as we or our agents reasonably request to secure our recovery rights. You agree to obtain our consent before releasing any party from liability for payment of medical expenses. You agree to provide us with a copy of any summons, complaint or any other process served in in any lawsuit in which you seek to recover compensation for your injury and its treatment. You will do whatever is necessary to enable us to enforce our recovery rights and will do nothing after loss to prejudice our recovery rights. You agree that you will not attempt to avoid our recovery rights by designating all (or any disproportionate part) of any recovery as exclusively for pain and suffering. In the event that you fail to cooperate with us , we shall be entitled to recover from you any payme nts made by us . Duplication of benefits/other insurance We will not provide duplicate coverage for benefits under the master group contract when a person is covered by us and has, or is entitled to, benefits as a result of their injuries from any other coverage including, but not limited to, first party uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, any no- fault insurance, medical payment coverage (auto, homeowners or otherwise), W orkers ' Compensation settlement or awards, other group coverage (including s tudent plans), direct recoveries from liable parties, premises medical pay or any other insurer providing coverage that would apply to pay your medical expenses, except another \"plan,\" as defined in the \"Coordination of Benefits\" section (e.g., group healt h coverage), in which case coverage will be determined as described in the \"Coordination of Benefits\" section. Where there is such coverage, we will not duplicate other coverage available to you and shall be considered secondary, except where specifically prohibited. Where double coverage exists, we shall have the right to be repaid from whomever has received the overpayment from us to the extent of the duplicate coverage. We will not duplicate coverage under the master group contract whether or not you have made a claim under the other applicable coverage. When applicable, you are required to provide us with authorization to obtain information about the other coverage available, and to cooperate in the recovery of overpayments from the other coverage, i ncluding executing any assignment of rights necessary to obtain payment directly from the other coverage available. CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C Workers' c ompensation This master group contract excludes coverage for sickness or bodily injury for which Workers' Compensation or simil ar coverage is available. If benefits are paid by us and we determine that the benefits were for treatment of bodily injury or sickness that arose from or was sustained in the course of, any occupation or employment for compensation, profit or gain, we have the right to recover as described below. We shall have first priority to recover amounts we have paid and the reasonable value of services and benefits provided under a managed care agreement from any funds that are paid or payable by Workers' Compensa tion or similar coverage as a result of any sickness or bodily injury , and we shall not be required to contribute to attorney fees or recovery expenses under a Common Fund or similar doctrine. Our right to recover from funds that are paid or payable by Workers' Compensation or similar coverage will apply even though: The Workers' Compensation carrier does not accept responsibility to provide benefits; There is n o final determination that bodily injury or sickness was sustained in the course of or result ed from your employment; The amount of Workers' Compensation due to medical or health care is not agreed upon or defined by you or the Workers' Compensation carrier; or Medical or health care benefits are specifically excluded from the Workers' Compensatio n settlement or compromise. As a condition to receiving benefits from us , you hereby agree, in consideration for the coverage provided by the master group contract , you will notify us of any Workers' Compensation claim you make, and you agree to reimburse us as described above. If we are precluded from exercising our recovery rights to recover from funds that are paid by Workers' Compensation or similar coverage we will exercise our right to recover against you. Right of subrogation As a condition to r eceiving benefits from us , you agree to transfer to us any rights you may have to make a claim, take legal action or recover any expenses paid under the master group contract . We will be subrogated to your rights to recover from any funds paid or payable as a result of a personal injury claim or any reimbursement of expenses by: Any legally liable person or their carrier , including self -insured entities ; Any uninsured motorist or underinsured motorist coverage; Medical payments/expense coverage under any automobile, homeowners, premises or similar coverages; Workers' Compensation or other similar coverage; and CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C No-fault or other similar coverage. We may enforce our subrogation rights by asserting a claim to any coverage to which you may be entitled. We shall have first priority to recover amounts we have paid and the reasonable value of services and benefits provided under a managed care agreement from any funds that are paid or payable as a result of any sickness or bodily injury , regardless of whether av ailable funds are sufficient to fully compensate you for your sickness or bodily injury . If we are precluded from exercising our rights of subrogation, we may exercise our right of reimbursement. Right of reimbursement If benefits are paid under the ma ster group contract and you recover from any legally responsible person, their insurer, or any uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, medical payment/expense, Workers' Compensation, no- fault, or other similar coverage, we have the right to recover from you an amount equal to the amount we paid and for the reasonable value of services and benefits provided under a managed care agreement . You shall notify us , in writing or by electronic mail , within 31 days of any settlement, compromise or judgment. Any covered person who waives, abrogates or impairs our right of reimbursement or fails to comply with these obligations, relieves us from any obligation to pay past or future benefits or expenses until all outstanding lien(s) are resolved. If, after the inc eption of coverage with us , you recover payment from and release any legally responsible person, their insurer, or any uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, medical payment/expense, Workers' Compensation, no- fault, or other similar insurer from liability for future medical expenses relating to a sickness or bodily injury , we shall have a continuing right to reimbursement from you to the extent of the benefits we provided with respect to that sickness or bodily injury . This right, however, shall apply only to the extent of such payment and only to the extent not limited or precluded by law in the state whose laws govern the master group contract , including any made whole or similar rule. The obligation to reimburse us in full exists, regardless of whet her the settlement, compromise, or judgment designates the recovery as including or excluding medical expenses. Assignment of recovery rights The master group contract contains an exclusion for sickness or bodily injury for which there is medical payme nt/expenses coverage provided under any automobile, homeowner's, premises or other similar coverage. If your claim against the other insurer is denied or partially paid, we will process your claim according to the terms and conditions of the master group contract . If payment is made by us on your behalf, you agree to assign to us the right you have against the other insurer for medical expenses we pay. CLAIMS (continued) CLMSNV 17 [#] CHMON 2004 -C If benefits are paid under the master group contract and you recover under any automobile, homeowner's, premises or similar coverage, we have the right to recover from you, or whomever we have paid, an amount equal to the amount we paid. Cost of legal representation The costs of our legal representation in matters related to our recovery rights shall be borne solely by us . The costs of legal representation incurred by you shall be borne solely by you.

Exhaustion of remedies COMPLAINT AND APPEAL PROCEDURES G&A NV 17 [#] CHMON 2004- C You must complete all levels of the appeal process availab le to you under state or federal law, including external review, before filing a lawsuit. This assures that both you and we have a full and fair opportunity to complete the record and resolve the dispute. Contact us if you believe your condition requires the use of the shorter time lines applicable to emergency health conditions. The appeal process, however, does not stop you from pursuing other appropriate remedies, including seeking injunctive relief or equitable relief, if the requirement of exhaustin g the process for appeals , including the emergency appeal process, would place your health in serious jeopardy. A coverage denial does not mean that your provider cannot provide the service or supply. Our denial only means we will not pay for the service or supply, unless our decision is reversed on appeal or in a subsequent lawsuit. Legal actions and limitations No lawsuit with respect to plan benefits may be brought after the expiration of one year after the latter of: The date on which we first den ied the service or claim; paid less than you believe appropriate; or failed to timely pay the claim; or 180 days after a final determination of a timely filed appeal . DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS DP 17 [#] CHMON 2004-C Employee assistance program We may provide you access to an employee assistance program (EAP). The EAP may include confidential, telephonic consultations an d work-life services. The EAP provides you with short-term, problem solving services for issues that may otherwise affect your work, personal life or health. The EAP is designed to provide you with information and assistance regarding your issue and may also assist you with finding a medical provider or local community resource. The services provided by the EAP are not covered expenses under the master group contract , therefore the copayments , deductible or coinsurance do not apply. However, there may be additional costs to you, if you obtain services from a professional or organization the EAP has recommended or has referred you to. The EAP does not provide medical care. You are not required to participate in the EAP before using your benefits under the master group contract , and the EAP services are not coordinated with covered expenses under the master group contract. The decision to participate in the EAP is voluntary, and you may participate at any time during the year. Refer to the marketing literatu re for additional information. Discount programs From time to time, we may offer or provide access to discount programs to you.

All defined terms used in this amendment ha ve the same meaning given to them in the certificate unless otherwise specifically defined in this amendment. Payment of premium on or after the effective date of this amendment will be deemed to constitute the group plan sponsor's agreement to the terms of this amendment. This amendment modifies the \"Premium\" section of the master group contract by adding the following: Wellness engagement incentive program Depending on the group size, wemay credit to the group plan sponsor's premium statement, or issue separately to the group plan sponsor wellness engagement incentives for employees who; Participate in a wellness program made available with this master group contract ; and Have achieved certain status levels, as defined by the wellness program. The wellness engagement incentives will vary depending on the employees' status levels. An employee's status level will be determined on the last day of the preceding calendar month. For employees covered under the master group contract as of the last day of the preceding calendar month, we will also consider the three preceding calendar months when the incentive is calculated to ensure employees that were not included in prior calcula tions due to certain delays in submitting information to our wellness program administrator are included if they attained the engaged status, as defined in the wellness program. The wellness engagement incentive is a reward pr ovided under a nondiscriminatory wellness program and is subject to limits under state and federal law. It is the employer's responsibility to determine how the incentive will be used in accordance wi th applicable federal and state law, including but not limited to: The Federal Employee Retirement Income Secu rity Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended; The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Ac t (the Affordable Care Act), as amended; The Health Insurance Portability and Acc ountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended; The Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended; The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), as amended; and The Genetic Information Nondiscriminati on Act of 2008 (GINA), as amended.

Some or all of the incentives may be considered funds attributable to plan assets, which generally must be used for the exclusive benefit of the group health plan participants. We are not liable for monetary penalties or fines, or other state or federal regulatory action taken against the employer for failure to comply with any applicable federal or state law. No wellness engagement incentive will be earned: After the master group contract terminates; or During the last calendar month of coverage. [Entity] [Signature of "}
