Practiced for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture is an alternative method of treating medical conditions by inserting thin, flexible needles into target points in the body to relieve discomfort and pain and restore the body to its natural balance. Today, acupuncture is widely used by licensed Western practitioners, doctors, and care providers as a complementary therapy to conventional medicines and procedures. At the Pain Center, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to pain management, with the goal of delivering the most comprehensive, highest-quality care to our patients. As such, our expert team of board-certified, top-notch physicians and specialists includes professionals with extensive training and knowledge in acupuncture therapy, administering safe, effective treatments to both adult and pediatric patients for a wide variety of acute and chronic ailments, from headaches and arthritis to low back pain and cancer pain. Our dedicated team works closely with patients to evaluate their pain and develop an effective, individualized treatment plan tailored to their unique needs. When acupuncture therapy is recommended, a licensed professional will meet with the patient to address concerns, explain the procedure and subsequent treatments needed, and discuss any follow-up care that may be necessary. The treatment is performed in our office, conveniently located in midtown Manhattan, and can last anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour. Patients are monitored throughout the procedure. Most of our patients find acupuncture painless; others report a \"grabbing\" sensation after the needle is inserted. While some people may benefit from treatment immediately, full therapeutic effects are usually felt after five or six treatment sessions. "}
