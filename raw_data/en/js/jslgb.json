It's the season of the metal element, a time to take special care of our lungs and large intestine, clear the body of unneeded gunk, and prepare it for the bounty of the fall harvest, and the coming of winter.* Formulated by Nicholas Schnell, RH. These items are shipped in 2 oz. dropper bottles. Suggested Use: 2 droppers (60 drops) 3 times per day. Pair the Deep Tissue Alterative with the seasonal cleanse formula until the bottles are empty.
