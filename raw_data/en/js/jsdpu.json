Sound familiar? it might be because you have a sun allergy, turning your time in the mood-boosting sunshine into an itchy, unpleasant affair. \"Most sun allergies typically appear for the first time in your 20s and 30s,\" [Elizabeth K. Hale, MD](https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1649261769/elizabeth-k-hale), a board-certified dermatologic surgeon and clinical associate professor of dermatology at [New York University](https://nyulangone.org/), tells SELF. \"Though it's a poorly understood phenomenon, the thought is that there's something about [sun-damaged skin cells](https://www.self.com/story/how-to-treat-painful-sunburn) that initiates an immune response in the body.\" The result is a sunburn-like red or darkened area with an [itchy rash](https://www.self.com/story/decode-rash-questions) that can look different, depending on what type of sun allergy you have\u2014more on that below. Sun allergies tend to be more common in women, according to [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17681-sun-allergy), but exactly why isn't clear, [Susan dermatologist at [The Ohio State tells SELF\u2014though some sun allergies do have genetic links.\u00b9 Making matters more mysterious, you can suddenly develop a sun rash\u2014even if you've been fine at every other time in your life. Here's what you need to know about the various sun allergy conditions, their symptoms, and how to treat them\u2014plus smart ways to prevent them from ruining your moment in, um, the sun. [What is a sun allergy?](#definition) | [What are sun allergy symptoms?](#symptoms) | [What's the difference between a sun allergy and sun poisoning?](#allergyvspoisoning) | [How do you get rid of a sun allergy?](#getrid) | [How do you prevent sun allergy symptoms?](#prevention) What is a sun allergy? A sun allergy is not a single disease. It's an umbrella term for a cluster of conditions that occur when your immune system reacts to ultraviolet light from the sun and produces a rash on your skin, according to [Harvard Medical School](https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/sun-allergy-photosensitivity-a-to-z). You can experience several different types of sun allergy: A rare form of sun allergy, an actinic prurigo rash pops up on the face, neck, and other sun-exposed skin areas, and typically starts in the spring.\u00b2 While the condition can affect anyone, it's more likely to occur in indigenous people (there's a genetic predisposition) and begin in childhood, according to [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17681-sun-allergy). The rash is terribly itchy and the bumps can look crusty, they note. Did you start using a new facial serum? Spritz on a new fragrance or apply a new body lotion before a beach day? Your red rash might be from what's called a photoallergic reaction. \"This is an allergy triggered by something that's applied to the skin that reacts with the sun and causes irritation,\" Dr. Hale says. Another potential offender in photoallergic skin reactions? Certain photosensitizing plant compounds called furocoumarins that happen to get on your skin: think lemon juice from a summer mocktail or the lime in your Corona that accidentally ends up on your hand or leg, Dr. Massick says. Along with citrus fruits, celery, parsley and wild parsnip also contain these compounds to create an allergic reaction called phytophotodermatitis, according to a 2014 study in the Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives.\u00b3 You're also more vulnerable to photoallergic reactions if you're taking certain medications. For instance, the antibiotic doxycycline is one of the more common meds that makes you more susceptible to developing a type of sun allergy reaction, according to Dr. Hale. Research in 2018 in QJM: An International Journal of Medicine that looked at case studies in two older women (ages 64 and 87) taking these antibiotics found that a photoallergic reaction can happen even from sitting by windows. (UVA rays can still penetrate glass.) Other medications that may bump up your risk for a sun rash include: antifungals, to treat [type 2 diabetes](https://www.self.com/health-conditions/type-2-diabetes)), and cholesterol-lowering drugs, per the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/special-features/sun-and-your-medicine). Also important to note: While [retinoids](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-retinol-cream), alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), and hydroquinone don't cause photoallergic reactions, they are three of the most common ingredients that make skin more sun-sensitive, according to the [Skin Cancer Foundation](https://www.skincancer.org/blog/when-beauty-products-cause-sun-sensitivity/), which could increase your risk of sunburn. Oxybenzone, an ingredient found in many chemical-based sunscreens, can also make skin more sensitive the sun's rays, 2018 research in the Spanish medical journal Actas Dermo-Sifiliogr\u00e1ficas shows. The first warm days of spring coax you outside. The temperature is comfortable. The sun is shining down on you in all its life-giving glory and you're soaking it up. But later that day, in what feels like a cruel twist of fate, an itchy, maybe red (depending on your skin tone) rash appears on your arms, legs, and the backs of your hands. What the hell? \"PMLE is a delayed hypersensitivity where the sun triggers an inflammatory reaction in skin that occurs a few hours after the exposure,\" [Megan Rogge, MD](https://med.uth.edu/dermatology/faculty/megan-rogge-m-d/), assistant professor in the department of dermatology at McGovern Medical School at [UTHealth Houston](https://www.uth.edu/), tells SELF. PMLE is benign (meaning it is not harmful), but because it can be really itchy and possibly red, it of course impacts how you feel. PMLE is common, affecting up to 15% of people, per [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17681-sun-allergy). This sun allergy typically happens at the start of the spring or summer (or when you go on a warm vacay for spring break). PMLE only affects your skin in the short-term: Skin quickly builds up a tolerance to the sun and you won't have to worry about the rash for the rest of the season. That said, it will likely reoccur at the start of each spring. \"PMLE can last a lifetime, however, you may outgrow it over many years,\" Dr. Rogge explains. Experts aren't sure why, exactly, it may become less severe over time, though. If you live in a temperate climate with a traditional winter and summer, you're more at risk, notes the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Conversely, if you live in a sunny, warm place year-round, you're less vulnerable to PMLE, since your skin is already acclimated. And because your face, specifically, is typically exposed throughout the year, it's less likely to develop this type of rash from the sun. If you get hives when you go out in the sun, you may have solar urticaria. \"This is a type of immune response that triggers cells to release histamine almost immediately upon sun exposure,\" Dr. Rogge explains. If you have this skin condition, you'll see red wheals or hives appear in as quickly as 5 to 10 minutes. What are sun allergy symptoms? PMLE will usually show up on your lower arms, legs, or backs of hands, Dr. Hale says. In this case, your skin will appear patchy, and may have subtle pink or fluid-filled bumps. If you have a lighter skin tone, this rash will likely appear red. Darker skin tones may develop bumps or a rash that's more hyperpigmented (or darker), and your skin will also feel sensitive when you're in the sun, adds Dr. Massick. Sometimes, the PMLE rash can also appear as plaques, which are raised, scaly patches of skin.4 As mentioned above, a rash from solar urticaria tends to be hive-like with red wheals, Dr. Rogge describes\u2014wheals may clump together and look like a figure eight. What does sun rash look like with solar urticaria? You'll typically see crusted bumps, according to [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17681-sun-allergy). And a photosensitivity reaction can show up on skin in a variety of ways: redness, inflammation, discoloration, scaling, blisters, or hive-like spots on exposed skin and/or covered-up areas, according to [Merck Manual](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/skin-disorders/sunlight-and-skin-damage/photosensitivity-reactions). What are sun allergy symptoms? - An irritated, red rash that occurs after sun exposure, appearing within minutes to hours or days after exposure, depending on the underlying sun allergy condition - A rash that looks like hives, wheals, plaques, crusted bumps, and/or fluid-filled blisters - Severe itchiness - Burning or pain What's the difference between a sun allergy and sun poisoning? A [sun poisoning](https://www.self.com/story/sun-poisoning) rash is often put in the sun allergy category, but these are two different conditions. \"Sun poisoning happens after really severe cases of sunburn. You can become sick with fever and chills, as well as experience blistering skin from a lot of sun exposure,\" Dr. Massick says. In the case of sun poisoning, severe damage to the skin cells triggers blistering and impairs the way your body regulates its temperature, as well as stymies your skin's ability to hold onto moisture, leaving you severely dehydrated, she says. The damage also triggers increased blood flow to the skin, which can make you feel lightheaded. While it's true that if you have a sun allergy, you may be more likely to develop sun poisoning (or it might take less sun exposure to cause a severe burn compared to your non-allergic counterparts), anyone can develop sun poisoning. Heat rash, on the other hand\u2014another unfavorable sun reaction\u2014is caused by overheating of the skin, Dr. Hale adds. Therefore, it can occur in covered-up skin and it can happen even if you haven't gone outside. Most common in babies (though it happens in adults too), heat rash develops when clogged pores trap sweat under the skin, resulting in bumps that may be red and can feel prickly or super itchy. How do you get rid of a sun allergy? If a rash is rearing its head for the first time and you think it may be a sun allergy, see a dermatologist for the right diagnosis. In addition if you notice sun sensitivity and rashes and have other symptoms (for instance, joint pain and swelling, hair loss, or extreme fatigue), make an appointment with your primary care doctor. A skin rash in the sun can also be a sign of certain autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, the [Lupus Foundation of America](https://www.lupus.org/resources/common-symptoms-of-lupus) points out. Sun allergy symptoms from PMLE go away on their own within about 10 days, but Solar urticaria, on the other hand, can take days to weeks to disappear. In the meantime, there are a few treatment options that can help you find relief. For solar urticaria or PMLE, consider taking an over-the-counter antihistamine to relieve itchiness, advises Dr. Hale. Some examples are loratadine, also known as Claritin, and Diphenhydramine (Benadryl). These meds quell the histamine response in hives from solar urticaria, but also the reaction in PMLE. As far as topical options, smoothing an aloe vera gel on flare-ups can also feel [cooling and soothing](https://www.self.com/gallery/sunburn-relief-products), says Dr. Hale. If that's not enough, a low-dose 1% topical steroid can also reduce inflammation and is a good go-to sun rash treatment. These are available as over-the-counter creams and stronger versions via prescription from your doctor. You can apply topical steroids to your legs, arms, or the backs of your hands. But ask your doctor before applying them to your face, Dr. Hale advises, as they can cause the stratum corneum (the outermost layer of the epidermis) to atrophy there over time, resulting in thinner skin that can worsen the appearance of blood vessels and exacerbate [rosacea](https://www.self.com/story/is-your-acne-actually-rosacea). Keeping skin cool with cold compresses and avoiding hot temperatures, excessive perspiration, and additional sun will also help you feel more comfortable as your skin repairs, adds Dr. Massick. How to prevent sun allergy symptoms? Even if you have a sun allergy, you can still go outside and enjoy yourself: - Get your skin acclimated to the sun at the start of the spring. At first, go out for five minutes a day (while wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen, of course) and then slowly increase that time by a minute or two each day, advises Dr. Massick. This strategy avoids sudden, long exposure that's more likely to trigger an eruption, she says. Do not use tanning beds. A \"base tan\" will not help you avoid a sun allergy, and will only increase your risk of skin cancer, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. - Avoid the hours when sun is at its strongest: Between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., advises Dr. Massick. - Seek shade when you're outside, says Dr. Hale. Cross to the shady side of the street, sit under a tree at the park, and choose the table with the umbrella when dining al fresco. - Going on vacation? Consider taking an antihistamine like loratadine (Claritin) a few days before you leave and throughout the time you're in the sun, suggests Dr. Hale. Again, this will decrease the histamine reaction in your skin, which is useful for relieving itchiness in solar urticaria and PMLE. You can also ask your dermatologist for a prescription for a topical steroid to keep on hand while you travel. - If you have sun allergy or are using a product or medication that increases sun sensitivity, always wear a broad-spectrum SPF of at least 45 to 50, says Dr. Massick, especially when you're going to spend concentrated time out in the sun. If you have sensitive skin, she recommends mineral-based sunscreens, which contain physical UV light blockers titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide that sit on the surface of skin and deflect UV rays. Having said that, remember that the best sunscreen is the one you'll actually wear, so if that means wearing a chemical sunscreen, do it. However, if you are looking for some great mineral-based formulas that won't leave a white cast and are easy to rub in, we've rounded up some excellent [mineral sunscreens](https://www.self.com/gallery/best-mineral-sunscreens). - Cover up: Wear UPF protective clothing, sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and/or lightweight long-sleeved clothing to minimize exposure and increase sun protection, says Dr. Rogge. - And if you're taking a new medication? Ask your doctor or pharmacist if one of the side effects is increased sun sensitivity. Then prioritize your sun-protective habits accordingly. Sources: [National [StatPearls, Medicine International "}
