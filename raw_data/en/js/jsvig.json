We've got you covered, with our list of the 6 best herbs for UTI treatment. \u2014 [Urinary tract infections](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-tract-infections-utis/) (UTIs) are, sadly, pretty common. Most of us will experience at least one in our lives and they can leave us feeling miserable. UTIs are usually caused by bacteria. Sometimes you may need to turn to antibiotics to clear the infection. But this isn't always necessary. There are also herbal remedies you can use at home that aim to flush your system out and get rid of harmful bacteria. Many herbs also have antibacterial properties, helping to kill off the bacteria that are causing your infection. If you prefer to try the natural route before turning to antibiotics, our list of the 6 best herbs for UTI treatment should help. 1. Uva Ursi Also known as bearberry, uva ursi has been used as a herbal treatment for UTIs for centuries. It comes from a small evergreen shrub that is native to the Americas and remains a popular remedy for UTIs and kidney stones today. A natural diuretic, uva ursi encourages our bodies to produce more urine, helping to flush harmful bacteria out of our systems. Uva ursi also has antimicrobial properties and contains a compound called [arbutin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28197453/), which is an antiseptic and a pain reliever. 2. Parsley Another popular home remedy for UTIs is parsley tea. Probably better known for its use as a culinary garnish, parsley is packed with antioxidants and has antibacterial properties, preventing the growth of bacteria like E. coli, which are one of the common causes of UTIs. Like uva ursi, parsley is also [a mild diuretic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11849841/), so may help to flush UTI-causing bacteria out of your urinary tract. 3. Juniper Berry The dark berries of the juniper bush are often used in gin-making, but these small berries also have a long history of use as a natural remedy for kidney issues and UTIs. Juniper is a diuretic, encouraging our bodies to increase the flow of urine. Not only does this help to balance our fluids, but it also supports our bodies in getting rid of the bacteria causing the infection. These berries also contain essential oils that have antiseptic properties, preventing the growth of the bacteria that cause UTIs. 4. Cranberry Cranberry is perhaps the best-known natural remedy for a UTI and plenty of people turn to it when they experience an infection. Unlike some of the herbs on our list, cranberry doesn't appear to protect against UTIs by killing off bacteria. Instead, the compounds in these small red berries help prevent bacteria from [adhering to the walls of the urinary tract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6458811/). In turn, this makes it easier for our bodies to remove pathogens via our urine. As a result, you may want to pair cranberry with some of the diuretic herbs on our list for the best effects. 5. Acerola The fruit of the acerola tree is commonly referred to as a cherry and looks very similar, despite not actually being one. Native to the Americas, this fruit is packed full of nutrients, including high levels of vitamin C. It's the high vitamin C content that makes acerola especially good for anyone who is experiencing repeated UTIs. It makes your urine [more acidic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3784967/), which in turn makes it difficult for bacteria to infect your urinary tract. Vitamin C also helps to boost your immune system, helping your body fight off pathogens more effectively. 6. Goldenseal Another herb commonly used for UTI treatment is goldenseal. Native to North America, this plant has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that help to fight off UTI-causing bacteria. Goldenseal contains a compound called berberine, which is responsible for much of its effectiveness against UTIs. [Berberine](https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=PK2011001015) makes it harder for bacteria to stick to the walls of the urinary tract, making it easier to get rid of them before they cause an infection. Herbal remedies that include berberine can also prevent re-infection, which is great news for anyone who has experienced the misery of recurring UTIs.
