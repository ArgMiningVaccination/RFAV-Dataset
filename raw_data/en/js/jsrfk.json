[0002] Magnetic sensors have been designed to detect molecular interactions in a variety of media, including biof\u00ad luids, food products, and soil samples, among other media. Upon target binding, these sensors cause changes in proper\u00ad ties of neighboring water molecules (or any solvent molecule with free hydrogens) of a sample, which can be detected by magnetic resonance (NMR/MRI) techniques. Thus, by using these sensors in a liquid sample, it is possible to detect the presence, and potentially quantify the amount, of an analyte at very low concentration. For example, small molecules, DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, organisms, metabolites, and pathogens (e.g., viruses) can be detected using magnetic sensors. [0003] In general, magnetic sensors are magnetic particles that bind or otherwise link to their intended molecular target to form clusters (aggregates). It is believed that when mag\u00ad netic particles assemble into clusters and the effective cross sectional area becomes larger (and the cluster number density is smaller), the interactions with the water or other solvent molecules are altered, leading to a change in the measured relaxation rates (e.g., T2, T15T2*), susceptibility, frequency of precession, among other physical changes. Additionally, cluster formation can be designed to be reversible (e.g., by temperature shift, chemical cleavage, pH shift, etc.) so that \"forward\" or \"reverse\" (competitive and inhibition) assays can be developed for detection of specific analytes. Forward (clustering) and reverse (declustering) types of assays can be used to detect a wide variety of biologically relevant materi\u00ad als. The MRS (magnetic resonance switch) phenomenon was previously described (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20090029392). [0004] Many diagnostic assays require sensitivity in the picomolar or subpicomolar range. In such assays an equally low concentration of paramagnetic particles is employed. As a result, the binding events leading to cluster formation can become a rate-limiting step in the completion of the assay as the collision frequency of antigens, paramagnetic particles, and partially formed clusters is low in this concentration range (see Baudry et ah, Proc NatlAcad Sci USA, 103:16076 (2006)). The current detection of infectious agents, nucleic acids, small molecules, biowarfare agents and organisms, and molecular targets (biomarkers) or the combination of molecular and immunoassay targets usually requires up-front sample preparation, time to analyze the sample, and single tests for each of the individual analytes. There is a need for a rapid, commercially-realizable NMR-based analyte detec\u00ad tion device suitable for use with magnetic nanosensors having four unique features and qualities: I) little to no sample prepa\u00ad ration, 2) multiplex detection across multiple molecular types, 3) rapid acquisition of diagnostic information, and 4) accurate information for point-of-care clinical decision mak\u00ad ing.

IA is a schematic diagram of an NMR unit for detection of a signal response of a sample to an RF pulse sequence, according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. [0116] FIG. IB depicts a typical coil configuration sur\u00ad rounding a sample tube for measuring a relaxation signal in a 20 pi sample. [0117] FIGS. 2A-2E illustrate micro coil geometries which can be used in NMR (for excitation andZor detection); designs include, but are not limited to a wound solenoid coil (FIG. 2A), a planar coil (FIG. 213), a MEMS coil (FIG. 2C), a MEMS Helmholz coil (FIG. 2D), and saddle coil (FIG. 2E), according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. Three dimensional lithographic coil fabrication of well characterized coils used in MR detection is also estab\u00ad lished and can be used for these applications, Demas et al. US 2013/0260367 A l 20Oct. 3, 2013 \"Electronic characterization of lithographically patterned microcoils for sensitivity NMR detection\" J Magn Reson 200:56 (2009). [0118] FIG. 3 is a drawing depicting an aggregation assay of the invention. The magnetic particles (dots) are coated with a binding agent (Te., antibody, oligo, etc.) such that in the presence of analyte, or multivalent binding agent, aggregates are formed. The dotted circles represent the diffusion sphere or portion of the total fluid volume that a solution molecule may experience via its diffusion during a T2 measurement (the exact path traveled by a water molecule is random, and this drawing is not to scale). Aggregation (right hand side) depletes portions of the sample from the microscopic mag\u00ad netic non-uniformities that disrupt the water's T2 signal, lead\u00ad to an increase in T2 relaxation. [0119] FIGS. 4A-4E are a series of graphs depicting the dependence of transverse relaxivity (R2) (FIG. 4A) or T2 (FIGS. 4B-4E) on particle diameter and particle aggregation. FIG. 4A is a graph depicting the motional averaging regime (light line, left side); the R2 (1/T2) measured by a CPMG sequence increases as particle size increases because the refo\u00ad cusing pulses are ineffective to counteract the dephasing effects of the particles. As the system transitions to the visit limited regime (dark line, right side) the refocusing pulses begin to become effective and the R2 decreases as particle size increases. For homogeneous magnetic fields, the R2* in the motional averaging regime matches the R2 and the R2* reaches a constant value in the visit limited regime. In a homogenous field, when the R2* is less than the R2 of either the motional averaging regime or visit limited regime the system is in the static dephasing regime. The empty circle represents the R2 of a solution of 100% dispersed particles (diameter= 15 nm) and the solid circle represents a solution of 100% clustered particles (diametei=200 nm). This is an example of how to interpret these curves for clustering reac\u00ad tions. Theconditions for this D=2.5xl0-5 m2 /s, andxc/J=0.25 ms. FIG. 4B is a graph depicting the same light and dark curves plotted in terms OfT2 and diameter, on a linear scale. In this figure the black dashed line represents the T2* measured in a non-uniform magnetic field where T2* is always lower than T2 and doesn't reflect the particle size. The data points are the same as well. FIG. 4C is a graph depicting the monodisperse clustering model and showing that T2 will follow the curve as analyte is added because the average diameter of the population particles will cover all intermediate diameters between the initial and final states. FIG. 4D is a graph depicting the polydisperse model and showing that the T2 will transition between the two points on this curve when particles form clusters of specific sizes. The response curve will be linear with regard to analyte addition, but non-linear with regard to volume fraction of clusters, because particles transition between state I and state 2. The slope of the response curve is directly proportional to the sensitivity of the assay. FIG. 4E is a graph showing the two regimes for particle aggregation and T2 affects based on par\u00ad ticle size and how clustering assays in the different regimes map onto the T2 versus diameter curves (i) for the motional averaging regime T2 decreases when particles cluster; and (ii) for the slow motion regime T2 increases when particles clus\u00ad ter. Under the conditions shown in these models, the bound\u00ad ary between the two regimes is ca. 100 nm diameter particles. When small magnetic particles form aggregates under 100 nm in diameter, the result is a decrease in T2 upon aggregateformation. When magnetic particles at or above 100 nm in diameter form larger aggregates, the result is an increase in T2 upon aggregate formation. [0120] FIGS. 5A-5C are drawings depicting different assay formats for the assays of the invention. FIG. 5A depicts an agglomerative sandwich immunoassay in which two popula\u00ad tions of magnetic particles are designed to bind to two differ\u00ad ent epitopes of an analyte. FIG. 5B depicts a competitive immunoassay in which analyte in a liquid sample binds to a multivalent binding agent (a multivalent antibody), thereby depicts a hybridization-me\u00ad agglomerative assay in which two populations of par\u00ad ticles are designed to bind to the first and second portions of a nucleic acid target, respectively. [0121] FIG. 6 illustrates a modular cartridge concept in sections that can be packaged and stored separately. This is done, for example, so that the inlet module (shown elevated with inverted Vacutainer tube attached) can be sterilized while the reagent holding module in the middle is not. This allows the component containing reagents to be the only refrigerated component. [0122] FIGS. 7A-7F depict a Vacutainer inlet module. FIG. 7 A shows it in the inverted position after the user has removed the closure from the Vacutainer tube and placed the cartridge onto it. FIG. 7B shows the molded in path that the blood will follow out of the Vacutainer and into the sample loading region once the cartridge is turned right side up. The foil seal can be the bottom side of the channels, forming an inexpen\u00ad sively molded part with closed channels. FIG. 7C is a cutaway view showing the vent tube which allows air to enter into the vial as the blood leaves and fills the sample region. FIGS. 7D-7F depict an inlet module for sample aliquoting designed to interface with uncapped vacutainer tubes, and to aliquot two a sample volume that can be used to perform, for example, a Candida assay. The inlet module has two hard plastic parts, that get ultrasonically welded together and foil sealed to form a network of channels to allow a flow path to form into the first well overflow to the second sample well. A soft vacutainer seal part is used to for a seal with the vacu\u00ad tainer. It has a port for sample flow, and a venting port, to allow the flow to occur. [0123] FIG. 8 depicts the sample inlet module with the foil seal removed. On the top, one can see the small air inlet port to the left, the laiger sample well in the center and a port which connects them together. This port provides a channel through which air can flow once the foil seal is pierced. It also provides an overflow into the body of the module to allow excess blood to drain away and not spill over. This effectively meters the blood sample to the volume contained in the sample well. [0124] FIGS. 9A-9C depict a reagent module. FIG. 9A depicts the module of the cartridge that is intended to hold reagents and consumables for use during the assay. On the left are sealed pre-dispensed aliquots of reagents. On the right is a 2.8 ml conical bottomed centrifuge tube that is used for initial centrifugation of the blood. The other holes can be filled as need with vials, microcentrifuge tubes, and pipette tips. FIG. 9B is a cutaway view of the reagent module show\u00ad ing the holders for the pre-aliquoted reagent tips, including the feature at the bottom into which the tips are pressed to provide a seal. FIG. 9C depicts three representative pipette tips into which reagents can be pre-dispensed, and then the backs sealed. The tips are pressed into the sample holder to provide a seal. US 2013/0260367 A l 21Oct. 3, 2013 [0125] FIGS. IOA and IOB depict an alternative design of the modular cartridge, showing a detection module with a recessed well for use in assays that require PCR. Cross\u00ad contamination from PCR products is controlled in two ways. First, the seals that are on the detection tubes are designed to seal to a pipette tip as it penetrates. Second, the instrument provides air flow through the recessed well by means of holes in the well to ensure that any aerosol is carried down and does not travel throughout the machine. [0126] FIG. 11 depicts a detection module of cartridge showing detection tubes and one of the holes used to ensure air flow down and over the tubes during pipetting to help prevent aerosol escape. [0127] FIG. 12 depicts a bottom view of the detection mod\u00ad ule, showing the bottom of the detection tubes and the two holes used to ensure airflow. An optional filter can be inserted here to capture any liquid aerosol and prevent it from entering the machine. This filter could also be a sheet of a hydrophobic material like Gore-tex that will allow air but not liquids to escape. [0128] FIGS. 13 A-13C depict a detection tube. FIG. 13 A is a view of the detection tube. The tube itself could be an off the shelf 200 microliter PCR tube, while the cap is a custom molded elastomer part that provides a pressure resistant duck\u00ad bill seal on the inside and a first seal to the pipette tip from the top. The seal is thus a make-break type of seal, where one seal is made before the other is broken. FIG. 13B depicts the custom molded seal component. Note the circular hole into which the pipette tip is inserted and the duckbill seal below, which provides a second seal that resists pressure developed in the tube. FIG. 13C depicts the seal showing the duckbill at bottom and the hole at top. [0129] FIGS. 14A-14C depict a cartridge for performing a multiplexed assay. FIG. 14A shows a reagent strip for the cartridge. The oval holes are the supports for the detection modules, and these are constructed separately and then placed into the holes. The detection wells could be custom designed or commercially available. FIG. 14B shows the detection module for the cartridge depicted in FIG. 14A. In this example, the detection module contains two detection cham\u00ad bers, but could contain any number of chambers as required by the assay and as the detection system (the MR reader) is designed to accept. FIG. 14C depicts an alternate footprint for the modular multiplexed cartridge. This cartridge includes 3 detection modules that are molded as part of the reagent strip, and these portions are popped out of the frame and individu\u00ad ally processed at other units (Te., the NMR unit and/or mag\u00ad netic assisted agglomeration (MAA) unit) within the assay system. [0130] FIG. 15 is a scheme depicting one embodiment of the cycling gradient magnetic assisted agglomeration (gMAA) method of the invention. Two magnets are placed in two positions such that if the sample tube is placed close to the a region of strong magnetic field gradient produced by the first magnet, the magnetic particles will be drawn towards the direction of the field gradient produced by the first magnet, the sample tube is then placed next to the second magnet producing a field gradient, and the magnetic particles are drawn to the direction of the field gradient produced by sec\u00ad ond magnet. The cycle can be repeated until the aggregation reaction reaches a steady state (as observed by the change in the NMR relaxation rate of the sample); a smaller number of cycles can be used as well. A single magnet used to producea field gradient can also be used, while for cycling the sample tube can be moved relative to the magnetic field gradient. [0131] FIG. 16 is a scheme depicting a homogenous mag\u00ad netic assisted agglomeration (hMAA) setup. On the left hand side, the magnetic particles are shown as dots in a partially clustered state. When exposed to a homogeneous magnetic field, as depicted on the right hand side, clustering of the magnetic particles is promoted as the magnetic particles form chains along the direction of the field produced by the hMAA setup. On the right hand side, the two magnets are represented by bars, to depict the formation of a standard dipole field. hMAA can also be used to evaluate the nonspecific revers\u00ad ibility of a magnetic particle to assess its utility in an assay of the invention. [0132] FIG. 17 depicts a gradient MAA unit configured to apply a gradient magnetic field to the side and to the bottom of a sample. The specific setup has magnets with a surface field of approximately 0.7 T, while the produced gradient is in the order of 0.25 T/mm. Similar gMAA units, covering a much bigger range of fields and gradients can be used. [0133] FIGS. 18A-18C depict a gradient MAA unit config\u00ad ured to apply a gradient magnetic field to the side and to the bottom of an array of samples. FIG. 18A depicts the gMAA unit array of 32 bottom magnets and 40 side magnets (32 functional, 8 used to balance the stray magnetic fields seen by all sample), each with a field strength of about 0.5 T, used for assisting agglomeration in an array of samples simulta\u00ad neously. FIGS. 18B-18C depict a top view (FIG. 18B) and side view (FIG. 18C) of a setup for the automation of the an automated gMAA unit wherein a plate gMAA along with a configuration for containing an array of samples is cycled between the bottom and side magnet positions by a robotic systems, within a temperature controlled array. The magnets are stationary, while the plate holding the sample tubes moves through a preset trajectory. An exemplary field strength on the surface of individual magnets is 0.4-0.5 T, with a gradient in the order of 0.1 T/mm. [0134] FIGS. 19A-19B depict a top view (FIG. 19A) and side view (FIG. 19B) of a homogenous MAA unit configured to apply a homogenous magnetic field to an array samples. Field strengths from 0.2-0.7 T can be used with homogeneity from 500 to 5000 ppm over the sample tube region. [0135] FIG. 20 is a drawing of a vortexer which includes the following components: (i) a sample support, (ii) a main plate, (iii) four linkages, (iv) linear rail and carriage system (x2), (v) a support for driveshaft and rails, (vi) coupling and driveshaft, (vii) a mounting plate, and (viii) a drive motor. [0136] FIG. 21 is a drawing of a compact vortexer which includes the following components: (i) a sample support, (ii) a main plate, (iii) two linkages, (iv) linear rail and carriage system, (v) a support for linear rail, (vi) support for driveshaft, (vii) coupling and driveshaft, (viii) a mounting plate, and (ix) a drive motor. [0137] FIGS. 22A and 2213 depict portions of a vortexer. FIG. 22A is a drawing depicting the bottom portion (Te., the drive motor, coupling, and drive shaft) of a vortexer of the invention. The motor includes an index mark and/or other position sensing means such as an optical, magnetic or resis\u00ad tive position encoder that allows the motor to find a specific point in its rotation. These index marks are used to home the system, and ensure that the sample can be returned to a known position after mixing and allows the vortexer to be easily accessed by robotic actuators, and thus integrated into an automated system. In lieu of index marks, external home US 2013/0260367 A l 22Oct. 3, 2013 switches or position tracking sensors could be employed. FIG. 22B is a drawing depicting the guide mechanism of a vortexer of the invention. The main plate is connected to the offset axis of the drive shaft and is free to rotate. The plate follows the orbital path around and dictated by the motor shaft. [0138] FIGS. 23A-23C are a series of drawings depicting a vortexer utilizing a planetary belt drive. FIG. 23 A is an overall view showing the vortexer configured for one large tube. FIG. 23B is a section view showing two tube holders for small tubes. FIG. 23C is an overall view of vortexer showing four tubes and a close up of planetary belt drive mechanism. [0139] FIG. 24 is a drawing depicting the components of the creatinine competitive assay of Example 6. A magnetic particle decorated with creatinine is used in combination with a creatinine antibody to form an aggregating system. The creatinine present in a liquid sample competes with the mag\u00ad netic particles for the antibody, leading to a reduction in aggregation with increasing creatinine concentration. The change in aggregation is observed as a change in the T2 relaxation rate of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules of the liquid sample. By comparing the observed T2 relax\u00ad ation rate of the liquid sample to a standard curve, the con\u00ad centration of creatinine is determined. [0140] FIGS. 25A-25C are a series of graphs showing the response curve for creatinine competitive assays. FIG. 25A is a graph showing a standard curve for the creatinine competi\u00ad tive assay of Example 6 correlating the observed T2 relaxation rate with the concentration of creatinine in the liquid sample. FIG. 25B shows the T2 response of a creatinine-decorated particle with 2 different preparations of antibody. Preparation I is pre-production (with aggregated antibody) and Prepara\u00ad tion 2 is production purified (no aggregated antibody present). FIG. 25C shows the T2 response of a creatinine\u00ad decorated particle with unaggregated antibody, biotinylated antibody and deliberately multimerized antibody, and con\u00ad firms the increased clustering ability of multi-valent agglom\u00ad erating agents. [0141] FIG. 26 is a graph showing the specific clustering achieved, as determined via T2 relaxation rates, with various methods of gMAA as described in Example 10. In FIG. 26 (i) \"control\" is gMAA (magnet exposure+vortex, repeat) in which the relative position of the sample and the magnetic field direction are unchanged with each cycle; (ii) \"twist\" is gMAA (magnet exposure+rotation within magnet, repeat) with rotating tube ca. 90\u00b0 relative to the gradient magnet with each cycle; (iii) \"180\u00b0 turn\" is gMAA (magnet exposure+ remove tube from magnet, rotate, place back in magnet, repeat) with rotating tube ca. 180\u00b0 relative to the gradient magnet with each cycle; and \"remove 5 s\" is removal of tube from magnet, 5 seconds rest (no rotation), repeat. The results show that the rate at which a steady state degree of agglom\u00ad eration, and stable T2 reading, is achieved is expedited by cycling between the two or more positions over a number of gMAA treatments. Further, field gradient combinations, cycling field (side or bottom) to null or side field to bottom, field (side or bottom) to vortex are also iterations that can be used for gMAA. Exposure or dwell times (either on the field or away), and number of cycles can be varied to optimize assisted aggregation for a specific assay (not shown). [0142] FIG. 27 is a graph showing the response curve for the creatinine competitive assay for samples processed with alternating side-bottom magnet gMAA as described in Example 11.[0143] FIG. 28 is a drawing depicting the tacrolimus com\u00ad petitive assay architecture of Example 9. [0144] FIG. 29 is a graph showing a standard curve for the tacrolimus competitive assay of Example 9 correlating the observed T2 relaxation rate observed for a liquid sample with the concentration of tacrolimus in the liquid sample. [0145] FIGS. 30A-30B are graphs depicting the degree to which gMAA assisted aggregation is dependent upon tem\u00ad perature and dwell time in the assay of Example 11. FIG. 30A is a graph showing that the degree of aggregation as deter\u00ad mined by measuring the T2 response of the sample is increased with increasing dwell time at room temperature. FIG. 30B is a graph showing that the degree of aggregation as determined by measuring the T2 response of the sample is increased with increasing gMAA dwell time at 37\u00b0 C. As shown in FIGS. 30A and 30B, increasing temperature and increasing dwell time enhance the extent of gMAA assisted aggregation as observed by changes in the observed T2. [0146] FIG. 31 is a graph showing that the degree of aggre\u00ad gation as determined by measuring the T2 response of the sample is increased with increasing the number of gMAA cycles in the assay of Example 13. [0147] FIG. 32 is a drawing depicting the Candida agglom- erative sandwich assay architecture of Example 14. [0148] FIG. 33 is a graph depicting a creatinine inhibition curve (see Example 7) for using an antibody coated particle and an amino-dextran-creatinine multivalent binding agent to induce clustering by competing with any target analyte (crea\u00ad tinine) present in the sample to cause particle clustering. The binding agent used is a 40 kDa dextran with -10 creatinines per dextran molecule. [0149] FIG. 34 is a graph depicting the evaluation of Tac- dextran conjugates for clustering ability (see Example 8) by performing a titration. As observed, that increased molecular weight of Tac-dextran results in the improved T2 signal. [0150] FIG. 35 is a graph depicting the evaluation of Tac- dextran conjugates for clustering ability (see Example 8) by performing a titration. As observed, higher substitution improved T2 signal. [0151] FIG. 36 is a graph depicting the evaluation of Tac- BSA conjugates for clustering ability (see Example 8) by performing a titration similar to that used for the Tac-dextran conjugates. As observed, clustering performance varies with the tacrolimus substitution ratio. [0152] FIG. 37 is a graph depicting the results OfT2 assays for detecting anti-biotin antibody using prepared magnetic particles in blood and PBS matrices as described in Example I. [0153] FIG. 38 is a graph depicting results OfT2 assays for detecting anti-biotin antibody using prepared magnetic par\u00ad ticles with (open circle) and without (filled circle) a protein block as described in Examples 8 and 9. [0154] FIG. 39 is a graph depicting results OfT2 assays for detecting anti-biotin antibody using prepared magnetic par\u00ad ticles having a BSA block (dark filled diamond, square, tri\u00ad angle) or an FSG block (light gray X 's and circle) as described in Example 2. [0155] FIGS. 40A-40B are schematics of provided particle coatings. [0156] FIGS. 41A-41B depict results of T2 assays for detecting biotin in a competitive assay format described in Example 4. FIG. 41A depicts experimental results in buffer; while FIG. 41B depicts experimental results in lysed blood. US 2013/0260367 A l 23Oct. 3, 2013 [0157] FIG. 42 is a sketch of a system of the invention including an NMR unit, a robotic arm, a hMAA unit, a gMAA unit, two agitation units, a centrifuge, and a plurality of heat\u00ad ing blocks. [0158] FIGS. 43A-43D are images depicting various fluid transfer units which can be used in the systems of the inven\u00ad tion. [0159] FIGS. 44A and 44B are sketches showing how a system of the invention can be designed to regulate the tem\u00ad perature of the working space. [0160] FIGS. 45A and 45B are sketches depicting an NMR unit having a separate casing for regulation of the temperature at the site of the NMR measurement, and useful where tight temperature control is needed for precision of the measure\u00ad ment. The temperature control configuration depicted in this figure is one of many different ways to control temperature. [0161] FIG. 46A is a table and 46B is a graph depicting the repeatability of Candida measurements by methods of the invention over a period of eight days. To determine the repeat\u00ad ability of the T2 measurement on C albicans infected human whole blood, we conducted an eight day study in which the same donor spiked and amplified sample was hybridized to the superparamagnetic particles (n=3) each day and the resulting T2 values were recorded (see Example 17). The within run precision is shown in FIG. 46A and in general is tight with the CV's of all measurands less than 12%. The repeatability observed over the course of eight days is shown in FIG. 46B (Mean T2 values+/-the 95% confidence intervals measured from the same donor spiked and amplified samples over the course of eight days) with the CVs less than 10% across the range of Candida concentrations and 6% for the negative control. [0162] FIG. 47 is a scheme describing the work flow for detection of a bacterial or fungal pathogen in a whole blood sample (see Examples 14 and 17). [0163] FIGS. 48A and 48B are graphs depicting results from donor samples. FIG. 48A is a graph depicting the results obtained from 16 experiments designed to assess the assay's performance in 6 different donor blood samples spiked with a range of C albicans cells (see Example 17). Each data point is the mean+/-the 95% confidence interval (n=48). At the lowest test concentration (10 cells/mL), we failed to detect Candida albicans 37% of the time (6 out of 16 experiments); however at 100 cells/mL Candida albicans was detected 100% of the time. This suggests the assay can robustly detect at C albicans concentrations greater than or equal to 100 cells/mL with no major inhibition of performance introduced through the donor blood samples. FIG. 48B is a graph depict\u00ad ing the results obtained from 7 experiments designed to assess the assay's performance in 6 different donor blood samples spiked with a range of C krusei cells (see Example 17). Each data point is the mean+/-the 95% confidence interval (n=21). We do not detect at 10 cells/mL in any of the experimental runs but detect at 100 cells/mL for all experimental runs. This suggests the LOD between 10 and 100 cells/mL. [0164] FIG. 49 is a dot diagram showing the T2 values measured for five C albicans clinical isolates spiked into 400 pL whole blood at concentrations spanning 0 to IE4 cells/mL. The plotted results are the mean+/-1 SD. The data indicates despite the scatter of absolute T2 values obtained among the different isolates, at 50 cells/mL all values are above that of the no Candida control (3 replicate measurements from 20 independent assays, total of 60 different clustering reactions).[0165] FIGS. 50A and 50B are ROC plots of T2 results generated at 10 cells/mL (FIG. 50A) and 50 cells/mL (FIG. 50B). The area under the curve at 10 cells/mL is 0.72 (95CI=0.56 to 0.88) while at 50 cells/mL the area under the curve is 0.98 (950=0.95 to 1.001). The area under the curve is often used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy; in this case our ability to discriminate between a Candidemic patient with an infection of 10 cells/mL or 50 cells/mL versus a patient with no Candidemia. A tlO cells/mL the area under the curve is 0.72 which means that if the T2 assay was run on a ran\u00ad domly chosen person with Candidemia at a level of infection of 10 cells/mL, there is an 72% chance their T2 value would be higher than a person with no Candidemia. The clinical accuracy of the test is much higher at 50 cells/mL with the area under the curve at 0.98. Again indicating that in a person with Candidemia at this level of infection, the T2 assay would give a value higher than a sample from a patient without Candidemia 98% of the time. See Example 17. [0166] FIG. 51 is a graph depicting the sensitivity of the assay using the standard thermocycle (-3 hours turnaround time) and a process that combines the annealing/elongation steps (-2 hours, 13 minutes turnaround time). Combiningthe annealing and elongation step in the thermocycling reduces the total assay TAT to 2.25 hours without compromising assay sensitivity. [0167] FIG. 52 is a graph depicting the change in T2 signal with PCR cycling (see Example 18). The results demonstrate that the methods and systems of the invention can be used to perform real time PCR and provide quantitative information about the amount of taiget nucleic acid present in a sample. [0168] FIG. 53 is a series of photographs showing a simple magnetic separator/PCR block insert. [0169] FIG. 54 is an image showing the quantify of DNA generated by amplification of (I) 100 copies of genomic C albicans amplified in the presence of 3' and 5' C albicans single probe nanoparticles; particles were held on the side wall during PCR via magnetic field, (2) 100 copies of genomic C albicans amplified without nanoparticles, and (3) 100 copies of genomic C albicans amplified in the presence of 3' and 5' C albicans single probe field. [0170] FIGS. 55A-55E are schematic views of a sample tube containing an immobilized portion of magnetizable metal foam (shaded), magnetic particles (circles), and analyte (triangles), a magnetizable metal foam, e.g., made of nickel, may be inserted into a conduit and immobilized by exposure to heat, which shrinks the conduit around the metal foam, resulting in a tight seal. A sample containing magnetic par\u00ad ticles and analytes is then introduced at one end of the conduit (FIG. 55A). Next, the conduit is exposed to a magnet (FIG. 55B), and the magnetic particles are attracted to the metal foam and become magnetically trapped within its pores, or crevices. The average diameter of the pores in the metal foam is, e.g., between 100-1000 microns. Analyte molecules can be carried to the metal foam via binding to a magnetic particle, or the fluid can be forced through the metal foam to reach trapped magnetic particles. While trapped in the metal foam, the magnetic particles have enhanced interactions, as they are now confined and are closer to other magnetic particles, and cluster formation is enhanced. The metal foam is then demag\u00ad netized (FIG. 55C), i.e., the magnetic field of the metal foam becomes negligible. The magnetic particles and analyte clus\u00ad ter complexes largely remain in the metal foam, as the diffu\u00ad sion of magnetic particle clusters is relatively low, although US 2013/0260367 A l 24Oct. 3, 2013 some natural diffusion of the analyte in to and out of the metal foam occurs (FIG. 55D). Alternatively, the magnetizable metal foam (hollow cylinder) is free floating in the sample tube with the magnetic particles (circles), and analyte (stars). The magnetization and demagnetization of the free floating metal foam is used to increase the rate of aggregate formation. [0171] FIG. 56A depicts a rotary gMAA configuration. The Rotary gMAA can include three configurations for varying magnetic field exposures\u2014 side-bottom; side-null and bot\u00ad tom-null (see Example 21). [0172] FIG. 56B is a graph comparing T2 signal as a func\u00ad tion of various rotary gMAA configurations for varying mag\u00ad netic field exposures to a sample at a given agglomerator concentration. The rotary side-bottom configuration pro\u00ad vided the highest T2 signal at a given agglomerator tration, followed by the comparison side-bottom plate con\u00ad figuration. Rotary side-null provides equivalent signal to the plate side-bottom; and the bottom-null produces the lowest signal (see Example 21). [0173] FIG. 57 is a table depicting the T2MR results for 32 clinical specimens indicates fourteen specimens are Candida positive. The test identifies four specimens containing C krusei or C glabrata, seven specimens containing C albicans or C tropicalis, and three containing C parapsilosis. A solid black line indicates the decision threshold (T2=128 msec) (see Example 22). DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0174] The invention features systems, devices, and meth\u00ad ods for the rapid detection of analytes or determination of analyte concentration in a sample. The systems and methods of the invention employ magnetic particles, an NMR unit, optionally one or more MAA units, optionally one or more incubation stations at different temperatures, optionally one or more vortexer, optionally one or more centrifuges, option\u00ad ally a fluidic manipulation station, optionally a robotic sys\u00ad tem, and optionally one or more modular cartridges. The systems, devices, and methods of the invention can be used to assay a biological sample (e.g., blood, sweat, tears, urine, saliva, semen, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), feces, vaginal fluid or tissue, sputum, nasopharyngeal aspi\u00ad rate or swab, lacrimal fluid, mucous, or epithelial swab (buc\u00ad cal swab), tissues, organs, bones, teeth, or tumors, among others). Alternatively, the systems, devices, and methods of the invention are used to monitor an environmental condition (e.g., plant growth hormone, insecticides, man-made or envi\u00ad ronmental toxins, nucleic acid sequences resistance/susceptibility, algae and algae by-prod\u00ad ucts), as part of a bioremediation program, for use in farming plants or animals, or to identify environmental hazards. Simi- larily, the systems, devices, and methods of the invention are used to detect and monitor biowarfare or biological warfare agents, such as ricin, Salmonella typhimurium, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin, mycotoxins, Francisella tularesis, small pox, anthrax, or others. [0175] The magnetic particles can be coated with a binding moiety (Fe., antibody, oligo, etc.) such that in the presence of analyte, or multivalent binding agent, aggregates are formed. Aggregation depletes portions of the sample from the micro\u00ad scopic magnetic non-uniformities that disrupt the solvent's T2 signal, leading to an increase in T2 relaxation (see FIG. 3). [0176] The T2 measurement is a single measure of all spins in the ensemble, measurements lasting typically 1-10 sec\u00ad onds, which allows the solvent to travel hundreds of microns,a long distance relative to the microscopic non-uniformities in the liquid sample. Each solvent molecule samples a volume in the liquid sample and the T2 signal is an average (net total signal) of all (nuclear spins) on solvent molecules in the sample; in other words, the T2 measurement is a net measure\u00ad ment of the entire environment experienced by a solvent molecule, and is an average measurement of all microscopic non-uniformities in the sample. [0177] The observed T2 relaxation rate for the solvent mol\u00ad ecules in the liquid sample is dominated by the magnetic particles, which in the presence of a magnetic field form high magnetic dipole moments. In the absence of magnetic par\u00ad ticles, the observed T2 relaxation rates for a liquid sample are typically long (Fe., T2 (water)=~2000 ms, T2 (Mood)=-1500 ms). As particle concentration increases, the microscopic non-uniformities in the sample increase and the diffusion of solvent through these microscopic non-uniformities leads to an increase in spin decoherence and a decrease in the T2 value. The observed T2 value depends upon the particle concentra\u00ad tion in a non-linear fashion, and on the relaxivity per particle parameter. [0178] In the aggregation assays of the invention, the num\u00ad ber of magnetic particles, and if present the number of agglo- merant particles, remain constant during the assay. The spa\u00ad tial distribution of the particles change when the particles cluster. Aggregation changes the average \"experience\" of a solvent molecule because particle localization into clusters is promoted rather than more even particle distributions. At a high degree of aggregation, many solvent molecules do not experience microscopic non-uniformities created by mag\u00ad netic particles and the T2 approaches that of solvent. As the fraction of aggregated magnetic particles increases in a liquid sample, the observed T2 is the average of the non-uniform suspension of aggregated and single (unaggregated) mag\u00ad netic particles. The assays of the invention are designed to maximize the change in T2 with aggregation to increase the sensitivity of the assay to the presence of analytes, and to differences in analyte concentration. [0179] In designing magnetic relaxation switch (MRSw) biosensors, it is important to consider the relaxation mecha\u00ad nisms of the magnetic particles. First, in the case of super- paramagnetic particles the solvent longitudinal and trans\u00ad verse relaxivities (defined as R1 =ET1 and R2=ET2, respectively) are a function of particle size. Furthermore, R2 and R2* (where R2*=l/T2*, R2*=R2+A(Bp, where Ku o f is dephasing due to field inhomgeneities) increase with particle diameter until about 100 nm, and then R2 decreases with increasing particle size and the R2* reaches a plateau for uniform fields (see FIG. 4A). Superparamagnetic particles are typically divided into categories of strongly magnetized and weakly magnetized particles, based on the relative mag\u00ad nitude of the precession frequency difference between nuclei at the surface of the particle and nuclei distant from the particle, Aw, and the inter-echo delay of the CPMG detection sequence, xCP. Am is essentially a relative measure of the effect of the dipolar magnetic field generated by a superpara- magnetic particle on the resonant frequency of hydrogen nuclei in adjacent water molecules. When the product AmxcE=T then the particles are classified as strongly magne\u00ad tized and when Amxc/J<l then the particles are classified as weakly magnetized. For typical relaxometers, xC P is no shorter than tens of microseconds, so Am must be less than IO5 for the particles to be within the weakly magnetized regime. Most superparamagnetic particles used for MRSw US 2013/0260367 A l 25Oct. 3, 2013 assays have a surface dephasing Am of approximately IxlO7, therefore they are classified as strongly magnetized. This means that the inter-echo delay is always longer than the amount of dephasing that occurs at the surface of a particle. [0180] Another characteristic of superparamagnetic par\u00ad ticle solutions that is used to differentiate physical behavior is the diffusion time, or travel time, of water (X 1 3 ) relative to the inter-echo time of the pulse sequence, xCP. Particle solutions are in the long echo limit when the m is significantly less than that xCP. xD can be determined by the relationship: R 2 (I) where xD is the time it takes a water molecule to diffuse the distance of a particle radius, R, and D the diffusion constant of water, IO-9 m2/s. xD can be thought of as the time it takes a water molecule to pass a hemisphere of a particle, or a flyby time. When xD is much larger than xcp, then the particle system is within the \"short echo limit\". Typical CPMG sequences have echo times on the order of hundreds of micro\u00ad seconds to several milliseconds. Therefore, the \"short echo limit\" cannot be approached unless the particle diameter approaches 1000 nm. The most common MRSw biosensors are within the \"long echo limit\" because the length of the inter-echo delays (xclA0.25 ms) is longer than the time it takes a water molecule to diffuse past the hemisphere of a particle (0.2-100 microseconds). [0181] As the particle size of a solution of superparamag\u00ad netic particles at fixed iron concentration is increased there is an initial increase in R2, then a plateau and later decrease (FIG. 4A). The regime on the left hand side of the curve is been termed the motional averaging regime, the regime in the middle is been termed the static dephasing regime, and the regime on the right is been termed the visit limited, or slow motion regime. The boundaries between the motional aver\u00ad aging and visit limited regimes can be determined by gener\u00ad ating plots such as that shown in FIG. 4A, or they can be determined by the relationship between Am and xD. If Amx1 3 - = C l, then the system is in the motional averaging regime; if Amx1 3 Ol, then the system is in the visit limited regime (also termed the slow motion regime). As the diameter of the par\u00ad ticles increases in the motional averaging regime the refocus\u00ad ing echos in the CPMG pulse sequence cannot efficiently refocus the magnetization that has been dephased by the particles, hence the increase in R2 (or decrease in T2). In other words, the refocusing pulses cannot compensate for increased dephasing by larger particles. The flat region of the static dephasing regime is due to the R2 being limited by R2*. The decreasing R2 with increasing diameter in the visit limited regime results in the refocusing pulses being able to refocus the dephasing caused by the particles. Also apparent in FIG. 4A is that the R2 in the slow motion regime exhibits a depen\u00ad dence on the inter-echo delay of the spin echo sequence. [0182] In a homogenous magnetic field, one can determine which regime applies to a sample by comparing the R2 to the R2*; the two values are identical in the motional averaging or static dephasing regime and they are different in the visit limited regime. Flowever, in cases of inhomogeneous fields, such as those present on benchtop and portable MR devices, the T2* is dominated by the field gradient. In fact, the mea\u00ad sured T2* value is not indicative of the particle or particle cluster size state (FIG. 4B). The shape of the R, response asparticles agglomerated generally matches the expected trend for the increase in average particle size. The similarity between the R2 of particle agglomerates and that of spherical particles suggests that one can equate particle aggregates and spherical shapes. Even though this assumption may seem to be in contradiction with the fractal nature of particle agglom\u00ad erates, the shape of the particle aggregates observed by the magnetic resonance measurement is determined by the ensemble of diffusing water molecules in solution, which can be approximated by the radius of hydration measured by light scattering. [0183] The analytical models for R2 can be applied to mag\u00ad netic relaxation biosensors to aid in the design of biosensor assays. Conveniently, these models accurately predict the dependence OfR2 on parameters that a biosensor designer can control\u2014iron concentration, temperature, magnetic suscep\u00ad tibility, and particle size. Additionally, these analytical mod\u00ad els allow for predictive modeling of the dependence of T2 relaxation on these parameters. Results are not entirely quan\u00ad titative, but the general trends and response curves predicted by these models can be instructive. One useful model is the chemical exchange model for strongly magnetized spheres: (4/9) Vt d (A m,)2 ( 2) I + (4/9 )2 (TdAtc p )2 a5 A o jt c p 1 / 1 C ) a + bAcoTcpV - I where I/T2 is the transverse relaxivity, V the volume fraction of iron in solution, xD the diffusion, or flyby time, Amr the frequency shift at the surface of a particle relative to bulk solution, X c p one half the inter-echo delay in a CPMG sequence, and a and b are derived constants (a=1.34 and b=0.99). Equations (2) and (3) can be used to generate a curve that describes the dependence of R2 on particle sizes, as shown by the light and dark lines in FIGS. 4A and 4B (dark line on right side of the curve; light line on left side of the curve). [0184] A modification of Equation 2 can be used to gener\u00ad ate a plot that is more intuitive to an assay developer. This plot is in terms OfT2 and particle diameter with linear units rather than logarithmic units (FIG. 2). As discussed above, magnetic relaxation biosensor assays function due to a transition between dispersed and clustered states. For a given agglom- erative assay, the measured T2 can follow one of two path\u00ad ways over the course of an analyte titration. The population of dispersed particles can cluster in a uniform manner leading to an increase in average particle size that is proportional to the amount of analyte that has been added. This type of agglom\u00ad eration is termed the monodisperse model because it would lead to a monodisperse intermediate population of particles. In this case, T2 would be expected to decrease as particle size increases as long as the system is within the motional aver\u00ad aging regime. As the system approaches and enters the visit limited regime the T2 would increase with particle size (FIG. 4C). [0185] A different type of agglomeration that may occur is one in which the addition of analyte seeds the self-assembly of clusters, a process with energetics similar to crystal forma\u00ad tion or fractal aggregation. For this model one would expect a preferred size for particle clusters that depended on the con\u00ad ditions of the solution. Systems that followed this model US 2013/0260367 A l 26Oct. 3, 2013 would exhibit polydisperse intermediate populations; one would find a mixture of particles with discrete sizes. Given two discrete populations, dispersed particles and clustered particles, the system would transition between the T2 value of the starting monodisperse population of unclustered particles and the final T2 value of the fully clustered particles. For both models, full titration may lead to a monodisperse solution of clustered particles. Although the exact energetics, kinetics, and thermodynamics of particle agglomeration will depend on characteristics of the assay system such as valency and binding affinities, these two models are instructive in under\u00ad standing the dependencies and possible scenarios one may encounter during MRSw biosensor design. [0186] There are two regimes for particle clustering and T2 affects based on particle size (see FIG. 4D, the boundary is typically ca. 100 nm diameter particles). For any given assay of a liquid sample the particle count for 250 nm sized mag\u00ad netic particles can be ca. IxlO7 particles, whereas for 30 nm sized magnetic particles can be ca. I xl O 13. This is because the smaller particles have a lower relaxivity per particle (for the same type of material), resulting in an inherent sensitivity disadvantage. In a typical assay of the invention, the magnetic particles are selected such that T2 increases with an increase in the fraction of aggregated particles. [0187] The assay of the invention can be designed to change the direction of T2 in the presence of analyte (see FIGS. 5A-5C). For example, the assay can be an agglomera- tive sandwich immunoassay in which two populations of magnetic particles bind to different epitopes of an analyte (see FIG. 5A); a competitive assay in which analyte competes with a multivalent binding agents to inhibit the aggregation of magnetic particles (see FIG. 5B); or a hybridization-mediated agglomeration in which two populations of magnetic par\u00ad ticles bind to a first and second portion of an oligonucleotide (see FIG. 5C). Additional competitive format might include when two particles binding moieties bind without agglom- erator (e.g. the DNA oligonucleotides are designed so that two nanoparticles have two different oligos and they can anneal together and when heated the analyte or amplicon or target DNA competes or disrupts the np annealing). [0188] Other formats for carrying out the assays of the invention can be used, such as: (i) a target sample can be incubated in the presence of a magnetic particle that has been decorated with binding moieties specific to a target analyte and a multivalent binding agent, in an inhibition assay the binding of the analyte to the magnetic particles blocks agglomeration of the magnetic particles with the multivalent binding agent; (ii) a target sample can be incubated in the presence of a magnetic particle that has been decorated with binding moieties specific to a target analyte and a multivalent binding agent, in a disaggregation assay the analyte is exposed to a pre-formed aggregate of the multivalent binding agent and the magnetic particle and the analyte displaces the multivalent binding agent to reduce aggregation in the liquid sample; or (iii) a target sample can be incubated in the pres\u00ad ence of a magnetic particle that has been decorated with binding moieties specific to a target analyte and the target analyte itself to form a self-assembling single population of magnetic particles, in an inhibition assay or disaggregation assay the presence the binding of the analyte to the magnetic particles blocks the self agglomeration of the magnetic par\u00ad ticles; or (iv) a target sample can be incubated in the presence of a soluble agglomerating agent and a magnetic particle decorated with the analyte or analog of the analyte, in aninhibition assay the presence of the analyte binds the soluble agent blocking the agglomeration multivalent binding agent (agglomerant) is employed, multiple analytes are linked to a carrier (e.g., a simple synthetic scaffold, or a larger carrier protein or polysaccharide, such as BSA, transferrin, or dextran). [0190] Magnetic Particles [0191] The magnetic particles described herein include those described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 7,564,245 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003-0092029, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The magnetic par\u00ad ticles are generally in the form of conjugates, that is, a mag\u00ad netic particle with one or more binding moieties (e.g., an oligonucleotide, nucleic acid, polypeptide, or polysaccha\u00ad ride) linked thereto. The binding moiety causes a specific interaction with a target analyte. The binding moiety specifi\u00ad cally binds to a selected target analyte, for example, a nucleic acid, polypeptide, or polysaccharide. In some instances, bind\u00ad ing causes aggregation of the conjugates, resulting in a change, e.g., a decrease (e.g., in the case of smaller magnetic particles) or an increase (e.g., in the case of larger magnetic particles) in the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) of adjacent water protons in an aqueous solution (or protons in a non- aqueous solvent). Alternatively, the analyte binds to a pre\u00ad formed aggregate in a competitive disaggregation assay (e.g., an aggregate formed from a multivalent binding agent and magnetic particles), or competes with a multivalent binding agent for binding moieties on the magnetic particles in an inhibition assay (Fe., the formation of aggregates is inhibited in the presence of the analyte). [0192] The conjugates have high relaxivity owing to the superparamagnetism of their iron, metal oxide, or other ferro or ferrimagnetic nanomaterials. Iron, cobalt, and nickel com\u00ad pounds and their alloys, rare earth elements such as gado\u00ad linium, and certain intermetallics such as gold and vanadium are ferromagnets can be used to produce superparamagnetic particles. The magnetic particles can be monodisperse (a single crystal of a magnetic material, e.g., metal oxide, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide, per magnetic particle) or polydisperse (e.g., a plurality of crystals per magnetic par\u00ad ticle). The magnetic metal oxide can also include cobalt, magnesium, zinc, or mixtures of these metals with iron. Important features and elements of magnetic particles that are useful to produce conjugates include: (i) a high relaxivity, Te., strong effect on water (or other solvent) relaxation, (ii) a functional group to which the binding moiety can be covalently attached, (iii) a low non-specific binding of inter\u00ad active moieties to the magnetic particle, and/or (iv) stability in solution, Te., the magnetic particles remain suspended in solution, not precipitated and/or the nps retain their ability to be employed in the described method (i.e. the nps have a shelf life). [0193] The magnetic particles may be linked to the binding moieties via functional groups. In some embodiments, the magnetic particles can be associated with a polymer that includes functional groups selected, in part, to enhance the magnetic particles nonspecific reversibility. The polymer can be a synthetic polymer, such as, but not limited to, polyeth\u00ad ylene glycol or silane, natural polymers, or derivatives of either synthetic or natural polymers or a combination of these. The polymer may be hydrophilic. In some embodiments, the polymer \"coating\" is not a continuous film around the mag\u00ad netic metal oxide, but is a \"mesh\" or \"cloud\" of extended US 2013/0260367 A l 27Oct. 3, 2013 polymer chains attached to and surrounding the metal oxide. The polymer can include polysaccharides and derivatives, including dextran, pullanan, carboxydextran, carboxmethyl dextran, and/or reduced carboxymethyl dextran. The metal oxide can be a collection of one or more crystals that contact each other, or that are individually entrapped or surrounded by the polymer. [0194] Alternatively, the magnetic particles can be associ\u00ad ated with non-polymeric functional group compositions. Methods of synthesizing stabilized, functionalized magnetic particles without associated polymers are described, for example, in Halbreich et ah, Biochimie, 80:379 (1998). [0195] The magnetic particles typically include metal oxide mono and polycrystals of about 1-25 nm, e.g., about 3-10 nm, or about 5 nm in diameter per crystal. The magnetic particles can also include a polymer component in the form of a core and/or coating, e.g., about 5 to 20 nm thick or more. The overall size of the magnetic particles can be, e.g., from 20 to 50 nm, from 50 to 200 nm, from 100 to 300 nm, from 250 to 500 nm, from 400 to 600 nm, from 500 to 750 nm, from 700 to 1,200 nm, from 1,000 to 1,500 nm, or from 1,500 to 2,000 nm. [0196] The magnetic particles may be prepared in a variety of ways. It is preferred that the magnetic particle have func\u00ad tional groups that link the magnetic particle to the binding moiety. Carboxy functionalized magnetic particles can be made, for example, according to the method of Gorman (see PCT Publication No. WO00/61191). Inthis method, reduced carboxymethyl cial dextran. The CM-dextran and iron salts are mixed together and are then neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. The resulting carboxy functionalized magnetic particles can be used for coupling amino functionalized oligonucleotides. Carboxy-functionalized magnetic particles can also be made from polysaccharide coated magnetic particles by reaction with bromo or chloroacetic acid in strong base to attach carboxyl groups. In addition, carboxy-functionalized par\u00ad ticles can be made from amino-functionalized magnetic par\u00ad ticles by converting amino to carboxy groups by the use of reagents such as succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride. [0197] Magnetic particle size can be controlled by adjust\u00ad ing reaction conditions, for example, by using low tempera\u00ad ture during the neutralization of iron salts with a base as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,176. Uniform particle size materials can also be made by fractionating the particles using centrifugation, ultrafiltration, or gel filtration, as described, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,814. [0198] Magnetic particles can also be synthesized accord\u00ad ing to the method of Molday (Molday, D. MacK- enzie, \"Immunospecific ferromagnetic reagents for the labeling separation of cells,\" J. Immu\u00ad nol. Methods, 52:353 (1982)), and treated with periodate to form aldehyde groups. The aldehyde-containing magnetic particles can then be reacted with a diamine (e.g., ethylene diamine or hexanediamine), which will form a Schiff base, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride. [0199] Dextran-coated magnetic particles can be made and cross-linked with epichlorohydrin. The addition of ammonia reacts with epoxy groups to generate amine groups, see Hoge- mann, D., et al., Improvement of MRI probes to allow effi\u00ad cient detection of gene expression Bioconjug. Chem., 11:941 (2000), and Josephson et al., \"High-efficiency intracellular magnetic labeling with novel superparamagnetic-Tat peptideconjugates,\" Bioconjug. Chem., 10:186 (1999). This material is known as cross-linked iron oxide or \"CLIO\" and when functionalized with amine is referred to as amine-CLIO or NH2\u2014CLIO. Carboxy-functionalized magnetic particles can be converted to amino-functionalized magnetic particles by the use of water-soluble carbodiimides and diamines such as ethylene diamine or hexane diamine. [0200] The magnetic particles can be formed from a ferrof- Iuid (i.e., a stable colloidal suspension of magnetic particles). For example, the magnetic particle can be a composite of including multiple metal oxide crystals of the order of a few tens of nanometers in size and dispersed in a fluid containing a surfactant, which adsorbs onto the particles and stabilizes them, or by precipitation, in a basic medium, of a solution of metal ions. Suitable ferrofluids are sold by the company Liq\u00ad uids Research Ltd. under the references: WHKSIS9 (A, B or C), which is a water-based ferrofluid including magnetite (Fe30 4), having particles 10 nm in diameter; WHJSI (A, B or C), which par\u00ad dextran, including particles of magnetite (Fe3O4) 9 nm in diameter. Other suitable ferrofluids for use in the systems and methods of the invention are oleic acid-stabilized ferrofluids available from Ademtech, which include ca. 70% weight Ci-Fe2O3 particles (ca. 10 nm in diameter), 15% weight octane, and 15% weight oleic acid. [0201] The magnetic particles are typically a composite including multiple metal oxide crystals and an organic matrix, and having a surface decorated with functional groups (i.e., amine groups or carboxy groups) for the linking binding moieties to the surface of the magnetic particle. For example, the magnetic particles useful in the methods of the invention include those commercially available Invitrogen, and Ademtech, as well as those described herein by reference. [0202] Avidin or streptavidin can be attached to magnetic particles for use with a biotinylated binding moiety, such as an oligonucleotide or polypeptide (see, e.g., Shen et ah, \"Mag\u00ad netically labeled secretin retains receptor affinity to pancreas acinar cells,\" Bioconjug. Chem., 7:311 (1996)). Similarly, biotin can be attached to a magnetic particle for use with an avidin-labeled binding moiety. Alternatively, the binding moiety is covalently linked to the surface of the magnetic particle; the particles may be decorated with IgG molecules; the particles may be decorated with anti his antibodies; or the particles may be decorated with his-tagged FAbs. [0203] Low molecular weight materials can be separated from the magnetic particles by ultra-filtration, dialysis, mag\u00ad netic separation, or other means prior to use. For example, unreacted binding moieties and linking agents can be sepa\u00ad rated from the magnetic particle conjugates by magnetic separation or size exclusion chromatography. In certain instances the magnetic particles can be fractionated by size to produce mixtures of particles of a particular size range and average diameter. [0204] For certain assays requiring high sensitivity, analyte detection using T2 relaxation assays can require selecting a proper particle to enable sufficiently sensitive analyte-in\u00ad duced agglomeration. Higher sensitivities can be achieved US 2013/0260367 A l 28Oct. 3, 2013 using particles that contain multiple superparamagnetic iron oxide cores (5-15 nm diameter) within a single larger polymer matrix or ferrofluid assembly (100 nm-1200 nm total diam\u00ad eter, such as particles having an average diameter of 100 nm, 200 nm, 250 nm, 300 nm, 500 nm, 800 nm, or 1000 nm), or by using a higher magnetic moment materials or particles with higher density, and/or particles with higher iron content. Without being limited by theory, it is postulated these types of particles provided a sensitivity gain of over 100x due to a much higher number of iron atoms per particle, which is believed to lead to an increase in sensitivity due to the decreased number of particles present in the assay solution and possibly a higher amount of superparamagnetic iron affected by each clustering event. [0205] Relaxivity per particle and particle size is one useful term for selecting an optimal particle for high sensitivity assays. Ideally, this term will be as large as possible. Relax- ivity per particle is a measure of the effect of each particle on the measured T2 value. The larger this number, the fewer the number of particles needed to elicit a given T2 response. Furthermore, lowering the concentration of particles in the reactive solution can improve the analytical sensitivity of the assay. Relaxivity per particle can be a more useful parameter in that the iron density and relaxivity can vary from magnetic particle to magnetic particle, depending upon the components used to make the particles (see Table I). Relaxivity per par\u00ad ticle is proportional to the saturation magnetization of a superparamagnetic material.

The mag\u00ad netic particles used in the systems and methods of the inven\u00ad tion can be any of the designs, composites, or sources described above, and can be further modified has described herein for use as a magnetic resonance switch. [0208] In addition to relaxivity per particle, several other practical issues must be address in the selection and design of magnetic particles for high analytical sensitivity assays. [0209] For example, the use of large particles (i.e., IOOOnm or greater) may be desired to maximize iron content and the relaxivity per particle. Flowever, we have observed that par\u00ad ticles of this size tend to settle rapidly out of solution. We have observed that particle settling does not typically interfere with the assay if magnetic particle sizes are kept below 500 nm. When use of a particle above 500 nm in the described assays or smaller particles with high density are employed, settling is monitored and effect on T2 measurement is deter\u00ad mined. We have found a magnetic particle size of about 100- 300 nm particle to be ideal for stability in terms of settling, even after functionalization (increasing the hydrodynamic diameter to 300 nm by approximately 50 nm), and to afford the high sensitivity enabled by a high relaxivity per particle. Particle density certainly plays a role in buoyancy. As such, the relative density of the solution and particles plays an important role in settling of the particle. Accordingly, a pos\u00ad sible solution to this problem is the use of buoyant magnetic particles (i.e., a hollow particle, or particle containing both a low density matrix and high density metal oxide). Settling may affect the T2 detection, thus, solution additives may be employed to change the ratio of the particle to solution den\u00ad sity. T2 detection can be impacted by settling if there is a significant portioning of the superparamagentic material from the measured volume of liquid. Settling can be assessed by diluting the particles to a concentration such that UV-Vis absorbance at 410 nm is between 0.6-0.8 absorbance units and then monitoring the absorbance for 90 minutes. If settling occurs, the difference between the initial and final absor\u00ad bances divided by the initial absorbance will be greater than 5%. If % settling is above 5% then the particle is typically not suitable for use in assays requiring high analytical sensitivity. The magnetic particles used in the assay s of the invention canbe, but are not limited to, nonsettling magnetic particles. Fligh settling represents handling difficulties andmay leadto repro\u00ad ducibility issues. [0210] For magnetic particles on the order of 100 nm or larger, the multiple superparamagnetic iron oxide crystals that typically include the particle core results in a net dipole moment when in the presence of external magnetic fields, i.e. the dipole monment is a sufficient force to overcome Brown\u00ad ian motion. Nonspecific reversibility is a measure of the col\u00ad loidal stability and robustness against non-specific aggrega\u00ad tion. Nonspecific reversibility is assessed by measuring the T2 values of a solution of particles before and after incubation in a uniform magnetic field (defined as <5000 ppm). Starting T2 values are typically 200 ms for a particle with an iron con\u00ad centration of 0.01 mM Fe. If the difference in T2 values before and after incubation in the uniform magnetic field is less than 20 ms, the samples are deemed reversible. Further, 10% is a threshold allowing starting T2 measurements to reflect assay particle concentration. If the difference is greater than 10%, then the particles exhibit irreversibility in the buffer, diluents, and matrix tested. The MAA reversibility of the magnetic particles can be altered as described herein. For example, colloidal stability and robustness against non-specific aggre\u00ad gation can be influenced by the surface characteristics of the particles, the binding moieties, the assay buffer, the matrix and the assay processing conditions. Maintenance of colloi\u00ad dal stability and resistance to non-specific biding can be altered by conjugation chemistry, blocking methods, buffer modifications, and/or changes in assay processing condi\u00ad tions. [0211] We have observed that a very important attribute for robust and reproducible assays is the monodispersity in the size distribution of the magnetic particles used, a distinction observed in polydisperse particles post-coating versus mono- disperse particle pre-coating. Polydisperse batches lack reproducibility and compromise sen\u00ad sitivity. Polydisperse samples can also present problems in terms of achieving uniform coatings. For certain highly sen\u00ad sitive assays it is desirable that the magnetic particles be substantially monodisperse in size distribution (i.e., having a polydispersity index of less than about 0.8-0.9). Alternatively, the assays of the invention can be designed to accommodate the use of polydisperse magnetic particles. [0212] Given that the assays of the invention require moni\u00ad toring a shift in the clustering states of the agglomeration assays and that measuring a change in clustering likely requires a significant fraction of clustered particles (e.g., thought to be >1-10%), the total number of particles in an assay should be minimized to enable the highest sensitivity. However, sufficient number of particles must be present to allow utilization of the T2 detection dynamic range. We have found that the highest sensitivity is observed when the num\u00ad ber of magnetic particles (or molar equivalent) is approxi\u00ad mately on the same order of magnitude of the number (or molar equivalent) of the analyte being detected, and the mag\u00ad nitude of the number (or molar equivalent) multivalent bind\u00ad agents employed (i.e., in an inhibition assay). [0213] Forproteinaceous samples it may also be required to modify the magnetic particle surface to reduce non-specific binding of background proteins to the magnetic particles. Non-specific binding of background proteins to particles can induce or impede particle clustering, resulting in false signals and/or false lack of signals. For example, in some instances the surface of the magnetic particle can include blocking US 2013/0260367 A l 30Oct. 3, 2013 agents covalently linked to the surface of the magnetic par\u00ad ticle which reduce non-specific binding of background pro\u00ad teins. There are a variety of agents that one could use to achieve the desired effect, and in some cases, it is a combi\u00ad nation of agents that is optimal (see Table 3; exemplary par\u00ad ticles, coatings, and binding moieties). TABLE 3 ammo DextranAntibody NP-amino: his-tagged antibody [0214] Thus, we have found a protein block may be required to achieve assay activity and sensitivity, particularly in proteinaceous samples (e.g., plasma samples or whole blood samples), that is comparable to results in nonproteina- ceous buffer samples. Some commonly used protein blockers which may be used in provided preparations include, e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA), fish skin gelatin lysozyme, casein, peptidase, or non\u00ad fat dry milk. In certain embodiments a magnetic particle coating includes BSA or FSG. In other embodiments, a com\u00ad bination of coatings are combinations of those exemplary coatings listed in Table 3. [0215] Furthermore, nonspecific binding can be due to lip\u00ad ids or other non-proteinaceous molecules in the biological sample. For non-proteinaceous mediated non-specific bind\u00ad ing, changes in pFl and buffer ionic strength maybe selected to enhance the particle repulsive forces, but not enough to limit the results of the intended interactions. [0216] Assay Reagents [0217] The assays of the invention can include reagents for reducing the non-specific binding to the magnetic particles. For example, the assay can include one or more proteins (e.g., albumin, fish skin gelatin, lysozyme, or transferrin); low molecular weight ethylamine, or mercaptoethanol soluble yleneglycol, Tween\u00ae 20, Tween\u00ae 80, Pluronic\u00ae, or Igepal\u00ae) (see albumin small amine Other surfactants/detergents [0218] The surfactant may be selected from a wide variety of soluble non-ionic surface active agents including surfac\u00ad tants that are generally commercially available under the IGEPAL trade name from GAF Company. The IGEPAL surfactants are polyethylene glycol p-isooc- tylphenyl ether compounds and are available in various molecular weight designations, for example, IGEPAL CA720, include those available under the trade name TETRONIC 909 from BASF Wyandotte Corpo\u00ad ration. This material is a tetra-functional block copolymer surfactant terminating in primary hydroxyl groups. Suitable non-ionic surfactants are also available under the VISTA ALPFIONIC trade name from Vista Chemical Company and such materials are ethoxylates that are non-ionic biodegrad- ables derived from linear primary alcohol blends of various molecular weights. The surfactant may also be selected from poloxamers, such as polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers, such as those available under the trade names Synperonic PE series (ICI), such propylene gly\u00ad col. [0219] Such non-ionic surfactants may be selected to pro\u00ad vide an appropriate amount of detergency for an assay with\u00ad out having a deleterious effect on assay reactions. In particu\u00ad lar, surfactants may be included in a reaction mixture for the purpose of suppressing non-specific interactions among vari\u00ad ous ingredients of the aggregation assays of the invention. The non-ionic surfactants are typically added to the liquid sample prior in an amount from 0.01% (w/w) to 5% (w/w). used in combina\u00ad tion with one or more proteins (e.g., albumin, fish skin gela\u00ad tin, lysozyme, or transferrin) also added to the liquid sample prior in an amount from 0.01% (w/w) to 5% (w/w). [0221] Furthermore, the assays, methods, and cartridge units of the invention can include additional suitable buffer components (e.g., Tris base, selected to provide a pFl of about 7.8 to 8.2 in the reaction milieu); and chelating agents to salts thereof). [0222] Binding Moieties [0223] In general, a binding moiety is a molecule, synthetic or natural, that specifically binds or otherwise links to, e.g., covalently or non-covalently binds to or hybridizes with, a target molecule, or with another binding moiety (or, in certain embodiments, with an aggregation inducing molecule). For example, the binding moiety can be an antibody directed US 2013/0260367 A l 31Oct. 3, 2013 toward an antigen or any protein-protein interaction. Alterna\u00ad tively, the binding moiety can be a polysaccharide that binds to a corresponding taiget or a synthetic oligonucleotide that hybridizes to a specific complementary nucleic acid taiget. In certain embodiments, the binding moieties can be designed or selected to serve, when bound to another binding moiety, as substrates for a target molecule such as enzyme in solution. [0224] Binding moieties include, for example, oligonucle\u00ad otide binding moieties RNA, substituted or moieties are oligonucleotides, attached/linked to the magnetic particles using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single, e.g., cova\u00ad lent, bond, e.g., at the 3' or 5' end to a functional group on the magnetic particle. Such binding moieties can be used in the systems, devices, and methods of the invention to detect mutations (e.g., SNPs, translocations, large deletions, small deletions, insertions, substitutions) or to monitor gene expression (e.g., the presence of expression, or changes in the level of gene expression, monitoring RNA transcription), or CHP analysis characteristic of the presence of a pathogen, disease state, or the progression of disease. [0227] An oligonucleotide binding moiety can be con\u00ad structed using chemical synthesis. A double-stranded DNA binding moiety can be constructed by enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, a nucleic acid (e.g., an oligonucleotide) can be chemically syn\u00ad thesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological sta\u00ad bility of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the complementary strands, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucle\u00ad otides can be used. The nucleic acid also can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned. [0228] One method uses at least two populations of oligo\u00ad nucleotide magnetic particles, each with strong effects on water (or other solvent) relaxation. As the oligonucleotide- magnetic particle conjugates react with a target oligonucle\u00ad otide, they form aggregates (e.g., clusters of magnetic par\u00ad ticles). Upon prolonged standing, e.g., overnight at room temperature, the aggregates form large clusters (micron-sized clusters). Using the methods of the invention, the formation of large clusters can be accomplished more quickly by employing multiple cycles of magnetic assisted agglomera\u00ad tion. Magnetic resonance is used to determine the relaxation properties of the solvent, which are altered when the mixture of magnetic oligonucleotide magnetic particles reacts with a target nucleic acid to form aggregates. [0229] Certain embodiments employ a mixture of at least two types of magnetic metal oxide magnetic particles, each with a specific sequence of oligonucleotide, and each with more than one copy of the oligonucleotide attached, e.g., covalently, per magnetic particle. For example, the assay protocol may involve preparing a mixture of populations of oligonucleotide-magnetic particle conjugates and reacting the mixture with a taiget nucleic acid. Alternatively, oligo\u00ad nucleotide-magnetic particle conjugates can be reacted with the target in a sequential fashion. Certain embodiments fea\u00ad ture the use of magnetic resonance to detect the reaction of the oligonucleotide-magnetic particle conjugates with the targetnucleic acid. When a target is present, the dispersed conju\u00ad gates self-assemble to form small aggregates. [0230] For example, oligonucleotide binding moieties can be linked to the metal oxide through covalent attachment to a functionalized polymer or to non-polymeric surface-func\u00ad tionalized metal oxides. In the latter method, the magnetic particles can be synthesized according to the method of Albrecht et ah, Biochimie, 80:379 (1998). Dimercapto-suc- cinic acid is coupled to the iron oxide and provides a carboxyl functional group. [0231] In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are attached to magnetic particles via a functionalized polymer associated with the metal oxide. In some embodiments, the polymer is hydrophilic. In certain embodiments, the conju\u00ad gates are made using oligonucleotides that have terminal amino, sulfhydryl, or phosphate groups, and superparamag- netic iron oxide magnetic particles bearing amino or carboxy groups on a hydrophilic polymer. There are several methods for synthesizing carboxy and amino derivatized-magnetic particles. [0232] In one embodiment, oligonucleotides are attached to a particle via ligand-protein binding interaction, such as biotin-streptavidin, where the ligand is covalently attached to the oligonucleotide and the protein to the particle, or vice versa. This approach can allow for more rapid reagent prepa\u00ad ration. [0233] Other forms of oligonucleotides may be used. For example, aptamers are single-stranded RNA or DNA oligo\u00ad nucleotides 15 to 60 base in length that in solution form intramolecular interactions that fold the linear nucleic acid molecule into a three dimensional complex that then can bind with high affinity to specific molecular targets; often with equilibrium constants in the range of I pM to I nM which is similar to some monoclonal antibodies-antigen interactions. Aptamers can specifically bind to other nucleic acid mol\u00ad ecules, proteins, small organic compounds, small molecules, and cells (organisms or pathogens). [0234] Polypeptide Binding Moieties [0235] In certain embodiments, is a polypeptide (i.e., a protein, polypeptide, or peptide), attached, using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single covalent bond in such a manner so as to not affect the bio\u00ad logical activity of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, attachment is done through the thiol group of single reactive cysteine residue so placed that its modification does not affect the biological activity of the polypeptide. In this regard the use of linear polypeptides, with cysteine at the C-terminal or N-terminal end, provides a single thiol in a manner similar to which alkanethiol supplies a thiol group at the 3' or 5' end of an oligonucleotide. Similar bifunctional conjugation reagents, such as SPDP and reacting with the amino group of the magnetic particle and thiol group of the polypeptide, can be used with any thiol bearing binding moiety. The types of polypeptides used as binding moieties can be antibodies, antibody fragments, and natural and synthetic polypeptide sequences. The peptide binding moieties have a binding part\u00ad ner, that is, a molecule to which they selectively bind. [0236] Use of peptides as binding moieties offers several advantages. For example, polypeptides can be engineered to have uniquely reactive residues, distal from the residues required for biological activity, for attachment to the mag\u00ad netic particle. The reactive residue can be a cysteine thiol, an N-terminal amino group, a C-terminal carboxyl group or a carboxyl group of aspartate or glutamate, etc. A single reac\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 32Oct. 3, 2013 tive residue on the peptide is used to insure a unique site of attachment. These design principles can be followed with chemically synthesized peptides or biologically produced polypeptides. [0237] The binding moieties can also contain amino acid sequences from naturally occurring (wild-type) polypeptides or proteins. For example, the natural polypeptide may be a hormone, (e.g., a cytokine, a growth factor), a serum protein, a viral protein (e.g., hemagglutinin), an extracellular matrix protein, a lectin, or an ectodomain of a cell surface protein. Another example is a ligand binding protein, such as strepta- vidin or avidin that bind biotin. In general, the resulting binding moiety-magnetic particle is used to measure the pres\u00ad ence of analytes in a test media reacting with the binding moiety. [0238] Additionally, a polypeptide binding moiety can be used in a universal reagent configuration, where the target of the binding moiety (e.g., small molecule, ligand, or binding partner) is pre-attached to the target analyte to create a labeled analyte that, in the presence of the polypeptide decorated particles, induces clustering. [0239] Examples of protein hormones which can be uti\u00ad lized as binding moieties include, without limitation, platelet- derived factor (PDGF), which factor which binds the NGF receptor; fibroblast growth factor (FGF), binds the (e.g., aFGF and bFGF); epidermal growth factor (EGF), which binds the receptor; transforming growth factor (TGF, e.g., TGFa and TGF-(I), which bind the TGF receptor; erythropoietin, which binds the erythropoitin receptor; growth hormone (e.g., human growth hormone), which binds the growth hormone receptor; and proinsulin, insulin, A-chain insulin, and B-chain insulin, which all bind to the insulin receptor. [0240] Receptor binding moieties are useful for detecting and imaging receptor clustering on the surface of a cell. Useful ectodomains include those of the Notch protein, Delta protein, integrins, cadherins, and other cell that include at least one immu\u00ad noglobulin domain, and typically at least two such domains. An \"immunoglobulin domain\" refers to a domain of an anti\u00ad body molecule, e.g., a variable or constant domain. An \"immunoglobulin superfamily domain\" refers to a domain that has a three-dimensional structure related to an immuno\u00ad globulin domain, but is from a non-immunoglobulin mol\u00ad ecule. Immunoglobulin domains and immunoglobulin super\u00ad family domains typically include two (5 -sheets formed of about seven (5-strands, and a conserved disulfide bond (see, e.g., Williams and Barclay Ann. Rev Immunol., 6:381 (1988)). Proteins that include domains of the Ig superfamily domains include T cell receptors, CD4, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and intercellular (ICAM). [0243] One type of immunoglobulin binding moiety is an antibody. The term \"antibody,\" as used herein, refers to a full-length, two-chain immunoglobulin molecule and an gen-binding portion and fragments thereof, including syn\u00ad thetic variants. A typical antibody includes two heavy (Fl) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VFl), and two light (L) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VL).The VFl and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed \"complementarity deter\u00ad mining regions\" (CDR), interspersed are more conserved, termed \"framework regions\" (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDR's has been precisely defined (see, Rabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Flealth and Fluman Services, NUT Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia al., J. Mol. Biol, 196:901 (1987)). EachVH and VL is composed of CDR's and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in FR3, CDR3, and FR4. [0244] An antibody can also include a constant region as part of a light or heavy chain. Light chains can include a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus (termed CL). Heavy chains can include, for example, a gamma constant region (IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4; encoding about 330 amino acids). A gamma constant region can include, e.g, CHI, CH2, and CH3. The term \"full-length antibody\" refers to a protein that includes one polypeptide that includes VL and CL, and a second polypeptide that includes VH, CHI, CH2, and CH3. [0245] The term \"antigen-binding fragment\" of an anti\u00ad body, as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target. Examples of antigen-binding fragments include, but are not limited to: (i) an Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL,VH, CLandCHl domains; (ii) an F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment including two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHl domains; (iv) an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al, Nature 341:544 (1989)), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g. Bird et al, Science 242:423 (1988); Huston et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879 (1988)). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding fragment.\" [0246] A single domain antibody (sdAb, nanobody) is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antibody domain, and may also be used in the systems and methods of the invention. Like a whole antibody, sdAbs are able to bind selectively to a specific antigen. With a molecular weight of only 12-15 kDa, single domain antibodies are much smaller than common antibodies (150-160 kDa) which are composed of two heavy protein chains and two light chains, and even smaller than Fab fragments (-50 kDa, one light chain and half a heavy chain) and single-chain variable frag\u00ad ments (-25 kDa, two variable domains, one from a light and one from a heavy chain). [0247] Polysaccharide Binding Moieties [0248] In certain embodiments, the binding moiety is a polysaccharide, linked, for example, using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single bond, e.g, a covalent bond, at one of the two ends, to a functional group on the magnetic particle. The polysaccharides can be synthetic or natural. Mono-, di-, tri- and polysaccharides can be used as the binding moiety. These include, e.g, glycosides, N-glycosylamines, O-acyl US 2013/0260367 A 33Oct. 3, 2013 O-methyl derivatives, osazones, sugar alcohols, sugar acids, sugar phosphates when used with appropriate attachment chemistry to the magnetic particle. [0249] A method of accomplishing linking is to couple avidin to a magnetic particle and react the avidin-magnetic particle with commercially available biotinylated polysac\u00ad charides, to yield polysaccharide-magnetic particle conju\u00ad gates. For example, sialyl Lewis based polysaccharides are commercially available as biotinylated reagents and will (Slex) is recognized by proteins known as Selectins, which are present on the surfaces of leukocytes and function as part of the inflammatory cascade for the recruitment of leukocytes. [0250] Still other targeting moieties include a non-pro- teinaceous element, e.g., a glycosyl modification (such as a Lewis antigen) or another non-proteinaceous organic mol\u00ad ecule. Another method is covalent coupling of the protein to the magnetic particle. [0251] Another feature of the methods includes identifica\u00ad tion of specific cell types, for hematological orhistopatholgi- cal investigations for example CD4/CD3 cell counts and cir\u00ad culating tumor cells using any of the binding moieties described above. [0252] Multivalent Binding Agents [0253] The assays of the invention can include a multiva\u00ad lent binding agent (i) bearing multiple analytes are linked to a carrier (e.g., a simple synthetic scaffold, or a larger carrier protein or polysaccharide, such as BSA, transferrin, or dext- ran), or bearing multiple epitopes for binding to, for example, two or more populations of magnetic particles to form an aggregate. [0254] Where a multivalent binding agent is employed, multiple analytes can be linked to a carrier (e.g., a simple synthetic scaffold, or a larger carrier protein or polysaccha\u00ad ride, such as BSA, transferrin, or dextran). Alternatively, the multivalent binding agent can be a nucleic acid designed to bind to two or more populations of magnetic particles. Such multivalent binding agents act as agglomerants and the assay architecture is characterized by a competition between the analyte being detected and the multivalent binding agent (e.g., disaggre\u00ad assay). [0255] The functional group, present in the analyte can be used to form a covalent bond with the carrier. Alternatively, the analyte can be derivatized to provide a linker (i.e., a spacer separating the analyte from the carrier in the conjugate) ter\u00ad minating in a functional group (i.e., an alcohol, an amine, a carboxyl group, a sulfhydryl group, or a phosphate group), which is used to form the covalent linkage with the carrier. [0256] The covalent linking of an analyte and a carrier may be effected using a linker which contains reactive moieties capable of reaction with such functional groups present in the analyte and the carrier. For example, a hydroxyl group of the analyte may react with a carboxyl group of the linker, or an activated derivative thereof, resulting in the formation of an ester linking the two. [0257] Examples of moieties capable of reaction with sulf\u00ad hydryl groups include a-haloacetyl compounds of the type XCFl2CO\u2014 (where X=Br, Cl or I), which show particular reactivity for sulfhydryl groups, but which can also be used to modify imidazolyl, thioether, phenol, and amino groups as described by Gurd, Methods Enzymol. 11:532 (1967).N-Ma- leimide derivatives are also considered selective towards sulf\u00adhydryl groups, but may additionally be useful in coupling to amino groups under certain conditions. Reagents such as 2-iminothiolane (Traut et ah, Biochemistry 12:3266 (1973)), which introduce a thiol group through conversion of an amino group, may be considered as sulfhydryl reagents if linking occurs through the formation of disulphide bridges. [0258] Examples of reactive moieties capable of reaction with amino groups include, for example, alkylating and acy- lating agents. Representative alkylating agents include: (i) a-haloacetyl compounds, which show specificity towards amino groups in the absence of reactive thiol groups and are of the type XCH2CO\u2014 (where X =C l, Br or I), for example, as described by Wong, Biochemistry 24:5337 (1979); (ii) N-maleimide derivatives, which may react with amino groups either through a Michael type reaction or through acylation by addition to the ring carbonyl group, for example, as described by Smyth et ah, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 82:4600 (1960) and Biochem. J. alkyl halides, as described, for example, by McKenzie et ah, J. Protein Chem. 7:581 (1988); (v) aldehydes and ketones capable of SchifPs base formation with amino groups, the adducts formed usu\u00ad ally being stabilized through reduction to give a stable amine; (vi) epoxide derivatives such as epichlorohydrin and bisox- iranes, may with amino, phenolic hydroxyl groups; (vii) chlorine-containing derivatives of s-triazines, are as and hydroxyl groups; (viii) aziridines based on s-triazine compounds detailed above, e.g., as described by Ross, J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2:1 (1954), which react with nucleophiles such as amino groups by ring open\u00ad ing; (ix) squaric acid diethyl esters as Ber. (x) a-haloalkyl ethers, more reactive alkylating agents than normal alkyl halides because of the activation caused by the ether oxygen atom, as described by Bermeche et ah, Eur. J. Med. Chem. 28:463 (1993). [0259] Representative amino-reactive acylating agents include: (i) isocyanates and isothiocyanates, particularly aro\u00ad which and thiourea deriva\u00ad tives respectively; (ii) sulfonyl chlorides, et ah, Biopolymers 2:349 (1964); (iii) acid nitrophenylesters or N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters; (v) acid anhydrides such as mixed, symmetrical, orN-carboxyanhydrides; (vi) other use\u00ad ful reagents for amide bond formation, for example, as described by M. Bodansky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, 1984; (vii) acylazides, e.g. wherein the is from a preformed hydrazide deriva\u00ad tive using sodium and (viii) imidoesters, which form stable amidines on reaction with amino groups, for example, as described by Hunter and Ludwig, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 84:3491 (1962). Aldehydes and ketones may be reacted with amines to form SchifPs bases, which may advantageously be stabilized through reductive animation. Alkoxylamino moi\u00ad eties readily react with ketones and aldehydes to produce stable alkoxamines, for example, as described by Webb et ah, Bioconjugate Chem. 1:96 (1990). [0260] Examples of reactive moieties capable of reaction with carboxyl groups include diazo compounds such as dia\u00ad zoacetate esters and diazoacetamides, which react with high specificity to generate ester groups, for example, as described by Herriot, Adv. Protein Chem. 3:169 (1947). Carboxyl US 2013/0260367 34Oct. 3, 2013 modifying reagents such as carbodiimides, which react through O-acylurea formation followed by amide bond for\u00ad mation, may also be employed. [0261] It will be appreciated that functional groups in the analyte and/or the carrier may, if desired, be converted to other functional groups prior to reaction, for example, to confer additional reactivity or selectivity. Examples of meth\u00ad ods useful for this purpose include conversion of amines to carboxyls using reagents such as dicarboxylic anhydrides; a-haloacetates; conversion of using such carboxyls amines using reagents such as carbodiimides followed by diamines; and conversion of alcohols to thiols using reagents such tosyl chloride followed transesterification with thioacetate and hydroly\u00ad thiol acetate. [0262] So-called zero-length linkers, involving direct cova\u00ad lent joining of a reactive chemical group of the analyte with a reactive chemical group of the carrier without introducing additional linking material may, if desired, be used in accor\u00ad dance with the invention. Most commonly, however, the linker will include two or more reactive moieties, as described above, connected by a spacer element. The presence of such a spacer permits bifunctional linkers to react with specific functional groups within the analyte and the carrier, resulting in a covalent linkage between the two. The reactive moieties in a linker may be the same (homobifunctional linker) or different (heterobifunctional linker, or, reactive moieties are present, heteromultifunctional linker), providing a diversify of potential reagents that may bring about covalent attachment between the analyte and the carrier. [0263] Spacer elements in the linker typically consist of linear or branched chains and may include a Cfy1 0 alkyl, a heteroalkyl of I to 10 atoms, a Cfy1 0 alkene, a Cfy1 0 alkyne, Cfy1 0 aryl, a cyclic system of 3 to 10 atoms, o r\u2014(CH2CH2O) CH2CH2\u2014, in which n is I to 4. [0264] Typically, a multivalent binding agent will include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15, 50, or 100 (e.g., from 3 to 100, from 3 to 30, from 4 to 25, or from 6 to 20) conjugated analytes. The multivalent binding agents are typically from 10 kDa to 200 kDa in size and can be prepared as described in the Examples. [0265] Analytes [0266] Embodiments of the invention include devices, sys\u00ad tems, and/or methods for detecting and/or measuring the concentration of one or more analytes in a sample (e.g., a protein, a peptide, an enzyme, a polypeptide, an amino acid, a nucleic acid, an oligonucleotide, a therapeutic agent, a metabolite of a therapeutic agent, RNA, DNA, circulating DNA (e.g., from a cell, tumor, pathogen, or fetus), an anti\u00ad body, an organism, a virus, bacteria, a carbohydrate, a polysaccharide, glucose, a lipid, a gas (e.g., oxygen and/or carbon dioxide), an electrolyte (e.g., sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, magnesium, phosphate, cal\u00ad cium, ammonia, and/or lactate), chemistry molecules (creatinine, glucose), a lipoprotein, cholesterol, a fatty acid, a glycoprotein, a proteoglycan, and/or a lipopolysaccharide).

[0284] Other analytes which can be detected using the devices, systems, and methods of the invention include those mentioned in the Tietz Textbook of Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Burtis, Ashwood, and Bruns, ISBN 0721601898, Elsevier, A th edition (2006). [0285] The methods, kits, cartridges, and systems of the invention can be configured to detect a predetermined com\u00ad bination panel of analytes that may be used to understand the medical condition of the subject. For example, a combination panel may include detection of pathogens, therapeutic agents used to treat the suspected pathogen/s, and a potential biom\u00ad arker to monitor the therapeutic pharmacologic progress (ef\u00ad ficacy or pharmacokinetic), or monitoring the presence of the pathogen or pathogen by-products. Further, one could envi\u00ad sion a disease treatment panel configured for use to detect a disease or a disease biomarker, the level or concentration of a therapeutic drug for use in treating the suspected disease, apotential biomarker to monitor the therapeutic pharmaco\u00ad logic progress (efficacy or pharmacokinetic), and general chemistry biomarker or other physiological marker of the disease or effect of treatment. In this way, panels of analyte detection can be used to inform and lead to appropriate medi\u00ad cal decision making. [0286] For example, the systems and methods of the inven\u00ad tion can be used to monitor immuno-compromised subjects following allogenic transplantation. In transplant subjects that receive solid organ, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell, or other allogeneic donations, there is a need to monitor the immune status, organ function, and if necessary, rapidly and accurately identify opportunistic infections. Tacrolimus (also FK-506, Prograf, or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppres\u00ad sive drug whose main use is after allogeneic organ transplant to reduce the activity of the subject's immune system and so lower the risk of organ rejection. It reduces interleukin-2 (IL-2) production by T-cells. It is also used in a topical prepa\u00ad ration in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema), severe refractory uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It is a 23-membered macrolide lactone discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. It has similar immunosuppressive properties to cyclosporin, but is much more potent in equal volumes. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus was associated with a significantly lower rate of acute rejection compared with cyclosporin-based immunosuppression (30.7% vs. 46.4%) in one study. Long term outcome has not been improved to the same extent. Tacrolimus is normally prescribed as part of a post-transplant cocktail including steroids, mycophenolate and IL-2 receptor inhibitors. Dosages are titrated to taiget blood levels. Side effects can be severe and include infection, cardiac damage, hypertension, blurred vision, liver and kid\u00ad ney problems, seizures, tremors, hyperkalemia, hypomagne- saemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, itching, insomnia, and neurological problems such as confusion, loss of appe\u00ad tite, weakness, depression, cramps, and neuropathy. In addi\u00ad tion tacrolimus may potentially increase the severity of exist\u00ad ing fungal or infectious conditions such as herpes zoster or polyoma viral infections, and certain antibiotics cross-react with tacrolimus. [0287] Measuring serum creatinine is a simple test and it is the most commonly used indicator of renal function. A rise in blood creatinine levels is observed only with marked damage to functioning nephrons. Therefore, this test is not suitable for detecting early stage kidney disease. A better estimation of kidney function is given by the creatinine clearance test. Creatinine clearance can be accurately calculated using serum creatinine concentration and some or all of the follow\u00ad ing variables: sex, age, weight, and race as suggested by the American Diabetes Association without a 24 hour urine col\u00ad lection. Some laboratories will calculate the creatinine clear\u00ad ance if written on the pathology request form; and, the nec\u00ad essary age, sex, and weight are included in the subject information. [0288] There is a need to monitor creatinine and tacrolimus levels from the same blood sample from a subject as the monitoring of the drug concentration and the renal function can assist and guide the physician to optimal therapy post\u00ad transplantation. Optimizing therapy is a tight balance of pre\u00ad venting rejection but also to ensure immune function to fight opportunistic infections and overall results in enhanced sub\u00ad ject compliance to the immunosuppressive therapy. In large US 2013/0260367 A l 42Oct. 3, 2013 part, transplant recipients succumb to transplant rejection, graft versus host disease, or opportunistic infections. In the first two, immunosuppressive agents can ablate or inhibit the reactions. However, if the subject has an underlying infection, then clinical management is challenging. For a specific example, a heart, lung transplant subject presenting with fever of unknown origin enters a health care facility. The subject is started on broad spectrum antibiotics until the cul\u00ad ture results are known. If the condition worsens, and the culture reveals a specific infection, for example Candida, a specific antifungal, fluconazole, can be administered to the known subject. However, this antifungal may alter the levels of the immunosuppressive agent given to almost all allogenic transplant recipients, tacrolimus. Upon testing for both tac\u00ad rolimus and creatinine levels, the physician halts the tacroli\u00ad mus, believing that the fluconazole will defeat the infection, and in a rapid manner. Under this regimen, the subject may worsen if the Candida species is resistant to fluconazole, and the subject is then started on an appropriate anti-fungal agent. However, since the tacrolimus may be halted, the immuno\u00ad suppressive therapy is unmanaged and the subject may become unresponsive to any additional therapy and death may ensue. Thus, if there was a test to simultaneously monitor creatinine (kidney function), tacrolimus blood levels, and accurate identification of opportunistic infections, the above subject may have been saved. [0289] The systems and methods of the invention can include a multiplexed, no sample preparation, single detec\u00ad tion method, automated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinant, and the pathogen identification having a critical role in the immunocompro\u00ad mised subject setting. For example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing I) magnetic particles having creatinine specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having tacrolimus specific antibodies on their sur\u00ad face, and 3) magnetic particles having specific nucleic acid probes to identify pathogen species could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management values for a given transplant subject. Opportunistic infections that can be monitored in such subjects, and any other patient populations at risk of infection, include, without limitation, fungal; Candida (resistant and non-resistant strains); gram negative bacterial coli, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Klebsiella pneumonia/oxytoca, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial infections (e.g., Sta\u00ad phylococcus species: S. aureus, S. pneumonia, E. faecalis, and E. faecium). Other opportunistic infections that can be monitored include coaglulase negative staphylococcus, Corynebacterium spp., Fusobacterium spp., EBC, HIV, HCV, HBV, and HAV. [0290] The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose cancer patients as part of a multiplexed diagnostic test. One specific form of cancer, col\u00ad orectal cancer, has demonstrated positive promise for person\u00ad alized medical treatment for a specific solid tumor. Pharma- cogenetic markers can be used to optimize treatment of colorectal and other cancers. Significant individual genetic variation exists in drug metabolism of 5FU, capecitabine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin that influences both the toxicity and efficacy of these agents. Examples of genetic markers include UGTlAl *28 leads to reduced conjugation of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, resulting in an increased rate of adverse effects, especially neutropenia. To a lesserextent, increased 5-FU toxicity is predicted by DPYD*2A. A variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase enhancer region, in combination with a single nucleotide polymorphism C>G, may predict poorer response to 5-FU. Efficacy of oxaliplatin is influenced by polymorphisms in components of DNA repair systems, such as ERCC I and XRCC I . Polymorphic changes in the helial growth cetuximab the antibody-depended cell-mediated be reduced by polymor\u00ad phisms in the immunoglobin G fragment C receptors. Poly\u00ad morphic changes in the VEGF gene and the hypoxia inducible factor I alpha gene are also believed to play a role in the variability of therapy outcome. Thus, identification of such polymorphisms in subjects can be used to assist physicians with treatment decisions. For example, PCR-based genetics tests have been developed to assist physicians with therapeu\u00ad tic treatment decisions for subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC) KRAS, EGFR, and BRAF are available for physicians to order to identify the optimal thera\u00ad peutic option. However, these PCR tests are not available on site, and thus the sample must be delivered to the off-site laboratory. These solid tumors are often biopsied and FFPE (Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (tissue)) samples are prepared. The systems and methods of the invention can be used without the 5-7 day turnaround to get the data and information and use of fixed samples required for existing methods. The systems and methods of the invention can pro\u00ad vide a single platform to analyze samples, without sample prep, for multiple analyte types, as in cancer for chemothera\u00ad peutic drugs, genpotyping, toxicity and efficacy markers can revolutionize the practice of personalized medicine and pro\u00ad vide rapid, accurate diagnostic testing. [0291] The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose neurological disease, such as dementia (a loss of cognitive ability in a previously-unim- paired person) and other forms of cognitive impairment. Without careful assessment of history, the short-term syn\u00ad drome of delirium (often lasting days to weeks) can easily be confused with dementia, because they have all symptoms in common, save duration, and the fact that delirium is often associated with over-activity of the sympathetic nervous sys\u00ad tem. Some mental illnesses, including depression and psy\u00ad chosis, may also produce symptoms that must be differenti\u00ad ated from both delirium and dementia. Routine blood tests are also usually performed to rule out treatable causes. These tests include vitamin B12, folic acid, electro\u00ad lytes, calcium, renal function, and liver enzymes. Abnormali\u00ad ties may suggest vitamin deficiency, infection or other problems that commonly cause confusion or disorientation in the elderly. The problem is complicated by the fact that these cause confusion more often in persons who have early dementia, so that \"reversal\" of such problems may ultimately only be temporary. Testing for alcohol and other known dementia-inducing drugs may be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of dementia induced by Alzheimer dis\u00ad ease. They may be useful for other similar diseases causing dementia suchas Parkinsons or vascular dementia. N-methyl- US 2013 D-aspartate blockers include memantine (Namenda), which is a drug representative of this class. It can be used in combi\u00ad nation with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Amyloid deposit inhibitors include minocycline and clioquinoline, which are antibiotics that may help reduce amyloid deposits in the brains of persons with Alzheimer disease. Depression is fre\u00ad quently associated with dementia and generally worsens the degree of cognitive and behavioral impairment. Antidepres\u00ad sants effectively treat the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of depression in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, but evi\u00ad dence for their use in other forms of dementia is weak. Many subjects with dementia experience anxiety symptoms. Although benzodiazepines like diazepam (Valium) have been used for treating anxiety in other situations, they are often avoided because they may increase agitation in persons with dementia and are likely to worsen cognitive problems or are too sedating. Buspirone (Buspar) is often initially tried for mild-to-moderate anxiety. There is little evidence for the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in dementia, whereas there is evidence for the effectiveness of antipsychotics (at low doses). Selegiline, a drug used primarily in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, appears to slow the development of dementia. Selegiline is thought to act as an antioxidant, pre\u00ad venting free radical damage. However, it also acts as a stimu\u00ad lant, making it difficult to determine whether the delay in onset of dementia symptoms is due to protection from free radicals or to the general elevation of brain activity from the stimulant effect. Both typical antipsychotics (such as halo- peridol) and atypical antipsychotics such as (risperidone) increases the risk of death in dementia-associated psychosis. This means that any use of antipsychotic medication for dementia-associated psychosis is off-label and should only be considered after discussing the risks and benefits of treatment with these drugs, and after other treatment modalities have failed. In the UK around 144,000 dementia sufferers are unnecessarily prescribed antipsychotic drugs, around 2000 subjects die as a result of taking the drugs each year. Dementia can be broadly categorized into two Binswanger's disease, dementia with Lewy dementia (or temporal FTLD), disease, dementia pugilistica, atrophy or Benson's syndrome. Subcortical dementias include dementia due to Huntington's disease, dementia due to hypothyroid\u00ad ism, dementia due to Parkinson's disease, dementia due to vitamin BI deficiency, dementia due to vitamin B12 defi\u00ad ciency, dementia due to folate deficiency, dementia due to syphilis, dementia due to subdural hematoma, dementia due to hypercalcaemia, dementia due to hypoglycemia, AIDS dementia complex, pseudodementia (a major depressive epi\u00ad sode with prominent cognitive symptoms), aubstance-in- duced persisting dementia (related to psychoactive use and formerly absinthism), dementia due to multiple etiologies, fementia due to other general medical conditions (i.e., end stage renal failure, cardiovascular disease etc.), or dementia not otherwise specified (used in cases where no specific cri\u00ad teria is met). Alzheimer's disease is a common form ofdementia. There are three companies that a currently offer for research only diagnostic testing of proteins (Satoris), splice variants (Exonhit), or protein expression levels (Diagenic) in subjects suffering from dementia, Lewy Body disease, or mild cognitive impairment. Since dementia is fundamentally associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, the ability to test for these proteins, as biomarkers of the disease, along with drug or drug metabolite levels in a single platform will assist a physician to adjust the dosage, alter a regimen, or generally monitor the progression of the disease. These tests are currently run off-site at locations far from the subject and care giver. Thus, to have the ability to monitor the drug levels and the biomarker in the same detection system, on-site will provide a huge advantage to this debilitating and devastating disease. The method of the invention can be a multiplexed, no sample preparation, single detection method, automated sys\u00ad tem to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinant, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the disease. For example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing I) magnetic particles having protein biom\u00ad arker specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) mag\u00ad netic particles having specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic particles having nucleic acid specific probes to identify protein expression levels could be employed to rap\u00ad idly determine and provide clinical management values for a given dementia subject. [0292] The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose infectious disease in a mul\u00ad tiplexed, automated, no sample preparation system. Examples of pathogens that may be detected using the devices, systems, and methods of the invention include, e.g., Candida (resistant and non-resistant strains), e.g., C albi\u00ad cans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, The systems and methods of the invention can be used to identify and monitor the pathogenesis of disease in a subject, to select therapeutic interventions, and to monitor the effectiveness of the selected treatment. For example, for a patient having or at risk of a viral infection, the systems and methods of the invention can be used to identify the infectious virus, viral load, and to monitor white cell count and/or biom\u00ad arkers indicative of the status of the infection. The identity of the virus can be used to select an appropriate therapy. The therapeutic intervention (e.g., a particular antiviral agent) can be monitored as well to correlate the treatment regiman to the circulating concentration of antiviral agent and viral load to ensure that the patient is responding to treatment. [0294] The systems and methods of the invention can be used to monitor a viral infection in a subject, e.g., with a viral panel configured to detect Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein US 2013/0260367 A l 44Oct. 3, 2013 Barr Virus, BK Vims, sub- l, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza B, The methods of the inven\u00ad tion can be used to monitor a suitable therapy for the subject with a viral infection feron type II, Interferon type I, Interferon to monitor the circulating concentration of the therapeutic administered to the subject. [0295] The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor HIV/AIDS patients. When clinicians sus\u00ad pect acute infection (e.g., in a subject with a report of recent risk behavior in association with symptoms and signs of the acute retroviral syndrome), a test for HIV RNA is usually performed. High levels of HIV RNA detected in plasma throughuse of sensitive amplification assays (PCR, bDNA, or NASBA), in combination with a negative or indeterminate HIV antibody test, support the diagnosis of acute HIV infec\u00ad tion. Low-level positive PCR results (<5000 copies/mL) are often not diagnostic of acute HIV infection and should be repeated to exclude a false-positive result. HIV RNA levels tend to be very high in acute infection; however, a low value may represent any point on the upward or downward slope of the viremia associated with acute infection. Plasma HIV RNA levels during seroconversion do not appear significantly different in subjects who have acute symptoms versus those who are asymptomatic. Viremia occurs approximately 2 weeks prior to the detection of a specific immune response. Subjects diagnosed with acute HIV infection by HIV RNA. Fever and flu- or mono-like symptoms are common in acute HIV infection but are nonspecific rash, mucocutaneous ulcers, or pharyngeal candidiasis and meningismus are more specific and should raise the index of suspicion testing still require antibody testing with confirmatory Western blot 3 to 6 weeks later. [0296] Subjects undergoing HIV testing who are not sus\u00ad pected to be in the acute stages of infection should receive HIV antibody testing according to standard protocol. Anti\u00ad body test results that are initially negative should be followed up with HIV antibody testing at 3 months to identify HIV infection in individuals who may not yet have seroconverted at the time of initial presentation. Plasma HIV RNA levels indicate the magnitude of HIV replication and its associated rate of CD4+ T cell destruction, while CD4+ T-cell countsindicate the extent of HIV-induced immune damage already suffered. Regular, periodic measurement of plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts is necessary to determine the risk of disease progression in an HIV-infected individual and to determine when to initiate or modify antiretroviral treatment regimens. [0297] As rates of disease progression differ among indi\u00ad viduals, treatment decisions shouldbe individualized by level of risk indicated by plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts. Current WHO guidelines and recommendations for HIV therapy includes a combination of the following drugs, AZT (zidovudine), for HIV is to com\u00ad mence in subjects who have a CD4 count <350 cell/mm3 irrespective of clinical symptoms. At least one of the four following regimens for antiretroviral naive subjects is begun: I) AZT+3TC+EFV, 2) AZT+3TC+NVP, 3) TDF+3TC or regimens avoid d4T to limit the disfiguring, unpleasant, and potentially life-threatening toxicities of this drug. Treatment failure is usually determined by viral load, a persistent value of 5,000 copies/ml confirms treatment failure. In cases whereby viral load measurement is not available, immuno\u00ad logical criteria (CD4 cell count) can be used to determine therapeutic progress. In cases of treatment failure, a boosted protease inhibitor plus two nucleoside analogs are added to the regimen and is considered second line antiretroviral therapy. ATV plus low dose RTV, or LPV with low dose RTV is also considered second line therapy. Often the goal in treatment failure cases is simpler timed regimens and fixed doses. [0298] For subjects failing the second line treatment regi\u00ad mens should be maintained on a tolerated regimen for the duration. The use of potent combination antiretroviral therapy to suppress HIV replication to below the levels of detection of sensitive plasma HIV RNA assays limits the potential for selection of antiretroviral-resistant HIV variants, the major factor limiting the ability of antiretroviral drugs to inhibit virus replication and delay disease progression. There\u00ad fore, maximum achievable suppression of HIV replication should be the goal of therapy. The most effective means to accomplish durable suppression of HIV replication is the simultaneous initiation of combinations of effective anti-HIV drugs with which the subject has not been previously treated and that are not cross-resistant with antiretroviral agents with which the subject has been treated previously. Each of the antiretroviral drugs used in combination therapy regimens should always be used according to optimum schedules and dosages. The available effective antiretroviral drugs are lim\u00ad ited in number and mechanism of action, and cross-resistance between specific drugs has been documented. Therefore, any change in antiretroviral therapy increases future therapeutic constraints. [0299] Monitoring HIV/AIDS subjects for viral load, drug levels, CD4 cell counts, and toxicity patterns in a single platform diagnostic method would provide distinct advan\u00ad tages to a subject. The systems and methods of the invention can be used in a multiplexed, no sample preparation, single detection method, automated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinants, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the disease. For US 2013/0260367 A l 45Oct. 3, 2013 example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing I) magnetic particles having CD4 cell specific antibodies deco\u00ad rated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having toxicity biomarker specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) mag\u00ad netic particles having nucleic acid specific probes to identify viral load levels could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management values for a given HIV/AIDS subject. [0300] The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose immune disease in a subject (e.g., Crohn's disease, ileitis, enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, as well as non-gastrointestinal immune disease). The relatively recent development of genetically engineered agents has the potential to alter the treatment of immune disease radically, and Remicade (also known as Infliximab, an anti-TNF anti\u00ad body) was introduced as a new therapeutic class with high efficacy, rapid onset of action, prolonged effect, and improved tolerance. However these agents are expensive and at least one-third of the eligible patients fail to show any useful response. Finding a means to predict those who will respond, and to anticipate relapse is, therefore, of obvious importance. T helper-type I (Thl) lymphocytes orchestrate much of the inflammation in Crohn's disease mainly via production of TNF-alpha, which appears to play a pivotal role as a pro- inflammatory cytokine. It exerts its effects through its own family of receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), the end results of activation. Activated NF-kappaB enters the nucleus and induces transcription of genes associated with inflammation, host defense and cell survival. The promoter region of the TNF gene lies between nucleotides - I and -1300, and encompasses numerous polymorphic sites associated with potential binding sites for various transcription factors. Car\u00ad riers of the TNF allele 2 (TNF2) (which contains base-pair polymorphism the -308 promoter position) pro\u00ad duce slightly TNF-alpha in their intestinal mucosa than non-TNF2 carriers. TNF polymorphisms also appear to influ\u00ad ence the nature and frequency of extra-intestinal manifesta\u00ad tions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A number of routes of inhibition of TNF are being investigated. Most extensively evaluated is the use of remicade. Several large controlled trials indicate that remicade has a role in treating patients with moderate to severely active Crohn's disease and in fistulating Crohn's disease. Small studies have shown pos\u00ad sible associations between poor response to remicade and increasing mucosal levels of activated NF-kappaB, homozy\u00ad presence of increased numbers of activated lamina propia mononuclear cells producing interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha. disease patients for TNF-alpha and tox\u00ad icity patterns in a single platform diagnostic method would have distinct advantages. The method of the invention can be a multiplexed, no sample preparation, single detection method, automated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinants, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the disease. For example, a cartridge having portals or wells containing I) magnetic par\u00ad ticles having anti-TNF-alpha specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having toxicity biomarker specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic particleshaving specific probes to identify disease markers of progres\u00ad sion could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management values for a given Crohn's disease patient. [0301] The systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose infectious disease and inflammation in a multiplexed, automated, no sample prepa\u00ad ration system. Such systems and methods could be used to monitor, for example, bacteremia, sepsis, and/or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). Early diagnosis is clinically important as this type of infection, if left untreated, can lead to oigan dysfunction, hypoperfusion, hypotension, refractory (septic) shock/SIRS shock, and/or Multiple Oigan Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). For a typical patient, many bacterial or fungal infections are the result of incubation at the time of admission to a healthcare setting and are termed healthcare-associated infections (HAI), also known as noso\u00ad comial, hospital-acquired or hospital-onset infections. Healthcare-associated infections are most commonly caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens and are commonly transmitted via wounds, invasive devices (catheters, tracheo\u00ad stomy, intubation, suigical drains) or ventilators and are found as urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, or a form of pneumonia. Within hours after admission, a patient's flora begins to acquire characteristics of the surrounding bac\u00ad terial pool. Most infections that become clinically evident after 48 hours of hospitalization are considered hospital-ac\u00ad quired and the pathogens should be investigated in all febrile patients who are admitted for a nonfebrile illness or those who develop clinical deterioration unexplained by the initial diag\u00ad nosis. More careful and selective use of antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, is also desirable to decrease the selection pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Infections that occur after the patient is discharged from the hospital can be considered healthcare-associated if the organisms were acquired during the hospital stay. Patient-related risk factors for invasion of colonizing pathogen include severity of ill\u00ad ness, underlying immunocompromised state and/or the length of in-patient stay. Risk factors for the development of catheter-associated bloodstream infections in neonates include catheter hub colonization, exit site colonization, cath\u00ad eter insertion after the first week of life, duration of parenteral nutrition, and extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) at the time of catheter insertion. In patients in the PICU risks, for catheter-associated bloodstream infections increase with neutropenia, prolonged catheter dwell time (>7 days), use of percutaneously placed CVL (higher than tunneled or implanted devices), and frequent manipulation of lines. Can\u00ad dida infections are increasingly important pathogens in the NICU. Risk factors for the development of candidemia in neonates include gestational age less than 32 weeks, 5-min Apgar scores of less than 5, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, prior use of intralipids, parenteral nutrition administration, CVL use, 1-12 blocker administration, intu\u00ad bation, or length of stay longer than 7 days. Risk factors for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in pediatric patients include reintubation, genetic syndromes, immunodeficiency, and immunosuppression. In neonates, a prior episode of bloodstream infection is a risk factor for the development of VAP Risk factors for the development of healthcare-associated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients include bladder catheterization, prior antibiotic therapy, and cerebral palsy. Among the categories of bacteria most known to infect immunocompromised patients are US 2013/0260367 A l 46Oct. 3, 2013 MRSA (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ), gram\u00ad positive bacteria and Helicobacter, which is gram-negative. While there are antibiotic drugs that can treat diseases caused by Gram-positive MRSA, there are currently few effective drugs for Acinetobacter. Commonpathogens in bloodstream infections are coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococ\u00ad cus, and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, Candida albi\u00ad cans and pathogens for pneumonia such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenza account for many infections. Pathogens for urinary tract Gram-negative enteric organisms are additionally common in urinary tract infections. Surgical site infections include Sta\u00ad phylococcus aeruginosa, and coagu\u00ad lase-negative staphylococci. agent can be selected from, without limitation, pathogens associated with S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and S. sanguinis', or any other infectious agent described herein. In certain instances, the method and system will be designed to ascertain whether the infectious agent bears a Van A gene or Van B gene character\u00ad istic of resistance to beta- lactams. [0302] Sepsis or septic shock are serious medical condi\u00ad tions that are characterized by a whole-body inflammatory state (systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS) and the presence of a known or suspected infection. Sepsis is defined as SIRS in the presence of an infection, septic shock is defined as sepsis with refractory arterial hypotension or hypoperfusion abnormalities in spite of adequate fluid resus\u00ad citation, and severe sepsis is defined as sepsis with oigan dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension. In addition to symptoms related to the provoking infection, sepsis is char\u00ad acterized by presence of acute inflammation present through\u00ad out the entire body, and is, therefore, frequently associated with fever and leukocytosis or low white blood cell count and lower-than-average temperature, and vomiting. It is currently believed that sepsis is the host's immune response to an infection and it is thought that this response causes most of the symptoms of sepsis, resulting inhemodynamic consequences and damage to organs. SIRS is characterized by hemody\u00ad namic compromise and resultant metabolic derangement. Outward physical symptoms of this response frequently include a high heart rate (above 90 beats per minute), high respiratory rate (above 20 breaths per minute), elevated WBC count (above 12,000) and elevated or lowered body tempera\u00adture (under 36\u00b0 C. (97\u00b0 F.) or over 38\u00b0 C. (100\u00b0 F.)). Sepsis is differentiated from SIRS by the presence of a known patho\u00ad gen. For example, SIRS and a positive blood culture for a pathogen indicates the presence of sepsis. Without a known infection, it's not possible to classify the above symptoms as sepsis, only SIRS. SIRS causes widespread activation of acute-phase proteins, affecting the complement system and the coagulation pathways, which then cause damage to the vasculature as well as to the organs. Various neuroendocrine counter-regulatory systems are then activated as well, often compounding the problem. Even with immediate and aggres\u00ad sive treatment, this may progress to multiple organ dysfunc\u00ad tion syndrome and eventually death. The laboratory compo\u00ad nent of sepsis diagnosis can include several markers are considered at once and/or measured serially. A number of studies have examined the value of combining currently available markers like GRO-alpha, Fligh mobility group-box chemotactic protein I (MCP-1). Additionally, the systems and methods can be designed to monitor certain proteins characteristic of sepsis, such as adenosine deaminase binding protein calcitonin (PCT). Sepsis is usually treated in the intensive care unit with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. If fluid replacement is insufficient to maintain blood pressure, spe\u00ad cific vasopressor medications can be used. Mechanical ven\u00ad tilation and dialysis may be needed to support the function of the lungs and kidneys, respectively. To guide therapy, a cen\u00ad tral venous catheter and an arterial catheter may be placed. Sepsis patients may require preventive measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers and pressure ulcers, and some patients may benefit from tight control of blood sugar levels with insulin (targeting stress hyperglycemia), low-dose cor\u00ad ticosteroids, C). Foran immunocompromisedpatient, or a patient with a suspected infection that may be experiencing sepsis or SIRS, such methods and systems of the invention provide a diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of one or more pathogens, and whether or not the pathogens are resistant to certain therapies (for the selection of an appropriate antimi\u00ad crobial therapy). The platform as described allows for the simultaneous determination of the levels of the factors (e.g., GRO-alpha, Fligh mobility group-box (PCT)) thought to be involved in SIRS, allowing for the optimization for the treatment of sepsis and SIRS. Thus, this platform reduces the empirical protocols and/or use of non-specific/general antimicrobials that may or may not be targeting the specific pathogen and/or the under\u00ad lying system dysfunction for a given patient. This platform US 2013/0260367 A l 47Oct. 3, 2013 allows for rapid and accurate diagnoses, which can point to effective therapy, providing a key component to a physician's decision making and reducing morbidity and mortality. [0303] To determine whether a patient has sepsis, it is nec\u00ad essary to identify the presence of a pathogen. To most effec\u00ad tively treat a patient, the earliest initiation of appropriate therapy is critical. Antimicrobial and other treatments for sepsis rely on the classification of pathogens at multiple lev\u00ad els, including the identification of an agent as I) bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic or otherwise; 2) gram positive, gram negative, yeast, or mold, 3) species, and 4) susceptibility. [0304] Each of these levels of specificity improves the time to initiation of appropriate therapy, and each step further down the track will lead to a narrowing of therapeutic agents to the most specific set. Without absolute susceptibility data, empiric approaches to care rely on the information available about the pathogen (at whichever level) and the pattern of pathogen frequency and susceptibility trends in the hospital of another site of care. Thus, certain categories of pathogens are frequently presumed to be causative until there are more data to refine the pairing of pathogen and therapy. Specifi\u00ad cally, these targets fall into the ESKAPE category (which is a series of resistant pathogens) and the SPACE category, which is a set of high virulence pathogens that require isolation of patients. [0305] In addition to identifying these pathogens in mul\u00ad tiple sample types (blood, tissue, urine, etc.), another method to distinguish symptomatic patients, for instance, patients with systemic inflammatory syndrome, or SIRS, from septic patients, is to use biomarkers that correlate either individually or via an index, to identify patients with infection. In cases where infections are not detected due to antimicrobial therapy interference with diagnostics, immune system control of the therapy, or otherwise, these biomarkers, which can be mul\u00ad tiple types of analytes (cytokines, metabolites, DNA, RNA/ gene expression, etc.) will indicate infection and thus sepsis. [0306] To generate the diagnostic information required for both the presence of an infection and some level of species identification, one panel could be: (i) gram positiive clusters (e.g., S. aureus, and CoNS (coagulase negative staph)); (ii) gram positive cies). [0307] This panel should be used in conjunction with a fungal assay for full coverage. The categories represent the information required for an effective intervention with appro\u00ad priate therapy, given that each site of care will have an empiri\u00ad cally derived approach based on a positive response to gram +, gram -, etc. The species identified in each category repre\u00ad sent those that would fit under each heading, but are not comprehensive. Further, a pan-bacterial marker is included to cover any species that is not covered by the diagnostic method employed for each category. Further, the combination of results will also give an indication of the species, although not fully, if included as described above. Cross-referencing posi\u00adtives and negatives by category allow a process of elimination approach to identify some of the species, probabilistically. [0308] In addition to pathogen panels, a standalone or com\u00ad panion test could be performed for biomarkers that can indi\u00ad cate sepsis. Examples of these markers are below, and may be used individually or in combination: IL-1 (3 , systems and methods of the invention can also be used to monitor and diagnose heart disease in a subject, such as a myocardial infarction. Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells and are used to assess cardiac injury. Cardiac markers include, without limitation, the enzymes SGOT, LDFl, the MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase, and cardiac troponins (T and I). The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4-6 hours of an attack of myocardial infarc\u00ad tion (and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks) have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. Elevated troponins in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is typically based upon subject history, ECG, and cardiac markers. When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time, which is why blood tests for them are taken over a 24-hour period. Because these enzyme levels are not elevated immediately following a heart attack, patients presenting with chest pain are generally treated with the assumption that a myocardial infarction has occurred and then evaluated for a more precise diagnosis. A MI is a medical emergency which requires immediate medi\u00ad cal attention. Treatment attempts to salvage as much myocar\u00ad dium as possible and to prevent further complications, thus the phrase \"time is muscle\". Oxygen, aspirin, and nitroglyc\u00ad erin are usually administered as soon as possible. Thus, in the acute setting, monitoring Troponin I and T, as well as poten\u00ad tial other biomarkers of cardiac ischemia, in addition to drug therapy and toxicity patterns in a single platform diagnostic method would have distinct advantages. The systems and methods of the invention can be used to provide a multi\u00ad plexed, no sample preparation, single detection method, auto\u00ad mated system to determine the drug level, the toxicity or adverse effect determinants, and the potential biomarker of the progression of the disease. For example, a cartridge hav\u00ad ing portals or wells containing I) magnetic particles having anti-troponin I or troponin T specific antibodies decorated on their surface, 2) magnetic particles having toxicity biomarker specific antibodies on their surface, and 3) magnetic particles having specific probes to identify disease markers of progres\u00ad sion could be employed to rapidly determine and provide clinical management values for a given myocardial infarction patient. [0310] One ormore multi-well cartridges canbe configured for use in the systems and methods of the invention and prepared with at least one whole blood sample from the patient; magnetic particles for detecting each of the analytes to be detected (one or more small molecules; one or more metabolites of the one or more small molecules; metabolic biomarker such as described for the hepatic function panel); US 2013/0260367 A l 48Oct. 3, 2013 and dilution and wash buffers. Liver function tests are done on a patient's serum orplasma sample and clinical biochemistry laboratory blood analysis furnishes crucial data regarding the condition of the patient's liver. A \"hepatic function panel\" is a blood test wherein low or high levels of one or more enzymes may point to liver diseases or damage. For example, the hepatic function panel can include one or more of the following analyte detection assays: one or more small mol\u00ad ecules; one or more metabolites of the one or more small molecules; a biologic, biomarkers; analysis. [0311] A hepatic function panel can include analysis of one or more of the following proteins in a patient or subject biological sample: I) albumin (the major constituent of the total protein in the liver; while the remnant is called globulin; albumin must be present as 3.9 to 5.0 g/dL, hypoalbumin- aemia indicates poor nutrition, in liver parenchymal cells and is normally 10 to 34 IU/L; elevated levels are indicative of acute liver damage); 3) alanine tran\u00ad is present in hepatocytes at levels between 8 to 37 IU/L; elevated levels are indicative of acute liver damage in viral hepatitis or parac\u00ad etamol overdose; the ratio of AST to ALT is used to differen\u00ad tiate between the reasons of liver damage); 4) alkaline phos\u00ad phatase (ALP) (an enzyme that is present in the cells lining the biliary ducts of the liver; the normal range is 44 to 147 IU/L and the level rises in case of infiltrative diseases of the liver, intrahepatic sensitive marker for cholestatic damage than ALP, is very specific to the liver; the standard range is 0 to 51 IU/L; both acute and chronic alcohol toxicity raise GGT; the reason of an isolated elevation in ALP can be detected by GGT); 6) total bilirubin (TBIL) (an increase in the total bilirubin can lead to jaundice and can be attributed to cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, hemolytic anemias, or internal hemorrhage); 7) direct bilirubin; 8) pro\u00ad thrombin time (PTT) (hepatic cell damage and bile flow obstruction can cause changes to blood clotting time); 9) alpha-fetoprotein test (elevated levels indicate hepatitis or cancer); 10) lactate dehydrogenase; and 11) mitochondrial antibodies (if present may indicate chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or other autoimmune disorders). The proteins described above would be analyzed in the hepatic function panel using the systems and methods of the invention. [0312] An additional hepatic function panel may include P450 enzymes. The cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP) is a large and diverse group of enzymes. The function of most CYP enzymes is to catalyze the oxidation of organic substances. The substrates of CYP enzymes include metabolic intermediates such as lipids and steroidal hormones, as well as xenobiotic substances such as drugs and other toxic chemicals. CYPs are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bioactivation, accounting for ca. 75% of the total metabolism. Most drugs undergo biotransformation and are eventually excreted from the body; and many require bioactivation to form the active compound. The CYP enzymes that many are used to determine how well a patient or subject metabolizes a drug. The results of cytochrome P450 tests can be used to divide individuals into four main types: [0314] (i) Poor metabolizers. Certain drugs are metabo\u00ad lized more slowly than normal and the medication will have a longer half life and possibly increase the likelihood that it will cause side effects. [0315] (ii) Normal metabolizers. Drugs will be metabo\u00ad lized at an average rate and thus is indicative that there is a benefit from treatment and points to fewer side effects than are other individuals who don't metabolize those particular medications as well. [0316] (iii) Intermediate metabolizers. Drugs may or may not be metabolized at an average rate. At least one gene involved in drug metabolism is suspected to function abnor\u00ad mally. There then is a predisposition to metabolize certain drugs differently. [0317] (iv) Ultra rapid metabolizers. Drugs are metabolized faster and more efficiently than the average. Since the meta\u00ad bolic rate is higher than average, some medications are inac\u00ad tivated sooner or are excreted sooner than normal and the medication may not have the desired efficacy. [0318] Currently, genotyping the genes responsible for these enzymes across a population has been shown that poly\u00ad morphic differences in these enzymes can lead to variation in efficacy and toxicity of some drugs. Assessing cytochrome P450 status in a patient sample can be accomplished by mea\u00ad suring the enzyme activity of the sample, or determining if a genetic difference occurs in one of the genes of this metabolic system in the genome. Genotyping requires a cell sample representative of the patient or subject's genome and the analysis is aimed at determining genetic differences in these clinically important genes. Alternatively, CYP450 enzyme phenotyping (identifying enzymatic metabolizer status) can be accomplished by administering a test enzyme substrate to a patient and monitoring parent substrate and metabolite con\u00ad centrations over time (e.g., in urine). However, testing and interpretation are time-consuming and inconvenient; as a result, phenotyping is seldom performed. [0319] Below is a listing of the possible hepatic metabolic enzymes that may be part of a hepatic function panel. [0320] CYP2C19 metabolizes several important types of including proton-pump inhibitors, diazepam, propra\u00ad nolol, imipramine, and amitriptyline. FDA cleared the test \"based on results of a study conducted by the manufacturers of hundreds of DNA samples as well as on a broad range of supporting peer-reviewed literature.\" According to FDA labeling, \"Information about CYP2D6 genotype may be used as an aid to clinicians in determining therapeutic strategy and treatment doses for therapeutics that are metabolized by the CYP2D6 product.\" Thus, a hepatic function panel employing the methods of the invention, may be used to genotype patient or subject samples to assess the status of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system to then optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety. [0321] CYP2D6 (cytochrome P450 2D6) is the best studied of the DMEs and acts on one-fourth of all prescription drugs, including the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), tricylic antidepressants (TCA), beta-blockers and the Type IA antiarrhythmics. Approximately 10% of the population has a slow acting form of this enzyme and 7% a super-fast acting form. Thirty-five percent are carriers of a non-functional 2D6 allele, especially elevating the risk of US 2013/0260367 A l 49Oct. 3, 2013 ADRs when these individuals are taking multiple drugs. Drugs that of the most prescribed drugs and the over-the-counter diphenylhydramine drugs (e.g., Allegra, Dytuss, andTusstat). CYP2D6 is responsible for activating the pro-drug codeine into its active form and the drug is in CYP2D6 slow metabolizers. [0322] CYP2C9 (cytochrome Coumadin (warfarin). Approxi\u00ad mately 10% of the population are carriers of at least one allele for the slow-metabolizing form of CYP2C9 and may be treat\u00ad able with 50% of the dose at which normal metabolizers are treated. Other drugs metabolized by that acts on isoniazid, procainamide, and Azulfidine. The frequency of the NAT2 \"slow acetylator\" in various worldwide populations ranges more than 90%. [0326] DPD (Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) is responsible for the metabolism of Fluorouracil (5-FU), one of the most successful and widely used chemotherapy drugs. [0327] U G TlAl (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) varia\u00ad tions can lead to severe even fatal the first dost of Camptosar (irinotecan). [0328] 5HTT (Serotonin Transporter) helps determine whether people are likely to respond to SSRIs, a class of medications that includes citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline, among others, and often is prescribed for depression or anxiety. [0329] Diagnostic genotyping tests for certain CYP450 enzymes are now available. Some tests are offered as in house laboratory-developed test services, which do not require U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval but which must meet CLIA quality standards for high complexity test\u00ad ing. The AmpliChip\u00ae (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) is the only FDA-cleared test for CYP450 genotyping. The Ampli\u00ad Chip\u00ae is a microarray consisting of many DNA sequences complementary to 2 CYP450 genes and applied in micro\u00ad scopic quantities at ordered locations on a solid surface (chip). The AmpliChip\u00ae tests the DNA from a patient's white blood cells collected in a standard anticoagulated blood sample for 29 polymorphisms and mutations for the CYP2D6 gene and 2 polymorphisms for the CYP2C19 gene. [0330] Therefore, the invention features a multiplexed analysis of a single blood sample (e.g., a single blood draw, or any other type of patient sample described herein) from a patient to determine a) liver enzymatic status, as well as b) the genotype of key metabolic enzymes to then be able to design pharmacotherapy regimes for optimal therapeutic care using the systems and methods of the invention.[0331] The systems and methods of the invention can include one or more multi-well cartridges prepared with at least one whole blood sample from the patient; magnetic particles for detecting each of the analytes to detected; analyte multiplexed assay as described above. [0332] Nephrotoxicity [0333] Renal toxicity is a common side effect of use of xenobiotics and early, rapid detection of early stages of neph\u00ad rotoxicity may assist in medical decision making. Early reports of detection of renal toxicity suggest that increased mRNA expression of certain genes can be monitored. How\u00ad ever, others have suggested that markers of renal toxicity can be detected in urine. More broadly, detection of DNA, heavy metal ions or BUN levels in urine can be useful clinical information. Thus, the methods and utlity of the instant invention also includes the ability to detect these markers of renal toxicity. Option\u00ad ally, a hepatic function panel may also include one or two hallmark biomarkers of nephrotoxicity, or visa versa. [0334] Non-Agglomeration-BasedAssays and Methods [0335] In some embodiments, the magnetic particles described herein may be utilized in an assay that does not feature particle agglomeration. For example, the magnetic particles may be used to capture or concentrate an analyte, e.g., by passing a liquid sample containing the analyte over magnetic particles that include binding moieties specific for the analyte. Some advantages of this approach include a) no clusters need be formed (the clusters may be inherently unstable over a certain size, leading to increased CV's); b) no clustering may not require vortexing as flow shear forces may dislodge non-specific binding of magnetic particles, c) fluidic handling steps may be reduced, and d) miniaturization of the assay may favor these non-agglomerative methods. Broadly, two models for surface based detection include: (i) changes in T2 signal arising from the depletion of magnetic particles from a solution and (ii) changes in T2 signal arising from magnetic particle enrichment of a surface. [0336] The magnetic particles derivatized with a binding moiety can be held in position by an external magnetic field while sample containing the corresponding analyte is circu\u00ad lated past the \"trapped\" magnetic particles allowing for cap\u00ad ture and/or concentrate the analyte of interest. The particles may be pulled to the side or bottom of the assay vessel, or a magnetizable mesh or magnetizable metal foam with appro\u00ad priate pore size can be present in the reaction vessel, creating very high local magnetic gradients. An advantage of having the mesh/metal foam in the reaction vessel is that the distance each magnetic particle needs to travel to be \"trapped\" or \"captured\" can be very short, improving assay kinetics. Another assay is to have derivitized with ligands complementary to the binding moiety present on the magnetic particle and using a capture/ depletion/flow through format. Specific binding of magnetic particles to a surface depletes magnetic particles from the bulk particle suspension used in the assay, thus leading to a change in the T2 value in the reaction volume interrogated by the MR reader. Pre-incubation of the particles with the sample containing analyte can reduce/inhibit the specific binding/ capture/depletion of the magnetic particle by the derivitized surface in proportion to the concentration of analyte in the US 2013/0260367 A l 50Oct. 3, 2013 sample. One example of this type of assay approach has been demonstrated using PhyNexus affinity chromatography micropipette tips. The 200 ul PhyTips contain a 20 pi volume of resin bed trapped between 2 fits. The resin bed consists of 200 pm cross-linked agarose beads derivitized with avidin, protein A, analyte. A programmable elec\u00ad tronic pipettor can aspirate and dispense various volumes at various flow rates. The magnetic particles flow through the pores created by the packed agarose bead resin bed. By repeatedly passing the appropriate magnetic particle suspen\u00ad sion over the trapped resin bed to allow for productive inter\u00ad actions to occur between, say, an avidin-derivatized agarose bead resin bed and biotin-derivatized magnetic particles, some of the magnetic particles will specifically bind to and be depleted from the particles suspension. By measuring the T2 of the particle suspension before and after exposure to the agarose resin bed, the amount of particle depletion can be quantified. [0338] Another non-agglomerative assay format is similar to that described above, but uses derivatized magnetizable metal foam to replace the resin bed. The advantage of the metal foam as the solid phase substrate is that when placed in a magnetic field, the metal foam generates very high local magnetic field gradients over very short distances which can attract the derivatized magnetic particles and bring them in contact with the complementary binding partner on the metal foam and improve the chances of a specific productive inter\u00ad action. By optimizing the pore size and surface area of the metal foam, the assay kinetics can be vastly improved because the particles need to travel much shorter distances to find a complementary surface to bind. The particle concen\u00ad tration in the flow-through reaction volume will be reduced inversely proportional to the analyte concentration in the sample and can be quantified using the MR reader. The metal foam can be nickel bearing directly bound his-tagged moi\u00ad eties, or can be nickel treated with aminosilane and covalently linkedbinding moieties. This process has been demonstrated using aminosilane-treated nickel metal foam with 400 pm pores decorated with anti-creatinine antibodies and shown to specifically bind creatinine-derivatized magnetic particles. [0339] To prepare small circular pieces of nickel metal foam (NMF), NMF material is incubated with deionized water and then frozen. The frozen water in the NMF crevices support the foam so that it will not collapse or create differ\u00ad ential edges. Next, a punch is used to create uniform-sized pieces of NMF; a hammer and punch (e.g., a circular tube having a circular cutting edge at one end) is used to cut out circular pieces, e.g., 2-3 mm in size, of the frozen foam. A wire is then used to poke out the pieces, which are dried in a glassware oven. To derivatize the NMF pieces and prepare them for use in the devices and methods described herein, the following steps are performed. First, NMF pieces are cleaned with 2M Fl2SO 4 in a sonicator, and sulfuric acid solution is used to clean the NMF and to roughen the NMF surfaces in order to assist in subsequent attachment of the amino groupsof aminosilane. The acid-washed NMF pieces are then rinsed with deionized water to remove any residual acid solution, and the NMF pieces are dried in a glassware oven. Next the NMF pieces are derivatized with aminosilane, and 70 kD with gluteraldehyde. Specific antibodies, oligonucleotides, and analytes can then be covalently attached to the amino groups on the aminodextran using various chemistries, and the derivatized NMF pieces are incubated to block non-specific binding. Common block\u00ad ers include but are not limited to BSA, non-fat dried milk, detergents, salmon sperm DNA, among others. [0340] Further, there are examples of assays that would be aimed at detecting a physical property change in a liquid sample. As described in pending cases, PCT/US2009/062537 (published as W02010/051362) and PCT/US2008/073346 (published as W02009/026164), coagulation of blood can be determined by the instant methods described therein. Further, other physical properties may be detected such as solidifica\u00ad tion, changes in density and may have uses in determining curing of materials (plastic compositions), changes in food and food products with time, contamination of products found in nature, and monitoring certain biological fluids such as urine as a function of kidney function. [0341] The magnetic particles utilized in the non-agglom- erative methods described herein can have an average diam\u00ad eter of from IOnmto 1200 nm (e.g., from IOto 50, 50 to 150, 150 to 250,200 to 350,250 to 450,300 to 500,450 to 650,500 to 700 nm, 700 to 850, 800 to 950, 900 to 1050, or from 1000 to 1200 nm). [0342] Amplification and Detection of Nucleic Acids from Complex Samples [0343] Systems and methods of the invention can include amplification based nucleic acid detection assays conducted starting with complex samples (e.g., for diagnostic, forensic, and environmental analyses). [0344] Sample preparation must also remove or provide resistance for common PCR inhibitors found in complex samples (e.g., body fluids, soil, or other complex milieu). Common inhibitors are listed in Table 5 (see also, Wilson, Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 63:3741 (1997)). Inhibitors typi\u00ad cally act by either prevention of cell lysis, degradation or sequestering a target nucleic acid, and/or inhibition of a poly\u00ad merase activity. The most commonly employed polymerase, Taq, is inhibited by the presence of 0.1% blood in a reaction. Very recently, mutant Taq polymerases have been engineered that are resistant to common inhibitors (e.g., hemoglobin and/or humic acid) found in blood and soil (Kermekchiev et ah, Nucl. Acid. Res., 37(5): e40, (2009)). Manufacturer rec\u00ad ommendations indicate these mutations enable direct ampli\u00ad fication from up to 20% blood. Despite resistance afforded by the mutations, accurate real time PCR detection is compli\u00ad cated due to fluorescence quenching observed in the presence of blood sample (Kermekchiev et ah, Nucl. Acid. Res., 37 :e40 (2009)). TABLE 5 PCR inhibitors and facilitators/methods for overcoming inhibition.

Recently mutant Taq poly\u00ad merases have been engineered to harbor resistance to com\u00ad mon inhibitors found in blood and soil. Currently available polymerases, e.g., HemoKlenTaq (New England BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, Mass.) as well as OmniTaq and OmniKlen-Taq (DNA Polymerase Technology, Inc., St. Louis, Mo.) are mutant (e.g., N-terminal truncation and/or point muta\u00ad tions) Taq polymerase that render them capable of amplifying DNA in the presence of up to 10%, 20% or 25% whole blood, depending on the product and reaction conditions (See, e.g., Kermekchiev et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 31:6139 (2003); and Kermekchiev et ah, Nucl. Acid. Res., 37:e40 (2009); and see U.S. Pat. No. 7,462,475). Additionally, Phusion\u00ae Blood Direct PCR Kits (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), include a US 2013/0260367 A l 52Oct. 3, 2013 unique fusion DNA polymerase enzyme engineered to incor\u00ad porate a double-stranded DNA binding domain, which allows amplification under conditions which are typically inhibitory to conventional polymerases such as Taq or Pfu, and allow for amplification of DNA in the presence of up to about 40% whole blood under certain reaction conditions. See Wang et ah, Nuc. Acids Res. 32:1197 (2004); and see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,778 Kapa Blood a geneti\u00ad cally engineered DNA polymerase enzyme which allows for direct amplification of whole blood at up to about 20% of the reaction volume under certain reaction conditions. Despite these breakthroughs, direct optical detection of generated amplicons is not possible with existing methods since fluo\u00ad rescence, absorbance, and other light based methods yield signals that are quenched by the presence of blood. See Ker- mekchiev et ah, Nucl. Acid. Res., 37:e40 (2009). [0346] We have found that complex samples such as whole blood can be directly amplified using about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 25%, about 40%, and 45% or more whole blood in amplification reac\u00ad tions, and that the resulting amplicons can be directly detected from amplification reaction using magnetic reso\u00ad nance (MR) relaxation measurements upon the addition of conjugated magnetic particles bound to oligonucleotides complementary to the target nucleic acid sequence. Alterna\u00ad tively, the magnetic particles can be added to the sample prior to amplification. Thus, provided are methods for the use of nucleic acid amplification in a complex dirty sample, hybrid\u00ad ization of the resulting amplicon to paramagnetic particles, followed by direct detection of hybridized magnetic particle conjugate and target amplicons using magnetic particle based detection systems. In particular embodiments, direct detec\u00ad tion of hybridized magnetic particle conjugates and ampli\u00ad cons is via MR relaxation measurements (e.g., T2, T1, T1/T2 hybrid, T2*, etc). Further provided are methods which are kinetic, in order to quantify the original nucleic acid copy number within the sample (e.g., sampling and nucleic acid detection at pre-defined cycle numbers, comparison of endogenous internal control nucleic acid, use of exogenous spiked homologous competitive control nucleic acid). [0347] The terms \"amplification\" or \"amplify\" or deriva\u00ad tives thereof as used herein mean one or more methods known in the art for copying a target or template nucleic acid, thereby increasing the number of copies of a selected nucleic acid sequence. Amplification may be exponential or linear. A tar\u00ad get or template nucleic acid may be either DNA or RNA. The sequences amplified in this manner form an \"amplified region\" or \"amplicon.\" Primer probes can be readily designed by those skilled in the art to target a specific template nucleic acid sequence. In certain preferred embodiments, resulting amplicons are short to allow for rapid cycling and generation of copies. The size of the amplicon can vary as needed to provide the ability to discriminate target nucleic acids from non-target nucleic acids. For example, amplicons can be less than about 1,000 nucleotides in length. Desirably the ampli\u00ad cons are from 100 to 500 nucleotides in length (e.g., 100 to 200, 150 to 250, 300 to 400, 350 to 450, or 400 to 500 nucleotides in length). [0348] While the exemplary methods described hereinafter relate to amplification using polymerase chain reaction (\"PCR\"), numerous other methods are known in the art for amplification of nucleic acids (e.g., isothermal methods, roll\u00ad ing circle methods, etc.). Those skilled in the art will under\u00adstand that these other methods may be used either in place of, or together with, PCR methods. See, e.g., Saiki, \"Amplifica\u00ad tion of Genomic DNA\" in PCR Protocols, Innis Eds., Academic Press, SanDiego, Calif., pp 13-20 (1990); Wharam et ah, Bio\u00ad techniques, 30:852 (2001). Further amplification methods suitable for use with the present methods include, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), transcription based amplification system (TAS), transcription mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) method, the strand displacement amplification (SDA) method, the loop mediated isothermal amplification method, isothermal and chimeric primer-initiated acid (ICAN) method, and the smart amplification system (SMAP) method. These methods, as well as others are well known in the art and can be adapted for use in conjunction with provided methods of detection of amplified nucleic acid. The PCR method is a technique for making many copies of a specific template DNA sequence. [0349] The PCR process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195; 4,683,202; and 4,965,188, each of which is incor\u00ad by reference. One set of primers complemen\u00ad tary to a template DNA are designed, and a region flanked by the primers is amplified by DNA polymerase in a reaction including multiple amplification cycles. Each amplification cycle includes an initial denaturation, and up to 50 cycles of annealing, strand elongation (or extension) and strand sepa\u00ad ration (denaturation). In each cycle of the reaction, the DNA sequence between the primers is copied. Primers can bind to the copied DNA as well as the original template sequence, so the total number of copies increases exponentially with time. PCR can be performed as according to Whelan, et al, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 33:556 (1995). Various modified PCR methods are available and well known in the art. Various modifications such as the \"RT-PCR\" method, in which DNA is synthesized from RNA using a reverse transcriptase before performing PCR; and the \"TaqMan PCR\" method, in which only a specific allele is amplified and detected using a fluo- rescently labeled TaqMan probe, and Taq DNA polymerase, are known to those skilled in the art. RT-PCR and variations thereof have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,804,383; 5,407,800; 5,322,770; and 5,310,652, and refer\u00ad ences described are hereby incorporated by reference; and TaqMan PCR and related reagents for use in the method have been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,210,015; 5,876,930; 5,538,848; 6,030,787; and6,258, 569, which are hereby incorporated by reference. [0350] LCR is a method of DNA amplification similar to PCR, except that it uses four primers instead of two and uses the enzyme ligase to ligate or join two segments of DNA. Amplification can be performed in a thermal cycler (e.g., LCx of Abbott Labs, North Chicago, 111.). LCR can be performed for example, as according to Moore et ah, Journal of Clinical Microbiology 36:1028 (1998). LCRmethods and variations have been described, for example, in European Patent Appli\u00ad cation Publication No. EP0320308, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,427, 930, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. [0351] The TAS method is a method for specifically ampli\u00ad fying a target RNA in which a transcript is obtained from a template RNA by a cDNA synthesis step and an RNA tran\u00ad scription step. Inthe cDNA synthesis step, a sequence recog\u00ad nized by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Te., a poly\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 53Oct. 3, 2013 merase-binding sequence or PBS) is inserted into the cDNA copy downstream of the target or marker sequence to be amplified using a two-domain oligonucleotide primer. In the second step, an RNA polymerase is used to synthesize mul\u00ad tiple copies of RNA from the cDNA template. Amplification using TAS requires only a few cycles because DNA-depen- dent RNA transcription can result in 10-1000 copies for each copy of cDNA template. TAS can be performed according to Kwoh et ah, PNAS 86:1173 (1989). The TAS method has been described, for example, in International Patent Applica\u00ad tion Publication No. W01988/010315, whichis incorporated herein by mediated amplification (TMA) is a transcription-based isothermal amplification reaction that uses RNA transcription by RNA polymerase and DNA tran\u00ad scription by reverse transcriptase to produce an RNA ampli- con from target nucleic acid. TMA methods are advantageous in that they can produce 100 to 1000 copies of amplicon per amplification cycle, as opposed to PCR or LCR methods that produce only 2 copies per cycle. TMA has been described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,491 which is incorporated herein by reference. NASBA is a transcription-based method which for specifically amplifying a target RNA from either an RNA or DNA template. NASBA is a method used for the continuous amplification of nucleic acids in a single mixture at one temperature. A transcript is obtained from a template RNA by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using a forward primer having a sequence identical to a taiget RNA and a reverse primer having a sequence complementary to the target RNA a on the 3' side and a promoter sequence that recognizes T7 RNA polymerase on the 5' side. A transcript is further synthesized using the obtained transcript as template. This method can be performed as according to Heim, et ah, NucleicAcidsRes., 26:2250 (1998). TheNASBAmethodhas been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,238, whichis incorpo\u00ad rated herein by reference. [0353] The SDA method is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method in which taiget DNA is amplified using a DNA strand substituted with a strand synthesized by a strand substitution type DNA polymerase lacking 5'->3' exo\u00ad nuclease activity by a single stranded nick generated by a restriction enzyme as a template of the next replication. A primer containing a restriction site is annealed to template, and then amplification primers are annealed to 5' adjacent sequences (forming a nick). Amplification is initiated at a fixed temperature. Newly synthesized DNA strands are nicked by a restriction enzyme and the polymerase amplifi\u00ad cation begins again, displacing the newly synthesized strands. SDA can be performed according to Walker, et ah, PNAS, 89:392 (1992). SDA methods have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,455,166 and 5,457,027, each of which are incor\u00ad porated by reference. [0354] The LAMP method is an isothermal amplification method in which a loop is always formed at the 3' end of a synthesized DNA, primers are annealed within the loop, and specific amplification of the target DNA is performed isother- mally. LAMP can be performed according to Nagamine et al., Clinical Chemistry. 47:1742 (2001). LAMP methods have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,410,278; 6,974,670; and 7,175,985, each of which are incorporated by reference. [0355] The ICAN method is anisothermal amplification method in which specific amplification of a target DNA is performed isothermally by a strand substitution reaction, a template exchange reaction, and a nick introduction reaction,using a chimeric primer including RNA-DNA and DNA poly\u00ad merase having a strand substitution activity and RNase H. ICAN can be performed according to Mukai et ah, J. Bio- chem. 142:273 (2007). The IC AN method has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,951,722, which is incorporated herein by reference. [0356] The SMAP (MITANI) method is a method in which a target nucleic acid is continuously synthesized under iso\u00ad thermal conditions using a primer set including two kinds of primers and DNA or RNA as a template. The first primer included in the primer set includes, in the 3' end region thereof, a sequence (Ac') hybridizable with a sequence (A) in the 3' end region of a target nucleic acid sequence as well as, on the 5' side of the above-mentioned sequence (Ac'), a sequence (B') hybridizable with a sequence (Be) complemen\u00ad tary to a sequence (B) existing on the 5' side of the above- mentioned sequence (A) in the above-mentioned taiget nucleic acid sequence. The second primer includes, in the 3' end region thereof, a sequence (Ce') hybridizable with a sequence (C) in the 3' end region of a sequence complemen\u00ad tary to the above-mentioned target nucleic acid sequence as well as a loopback sequence (D-Dc') including two nucleic acid sequences hybridizable with each other on an identical strand on the 5' side of the above-mentioned sequence (Ce'). SMAP can be performed according to Mitani et ah, Nat. Methods, 4(3): 257 (2007). SMAP methods have been described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006/ 0160084,2007/0190531 and 2009/0042197, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. [0357] The amplification reaction can be designed to pro\u00ad duce a specific type of amplified product, such as nucleic acids that are double stranded; single stranded; double stranded with 3' or 5' overhangs; or double stranded with chemical ligands on the 5' and 3' ends. The amplified PCR product can be detected by: (i) hybridization of the amplified product to magnetic particle bound complementary oligo\u00ad nucleotides, where two different oligonucleotides are used that hybridize to the amplified product such that the nucleic acid serves as an interparticle tether promoting particle agglomeration; (ii) hybridization mediated detection where the DNA of the amplified product must first be denatured; (iii) hybridization mediated detection where the particles hybrid\u00ad ize to 5' and 3' overhangs of the amplified product; (iv) bind\u00ad ing of the particles to the chemical or biochemical ligandson the termini of the amplified product, such as streptavidin functionalized particles binding to biotin functionalized amplified product. [0358] The systems and methods of the invention can be used to perform real time PCR and provide quantitative infor\u00ad mation about the amount of target nucleic acid present in a sample (see FIG. 52 and Example 18). Methods for conduct\u00ad ing quantitative real time PCR are provided in the literature (see for example: RT-PCR Protocols. Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 193. Joe O'Connell, ed. Totowa, N.J.: Humana Press, 2002, 378 pp. ISBN 0-89603-875-0.). Example 18 describes use of the methods of the invention for real time PCR analysis of a whole blood sample. [0359] The systems and methods of the invention can be used to perform real time PCR directly in opaque samples, such as whole blood, using magnetic nanoparticles modified with capture probes and magnetic separation. Using real-time PCR allows for the quantification of a target nucleic acid without opening the reaction tube after the PCR reaction has commenced. US 2013/0260367 A l 54Oct. 3, 2013 [0360] In one approach, biotin or avidin labeled primers can be used to perform real-time PCR. These labels would have corresponding binding moieties on the magnetic par\u00ad ticles that could have very fast binding times. This allows for a double stranded product to be generated and allows for much faster particle binding times, decreasing the overall turnaround time. The binding chemistry would be reversible, preventing the primers from remaining particle bound. In order to reverse the binding, the sample can be heated or the pH adjusted.The Tm of the amplicon binding to one of the particle-immo\u00ad bilized capture probes can be designed such that that binding interaction is more favorable than the particle-to-particle binding interaction (by, e.g., engineering point mutations within the capture probes to thermodynamically destabilize the duplexes). Inthis embodiment, the particle concentration can be kept at, e.g., low or high levels. Examples of probes and primers useful in such a system are set forth in the table below. [0361] In another approach, the real-time PCR can be accomplished through the generation of duplex DNA with overhangs that can hybridize to the superparamagnetic par\u00ad ticles. Additionally, LNA and/or fluorinated capture probes may speed up the hybridization times. An exemplary set of capture probes useful in this method is set forth in the table below:C. a l b i c a n s IT S 2 R e v e r s e P C. a l b i c a n s IT S 2 F o r w a r d P C. a l b IT S 2 CPI P a n C a n d i d a F 5 ' -CAT GAT CTG CTG CAG / l S p l 8 / G G U n i - T a i l CAT GCC TGT TTG AGC GTC- 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 19)C. a l b IT S 2 CP2 P a n C a n d i d a R 5 ' -GCA GAA CTC CAG ACC / l S p l 8 / G C U n i - T a i l TTA TTG ATA TGC TTA AGT TCA GCG GGT- 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 20)C. a l b IT S 2 L o n g C P l 3 'AM u n i v e r s a l 5 '-C T G CAG CAG ATC ATG TTT t a i l CP TTT TTT TTT /3 A m M 0 /-3 ' (SEQ ID NO 21)C. a l b IT S 2 L o n g CP2 5 'AM u n i v e r s a l 5 ' -/5A m M C 6/TT TTT TTT TTT TGG t a i l CP TCT GGA GTT CTG C - 3 ' C. a l b IT S 2 F l u o r i n a t e d 5 ' -CTG / 12FC /A G /l2 F C /A G /l2 F A /T Cm u t 3 C P l 3 'AM u n i CP / 12FA /T G TTT TTT TTT T T T /3 A m M O /-3 ' (SEQ ID NO 22) C. a l b IT S 2 F l u o r i n a t e d 5 ' -/5A m M C 12/T T TTT TTT TTT TGGm u t 4 C P l 5 'AM u n i CP T /1 2 F C /T G /1 2 F G /A G / i 2 F U / T CTG C - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 23)5 ' -CCG TCT TTC AAG CAA ACC CAA GTC G - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 24) g , _ ACC GCT GG_ 3 (SEQ ID NO 25) 5 ' - / 5AmMC12/T T TTT TTT TTT TTT TGG TTT GGT MT GAG CAA TAC G - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 26) 5 ' - / 5AmMC12/T T TTT TTT TTT TCG TAT TGC TCA ACA CCA AAC C - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 27) 5 ' - / 5AmMC12/T T TTT TTT TTT TTT TAC CGC TGG GTT TGT TGA GCA ATA C G -3 ' (SEQ ID NO 28) 5 ' - / 5AmMC12/T T TTT TTT TTT TTT TAC CGC TGG GTT TGT TGA GCA ATA C G -3 ' (SEQ ID NO 29) 5 ' - / 5AmMC12/T T TTT TTT TTT TGG TTT GGC GTA GAG CCA TAC G - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 30) 5 ' - / 5AmMC12/T T TTT TTT TTT TGG TCT GGC GTA GAG CCA TAC G - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 31) [0362] In still another approach, the particles are designed to have a hairpin that buries the binding site to the amplicon. Heating the particles to a higher melt temperature would expose the binding site of the hairpin to allow binding to the target. [0363] In another approach, a probe that hybridizes to an amplicon is tethering two (or more) particles. The reaction would be conducted in the presence of a polymerase with 5' exonuclease activity, resulting in the cleavage of the inter\u00ad particle tether and a subsequent change in T2. The poly\u00ad merase is selected to have exonuclease activity and compat\u00ad ibility with the matrix of choice (e.g. blood). Inthis approach, smaller particles (e.g., 30 nm CLIO) can be used to reduce steric hindrance of the hybridization to target or subsequent enzymatic digestion during polymerization (see, e.g., Heid et al Genome Research 1996 6: 986-994). [0364] In another approach, two particle populations can be synthesized to bear complementary capture probes. In the absence of amplicon, the capture probes hybridize promoting particle clustering. Upon generation of amplicon, the ampli\u00ad con can compete, hybridize, and displace the capture probes leading to particle declustering. The method can be con\u00ad ducted in the presence or absence of nanoparticles. The par\u00ad ticles free in solution will cluster and decluster due to the thermocycling (because, e.g., the Tm can be below 95\u00b0 C.).[0365] Previous work showed that in some cases the pres\u00ad ence of particles in the PCR reaction could inhibit PCR. For these inhibitory particles, it is envisioned that the particles could be pulled to the side of the tube (or other location within the container) to keep them out of solution during the PCR reaction. Methods can be used to release the particles back into suspension to allow them to hybridize to the PCR product and then pull them back out of solution. [0366] In certain embodiments, the invention features the use of enzymes compatible with whole blood, e.g., NEB Hemoklentaq, PCR. In any of the real-time PCR methods of the invention, the method can involve the following steps: [0368] I. aliquoting whole blood into a prepared PCR mastermix containing superparamagnetic particles; [0369] 2. prior to the first PCR cycle, closing the tube until PCR cycling is completed; [0370] 3. loading the tube onto thermal cycler; [0371] 4. running \"n\" cycles of standard PCR thermal cycling; [0372] 5. conducting a T2 detection (the exact time dura\u00ad tion and steps for this vary depending on the biochemical and particle design approach described below); and US 2013/0260367 A l 55Oct. 3, 2013 [0373] 6. repeating steps 4 and 5 until enough T2 read\u00ad ings have been taken for an accurate quantification of initial taiget concentration. [0374] The above methods can be used with any of the following categories of detection of aggregation or disaggre\u00ad gation described herein, including: Name Description Clustering-based separation Clustering-based detection with particles >100 nm De-clustermg-based detection and magnetic separation De-clustermg-based detection nm Clustering-based detection nmParticles >100 compatible.

These inhibitors can lead to generation of false positives and low sensitivities. To reduce the generation of false posi\u00ad tives and low sensitivities when amplifying and detecting nucleic acids in complex samples, it is desirable to utilize a thermal stable polymerase not inhibited by whole blood samples (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,462,475) and include one or more internal PCR assay controls (see Rosenstraus et al. J. Clin and Hoofar et ah, J. Clin. Microbiol. 42:1863 (2004)). For example, to assure that clini\u00ad cal specimens are successfully amplified and detected, the assay can include an internal control nucleic acid that con\u00ad tains primer binding regions identical to those of the target sequence. As shown in the examples, the target nucleic acid and internal control can be selected such that each has a unique probe binding region that differentiates the internal control from the target nucleic acid. The internal control is, optionally, employed in combination with a processing posi\u00ad tive control, a processing negative control, and a reagent control for the safe and accurate determination and identifi\u00ad cation of an infecting organism in, e.g., a whole blood clinical sample. The internal control can be an inhibition control that is designed to co-amplify with the nucleic acid target being detected. Failure of the internal inhibition control to be ampli\u00ad fied is evidence of a reagent failure or process error. Universal primers can be designed such that the target sequence and theinternal control sequence are amplified in the same reaction tube. Thus, using this format, if the target DNA is amplified but the internal control is not it is then assumed that the taiget DNA is present in a proportionally greater amount than the internal control and the positive result is valid as the internal control amplification is unnecessary. If, on the other hand, neither the internal control nor the taiget is amplified it is then assumed that inhibition of the PCR reaction has occurred and the test for that particular sample is not valid. The assays of the invention can include one or more positive processing controls in which one or more target nucleic acids is included in the assay (e.g., each included with one or more cartridges) at 3x to 5x the limit of detection. The measured T2 for each of the positive processing controls must be above the pre-deter- mined threshold indicating the presence of the target nucleic acid. The positive processing controls can detect all reagent failures in each step of the process (e.g., lysis, PCR, and T2 detection), and can be used for quality control of the system. The assays of the invention can include one or more negative processing controls consisting of a solution free of taiget nucleic acid (e.g., buffer alone). The T2 measurements forthe negative processing control should be below the threshold indicating a negative result while the T2 measured for the internal control is above the decision threshold indicating an internal control positive result. The purpose of the negative control is to detect carry-over contamination and/or reagent contamination. The assays of the invention can include one or more reagent controls. The reagent control will detect reagent failures in the PCR stage of the reaction (i.e. incomplete transfer of master mix to the PCR tubes). The reagent controls can also detect gross failures in reagent transfer prior to T2 detection. [0376] Contamination Control [0377] One of the major problems in the use of PCR as an analytical tool is the risk of having new reactions contami\u00ad nated with old, amplified products. Potential sources of con\u00ad tamination include a) large numbers of target oiganisms in clinical specimens that may result in cross-contamination, b) plasmid clones derived from organisms that have been previ\u00ad ously analyzed and that may be present in larger numbers in the laboratory environment, and c) repeated amplification of the same taiget sequence leading to accumulation of ampli\u00ad fication products in the laboratory environment. A common source of the accumulation of the PCR amplicon is aero- solization of the product. Typically, if aero- solization occurs, the amplicon will contaminate laboratory reagents, equipment, and ventilation systems. Whenthis hap\u00ad pens, all reactions will be positive, and it is not possible to distinguish between amplified products from the contamina\u00ad tion or a true, positive sample. In addition to taking precau\u00ad tions to avoid or control this carry-over of old products, it is necessary to include a blank reference reaction in every PCR experiment to check for carry-over. In order to be certain that all results are reliable, there must be no amplified products after the temperature cycling. A carry-over contamination will be visible on the agarose gel as faint bands. Furthermore, it is also very important to include a positive sample. If, contrary to expectation, the sample is negative, none of the results can be considered as trustworthy, (see Aslanzadeh et ah, Annals of Clin Lab Science, 34:389 (2004)). [0378] It is conceivable that the reagents used to prepare the PCR may be contaminated. After the amplification a positive sample may contain 250 ng PCR product in 50 pi. This gives a total of 3.9 1011 copies of a 600 bp double-stranded prod\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 56Oct. 3, 2013 uct. One thousandth of a microliter of this reaction will con\u00ad tain approximately 8 million copies. If a very small and invis\u00ad ible aerosol is formed when the PCR vessel is opened, there is a possibility that this aerosol can contain a very large number of amplified products. Furthermore, the microscopic droplets in an aerosol are able to float for a long time in the air, and if there is turbulence in the room, they can be carried a long way. Considering the fact that only one copy is enough to create a false positive reaction, it is obvious that great care must be taken to avoid this carry-over contamination. [0379] To address the problem of contamination problem, one or more of the following protocols can be used: [0380] (i) Replace all reagents and stock buffers with new chemicals and new water which have never been in contact with the areas of sample preparation and PCR analysis. [0381] (ii) Physically divide the area of reagent mixing and sample preparation from the area of product analysis (Kwok & Higuchi, Nature, 339:237 (1989)). [0382] (iii) Sample preparation workstations can be cleaned (e.g., with 10% sodium hypochlorite solution, fol\u00ad lowed by removal of the bleach with ethanol). Oxidative breakdown of nucleic acids prevents reamplification of impu\u00ad rities in subsequent PCR reactions. [0383] (iv) Sterilization of the amplification products ensures that subsequent diagnostic assays are not compro\u00ad mised by carryover DNA, and must follow two generally accepted criteria: (a) the PCR needs to be exposed to the environment after there has been some form of modification of amplicon, and (b) the modification must not interfere with the detection method. For example, UV irradiation can effec\u00ad tively remove contaminating DNA (see Rys et ah, J. Microbiol. 3:2356 (1993); and Sarker et ah, Nature, 343:27 (1990)), but the irradiation of the PCR reagents must take place before addition of polymerase, primers, and template DNA. Furthermore, this approach may be inefficient because the large numbers of mononucleotides present in the reaction will absorb much of the UV light (See Frothingham et ah, BioTechniques 13:208 (1992)). UV light sterilization of the amplification products uses the property of UV light to induce thymine dimmers and other covalent modifications of the DNA that render the contaminating DNA un-amplifiable. Alternatively, incorporation of dUTP into the amplified frag\u00ad ments will also alter the composition of the product so that it is different from the template DNA composition (see Longo et ah, Gene 93:125 (1990); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,035,996; 7,687,247; and 5,418,149). The enzyme Uracil-N-Glycosy- Iase (UNG) is added together with the normal PCR enzyme to the reaction mix. The UNG enzyme will cleave the uracil base from DNA strands before amplification, and leave all the old amplified products unable to act as templates for new ampli\u00ad fication, but will not react on unincorporated dUTP or new template. This will efficiently remove contaminating PCR products from the reaction after the PCR vessel has been closed, and thus no new contamination is possible. Flowever, the use of dUTP in PCR reactions to prevent carry-over can cause problems when the products are used in a later hybrid\u00ad ization study, due to the low capability of uracil to act in hybridization (Carmody et ah, Biotechniques 15:692 (1993)). dUTP is incorporated instead of dTTP. When a probe rich in T's is amplified with the substitution of dTTP for dUTP in the reaction mixture, a later hybridization signal with the probe may be eliminated. To avoid the decrease in hybridization signal the probe binding site should be chosen with no more than 25% T's, and without stretches of poly-T. Furthermore,the PCR should contain equal concentrations of dUTP and dTTP and not only dUTP. In contrast to the decrease in hybridization signal is the increase in product amplification when using dUTP, especially when AT-rich target sequences are selected. This is probably because the incorporation of dUTP decreases re-annealing of formed PCR products which would prevent primers from annealing. If this approach is used to increase the product yield, the primer binding sites should be selected with a low content of T's, since primer annealing also will be inhibited by dUTP incorporation (Car\u00ad mody et ah, UDG isolated from BMTU 3346 is described in Schmidt et al. Biochemica 2:13 (1996) (see also U.S. Pat. No. 6,187,575). A uracil-DNA glycosylase gene from Psychrobacter sp HJl 47 was described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,723,093. Lastly a cod uracil- DNA glycosylase was described (U.S. Pat. No. 7,037,703). [0384] (v) DNase digestion after PCR can be used to reduce contamination. A heat labile DNase enzyme was identified that can be used to digest ds DNA to remove any contaminat\u00ad ing DNA prior to the PCR amplification step of the target DNA. In this case, the ds DNA is digested, the sample is heated to inactivate the DNase, and the target sample and PCR reactants are added to the reaction tube to carry out the target specific PCR. (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,204). [0385] (vi) Sterilization after PCR can be used to reduce contamination. Incorporation of a photochemical reagent (isopsoralen) into the product during amplification will create a difference in composition between the template DNA and the amplified PCR products (see Rys et ah, J. Clin Microbiol. 3:2356 (1993)). Furocoumarin compounds, such as isopsor\u00ad psoralen, are a class of planar tricylcic reagents that are known to intercalate between base pairs of nucleic acids (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,532,145). Light treatment of the closed PCR vessel will render previously formed PCR products unable to act as templates for further amplification. The hybridization abilities of the product are not changed, but the detection capabilities on agarose gel can be decreased due to reduced binding of EtBr. Isopsoralen of 25 mg/ml was shown to be ineffective at preventing contamination, and at concen\u00ad trations up to 100 mg/ml, isopsoralen may have an inhibitory effect on the PCR reaction itself (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,221, 608). Alternatively, primer hydrolysis can be used to sterilize a reaction after amplification. Primer hydrolysis of steriliza\u00ad tion of amplification products relies on the uniquely synthe\u00ad sized chimeric primers that contain one or more ribose link\u00ad ages at the 3' end. The generated amplification products containing those ribose residues are susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis at the site of the ribose molecule. The method includes exposure to IM NaOH and incubated for 30 minutes to hydrolyze the amplification products at the sites of the incorporated ribose. Thus, if there is carryover contamina\u00ad tion, the old amplicon has lost its primer site due to the hydrolysis of the ribose molecules and the new amplicon will have the primer binding sites. In another approach, addition of hydroxylamine hydrochloride to PCR reaction tubes after amplification sterilizes the reaction contents, and is espe\u00ad cially effective for short (<100 bp) The hydroxy reacts with in and creates covalent adducts that prevent base-pairing with guanine residues in subsequent reactions. Thus, the modified amplification prod\u00ad uct are not recognized as amplification targets in subsequent PCR reactions. US 2013/0260367 A l 57Oct. 3, 2013 [0386] (vii) Prevention of carry-over by changing the prod\u00ad uct composition from the template can reduce contamination. In one approach the DNA composition of the PCR product can be different from the natural template DNA composition. This altered composition is intended to make the PCR prod\u00ad ucts sensitive to treatment that will not alter the template DNA. The treatment of the closed PCR vessel just before amplification should make the contaminating PCR product unable to participate in the amplification. Here the modifica\u00ad tion would have to be innocuous to the detection method. The types of modifications that can be useful in distinguishing contaminant amplification product will be apparent, but include introduction of a ligand, cross-linking agent, enzyme recognition 5,650,302; 5,876,976; and 6,037,152). [0387] One or more of the methods described above can be used in conjunction with the methods of the invention to reduce the risk of contamination and false positives. Carry\u00ad over of old amplified PCR products can be a very serious risk in the nucleic acid analysis in the T2 Biosystems diagnostic platform. One way to prevent this contamination is to physi\u00ad cally divide the PCR working areas. Alternatives to the physi\u00ad cal separation of the PCR reaction method include UV irra\u00ad diation of PCR mix and incorporation of reagents into the newly formed PCR product can be used to alter it from the template. [0388] Reaction Kinetics [0389] The reaction of magnetic particles and specific ana\u00ad lytes to form aggregates can be used to produce a diagnostic signal in the assays of the invention. In many instances, incu\u00ad bation of the reaction mixture for a period of time is sufficient to form the aggregates. The methods, kits, cartridges, and devices of the invention can be configured to shorten the amount of time needed to capture a particular analyte, or produce aggregates of magnetic particles. While altering the overall concentration of magnetic particles would appear to be a simple and direct approach to increasing aggregation rates, this approach is complicated by (i) nonspecific aggre\u00ad gation that can arise with high magnetic particle concentra\u00ad tions, and (ii) the need to produce an observable signal change (i.e., change in relaxation signal) in response to aggregation in the presence of a low concentration of analyte. Reaction kinetics can be improved, for example, by mechanically induced aggregation, by acoustically induced aggregation, by ultrasonically induced aggregation, by electrostatically induced aggregation, or by trapping the magnetic particles in a portion of the liquid sample. [0390] Mechanically InducedAggregation [0391] The kinetics of aggregation can be increased by passing the particle/analyte solution through a vessal in which there is a narrowing of the path of the fluid flow. The narrowing enhances particle-particle interactions. [0392] Acoustically InducedAggregation [0393] The aggregation of magnetic particles can be accel\u00ad erated by applying an acoustic standing wave to the sample (see Aboobaker et ah, Journal of Environmental Engineering, 129:427 (2003) andU.S. Pat. No. 4,523,682). For example, a flow chamber with two transducers at opposite ends can be used to generate an acoustic standing wave in the sample that causes the magnetic particles to migrate (or be segregated) in a manner that increases the rate of magnetic particle aggre\u00ad gation.[0394] Ultrasonically InducedAggregation [0395] The aggregation of magnetic particles can be accel\u00ad erated by applying an ultrasonic wave to the sample (see Masudo et ah, Anal. Chem. 73:3467 (2001)). In the presence of a standing plane ultrasound wave particles can move to the node of the wave along the ultrasound force gradient. This approach can be used to provide a reliable method for assist\u00ad ing the agglomeration reaction. [0396] Electrostatically InducedAggregation accel\u00ad erated by electrostatic interactions. Electrostatic separation or movement of the magnetic particles utilizes inherent dif\u00ad ferences in friction charge characteristics, electric conductiv\u00ad ity, and dielectric constants. Since the magnetic particles will behave differently under the application of an electrostatic field, movement and enhanced collisions can occur. Electro\u00ad static force exertion on the particles can be proportional to the surface area available for surface charge, so the nanoparticles will typically move in the presence of the electrostatic field when coated with varying materials, such as dextran or other large molecular coatings, and whether or not the nanoparticle has bound to one of the binding moieties a analyte. The nanoparticles must first be charged and the charge could optionally be pulsed. See, for example, Sinyagin et Chem. ah, Lab Chip 5:606 (2005). [0398] Trapping [0399] The magnetic particles derivatized with a binding moiety can be held in position by an external magnetic field while sample containing the corresponding analyte is circu\u00ad lated past the \"trapped\" magnetic particles allowing for cap\u00ad ture and/or concentrate the analyte of interest. The capture and/or aggregation can be facilitated by exposure to a mag\u00ad netic field (i.e., MAA or gMAA) as described herein. [0400] Alternatively, the kinetics of magnetic particle aggregation can be increased by sequestering the magnetic particles in a compartment defined by a porous membrane, such as a tea bag, that permits flow of analytes into and out of the compartment. The increase in the local concentration of magnetic particles can increase the reaction kinetics between magnetic particles and analytes, and the kinetics of aggrega\u00ad tion. After mixing the solution and magnetic particles for a predetermined period of time, the magnetic particles are released from the compartment and the sample is measured. [0401] In certain instances, the particles may be pulled to the side or bottom of the assay vessel, or a magnetizable mesh or magnetizable metal foam with appropriate pore size can be present in the reaction vessel, creating very high local mag\u00ad netic gradients. The metal foam generates very high local magnetic field gradients over very short distances which can attract the derivatized magnetic particles and bring them in contact with the complementary binding partner on the metal foam and improve the chances of a specific productive inter\u00ad action. An advantage of having the mesh/metal foam in the reaction vessel is that the distance each magnetic particle needs to travel to be \"trapped\" or \"captured\" can be very short, improving assay kinetics. For example, to a reaction tube can be added a magnetizable mesh foam having pores of 100 to 1000 microns, a liquid sample, and magnetic particles for detecting an analyte in the liquid sample. The reaction tube is exposed to a magnetic field to magnetize the mesh. The magnetic particles are then attracted to the magnetized mesh and become trapped within the pores of the mesh. The con\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 58Oct. 3, 2013 centration of the magnetic particles within the mesh increases the reaction kinetics between the magnetic particles and the analyte diffusing into and out of the mesh (the reaction tube is optionally agitated to expedite the diffusion of analyte onto the trapped magnetic particles). The mesh is then demagne\u00ad tized (e.g., by heating the mesh or exposing the mesh to an alternating magnetic field), thereby permitting the release of magnetic particles complexed to analyte. Larger aggregates of magnetic particles can then be formed, completing the reaction. [0402] In an analogous approach, the kinetics of magnetic particle aggregation can be increased by centrifugally pulling the magnetic particles down to the bottom of the sample tube. The increase in the local concentration of magnetic particles can increase the aggregation kinetics. To facilitate separation by centrifugation the particles are, desirably, greater than about 30 nm in diameter. [0403] NMR Units [0404] The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more NMR units. FIG. IA is a schematic diagram 100 of an NMR system for detection of a signal response of a liquid sample to an appropriate RF pulse sequence. A bias magnet 102 establishes a bias magnetic field Bh 104 through a sample 106. The magnetic particles are in a liquid or lyophilized state in the cartridge prior to their intro\u00ad duction to a sample well (the term \"well\" as used herein includes any indentation, vessel, container, or support) 108 until introduction of the liquid sample 106 into the well 108, or the magnetic particles can be added to the sample 106 prior to introduction of the liquid sample into the well 108. An RF coil HO and RF oscillator 112 provides an RF excitation at the Larmor frequency which is a linear function of the bias magnetic field Bh. In one embodiment, the RF coil HO is wrapped around the sample well 108. The excitation RF creates a nonequilibrium distribution in the spin of the water protons (or free protons in a non-aqueous solvent). When the RF excitation is turned off, the protons \"relax\" to their origi\u00ad nal state and emit an RF signal that can be used to extract information about the presence and concentration of the ana\u00ad lyte. The coil HO acts as an RF antenna and detects a signal, which based on the applied RF pulse sequence, probes dif\u00ad ferent properties of the material, for example a T2 relaxation. The signal of interest for some cases of the technology is the spin-spin relaxation (generally 10-2000 milliseconds) and is called the T2 relaxation. The RF signal from the coil HO is amplified 114 and processed to determine the T2 (decay time) response to the excitation in the bias field Bh. The well 108 may be a small capillary or other tube with nanoliters to microliters of the sample, including the analyte and an appro\u00ad priately sized coil wound around it (see FIG. IB). The coil is typically wrapped around the sample and sized according to the sample volume. For example (and without limitation), for a sample having a volume of about 10 ml, a solenoid coil about 50 mm in length and 10 to 20 mm in diameter could be used; for a sample having a volume of about 40 pi, a solenoid coil about 6 to 7 mm in length and 3.5 to 4 mm in diameter could be used; and for a sample having a volume of about 0.1 nl a solenoid coil about 20 pm in length and about 10 pm in diameter could be used. Alternatively, the coil may be con\u00ad figured as shown in any of FIGS. 2A-2E about or in proximity to the well. An NMR system may also contain multiple RF coils for the detection of multiplexing purposes. In certain embodiments, the RF coil has designs. FIG. 2A shows a wound solenoid micro coil 200 about 100 pm in length, however one could envision a coil having 200 pm, 500 pm or up to 1000 pm in length. FIG. 2B shows a \"planar\" coil 202 (the coil is not truly planar, since the coil has finite thickness) about 1000 pm in diameter. FIG. 2C shows a MEMS solenoid coil 204 defining a volume of about 0.02 pL. FIG. 2D shows a schematic of a MEMS Flelmholz coil 206 configuration, and FIG. 2E shows a sche\u00ad matic of a saddle coil 220 configuration. [0406] A wound solenoid micro coil 200 used for tradi\u00ad tional NMR detection is described in Seeber et ah, \"Design and testing of high sensitivity micro-receiver coil apparatus for nuclear magnetic resonance and imaging,\" Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. Aplanarmicro coil 202 used for traditional NMR detection is described in Massin et ah, \"Ffigh RF A Flelmholtz coil configuration 206 features a well 208 for holding a sample, a top Si layer 210, a bottom Si layer 212, and deposited metal coils 214. An example of a Flelmholtz coil configuration 206 used for traditional NMR detection is described in Syms et al, \"MEMS 15 (2005) S1-S9. [0407] The NMR unit includes a magnet (i.e., a supercon\u00ad ducting magnet, an electromagnet, or a permanent magnet). The magnet design can be open or partially closed, ranging from U- or C-shaped magnets, to magnets with three and four posts, to fully enclosed magnets with small openings for sample placement. The tradeoff is accessibility to the \"sweet spot\" of the magnet and mechanical stability (mechanical stability can be an issue where high field homogeneity is desired). For example, the NMR unit can include one or more permanent magnets, cylindrically shaped and made from SmCo, NdFeB, or other low field permanent magnets that provide a magnetic field in the range of about 0.5 to about 1.5 T (i.e., suitable SmCo and NdFeB permanent magnets are available fromNeomax, Osaka, Japan). Forpurposes of illus\u00ad tration and not limitation, such permanent magnets can be a dipole/box permanent magnet (PM) assembly, or a hallbach design (See Demas et ah, Concepts Magn Reson Part A 34A: 48 (2009)). The NMR units can include, without limitation, a permanent magnet of about 0.5 T strength with a field homo\u00ad geneity of about 20-30 ppm and a sweet spot of 40 pL, centered. This field homogeneity allows a less expensive magnet to be used (less tine fine-tuning the assembly/shim- ming), in a system less prone to fluctuations (e.g. temperature drift, mechanical stability over time-practically any impact is much too small to be seen), tolerating movement of ferromag\u00ad netic or conducting objects in the stray field (these have less of an impact, hence less shielding is needed), without com\u00ad promising the assay measurements (relaxation measurements and correlation measurements do not require a highly homo\u00ad geneous field). [0408] The coil configuration may be chosen or adapted for specific implementation of the micro-NMR-MRS technol\u00ad ogy, since different coil configurations offer different perfor\u00ad mance characteristics. For example, each of these coil geom\u00ad etries has a different performance and field alignment. The planar coil 202 has an RF field perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The solenoid coil 200 has an RF field down the axis of the coil, and the Helmholtz coil 206 has an RF field trans\u00ad verse to the two rectangular coils 214. The Helmholtz 206 and US 2013/0260367 A l 59Oct. 3, 2013 saddle coils 220 have transverse fields which would allow the placement of the permanent magnet bias field above and below the well. Helmholtz 206 and saddle coils 220 may be most effective for the chip design, while the solenoid coil 200 may be most effective when the sample and MRS magnetic particles are held in a micro tube. [0409] The micro-NMR devices may be fabricated by winding or printing the coils or by microelectromechanical system (MEMS) semiconductor fabrication techniques. For example, a wound or printed coil/sample well module may be about 100 pm in diameter, or as large as a centimeter or more. A MEMS unit or chip (thusly named since it is fabricated in a semiconductor process as a die on a wafer) may have a coil that is from about 10 pm to about 1000 pm in characteristic dimension, for example. The wound or printed coil/sample well configuration is referenced herein as a module and the MEMS version is referenced herein as a chip. For example, the liquid sample 108 may be held in a tube (for example, a capillary, pipette, or micro tube) with the coil wound around it, or it may be held in wells on the chip with the RF coil surrounding the well. Alternatively, the sample is positioned to flow through a tube, capillary, or cavity in the proximity to the RF coil. [0410] Thebasic components of an NMR unit include elec\u00ad trical components, such as a tuned RF circuit within a mag\u00ad netic field, including an MR sensor, receiver and transmitter electronics that could be including preamplifiers, amplifiers and protection circuits, data acquisitions components, pulse programmer and pulse generator. [0411] Systems containing NMR units with RF coils and micro wells containing magnetic particle sensors described herein may be designed for detection and/or concentration measurement of specific analyte(s) of interest by develop\u00ad ment of a model for particle aggregation phenomena and by development of an RF-NMR signal chain model. For example, experiments can be conducted for analyte/magnetic particle systems of interest by characterizing the physics of particle aggregation, including, for example, the effects of affinities, relevant dimensions, and concentrations. Also, experiments can be conducted to characterize such as T1/T2 hybrid signals and may also include but are not limited to diffusion, susceptibility, frequency) as func\u00ad tions of particle aggregation or depletion and magnetic par\u00ad ticle characteristics. Signal characteristics specific to the MRS (magnetic resonance switch) phenomenon in a given system can be used to enhance detection sensitivity and/or otherwise improve performance. [0412] The NMR system may include a chip with RF coil (s) and electronics micromachined thereon. For example, the chip may be surface micromachined, such that structures are built on top of a substrate. Where the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the properties of the substrate are not as important as in bulk micromachining, and expensive silicon wafers used in bulk micromachining can be replaced by less expensive materials such as glass or plastic. Alternative embodiments, however, may include chips that are bulk micromachined. Surface micromachining generally starts with a wafer or other substrate and grows layers on top. These layers are selectively etched by photolithography and either a wet etch involving an acid or a dry etch involving an ionized gas, or plasma. Dry etching can combine chemicaletching with physical etching, or ion bombardment of the material. Surface micromachining may involve as many lay\u00ad ers as is needed. [0413] In some cases, an inexpensive RF coil maybe inte\u00ad grated into a disposable cartridge and be a disposable com\u00ad ponent. The coil could be placed in a manner that allows electrical contact with circuitry on the fixed NMR setup, or the coupling could be made inductively to a circuit. [0414] Where the relaxation measurement is T2, accuracy and repeatability (precision) will be a function of temperature stability of the sample as relevant to the calibration, the sta\u00ad bility of the assay, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the pulse sequence for refocusing (e.g., CPMG, BIRD, Tango, and the like), as well as signal processing factors, such as signal conditioning (e.g., amplification, rectification, and/or digiti\u00ad zation of the echo signals), time/frequency domain transfor\u00ad mation, and signal processing algorithms used. Signal-to- noise ratio is a function of the magnetic bias field (Bh), sample volume, filling factor, coil geometry, coil Q-factor, electronics bandwidth, amplifier noise, and temperature. [0415] In order to understand the required precision of the T2 measurement, one should look at a response curve of the assay at hand and correlate the desired precision of determin\u00ad ing the analyte concentration and the precision of the mea\u00ad surable, e.g., T2 for some cases. Then a proper error budget can be formed. [0416] For example, to obtain a 10-fold improvement in the 0.02 ng/mL detection limit for Troponin (10-fold increase in sensitivity), it would be necessary to discern a delta-T, less than about 5.6 milliseconds from a traditional (non-MRS- measured) T2 of about 100 milliseconds. The minimum sig- nal-to-noise ratio (S/N) would need to be about 20 to detect this difference. [0417] The NMR units for use in the systems and methods of the invention can be those described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,564,245, incorporated herein by reference. [0418] The NMR units of the invention can include a small probehead for use in a portable magnetic resonance relaxom- eter as described in PCT Publication No. W009/061,481, incorporated herein by reference. [0419] The systems of the invention can be implantable or partially implantable in a subject. For example, the NMR units of the invention can include implantable radiofrequency coils and optionally implantable magnets as described in PCT Publication Nos. W009/085214 and WO08/057578, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. [0420] The systems of the invention can include a poly\u00ad meric sample container for reducing, partly or completely, the contribution of the NMR signal associated with the sample container to the nuclear magnetic resonance parameter of the liquid sample as described in PCT Publication No. WO09/ 045354, incorporated herein by reference. [0421] The systems of the invention can include a dispos\u00ad able sample holder for use with the MR reader that is config\u00ad ured to permit a predetermined number of measurements (i .e., is designed for a limited number of uses). The disposable sample holder can include none, part, or all, of the elements of the RF detection coil (i.e., such that the MR reader lacks a detection coil). For example, the disposable sample holder can include a \"read\" coil for RF detection that is inductively coupled to a \"pickup\" coil present in the MR reader. When the sample container is inside the MR reader it is in close prox\u00ad imity to the pickup coil and can be used to measure NMR signal. Alternatively, the disposable sample holder includes US 2013/0260367 A l 60Oct. 3, 2013 an RF coil for RF detection that is electrically connected to the MR reader upon insertion of the sample container. Thus, when the sample container is inserted into the MR reader the appropriate electrical connection is established to allow for detection. The number of uses available to each disposable sample holder can be controlled by disabling a fusable link included either in the electrical circuit within the disposable sample holder, or between the disposable sample holder and the MR reader. After the disposable sample holder is used to detect an NMR relaxation in a sample, the instrument can be configure to apply excess current to the fusable link, causing the link to break and rendering the coil inoperable. Option\u00ad ally, multiple fusable links could be used, working in parallel, each connecting to a pickup on the system, and each broken individually at each use until all are broken and the disposable sample holder rendered inoperable. [0422] Cartridge Units [0423] The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more cartridge units to provide a convenient method for placing all of the assay reagents and consumables onto the system. For example, the system may be customized to perform a specific function, or adapted to perform more than one function, e.g., via changeable car\u00ad tridge units containing arrays of micro wells with customized magnetic particles contained therein. The system can include a replaceable and/or interchangeable cartridge containing an array of wells pre-loaded with magnetic particles, and designed for detection and/or concentration measurement of a particular analyte. Alternatively, the system may be usable with different cartridges, each designed for detection and/or concentration measurements of different analytes, or config\u00ad ured with separate cartridge modules for reagent and detec\u00ad tion for a given assay. The cartridge may be sized to facilitate insertion into and ejection from a housing for the preparation of a liquid sample which is transferred to other units in the system (i.e., a magnetic assisted agglomeration unit, or an NMR unit). The cartridge unit itself could potentially inter\u00ad face directly with manipulation stations as well as with the MR reader(s). The cartridge unit can be a modular cartridge having an inlet module that can be sterilized independent of the reagent module. [0424] For handling biological samples, such as blood samples, there are numerous competing requirements for the cartridge design, including the need for sterility for the inlet module to prevent cross contamination and false positive test results, and the need to include reagents in the package which cannot be easily sterilized using standard terminal steriliza\u00ad tion techniques like irradiation. An inlet module for sample aliquoting can be designed to interface with uncapped vacu- tainer tubes, and to aliquot two a sample volume that can be used to perform, for example, a Candida assay (see FIGS. 7D-7F). The vacutainer permits a partial or full fill. The inlet module has two hard plastic parts, that get ultrasonically welded together and foil sealed to form a network of channels to allow a flow path to form into the first well overflow to the second sample well. A soft vacutainer seal part is used to for a seal with the vacutainer, and includes a port for sample flow, and a venting port. To overcome the flow resistance once the vacutainer is loaded and inverted, some hydrostatic pressure is needed. Every time sample is removed from a sample well, the well will get replenished by flow from the vacutainer. [0425] A modular cartridge can provide a simple means for cross contamination control during certain assays, including but not limited to distribution of PCR products into multipledetection aliquots. In addition, a modular cartridge can be compatible with automated fluid dispensing, and provides a way to hold reagents at very small volumes for long periods of time (in excess of a year). Finally, pre-dispensing these reagents allows concentration and volumetric accuracy to be set by the manufacturing process and provides for a point of care use instrument that is more convenient as it can require much less precise pipetting. [0426] The modular cartridge of the invention is a cartridge that is separated into modules that can be packaged and if necessary sterilized separately. They can also be handled and stored separately, if for example the reagent module requires refrigeration but the detection module does not. FIG. 6 shows a representative cartridge with an inlet module, a reagent module and a detection module that are snapped together. In this embodiment, the inlet module would be packaged sepa\u00ad rately in a sterile package and the reagent and detection mod\u00ad ules would be pre-assembled and packaged together. [0427] During storage, the reagent module could be stored in a refrigerator while the inlet module could be stored in dry storage. This provides the additional advantage that only a very small amount of refrigerator or freezer space is required to store many assays. At time of use, the operator would retrieve a detection module and open the package, potentially using sterile technique to prevent contamination with skin flora if required by the assay. The Vacutainer tube is then decapped and the inverted inlet module is placed onto the tube as shown in FIG. I A. This module has been designed to be easily moldable using single draw tooling as shown in FIGS. 7B and 7C and the top and bottom of the cartridge are sealed with foil to prevent contamination and also to close the chan\u00ad nels. Once the tube has been re-sealed using the inlet module, the assembly is turned right side up and snapped onto the remainder of the cartridge. The inlet section includes a well with an overflow that allows sample tubes with between 2 and 6 ml of blood to be used and still provide a constant depth interface to the system automation. It accomplishes this by means of the overflow shown in FIG. 8, where blood that overflows the sampling well simply falls into the cartridge body, preventing contamination. [0428] FIGS. 9A-9C show the means of storing precisely pipetted small volume reagents. The reagents are kept in pipette tips that are shown in FIG. 9C. These are filled by manufacturing automation and then are placed into the car\u00ad tridge to seal their tips in tight fitting wells which are shown in a cutaway view FIG. 9B. Finally, foil seals are placed on the back of the tips to provide a complete water vapor proof seal. It is also possible to seal the whole module with a seal that will be removed by the operator, either in place of or in addition to the aforementioned foils. This module also provides storage for empty reaction vessels and pipette tips for use by the instrument while the detection module provides storage for capped 200 pi PCR vials used by the instrument to make final measurements from. [0429] FIGS. 10-13C show an alternative embodiment of the detection module of the cartridge which is design to provide for contamination control during, for example, pipet\u00ad ting of post-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) products. This is required because the billion fold amplification produced by PCR presents a great risk of cross contamination and false positives. Flowever, it is desirable to be able to aliquot this mixture safely, because low frequency analytes will have been amplified up and can be distributed for separate detec\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 61Oct. 3, 2013 tion or identification. There are three ways in which this portion of the cartridge aids in contamination control during this aliquoting operation. [0430] First, the cartridge contains a recessed well to per\u00ad form the transfer operations in as shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B. Second, the machine provides airflow through this well and down into the cartridge through holes in the bottom of the well, as shown in FIG. 11. The depth of the well is such that a pipette tip will remain in the airflow and prevent any aerosol from escaping. FIG. 12 depicts a bottom view of the detection module, showing the bottom of the detection tubes and the two holes used to ensure airflow. An optional filter can be inserted here to capture any liquid aerosol and prevent it from entering the machine. This filter could also be a sheet of a hydrophobic material like Gore-tex that will allow air but not liquids to escape. Finally, there is a special seal cap on each 200 ul tube to provide a make then break seal for each pipette tip as it enters the vessel, as shown in FIGS. 13A-13C. It is contemplated that the pipette tip used for aliqouting be stored in this well at all, thus making it possible for the tip never to leave the controlled air flow region. [0431] Alternatively, the modular cartridge is designed for a multiplexed assay. The challenge in multiplexing assays is combining multiple assays which have incompatible assay requirements (i.e., different incubation times and/or tempera\u00ad tures) on one cartridge. The cartridge format depicted in FIGS. 14A-14C allows for the combination of different assays with dramatically different assay requirements. The cartridge features two main components: (i) a reagent module (i.e., the reagent strip portion) that contains all of the indi\u00ad vidual reagents required for the full assay panel, and (ii) the detection module. The detection modules contain only the parts of the cartridge that carry through the incubation, and can carry single assays or several assays, as needed. The detection module depicted in FIG. 14B includes two detec\u00ad tion chambers for a single assay, the first detection chamber as the control and the second detection chamber for the sample. This cartridge format is expandable in that additional assays can be added by including reagents and an additional detec\u00ad tion module. [0432] The operation of the module begins when the user inserts the entire or a portion of the cartridge into the instru\u00ad ment. The instruments performs the assay actuation, aliquot\u00ad ing the assays into the separate detection chambers. These individual detection chambers are then disconnected from the reagent strip and from each other, and progress through the system separately. Because the reagent module is separated and discarded, the smallest possible sample unit travels through the instrument, conserving internal instrument space. By splitting up each assay into its own unit, different incuba\u00ad tion times and temperatures are possible as each multiplexed assay is physically removed from the others and each sample is individually manipulated. [0433] The cartridge units of the invention can include one or more populations of magnetic particles, either as a liquid suspension or dried magnetic particles which are reconsti\u00ad tuted prior to use. For example, the cartridge units of the invention can include a compartment including from I x IO 6 to IxlO 1 3 magnetic particles (e.g., from IxlO6 to IxlO8, to IxlO 0 to IxlO 12, IxlO 1 1 to 1x13, or from IxlO7 to 5xl08 magnetic particles) for assaying a single liquid sample.[0434] MAA Units [0435] The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more magnetic assisted agglom\u00ad eration (MAA) units to expedite agglomeration of the mag\u00ad particles, allowing the assay reactions to reach comple\u00ad tion (i.e., a stable reading) more quickly. The methods of the invention utilize functionalized magnetic particles to interact with analytes or multivalent binding agents (with multiple binding sites). Agglomeration of the magnetic particles alters the spin-spin relaxation rate of the sample when exposed to a magnetic field with a subsequent change in T2 relaxation time. [0436] For example, a field gradient can be used to sweep magnetic particles (MPs) through the liquid sample, allowing the magnetic particles to bind to either specific antibody (analyte-coated magnetic particles) or analyte (antibody- coated magnetic particles), and then concentrating the mag\u00ad netic particles in a portion of the reaction chamber so as to facilitate particle-particle interactions that lead to specific, ligand/analyte induced agglomeration. The magnetic par\u00ad ticles can optionally be allowed to diffuse in the absence of a magnetic field, sonicated, vortexed, shaken, or subjected to ultrasonic mixing to break apart non-specific magnetic par\u00ad ticle interactions and re-distribute the magnetic particles back into the liquid sample. The process can be repeated to pro\u00ad mote further specific agglomeration. This cycling of mag\u00ad netic particles between being dispersed in the liquid sample and then concentrated at the side or bottom of the reaction vessel can be repeated as many times as necessary to maxi\u00ad mize specific agglomeration, and consequently maximize the assay signal. The agglomeration state of the magnetic par\u00ad ticles can be determined using an NMR relaxation measure\u00ad ment. [0437] The MAA method of the invention can employ a gradient magnetic field in order to promote rapid magnetic particle-particle interactions. In one example, analyte coated magnetic particles are added to a solution with a multimeric - analyte specific ligand and placed in a gradient magnetic field. The magnetic field causes particles to concentrate on the side or bottom of a reaction vessel (highest magnetic field strength) resulting in enhanced particle-particle interaction and subsequent aggregation. Aggregation is measured by observing a change in, for example, T2 signal. Improvements of 10 to 1000 percent signal change (e.g., from 10 to 30%, from 20% to 50%, from 40% to 80%, from 50% to 200%, from 100% to 500%, or from 500% to 1000% signal change) can be observed. [0438] Traditional homogenous MAA takes advantage of dipole-dipole forces for assisting particle-particle interac\u00ad tions while particle dipoles are aligned with the magnetic field of the hMAA unit throughout the liquid sample. In contrast, gradient MAA rapidly concentrates magnetic par\u00ad ticles to a locus, thereby greatly facilitating particle-particle interactions. [0439] The cycling MAA approach described herein can accelerate the kinetics of magnetic particle-analyte clustering by (i) reducing the spatial entropy of the binding interaction step by maintaining local concentration of the magnetic par\u00ad ticles, (ii) introducing localized mixing by magnet mediated transportation of the pellet from position to position, (iii) reducing shearing of the specific-bound clusters by reducing the need for more energetic dispersion methods, such as vor- texing, and/or (iv) changing the magnetic field direction, and thereby causing a local dispersion and re-aggregation of mag\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 62Oct. 3, 2013 netically clustered particles as they re-align their dipoles with the new magnetic field direction, and allowing the locally dispersed magnetic particles to form specific binding inter\u00ad actions involving the target analyte. [0440] In one example, magnet assemblies producing a magnetic field gradient are placed in two positions relative to the assay tube, one to the side of the tube and one at the bottom of the tube (side-bottom configuration). Alternatively, the second magnet position can be located on a different side of the tube (side-side configuration). The tube then is moved to ensure exposure to one magnet followed by exposure to the other magnet (see FIG. 15). This has also been observed to produce a similar enhancement in clustering. [0441] An alternate methodology is to rotate the liquid sample within a gradient magnetic field (or to rotate the magnetic field gradient about the sample) to simultaneously effect a re-orientation of particles within the pellet (relative to the remainder of the liquid sample) and to sweep the pellet through the liquid sample. The rate of rotation can be slow to allow the pellet of magnetic particles to largely remain held in proximity to the gradient magnet (rather than moving in con\u00ad cert with the solvent and analytes in liquid sample). For example, the rotation is typically slower than 0.0333 Flz (e.g., from to 0.0333 Hz), such that the particles are retained adjacent to the magnetic field source, while the remaining contents in the tube are rotated. [0442] A single gradient magnet can be used, while the sample can be moved around the magnet (or use the same location close to the magnet and alternate with a position removed from the field of the single magnet. The magnet could be moved to the proximity or away from the sample. [0443] The sample can be placed between magnets of the same field orientation for a \"field averaging\" effect in alter\u00ad nating fashion, in order to simplify the fabrication of a gMAA system (Fe., eliminate the need to carefully select magnets that generate same field profiles). For example a plurality of such magnets could be placed in a circular setup, and samples rotated via a carousel setup, from the first magnet to a null (small magnetic field exposure) to the second magnet etc. The rotary gMAA device can include a fixed baseplate to which an electric motor is attached, with a number of magnets mounted around it in a circular pattern. The magnets are spaced such that there is minimal magnetic interference between posi\u00ad tions. A carousel capable of holding sample vials is attached to the motor shaft such that it rotates with the motor, exposing the samples to different magnetic field orientations from one position to the next. Any combination of side-oriented mag\u00ad nets, bottom-oriented magnets and positions with very low residual field (null) can be used. See FIG. 56A. [0444] In another example, a homogenous field is used to expedite the agglomeration of magnetic particles in an assay of the invention. We have observed that hMAA is not as effective as exposure to field gradients in terms of concen\u00ad trating particles and sweeping them through the sample, for timescales relevant to applications. However hMAA has advantages over the field gradient assisted agglomeration method. Using hMAA the magnetic particles are not enticed to move towards a specific location in the tube (see FIG. 16), minimizing non-specific trapping of particles within specific cluster fragments. Agitation after hMAA appears to minimize the non-specific binding. The hMAA treatment appears to enhance analyte induced clustering by increasing the colli\u00ad sion frequency (a possible result of decreasing the particle'sposition and rotational entropies due to localization in an ordered state). The magnetic particles can subsequently be sonicated, vortexed, shaken (Fe., energy additions) to break apart any non-specific particle interactions and re-distribute the particles back into the sample. Additional mixing or gentle agitation during this process would potentially further increase the analyte-specific binding events for enhancement of the overall assay signal. The agglomeration/clustering state of the magnetic particles can be determined by monitor\u00ad ing changes in an NMR relaxation rate. It is also possible to rotate the liquid sample within a homogenous magnetic field (or to rotate a homogenous magnetic field about the sample) to expedite the aggregation of magnetic particles in a liquid sample. [0445] We have observed that longer MAA times leads to increased changes in T2, presumably from an increased frac\u00ad tion of clustered particles. We have found that cycled mag\u00ad netic separation and resuspension leads to increased changes in T2 and increased clustering. All of these observations point towards a system that must be driven to a steady state or completion (e.g., maximally clustered). [0446] The systems of the invention can include one or more MAA units. For example, the MAA unit can be one or more magnets configured to apply a gradient magnetic field in a first direction relative to the liquid sample, and, after repo\u00ad sitioning the sample chamber, apply a gradient magnetic field in a second direction relative to the liquid sample (see FIG. 17). Alternatively, the MAA unit can be an array of magnets configured to apply a gradient magnetic field to, e.g., the side of a liquid sample, and, after repositioning the sample cham\u00ad ber, to, e.g., the bottom of the liquid sample (see FIGS. 18A-18C). The systems of the invention can include an MAA unit configured to apply a homogenous magnetic field to one or more liquid samples (see FIGS. 19A and 19B). [0447] Agitation Units [0448] The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more agitation units to break apart non-specific magnetic particle interactions and re-dis- tribute the magnetic particles back into the liquid sample, or to simply agitate the sample tube to completely mix the assay reagents. For example, the agitation units can include a soni- cation, vortexing, shaking, or ultrasound station for mixing one or more liquid samples. Mixing could be achieved by aspiration dispensing or other fluid motion (e.g., flow within a channel). Also, mixing could be provided by a vibrating pipette or a pipette that moves from side to side within the sample tube. [0449] The agitation unit can be vortexer or a compact vortexer each of which can be designed to provide a stable motion for the desired sample mixing. [0450] The vortexer includes the following components: (i) a sample support, (ii) a main plate, (iii) four linkages, (iv) linear rail and carriage system (x2), (v) a support for drive- shaft and rails, (vi) coupling and driveshaft, (vii) a mounting plate, and (viii) a drive motor (see FIG. 20). [0451] The compact vortexer includes the following com\u00ad ponents: (i) a sample support, (ii) a main plate, (iii) two linkages, (iv) linear rail and carriage system (xl), (v) a sup\u00ad port for linear rail, (vi) support for driveshaft, (vii) coupling and driveshaft, (viii) a mounting plate, and (ix) a drive motor (see FIG. 21). [0452] The basic principle of motion for a vortexer is as follows: the driveshaft including one axis coaxial to the motor shaft, and a second that is offset and parallel to the motor US 2013/0260367 A l 63Oct. 3, 2013 shaft. When the motor shaft is attached to the driveshaft (typically through a helical coupling) and rotated, the offset axis of the driveshaft is driven in an orbital path. The typical offset is 1 Zi\" to produce a vortex in a single 0.2 mL sample tube, but this can be easily modified to effectively mix differ\u00ad ent sample volumes in other tube geometries. [0453] Alternatively, the vortexer can be of the type utiliz\u00ad ing a planetary belt drive (see FIGS. 23A-23C). FIG. 23A is an overall view showing the vortexer configured for I large tube. FIG. 23B is a section view showing 2 tube holders for small tubes. FIG. 23C is an overall view of vortexer showing 4 tubes and a close-up of planetary belt drive mechanism. [0454] The drive motor is typically a servo or stepper with an encoder. These motors have an \"index\" mark that allows the motor to find a specific point in its rotation. These index marks are used to home the system, and ensure that the sample can be returned to a known position after mixing. Knowing the exact position of the sample in the vortex station allows theses vortexers to be easily accessed by robotic actuators and thus integrated into an automated system. In lieu of index marks, sensing devices external could be employed (see FIG. 22A). These could be mechanical, magnetic, optical or other sensor that is capable of resolving the sample's position at any point along the system's path or at a fixed \"home\" position. In order to access a vortexers or centrifuge via a robotic sample holder/positioned, the system can include using an index mark or external switch to \"home\" the system to a set position after running, using a sensor which tracks the sample motion at all times, so that wherever the system stops the robot knows the position, and using a \"find\" method that includes finding a sample after running that would employ a vision system that tracks the sample. The guide mechanism is depicted in FIG. 22B. The main plate is connected to the offset axis of the drive shaft and is free to rotate. The plate follows the orbital path around and dictated by the motor shaft. One end of a linkage is connected to the main plate, and is free to rotate. Therefore in this way, the connected linkage is then connected to the orbital rotation of the drive shaft. The other end of the linkage is connected to a carriage of the linear rail system and is free to rotate. Thus this end of the linkage follows the linear path of the rail. Having two linkages connected to both the carriage and main plate in this way prevents the main plate from rotating around its own center. In the vortexer, two linkages are used on two sides of the main plate (4 in total) to balance and stabilize the entire system. [0455] The two vortexers differ because of their use and design requirements. The compact version is designed to occupy less space, and requires less durability than this ver\u00ad sion because it is run at a lower speed, as limited by its smaller motor. For these reasons only two linkages are used to con\u00ad nect to a single linearrail system in the compact vortexer. This version needs to be capable of higher speeds, and a nearly continuous utilization due to the large throughput capability of this system. For these reasons a second carriage and set of linkages is added to balance the system, and increase its durability. [0456] Systems [0457] The systems for carrying out the methods of the invention can include one or more NMR units, MAA units, cartridge units, and agitation units. Such systems may further include other components for carrying out an automated assay of the invention, such as a PCR unit for the detection of oligonucleotides; a centrifuge, a robotic arm for delivery an liquid sample from unit to unit within the system; one or moreincubation units; a fluid transfer unit (Te., pipetting device) for combining assay reagents and a biological sample to form the liquid sample; a computer with a programmable processor for storing data, processing data, and for controlling the acti\u00ad vation and deactivation of the various units according to a one or more preset protocols; and a cartridge insertion system for delivering pre-filled cartridges to the system, optionally with instructions to the computer identifying the reagents and pro\u00ad tocol to be used in conjunction with the cartridge. See FIG. 42. [0458] The systems of the invention can provide an effec\u00ad tive means for high throughput and real-time detection of analytes present in a bodily fluid from a subj ect. The detection methods may be used in a wide variety of circumstances including, without limitation, identification and/or quantifi\u00ad cation of analytes that are associated with specific biological processes, physiological conditions, disorders or stages of disorders. As such, the systems have a broad spectrum of utility in, for example, drug screening, disease diagnosis, phylogenetic classification, parental and forensic identifica\u00ad tion, disease onset and recurrence, individual response to treatment versus population bases, and monitoring of therapy. The subject devices and systems are also particularly useful for advancing preclinical and clinical stage of development of therapeutics, improving patient compliance, monitoring ADRs associated with a prescribed drug, developing indi\u00ad vidualized medicine, outsourcing blood testing from the cen\u00ad tral laboratory to the home or on a prescription basis, and monitoring therapeutic agents following regulatory approval. The devices and systems can provide a flexible system for personalized medicine. The system of the invention can be changed or interchanged along with a protocol or instructions to a programmable processor of the system to perform a wide variety of assays as described herein. The systems of the invention offer many advantages of a laboratory setting con\u00ad tained in a desk-top or smaller size automated instrument. [0459] The systems of the invention can be used to simul\u00ad taneously assay analytes that are present in the same liquid sample over a wide concentration range, and can be used to monitor the rate of change of an analyte concentration and/or or concentration of PD or PK markers over a period of time in a single subject, or used for performing trend analysis on the concentration, or markers of PD, or PK, whether they are concentrations of drugs or their metabolites. For example, if glucose were the analyte of interest, the concentration of glucose in a sample at a given time as well as the rate of change of the glucose concentration over a given period of time could be highly useful in predicting and avoiding, for example, hypoglycemic events. Thus, the data generated with the use of the subject fluidic devices and systems can be utilized for performing a trend analysis on the concentration of an analyte in a subject. [0460] For example, a patient may be provided with a plu\u00ad rality of cartridge units to be used for detecting a variety of analytes at predetermined times. A subject may, for example, use different cartridge units on different days of the week. In some embodiments the software on the system is designed to recognize an identifier on the cartridge instructing the system computer to run a particular protocol for running the assay and/or processing the data. The protocols on the system can be updated through an external interface, such as an USB drive or an Ethernet connection, or in some embodiments the entire protocol can be recorded in the barcode attached to the cartridge. The protocol can be optimized as needed by US 2013/0260367 A l 64Oct. 3, 2013 prompting the user for various inputs (i.e., for changing the dilution of the sample, the amount of reagent provided to the liquid sample, altering an incubation time or MAA time, or altering the NMR relaxation collection parameters). [0461] A multiplexed assay can be performed using a vari\u00ad ety of system designs. For example, a multiplexed assay can performed using any of the following configurations: (i) a spatially-based detection array can be used to direct magnetic particles to a particular region of a tube (i.e., without aggre\u00ad gation) and immobilize the particles in different locations according to the particular analyte being detected. The immo\u00ad bilized particles are detected by monitoring their local effect on the relaxation effect at the site of immobilization. The particles can be spatially separated by gravimetric separation in flow (i.e., larger particles settling faster along with a slow flow perpendicular to gravity to provide spatial separation based on particle size with different magnetic particle size populations being labeled with different targets). Alterna\u00ad tively, of capture probes can be used to locate magnetic par\u00ad ticles in a particular region of a tube (i.e., without aggrega\u00ad tion) and immobilize the particles in different locations (i.e., on a functionalized surface, foam, or gel). Optionally, the array is flow through system with multiple coils and magnets, each coil being a separate detector that has the appropriate particles immobilized within it, and the presence of the ana\u00ad lyte detected with signal changes arising from clustering in the presence of the analyte. Optionally, once the particles are spatially separated, each individual analyte in the multiplexed assay can be detected by sliding a coil across the sample to read out the now spatially separated particles, (ii) A microf\u00ad luidic tube where the sample is physically split amongst many branches and a separate signal is detected in each branch, each branch configured for detection of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay, (iii) An array of 96 wells (or less or more) where each well has its own coil and magnet, and each well is configured for detection of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay, (iv) A sipper or flow through device with multiple independently addressable coils inside one magnet or inside multiple mini magnets that can be used for sequen\u00ad tial readings, each reading being a separate reaction for detec\u00ad tion of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay, (v) A sipper or flow through device with multiple independently addressable wells on a plate inside one magnet or inside multiple mini magnets that can be used for sequential read\u00ad ings using a single sided coil that can be traversed along the plate, each reading being a separate reaction for detection of a separate analyte in the multiplexed assay, (vi) A tube con\u00ad taining two compartments read simultaneously, resulting in one relaxation curve which is then fit using bi-exponential fitting to produce the separate readings for the multiplexed array, (vii) A microfluidics system where each droplet of liquid is moved around individually, to produce readings for the multiplexed array, (viii) Sequential measurements using magnetic separation and resuspension requires novel binding probes or the ability to turn them on and off. This method would be used for nucleic acid analytes in which turn on/off mechanism is based mostly on melting temperature (at higher temperatutres hairpin loops relax, denaturation of double strand binding), and hybridization will occur at different tem\u00ad peratures. (ix) Individual capillaries, each equipped with dried particles within them, allow for small volume rapid multiplexing of one small aliquot. The dried particles are spatially separated, and this spatial separation permits the MR Reader to read each capillary tube independently, (x) Bindingmoieties conjugated to nanoparticles are placed in a gel or other viscous material forming a region and analyte specific viscous solution. The gel or viscous solution enhances spatial separation of more than one analyte in the starting sample because after the sample is allowed to interact with the gel, the target analyte can readily diffuse through the gel and specifi\u00ad cally bind to a conjugated moiety on the gel viscous solu\u00ad tion held The clustering or aggregation of the specific analyte, optionally enhanced via one of the described magnetic assisted agglomeration methods, and detection of analyte specific clusters can be performed by using a specific location NMR reader. In this way a spatial array of nanopar\u00ad ticles, and can be designed, for example, as a 2d array, (xi) Magnetic particles can be spotted and dried into multiple locations in a tube and then each location measured sepa\u00ad rately. For example, one type of particle can be bound to a surface and a second particle suspended in solution, both of which hybridize to the analyte to be detected. Clusters can be formed at the surface where hybridization reactions occur, each surface being separately detectable, (xii) A spotted array of nucleic acids can be created within a sample tube, each configured to hybridize to a first portion of an array of taiget nucleic acids. Magnetic particles can be designed with probes to hybridize to a second portion of the target nucleic acid. Each location can be measured separately. Alternatively, any generic beacon or detection method could be used to produce output from the nucleic acid array, (xiii) An array of magnetic particles for detecting an array of targets can be included in a single sample, each configured (e.g., by size, or relaxation properties) to provide a distinct NMR relaxation signature with aggregate formation. For example, each of the particles can be selected to produce distinct T2 relaxation times (e.g., one set of particles covers 10-200 ms, a second set from 250-500 a third set from 550-1100, and so on). Each can be measured as a separate band of relaxation rates, (xiv) For detection of analytes of various size or magnetic particles, or aggregates of various size, a single sample with multiple analytes and magnetic particles can undergo separation in the presence of a magnetic or electric field (i.e., electrophoretic separation of magnetic particles coated with analytes), the separate magnetic particles and/or aggregates reaching the site of a detector at different times, accordingly, (xv) The detection tube could be separated into two (or more) cham\u00ad bers that each contain a different nanoparticle for detection. The tube could be read using the reader and through fitting a multiple exponential curve such as A*exp(T2 _1)+B*exp (T2_2), the response of each analyte could be determined by looking at the relative size of the constants A and B and T2 _I and T2 _2. (xvi) Gradient magnetic fields can be shimmed to form narrow fields. Shim pulses or other RF based Shimming within a specific field can be performed to pulse and receive signals within a specific region. In this way one could envi\u00ad sion a stratification of the Rf pulse within a shim and specific resonance signals could be received from the specific shim. While this method relies on shimming the gradient magnetic field, multiplexing would include then, to rely on one of the other methods described to get different nanoparticles and the clusters to reside in these different shims. Thus there would be two dimensions, one provided by magnetic field shims and a second dimension provided by varying nanoparticle binding to more than one analyte. Nanoparticles having two distinct NMR relaxation signals upon clustering with an analyte may be employed in a multiplexed assay. In this methods, the observation that small particles (30-200 nm) cause a decrease US 2013/0260367 A l 65Oct. 3, 2013 in T2 with clustering whereas large particles (>800 nm) cause an increase with clustering. The reaction assay is designed as a competitive reaction, so that with the addition of the target it changes the equilibrium relaxation signal. For example, if the T2 relaxation time is shorter, clusters forming of analyte with small particles are forming. If on the other hand, the T2 relaxation becomes longer, clusters of analyte with larger particles are forming. It's probably useful to change the den\u00ad sity/viscosity of the solution with additives such as trehalose or glucose or glycerol to make sure the big particles stay in solution. One nanoparticle having binding moieties to a spe\u00ad cific analyte for whose T2 signal is decreased on clustering may be combined with a second nanoparticle having a second binding moiety to a second analyte for whose T2 signal is increased on clustering. In the case for which the sample is suspected to have both analytes and the clustering reaction may cancel each other out (the increased clustering cancels the decreased clustering), one could envision an ordering of the analysis, i.e. addition of competitive binding agents to detect a competitive binding and thus T2 signal that would be related to the presence/absence of the analyte of interest in the sample. Alternatively, if the increased clustering cancels the decreased clustering in this multiplexing format, one could envision use of different relaxation pulse sequences or relax\u00ad ation determinants to identify the in the sample, (xvii) Precipitation mea\u00ad surement of particles. In this method, multiple types of particles designed to capture different target sequences of nucleic acid are designed So that the particle size is small enough that the particles bound with analyte remain sus\u00ad pended in solution. Sequential addition of an \"initiator\" sequence that is complementary to a nucleic acid sequence conjugated to a second set of particles (a larger particle, not necessarily having magnetic properties) and contains a complementary sequence to the captured target DNA sequence. After hybridization, clusters will form if the target DNA sequence is present, e.g. the magnetic nanoparticle conjugated with probe anneals to one specific sequence on the target analyte and the other particle binds to another sequence on the target nucleic acid sequence. These clusters will be big enough to precipitate (this step may require a centrifugation step). In the same reaction, and simulataneously, one could design an additional magnetic particle, second particle set to anneal with a second nucleic acid sequence for which forma\u00ad tion of the magnetic nanoparticle-analyte-second particle clusters do not precipitate. In this way sequential addition of particles can result in differential signaling, (xvii) One pos\u00ad sible different detection technique includes phase separated signals, which would stem from differing RF coil pulse sequences that are optimized for the conjugated nanoparticle- analyte interaction. Optimally, this could be achieved with multiple coils in an array that would optimize the ability of the different RF pulses and relaxation signal detection to be mapped and differentiated to ascertain the presence/absence of more than one analyte. Multiplexing may also employ the unique characteristic of the nanoparticle-analyte clustering reaction and subsequent detection of water solvent in the sample, the ability of the clusters to form various \"pockets\" and these coordinated clusters to have varying porosity. For example, linkers having varying length or conformational structures can be employed to conjugate the binding moiety to the magnetic nanoparticle. In this way, more than one type of cluster formed in the presence of an analyte could be designed having the ability of differing solvent water flow, and thusrelaxation signal differences, through the aggregated nano- particle-analyte-nanoparticle formation. In this way, two or more linker/binding moiety designs would then allow for detection of more than one analyte in the same sample, (xviii) The methods of the invention can include a fluorinated oil/ aqueous mixture for capturing particles in an emulsion. Inthis design one hydrophobic capture particle set and an aqueous capture set are used, the hydrophic capture particle set is designed to bind and aggregate more readily in an hydropho\u00ad bic environment, whereas the aqueous capture particle set is designed to bind and aggregate in an aqueous environment. Introduction of an analyte containing sample having specific analytes that will bind to either the hydrophic or aqueous particle, and subsequent mixing in the detection tube having both hydrophobic and aqueous solvents, binding and cluster\u00ad ing would then result in a physical separation of analytes to either the aqueous or hydrophobic phase. The relaxation sig\u00ad nal could be detected in either solution phase. In the event that the analytes and nanoparticles designed in this manner are physically found in an emulsion created by the mixing of the hydrophic/aqueous phases, relaxation curves would be dis\u00ad tinguishable in the emulsion phase. The detection tube may have a capsular design to enhance the ability to move the capsules through an MR detector to read out the signal. Fur\u00ad ther, additional use of a fluorescent tag to read out probe identity may be employed, i.e. in the case of two different analytes in the same aqueous or hydrophic phase, the addition of a fluorescent tag can assist determination of the identify of the analyte. This method is amenable in samples for which limited isolation or purification of the taiget analyte away from the other material in the sample because the described resonance signals are independent of sample quality. Further, the addition of the fluorescent tag can be added in much higher concentrations that usually added in typical fluores\u00ad cent studies because these tags will never interfere with the relaxation measurements. In this method, oligonucleotide capture probes that are conjugated to the magnetic nanopar\u00ad ticles are designed so that specific restriction endonuclease sites are located within the annealed section. After hybridiza\u00ad tion with the sample forming nanoparticle-analyte clusters, a relaxation measurement then provides a base signal. Intro\u00ad duction of a specific restriction endonuclease to the detection tube and incubation will result in a specific reduction of the nanoparticle/analyte cluster after restriction digestion has occurred. After a subsequent relaxation measurement, the pattern of signal and restriction enzyme digestion, one can deduce the target, (xix) In a combined method, a magnetic nanoparticle is conjugated with two separate and distinct binding moieties, i.e. an oligonucleotide and an antibody. This nanoparticle when incubated with a sample having both types of analytes in the sample will form nanoparticle-analyte complexes, and a baseline T2 relaxation signal will be detect\u00ad able. Subsequent addition of a known concentration of one of the analytes can be added to reduce the clustering formed by that specific analyte from the sample. After known analyte addition a subsequent T2 relaxation signal is detected and the presence/absence of the sample analyte can be surmised. Further, a second analyte can be added to compete with the analyte in the sample to form clusters. Again, after a subse\u00ad quent T2 relaxation signal detection the presence/absence of the second sample analyte can be surmised. This can be repeated. [0462] Broadly a multiplexed assay employing the meth\u00ad ods of this invention can be designed so that the use of one US 2013/0260367 A l 66Oct. 3, 2013 non-superparamagnetic nanoparticle to generate clusters with analyte from a sample, will reduce the overall Fe2+ in assay detection vessel and will extend the dynamic range so that multiple reactions can be measured in the same detection vessel. [0463] Multiplexing nucleic acid detection can make use of differing hybridization qualities of the conjugated magnetic nanoparticle and the target nucleic acid analyte. For example, capture probes conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles can be designed so that annealing the magnetic nanoparticle to the target nucleic acid sequence is different for more than one nucleic acid target sequence. Factors for the design of these different probe-target sequences include G-C content (time to form hybrids), varying salt concentration, hybridization tem\u00ad peratures, and/or combinations of these factors. This method then would entail allowing various nucleic acid conjugated magnetic nanoparticles to interact with a sample suspected of having more than one target nucleic acid analyte. Relaxation times detected after various treatments, i.e. heating, addition of salt, hybridization timing, would allow for the ability to surmise which suspected nucleic acid sequence is present or absent in the sample. [0464] Use complimentary amplicons to block one reaction and allow serial hybridizations. In this method, universal amplification primers are used to amplify more than one specific nucleic acid sequence in the staigin sample, forming an amplicon pool. Specific oligonucleotide conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles are added to the sample and a relax\u00ad ation measurement is taken. The sample is then exposed to a temperature to melt the oligonucleotide-analyte interaction and addition of a oligonucleotide that is not attached to a magnetic nanoparticle is added to compete away any analyte binding to the magnetic nanoparticle. A second magnetic nanoparticle having a second oligonucleotide conjugated to it is then added to form clusters with a second specific target nucleic acid analyte. Alternatively, the method could have a step prior to the addition of the second magnetic nanoparticle that would effectively sequester the first magnetic nanopar\u00ad ticle from the reaction vessel, i.e. exposing the reaction vessel to a magnetic field to move the particles to an area that would not be available to the second, or subsequent reaction. [0465] Each of the multiplexing methods above can employ a step of freezing the sample to slow diffusion and clustering time and thus alter the measurement of the relaxation time. Slowing the diffusion and clustering of the method may enhance the ability to separate and detect more than one relaxation time Each of the multiplexing methods above can make use of sequential addition of conjugated nanoparticles followed by relaxation detection after each addition. After each sequential addition, the subsequent relaxation baseline becomes the new baseline from the last addition and can be used to assist in correlating the relaxation time with presence/ absence of the analyte or analyte concentration in the sample. [0466] Flidden capture probes. In this method of multiplex\u00ad ing, oligonucleotides conjugated to the magnetic nanopar\u00ad ticles are designed so that secondary structure or a comple\u00ad mentary probe on the surface of the particle hides or covers the sequence for hybridization initially in the reaction vessel. These hidden hybridization sequences are then exposed or revealed in the sample vessel spatially or temporally during the assay. For example, as mentioned above, hybridization can be affected by salt, temperature and time to hybridize. Thus, in one form of this method, secondary or complemen\u00ad tary structures on the oligonucleotide probe conjugated to themagnetic nanoparticle can be reduced or relaxed to then expose or reveal the sequence to hybridize to the target nucleic acid sample. Further, secondary structures could be reduced or relaxed using a chemical compound, e.g. DMSO. Another method to selectively reveal or expose a sequence for hybridization of the oligonucleotide conjugated nanoparticle with the target analyte is to design stem-loop structures hav\u00ad ing a site for a restriction endonuclease; subsequent digestion with a restriction endonuclease would relax the stem-loop structure and allow for hybridization to occur. Alternatively, a chemical cut of the stem-loop structure, releasing one end could make the sequence free to then hybridize to the target nucleic acid sequence. [0467] Where the multiplexed array is configured to detect a target nucleic acid, the assay can include a multiplexed PCR to generate different amplicons and then serially detect the different reactions. [0468] The multiplexed assay optionally includes a logical array in which the targets are set up by binary search to reduce the number of assays required (e.g., gram positive or negative leads to different species based tests that only would be con\u00ad ducted for one group or the other). [0469] The systems of the invention can run a variety of assays, regardless of the analyte being detected from a bodily fluid sample. A protocol dependent on the identity of the cartridge unit being used can be stored on the system com\u00ad puter. In some embodiments, the cartridge unit has an iden\u00ad tifier (ID) that is detected or read by the system computer, or a bar code (ID or 2D) on a card that then supplies assay specific orpatient or subject specific information needed to be tracked or accessed with the analysis information (e.g., cali\u00ad bration curves, protocols, previous analyte concentrations or levels). Where desired, the cartridge unit identifier is used to select a protocol stored on the system computer, or to identify the location of various assay reagents in the cartridge unit. The protocol to be run on the system may include instructions to the controller of the system to perform the protocol, includ\u00ad ing but not limited to a particular assay to be run and a detection method to be performed. Once the assay is per\u00ad formed by the system, data indicative of an analyte in the biological sample is generated and communicated to a com\u00ad munications assembly, where it can either be transmitted to the external device for processing, including without limita\u00ad tion, calculation of the analyte concentration in the sample, or processed by the system computer and the result presented on a display readout. [0470] For example, the identifier may be a bar code iden\u00ad tifier with a series of black and white lines, which can be read by a bar code reader (or another type of detector) upon inser\u00ad tion of the cartridge unit. Other identifiers could be used, such as a series of alphanumerical values, colors, raised bumps, RFID, or any other identifier which can be located on a cartridge unit and be detected or read by the system computer. The detector may also be an LED that emits light which can interact with an identifier which reflects light and is measured by the system computer to determine the identify of a particu\u00ad lar cartridge unit. In some embodiments, the system includes a storage or memory device with the cartridge unit or the detector for transmitting information to the system computer. [0471] Thus, the systems of the invention can include an operating program to carry out different assays, and car\u00ad tridges encoded to: (i) report to the operating program which pre-programmed assay was being employed; (ii) report to the operating program the configuration of the cartridges; (iii) US 2013/0260367 A l 67Oct. 3, 2013 inform the operating system the order of steps for carrying out the assay; (iv) inform the system which pre-programmed routine to employ; (v) prompt input from the user with respect to certain assay variables; (vi) record a patient identification number (the patient identification number can also be included on the Vacutainer holding the blood sample); (vii) record certain cartridge information (i.e., lot #, calibration data, assays on the cartridge, analytic data range, expiration date, storage requirements, acceptable sample specifics); or (viii) report to the operating program assay upgrades or revi\u00ad sions (i.e., so that newer versions of the assay would occur on cartridge upgrades only and not to the larger, more costly system). [0472] The systems of the invention can include one or more fluid transfer units configured to adhere to a robotic arm (see FIGS. 43A-43C). The fluid transfer unit can be a pipette, such as an air-displacement, liquid backed, or syringe pipette. For example, a fluid transfer unit can further include a motor in communication with a programmable processor of the system computer and the motor can move the plurality of heads based on a protocol from the programmable processor. Thus, the programmable processor of a system can include instructions or commands and can operate a fluid transfer unit according to the instructions to transfer liquid samples by either withdrawing (for drawing liquid in) or extending (for expelling liquid) a piston into a closed air space. Both the volume of air moved and the speed of movement can be precisely controlled, for example, by the programmable pro\u00ad cessor. Mixing of samples (or reagents) with diluents (or other reagents) can be achieved by aspirating components to be mixed into a common tube and then repeatedly aspirating a significant fraction of the combined liquid volume up and down into a tip. Dissolution of reagents dried into a tube can be done is similar fashion. [0473] A system can include one or more incubation units for heating the liquid sample and/or for control of the assay temperature. Fleat can be used in the incubation step of an assay reaction to promote the reaction and shorten the dura\u00ad tion necessary for the incubation step. A system can include a heating block configured to receive a liquid sample for a predetermined time at a predetermined temperature. The heating block can be configured to receive a plurality of samples. [0474] The system temperature can be carefully regulated. For example, the system includes a casing kept at a predeter\u00ad mined temperature (i.e., 37\u00b0 C.) using stirred temperature controlled air. Waste heat from each of the units will exceed what can be passively dissipated by simple enclosure by conduction and convection to air. To eliminate waste heat, the system can include two compartments separated by an insu\u00ad lated floor. The upper compartment includes those portions of the components needed for the manipulation and measure\u00ad ment of the liquid samples, while the lower compartment includes the heat generating elements of the individual units (e.g., the motor for the centrifuge, the motors for the agitation units, the electronics for each of the separate units, and the heating blocks for the incubation units). The lower floor is then vented and forced air cooling is used to carry heat away from the system. See FIGS. 44A and 44B. [0475] The MR unit may require more closely controlled temperature (e.g., \u00b10.1\u00b0 C.), and so may optionally include a separate casing into which air heated at a predetermined temperature is blown. The casing can include an opening through which the liquid sample is inserted and removed, andout of which the heated air is allowed to escape. See FIGS. 45A and 45B. Othertemperature control approaches may also be utilized. [0476] The following examples are put forth so as to pro\u00ad vide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclo\u00ad sure and description of how the devices, systems, and meth\u00ad ods described herein are performed, made, and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Example I Preparation of Coated Particles [0477] Briefly, I mg of substantially monodisperse car- boxylated magnetic particles were washed and resuspended in 100 pi of activation buffer, 10 mM MES. 30 pi of 10 mg/ml 10 kDa amino-dextran (Invitrogen) was added to activation buffer and incubated on a rotator for 5 minutes at room temp. For coupling of the carboxyl groups to amines on the dextran, 30 pi of 10 mg/ml I diimide Flydrochloride (EDC) was added and incubated on rotator for 2 hours at room temperature. Particles were washed away from free dextran 3x in I ml of PBS using magnetic separation, then resuspended in I ml ofPBS. 100 pi of a 100 mM solution of Sulfo-NFIS-biotin (Invitrogen) was used to decorate the amino groups on the dextran surface with biotin. After 30 minutes of incubation, particles were washed 3 x in I ml activation buffer. Next, a protein block of 100 pi of 0.5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) and 30 pi of 10 mg/ml EDC was introduced and incubated overnight (Sigma). Prepared particles were washed 3x in I ml PBS and resuspended to the desired concentration. [0478] Prepared particles synthesized with this protocol have been shown to give similar results in T2 assays for detection of analyte, whether samples include buffer or 20% lysed blood (see FIG. 37). Variations of the preparations wherein pre-biotinylated amino dextran was conjugated directly to particles in one step have also resulted in similar performance in T2 assays in both blood and buffer samples. Example 2 Assessment of Particles Prepared with and without a Protein Block [0479] Briefly, biotin decorated amino-dextran magnetic particles prepared according to the method described in Example I were assayed in PBS and in 20% lysed blood anti-biotin titration T2 assay was performed with the following proce\u00ad dure. 50 pL of matrix, either PBS or 20% Lysed blood sample, 50 pL of varying concentrations of Anti-biotin antibody, and 50 pL of 1.0 pg/ml secondary antibody were added to a 5 mm NMR Tube. 150 pL of 0.02 mM Fe particles were then added to each tube (i.e., 2.7xl08 particles per tube). The samples were then vortexed for 4 seconds and incubated in a 37\u00b0 C. heat block for 2 minutes. Each sample was then revortexed for 4 seconds, and incubated for an additional minute in the 37\u00b0 C. heat block. Following incubation, each sample was placed into a Bruker Minispec for 10 minutes, under a magnetic field. After 10 minutes, the sample was removed from the magnet, vortexed for 4 seconds, and incubated in 37\u00b0 C. heat block for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, each sample was revortexed and US 2013/0260367 A l 68Oct. 3, 2013 incubated in a 37\u00b0 C. heat block for an additional I minute. T2 values were taken using the Bruker Minispec program with values were calculated: T2-(T 2)0, and results are depicted in FIG. 37. [0488] Particles synthesized with a protein block, AXN4, gave nearly equal performance in blood and buffer (FIG. 37). The graph depicted in FIG. 38 compares particles prepared with (open circle) and without (filled circle) a protein block\u00ad ing step. We have thus found the protein block may be needed to achieve similar functionality in blood matrices. [0489] Additional protein blocks including but not limited to fish skin gelatin have also been successful. Particles were prepared according to the method described above, with the exception that in lieu of using BSA as the protein block, fish skin gelatin (FSG) was substituted. The graph depicted in FIG. 39 shows results of a T2 assay (as described above) using antibody titration for particles blocked with BSA and com\u00ad pared to FSG. The data indicates that there is little or no difference between the two protein blocking methods (see FIG. 39). Flowever, BSA has proven to be a more reliable block. Example 3 Determination of Amount of Dextran Coating [0490] Attempts to increase dextran coating density on par\u00ad ticles have been found to reduce functionality of prepared particles in blood. The preparation of particles described in Example I above that demonstrated nearly equivalent buffer/ blood performance used a IOx excess of dextran base upon a space filling model to determine amount of dextran to include in coating experiments. In an attempt to functionalize par\u00ad ticles with a higher fidelity, increasing the dextran coating to a 1000-10000x excess of dextran in coating experiments gen\u00ad erated particles having a thicker dextran coating which yielded a reduced response in blood as compared to buffer. We conclude that a moderate density of dextran with a protein block may be desirable to produce a particle coating that functions well in T2 assays in the presence of blood sample (see FIGS. 40A and 40B). Example 4 Detection of a Small Molecule Analyte in Whole Blood Samples [0491] Materials and Methods: [0492] Immuno [0506] 37\u00b0 C. by weight was prepared. Briefly, Tween\u00ae in IxPBS was prepared. 500 mL of 0.2% Tween solution was prepared by adding 10 mL of 10% Tween\u00ae to 490 mL of lxPBS. A 2% solution of BSA was prepared in lxPBS solution by weight. A 0.2% solution of BSA solution was prepared by adding 50 mL of 2% BSA in PBS to 450 mL of lxPBS. Dilutions were combined to make a final volume of I L and a final buffer concentration of 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Tween\u00ae in lxPBS. a 0.5 mM solu\u00ad tion was prepared from I mM Tris HC1. 40 pi of PEG FITC biotin was mixed with 40 pi of 0.5 mM Tris HC1, and incu\u00ad bated for 15 minutes at room temperature. After 15 minutes, 70 pi of PEG-FITC-Biotin in 0.5 mM Tris HCl was added to 630 pi of 0.1% Tween\u00ae to make a 100 pM stock solution. Stock solution was vigorously mixed by vortexing. 200 pi of 100 pM solution was added to 900 pi of 0.1% Tween\u00ae to make 20,000 nM analyte. 10 fold prepared down to 0.02 nM [0509] Procedure: [0510] 25 pi of appropriate analyte and 50 pi of 1:5 Lysed blood matrix were pipetted directly into a 5 mm NMR tube. Samples were vortexed for 4 seconds. 25 pi of primary Anti\u00ad biotin antibody (0.18 pg/ml diluted in 0.1% Tween lxPBS) was added, followed by a 37\u00b0 C. incubation for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, 50 pi of 3.0 pg/ml Secondary Anti-Mouse antibody (diluted in 0.1% Tween, 0.1% BSA, lxPBS) and 150 pi of0.02mMFeparticles (2.7x108particles per tube) were added to the NMR Tube. The sample was then vortexed for 4 seconds and incubated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. The sample was placed in a Bruker Minispec for 10 minutes, under magnetic field. After 10 minutes, the sample was removed from the magnet and incubated for an additional 5 minutes. The sample was again vortexed for 4 seconds and incubated for an additional I minute. T2 values were taken using the Bruker Minispec program with Echos: 2 US 2013/0260367 A l 69Oct. 3, 2013 Example 5 Synthesis of Antibody Decorated Particles [0517] Amino dextran coated magnetic particles prepared as described in Example I can be further functionalized with antibodies via an SMCC-SATA linkage (SMCC=succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane- SATA=N-succinimidyl-5-acetylthioacetate). conjugated to 10 kDa amino dextran via EDC chemistry as described above. The dextran coated particles are further modified with an excess of sulfo-SMCC to provide a maleimide functional group. Antibodies are modified with a SATA linker, which primarily binds to the amines on the antibody. The SATA linkage is controlled to minimize over-functionalization of the antibody which may lead to cross-linking of the particles or reduced affinity of the antibody. After deacetylation, the SATA linker exposes a thiol functional group which can be used to directly attach to the malemide functionalized par\u00ad ticles forming a thioether bond. The number of antibodies conjugated to each particle can be measured using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Linkers that provide similar function\u00ad ality to SATA been used successfully, such as SPDP (N-Succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]-propionate). [0518] Antibody coated magnetic particles can also be pre\u00ad pared using the chemistries described above, but with direct covalent linkage to the base carboxylated particle. In some instances it may necessary to add additional coating to the particle surface, such as dextran, or a blocking agent. Similar chemistries can be used with alternate coatings to the amino dextran, such as PEG or BSA. Example 6 Creatinine Assay [0519] Briefly, the assay includes the following: a target sample is incubated in the presence of a magnetic particle that has been decorated with creatinine, which is linked to the surface of the magnetic particles. The creatinine decorated magnetic particles are designed to aggregate in the presence of the creatinine antibody. Each of the creatinine decorated magnetic particles and creatinine antibody is added to the liquid sample containing creatinine, which competes with the magnetic particles for the creatinine antibody. Thus, the bind\u00ad ing of the creatinine to the antibody blocks agglomeration of the magnetic particles, and low levels of creatinine are marked by the formation of agglomerates. These agglomer\u00ad ates alter the spin-spin relaxation rates of sample when exposed to a magnetic field and the change in the T2 relax\u00ad ation times (measuring a change in the magnetic resonance signal from the surrounding water molecules) can be directly correlated to presence and/or concentration of the analyte in the target sample. [0520] CreatinineAntibody [0521] In establishing an antibody generation program for creatinine, a modified creatinine molecule was devised (COOH-creatinine) and conjugated transferrin AJ mice.HO / COOH-creatmme [0522] Thirty four stable antibody producing clones were generated. These clones arose from either BALB-C (spleen cells) (n=l 7) or AJ mice (n=l 7). The two genetically different mouse lines were selected for the known genetic differences in their immune systems. Criteria and a selection process were developed for screening and identification of an optimal monoclonal antibody for use in the assay. The antibody selec\u00ad tion process included screening for binding to BSA-creati- nine by ELISA, antibody affinity/sensitivity/specificity by ELISA competitive assays using free creatinine and potential interferents, determination of the ability of the antibody to be conjugated to the magnetic particle and functionality in a T2 magnetic relaxation switch assay. [0523] Using the established antibody selection criteria outlined above, seven monoclonal antibodies were identified and selected as potential candidates in the assay. [0524] Creatinine-Coated Magnetic Particles [0525] Substantially monodisperse carboxylated magnetic particles were washed and resuspended in 100 pi of coupling buffer (50 mM MES, pH=4.75). Sulfo-NHS (55 pmol in 200 pi MES buffer) was added and the mixture vortexed. To the mixture was added EDC (33.5 pmol in 200 pi MES buffer). The solution was briefly vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for I hour at room temperature, allowed to settle, and the supernatant removed. To the resulting solids was added I mL of 1% BSA in PBS, and again the mixture was vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 15-18 hours at room temperature. The particles were allowed to settle and the supernatant removed. [0526] The BSA-coated particles were suspended in 0.5 mL PBS-0.01% T20 (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH=7.4, 150 mM NaCl, with 0.01% Tween\u00ae 20). Umeacted carboxyl were Methyl-PEG4-amine (20 pi of 10% v/v in DMSO) as a blocking agent. The mixture was vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 8 hours at room temperature. The resulting BSA-coated particles were repeat\u00ad edly washed pmol) were combined with 300 pi of dry DMSO to form a slurry, which cleared as the reaction reached comple\u00ad tion. BSA-coated particles were suspended in 0.5 mL PBS- 0.01% T20 (pH=8), followed by the addition of the activated COOH-creatinine solution. The resulting mixture was vor\u00ad texed and placed on an end over end mixer for 4 hours at room temperature. The resulting particles were washed 3x each with sonicationusing 1:15 and 1:30 DMSO:PBS-0.01% T20 (vol/vol). particles 3x each cation using 2K US A l 70Oct. 3, 2013 in 200 PBS-0.01% T20 was added. The mixture was placed on an end over end mixer for 12-20 hours at room tempera\u00ad ture. The particles were then washed 3x each with sonication using PBS-0.01% T20 to produce creatinine-conjugated magnetic particles with sequential BSA, creatinine coating, PEG cap and block. [0528] The creatinine coated particles were resuspended in assay conjugated particles and soluble creatinine anti\u00ad body with detection using the T2 signal was generated/com\u00ad pleted. The creatinine competitive assay architecture is depicted in FIG. 24. [0530] Solutions of magnetic particles, antibody, and liquid sample were, where indicated, subject to dilution with an assay buffer that included 100 mM diluted to 0.4 mM Fe (5.48xl09 particles/ml) in assay buffer, vortexed thoroughly, and allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours at 4-8\u00b0 C. [0532] The anti-creatinine mouse monoclonal antibody (described above) was employed as a multivalent binding agent for the creatinine-conjugated magnetic particles. The antibody was diluted to a concentration of 0.8 pg/ml in assay buffer and vortexed thoroughly. [0533] Samples and calibrators were diluted I part sample to 3 parts assay buffer. The upper assay range is ca. 4 mg/dL creatinine. For samples with expected creatinine levels >4 mg/dL an additional sample dilution was performed using I part initial diluted sample to 4 parts assay buffer. [0534] The pre-diluted sample, assay buffer, magnetic par\u00ad ticle, and antibody solutions were each vortexed. 10 pL of each solution added to a tube, and the tube was vortexed for 5 seconds. [0535] The tube was then subjected to 12 minutes of gMAA, incubated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., placed in the MR Reader (T2 MR, Reader with 2200 Fluke Temperature Con\u00ad troller, with NDxlient software 0.9.14.1/hardware Version 0.4.13 Build 2, FirmwareVersion 0.4.13 Build 0) to measure the T2 relaxation rate of the sample, and the T2 relaxation rate of the sample was compared to a standard curve (see FIG. 25 A) to determine the concentration of creatinine in the liquid sample. [0536] Performance of Modified Creatinine Antibodies [0537] Different creatinine antibodies were tested in the assay to ascertain the effect of the antibody on agglomeration. We observed that the performance of the creatinine antibodies varied in their performance characteristics when combined with creatinine-coated magnetic particles (see FIG. 25B). SDS-PAGE gel analysis of the two preparations revealed significantly enhanced aggregation in preparation I , believed to arise from an increase in the creatinine binding valency for this antibody, which is aggregated due to its purification pro\u00ad cess. For comparison, we multimerized another creatinine monoclonal antibody (14F103) by biotinylating the antibody and multimerizing the antibody in the presence of streptavi- din. The monomeric, biotinylated monomeric, and multimer\u00ad ized forms were then tested with creatinine-coated magneticparticles to assess the effect of increased valency on T2 time. The results are depicted in FIG. 25C, showing the multimer\u00ad ized antibody forms clusters at much lower concentrations that the non-multimerized antibodies. This valency enhance\u00ad ment for particle clustering has also been observed using IgM antibodies. Example 7 Creatinine Antibody-Coated Magnetic Particle [0538] Using an alternative assay architecture, the assay includes the following: a target sample is incubated in the presence of (i) a magnetic particle that has been decorated with creatinine antibody; and (ii) a multivalent binding agent including multiple creatinine conjugates. The magnetic par\u00ad ticles are designed to aggregate in the presence of the multi\u00ad valent binding agent, but aggregation is inhibited by compe\u00ad tition with creatinine in the liquid sample. Thus, the binding of the creatinine to the antibody-coated particle blocks agglomeration of the magnetic particles in the presence of the multivalent binding agent, and low levels of creatinine are marked by the formation of agglomerates. These agglomer\u00ad ates alter the spin-spin relaxation rates of sample when exposed to a magnetic field and the change in the T2 relax\u00ad ation times (measuring a change in the magnetic resonance signal from the surrounding water molecules) can be directly correlated to presence and/or concentration of the analyte in the target sample. [0539] Substantially monodisperse carboxylated magnetic particles were washed and resuspended in 300 pi of coupling buffer (50 mM MES, pFl=4.75), and sulfo-NFIS (46 mmol) EDC (25 pmol) were added to the particles. The solution was briefly vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for I hour at room temperature. The activated particles were washed with mL PBS-0.01% T20, and resuspended in I mL of 10% w/v of amine-PEG-amine in PBS-0.01% T20. The mixture was vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature, and then washed 3x with PBS-0.01% T20. [0540] BSA can be substituted for amine-PEG-amine as an alternate chemistry. The BSA-coated magnetic particles were prepared as described in example 6, in the section describing creatinine coated magnetic particles. [0541] The particles were resuspended in 260 pi PBS-0. 01% T20 and reacted pi sulfo SMCC mg/mL in PBS-0.01% T20). The solution was briefly vortexed and placed on an end over end mixer for I hour at room tempera\u00ad ture, and then washed 3x with PBS-0.01% T20 mM EDTA to produce SMCC-coated particles. [0542] SATA-labeled antibody was prepared by combining SATA (30 nmol in DMSO) with antibody (2 nmol in PBS, pFl=7.4). The solution was placed on an end over end mixer for I hour at room temperature. Blocked sulfhydryl groups on SATA-labeled antibody were deprotected by treatment with deacetylation buffer (0.5M hydroxylamine hydrochloride in pFl 7.4, 10 mM phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM EDTA) for I hour and purified through a desalting column using PBS containing 10 mM EDTA prior to use. US 2013/0260367 A l 71Oct. 3, 2013 [0543] As an alternate to SATA, SPDP-Iabeled antibody can be used. SPDP-Iabeled antibody was prepared by adding SPDP (10 mmol in DMSO) with antibody (2 nmol in PBS, pH 7.4). The solution was incubated for I hour at room tempera\u00ad ture and purified through a desalting column. The disulfide linkage of SPDP on the SPDP-Iabeled antibody was cleaved in a reaction with 5 mM mercaptoethyamine and incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature. The disulfide bond- cleaved SPDP-Iabeled antibody was purified through a desalting column prior to use. [0544] The SMCC-functionalized particles with PEG- or BSA-coating and deacetylated SATA-modified antibody were combined and placed on an end over end mixer for overnight at room temperature, washed 3x with PBS-0.05% Tween\u00ae 80, and resuspended in PBS-0.01 mM EDTA. A blocking agent (m-PEG-SH 2K) was added, the solution was placed on an end over end mixer for 2 hours, washed 2x with PBS-0.05% particles and disulfide-bind cleaved SPDP-Iabeled antibody were combined and placed on an end over end mixer for 2 hours at room temperature, washed 2 times with PBS-0.01% Tween\u00ae 20, 10 mM EDTA, and resuspended in PBS, and A blocking agent, m-PEG-SH 2K (I mole), was added, and the solution was placed on an end over end mixer for 2 hours. A second blocking agent, n-ethyl maleim- ide (5 pmole), was added. The particles were mixed for 15 minutes, washed twice with PBS-0.01% Tween\u00ae 20, and resuspended in pH 9, Tween\u00ae 80, coated mag\u00ad netic particles. [0546] The procedure outlined above can be used with crea\u00ad tinine antibodies, or the creatinine antibodies can be coupled directly to the surface of the carboxylated magnetic particles via EDC coupling. [0547] Creatinine compounds (Invitrogen; MW 10k, 40k, and 70 k with 6.5, 12, and 24 amino groups per molecule of dextran respec\u00ad tively) and BSA tinine and amino-dextran-creatinine multivalent binding agents can be used in the competitive inhibition assay described above. Degrees of substitution between 2-30 crea\u00ad dextran moiety were achieved. An example crea\u00ad tinine inhibition curve is shown in FIG. 33. The binding agent used is a 40 kDa dextran with -10 creatinines per dextran molecule. Example of Tacrolimus Multivalent Binding Agents [0549] Tacrolimus conjugates were prepared using and BSA. FK-506 was subjected to the olefin metathesis reaction using Grubbs second generation catalyst in the pres\u00ad ence of 4-vinylbenzoic acid as depicted below in Scheme I . The crude product mixture was purified by normal phase silica gel chromatography.Scheme using three different molecular weight amino-dextrans, each with a different amino group substitution. [0552] 2.78 mL of EDC solution (40 mg/mL EDC hydro\u00ad and 2.78 mL of sulfo-NHS solution (64 mg/mL sulfo-NHS) were combined with stirring. To this mixture was added 0.96 mL of tacrolimus-acid derivative (C21) solution (28.8 mg/mL in DMSO) and the contents stirred for 30 min\u00ad utes at room temperature to form the activated tacrolimus- acid derivative (activatedTac solution 4.6 mM). The activated tacrolimus was used immediately. [0553] Various amino-dextran polymers were dissolved in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to make a 9.5 mg/mL stock solution. [0554] Activated Tac solution was added drop-wise with stirring at room temperature to the stock solution of amino- dextran in the ratios tabulated below. Each reaction was stirred vigorously for at least 2 hours.

[0556] Following purification, each of the samples was Iyo- philized and the dry weight determined. The multivalent binding agents were reconstituted prior to use. [0557] After reconstitution, the tacrolimus substitution ratios were estimated based upon the absorbance at 254 nm. [0558] Experiments were performed to determine which size dextran provided the most optimal agglomerative 10K, 40K, 70K, at varying concentrations, and 10 pL of Anti-Tacrolimus coated magnetic particles at 0.2 mM Fe was added to a 200 pL PCR Tube (2.7xl09 particles per tube). The sample was vortexed using a plate mixer at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes, preheated for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in an incubation station, exposed to a side and bottom magnet for I minute each, repeated for 6 cycles, vortexed again for 2 minutes at 2000 rpm, incubated for 5 minutes in 37\u00b0 C. incubator containing PCR tube designed heat block, and the T2 was read on the MR Reader. Data indicates that increased molecular weight/varied substitution ratios of dextran Tac can result in the improved T2 signal (see FIG. 34). In addition, higher substitution also resulted in improved response (see FIG. 35). [0559] BSA Conjugates [0560] BSA-tacrolimus conjugates were prepared 34.5 pL of NFlS solution (6.481 mg/mL in 50 mM MES pFl 4.7) were combined with stirring. 515.2 pL of this EDC NFlS mixture was added drop- wise to 220.8 tacrolimus-acid derivative (C21) solution (33.33 mg/mL in acetonitrile) and the contents stirred for I hour at room temperature to form the activated tacrolimus- acid derivative. The activated tacrolimus was used immedi\u00ad ately. BSA was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline acetonitrile to form a solution containing 5 mg/mL BSA in 40% acetonitrile. [0562] Activated Tac solution was added drop-wise with stirring at room temperature to the BSA solution in the ratios tabulated below. Each reaction was stirred vigorously for at least 2 hours.TABLE 7 ReactionRatio of Tac BSABSA C fi L )Volume Tac O 1 L) I 5 I 1 0 0 0 35 2 10 I 1 0 0 0 70 3 20 I 1 0 0 0 140 4 30 I 1 0 0 0 210 5 50 I 1 0 0 0 350 [0563] The resulting Tac-BSA conjugates were purified using a PDlO size exclusion column pre-equilibrated with 40% acetonitrile. The eluent was collected in I mL fractions and monitored for absorbance at 280 nm to identify fractions containing BSA. [0564] The BSA-containing fractions were combined and the acetonitrile removed under vacuum. [0565] Tac-BSA conjugates were evaluated for clustering ability by performing a titration similar to that used for the dextran-tacrolimus conjugates. As observed, clustering per\u00ad formance differs with Tac substitution ratio (see FIG. 36). Example 9 Tacrolimus CompetitiveAssay Protocol (Antibody on Particle Architecture) [0566] A tacrolimus assay was developed using particles and BSA-tacrolimus multivalent binding agent with detection using an MR Reader (see Example 6). This assay was designed for testing whole blood samples that have been extracted to release tacrolimus from the red blood cells and binding proteins (the extraction of hydrophobic analyte from a sample can be achieved, for example, using the methodology described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,875). The tacrolimus competitive assay architecture is depicted in FIG. 28. [0567] Solutions of magnetic particles and multivalent binding agent were, where indicated, subject to dilution with an assay buffer that included 100 mM Glycine with COOH functionality was modi\u00ad fied by sequential animated coating (PEG or BSA), antibody covalent attachment, PEG cap and PEG/protein block (as described in the examples above). The antibody-coated mag\u00ad netic particles were diluted to 0.4 mM Fe (5.48xl09 particles/ ml) in assay buffer, and vortexed thoroughly. tacrolimus covalently conjugated to BSA (as described in Example 8). The multivalent binding agent was diluted to 0.02 pg/ml in assay buffer, and vortexed thor\u00ad oughly. [0570] The extracted sample solution (10 pL) and the mag\u00ad netic particle solution (10 pL) were combined and vortexed for five seconds and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 15 minutes. To this mixture was added 20 pL of the multivalent binding agent and the resulting mixture vortexed for five seconds and incu\u00ad bated at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. [0571] Several samples were prepared as described above. All samples were placed into the gMAA unit for I minute. All samples were then placed into a tray removed from the mag\u00ad netic field. Each sample was vortexed for at least five seconds and returned to the tray. All samples were again placed into the gMAA unit for I minute, followed by vortexing. This process was repeated twelve times for each sample. US 2013/0260367 A l 73Oct. 3, 2013 [0572] The sample was incubated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., placed in the MR Reader (see Example 6) to measure the T2 relaxation rate of the sample, and the T2 relaxation rate of the sample was compared to a standard curve (see FIG. 29) to determine the concentration of tracrolimus in the liquid sample. [0573] Tacrolimus Antibody [0574] Several antibody development programs were pur\u00ad sued to create a high-affinity tacrolimus antibody including traditional mouse monoclonal models, in vitro phage display strategies, and rabbit models. C21 derivatives of tacrolimus were used as the haptens for the immunogen and screening conjugates used in these programs. A set of criteria was devel\u00ad oped for screening and identification of an optimal antibody for use in the assay. The criteria include the ability to bind tacrolimus-protein conjugates, the inhibition of that binding in the presence of nanomolar levels of free tacrolimus, all while exhibiting little or no affinity for the metabolites of tacrolimus (depicted below). [0575] Using the established antibody selection criteria outlined above, several monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and Fab fragments have been identified and selected as potential candidates in a tacrolimus assay.This process was repeated twelve times for each sample, to obtain replicate measurements. [0578] After the last gMAA cycle, the sample was vortexed for 5 seconds, incubated for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C., and placed in the MR Reader to measure the T2 relaxation rate of the sample. [0579] The specific aggregation achieved with various methods of gMAA are depicted in FIG. 26, wherein (i) \"con\u00ad trol\" is gMAA (magnet exposure+vortex, repeat) in which the relative position of the sample and the magnetic field direc\u00ad tion are unchanged with each cycle; (ii) \"twist is gMAA (magnet exposure+rotation within magnet, repeat) with rotat\u00ad ing tube ca. 90\u00b0 relative to the gradient magnet with each cycle; (iii) \"180 turn\" is gMAA (magnet exposure+remove tube from magnet, rotate, place back in magnet, repeat) with rotating tube ca. 180\u00b0 relative to the gradient magnet with each cycle; and (iv) \"remove 5 s\" is =removal of tube from magnet, 5 sec rest (no rotation), repeat. [0580] In the pulsed (cycled) magnetic assisted agglomera\u00ad tion of the invention, the liquid sample is exposed to magnetic fields from different directions in an alternating fashion. As shown in FIG. 26, the rate at which a steady state degree of 31 -O-demethylated 31-O-demethylated and a formation of a new ring system between carbon 19, 36 and 37 15-O-demethylated 15,31 Assisted Agglomeration (gMAA) [0576] An evaluation of alternative methods of gMAA was performed using the creatinine immunoassay described in Example 6 with sample containing no analyte to compete with the particle-antibody specific agglomeration. [0577] Several identical samples were prepared as described in Example 6. All samples were placed into the gMAA unit for I minute. All samples were then placed into a tray removed from the magnetic field. Each sample was vor\u00ad texed for at least five seconds and returned to the tray. All samples were again placed into the gMAA unit for I minute.agglomeration, and stable T2 reading, is achieved is expedited by cycling between the two or more positions over a series of gMAA treatments. Example 11 Side-Bottom Gradient Magnetic Assisted Agglomeration (gMAA) [0581] An evaluation of gMAA was per\u00ad formed using the creatinine basic immunoassay described in Example 6. For this evaluation, creatinine antibody was diluted to I pg/ml and serum calibrators were diluted 1:5 prior to the assay. 10 pi of diluted calibrator, 10 pL of particle reagent and 20 pL of antibody reagent were pipetted into the US 2013/0260367 A l 74Oct. 3, 2013 reaction well. The tube was preheated to 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes and then processed through gMAA with a 60 sec exposure in the side magnet, followed by 60 sec in the bottom magnet. This was completed for 6 total cycles or 12 minutes total. A final mix using a vortex for 60 sec was performed prior to the reading operation. [0582] A standard curve for the competitive creatinine creatinine assay with alternating side-bottom gMAA is shown in FIG. 27 demonstrating good response with the side-bottom gMAA configuration. Example 12 Effect of Varying the gMAA Dwell Time and Temperature [0583] An evaluation of gMAA dwell time and temperature on assisted agglomeration was performed. [0584] The following conditions were tested to determine the most optimal temperature and dwell time for T2 perfor\u00ad mance: 24, 48; for each alter\u00ad ations the following dwell time was evaluated: 30, 60, 120 seconds. A fixed magnet time of 6 minutes with the following dwell times was also evaluated: 30, 60,120 seconds. Samples were prepared by adding 20 pL of varied concentrations of ProteinA (a target protein) and 20 pL Anti-ProteinA antibody coated magnetic particles at 0.08 mM Fe to a PCR Tube (1.2xl09 particles per tube). Samples were placed into a 32 position tray, vortexed in a plate shaker for 2 minutes at 2000 rpm and incubated in a 37\u00b0 C. incubation station for 15 minutes. Samples were then exposed to the aforementioned dwell and alteration conditions between alternating magnetic fields. Following gMAA treatment, samples were vortexed manually for 5 minutes, incubated in a 37\u00b0 C. heat block compatible with PCR Tubes, and the T2 was read using the MR Reader (see Example 6). Data in FIGS. 30A and 30B show that T2 response is directly proportional to temperature and dwell time. Therefore, increased temperature and dwell time/total time results in improved T2 response. Example 13 Effect of Varying the Number of gMAA Cycles [0585] An evaluation of varying the number of gMAA cycles was performed using the system and procedure of Example 12. [0586] The following conditions were tested for effect on T2 performance: cycles\u20143, 6, 12, 24; for each cycle the following dwell time were evaluated: 30, 60, 120 seconds. A cycle consists of dwell in the side, followed by bottom. 6 Cyeles=I 2 total alterations. Samples were prepared as described in Example 12. As shown in FIG. 31, the degree of aggregation is directly proportional to number of gMAA cycles. It was also found that when magnet exposure time reaches or exceeds 24 minutes, there is an increase in non\u00ad specific aggregation that cannot be dispersed with vortex (not shown here). Example 14 Candida Assay [0587] In the assay used for Candida, two pools of mag\u00ad netic particles are used for detection of each Candida species. In the first pool, a species specific Candida capture oligo\u00adnucleotide probe is conjugated to the magnetic particles. In the second pool, an additional species-specific capture oligo\u00ad nucleotide probe is conjugated to the magnetic particles. Upon hybridization, the two particles will hybridize to two distinct species-specific sequences within the sense strand of the taiget nucleic acid, separated by approximately 10 to 100 nucleotides. (Alternatively, the two capture oligonucleotides can be conjugated to a single pool of particles, resulting in individual particles having specificity for both the first and second regions). The oligonucleotide-decorated magnetic particles are designed to aggregate in the presence of nucleic acid molecules from a particular species of Candida. Thus, unlike the inhibition assays used for creatinine and tacroli\u00ad mus, the Candida assay features an increase in agglomeration in the presence of the target Candida nucleic acid molecules. The hybridization-mediated agglomerative depicted in FIG. 32. Carboxylated magnetic particles are used in the Candida assays. Magnetic particles were conjugated to oli\u00ad gonucleotide create oligonucleotide-par\u00ad prepared. Oligo\u00ad nucleotide-particle conjugates were prepared using standard EDC chemistry between animated oligonucleotides and car- boxylated particles, or, optionally, by coupling biotin-TEG modified oligonucleotides to streptavidin particles. Coupling reactions were typically performed at a particle concentration of 1% solids. [0589] Post-conjugation, functional oligonucleotide densi\u00ad ties were measured by hybridizing Cy 5 -labeled complements to the particles, washing the particles three times to remove non-hybridized oligo; and eluting by heating to 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes. The amount of Cy5 labeled oligonucleotide was quantified via fluorescence spectroscopy. [0590] The coupling reactions were performed at 37\u00b0 C. overnight with continuous mixing using a rocker or roller. The resulting particle conjugates were washed twice with I x reaction volume of Millipore water; twice with I x reaction volume of 0.1 M Imidazole (pFl 6.0) at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes; three times with lx reaction volume of 0.1 M sodium bicar\u00ad bonate at 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes; then twice with lx reaction volume of 0.1 Msodiumbicarbonateat 65\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes. The resulting particle conjugates were stored at 1% solids in TE (pH 8), 0.1% Tween\u00ae20). [0591] The panel of Candida species detected includes C albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, and C. parap- silosis. The sequences are amplified using universal primers recognizing highly conserved sequence within the genus Candida. The capture oligonucleotides were designed to rec\u00ad ognize and to species-specific regions within the amplicon. [0592] An aliquot of a blood sample was first subjected to lysis as follows: [0593] (i) A whole blood sample was mixed with an excess (1.25x, 1.5x, or 2x) volume of ammonium chloride Addition of lysis solution disrupts all RBCs, but does not disrupt WBC, yeast, or bacteria cells. The cellu\u00ad lar matter was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 minutes and lysate was removed. Intact cells were reconstituted with 100 pi TE (tris EDTA, pH=8) to a final volume of about 100 pi; and [0594] (ii) To the approximately 100 pi sample, 120 mg of 0.5 mm beads were added. The sample was agitated for 3 minutes at about 3K rpm, thereby forming a lysate. US 2013/0260367 A l 75Oct. 3, 2013 [0595] An aliquot of ca. 50 pi of lysate was then subjected to PCR amplification by addition of the lysate to a PCR master mix including nucleotides; buffer (5 mM (NH4)SO4, 3.5 primer in 4x excess (300 mM forward; 0.75 mM reverse) to allow for asymmetric single strand pro\u00ad duction in the final product); and polymerase (New England Biolabs)). After an initial incubation at 95\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, the mixture is subjected to cycles: 62\u00b0 there 6\u00b0 difference in the annealing and elongation temperatures; the annealing and elongation may be combined into a single step to reduce the total ampli\u00ad fication turn-around time. [0596] The PCR amplicon, now ready for detection, is com\u00ad bined with two populations of particles in a sandwich assay. [0597] The PCR primers and capture probes which can be used in the Candida assay are provided below in Table 8.

Example 15 Non-Agglomerative Methods [0599] This process has been demonstrated using aminosi- lane-treated nickel metal foam with 400 pm pores decorated with anti-creatinine antibodies and shown to specifically bind creatinine-detivatized magnetic particles. A I cm square piece of nickel metal foam (Recemat RCM-Ni-4753.016) was washed by incubating at room temperature for I hr in 2M HCL, rinsed thoroughly in deionized water, and dried at 100\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The nickel foam was then treated with 2% 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in acetone at room temp over\u00ad night. The nickel metal foam was then washed extensively with deionized water and dried for 2 hours at 100\u00b0 C. The aminosilane-treated nickel metal foam was treated with 2% gluteraldehyde in water for 2 hours at room temp and washed extensively with deionized water. Next, the metal foam was exposed to 100 pg/ml of anti-creatinine antibody (14H03) (see Example 6) in PBS overnight, washed extensively with PBS, and treated with Surmodics Stabilguardto stabilize and block non-specific binding. Two mm square pieces of the derivatized metal foam were cut using a fresh razor blade being careful not to damage the foam structure. A piece of the derivatized metal foam was place into a PCR tube in 20 pi assay buffer (100 Twenty micro\u00ad liters of control particles (that should not bind to the metal foam ABXl - I I) at 0.2 mMFe were added to the tube to bring the final volume to 40u I and final particle concentration to 0.1 mM Fe (IxIO6 * -I xIO8 particles/tube). A separate PCR tube with the exact particle and buffer, without the metal foam was also prepared. The PCR tube containing the derivatized metal foam and control particles was placed in a gMAA fixture (side pull 6 position) for one minute and removed touched with a hand demagnetize^ and placed back into the gMAA fixture for another minute, removed touched with a hand demagne- tizer and placed back into the gMAA fixture for another minute and vortexed (three I minute magnetic exposures). Thirty pi of sample was removed from both PCR tubes, heated to 37\u00b0 C. in a grant block heater for 5 minutes and the T2 read using the MR Reader (see Example 6). The T2 from the sample with no foam read 39.2, and the samples from the PCR tube containing the foam read 45.1, demonstrating a low level of particle depletion due to NSB. The derivatized metal foam was de-magnetized, vortexed and rinsed in assay buffer. It was placed in a new PCR tube with 20 pi of assay buffer and 20 pi of AACr2-3-4 particles derivatized with creatinine with a final particle concentration of 0.1 mMFe. A duplicate PCR US 2013/0260367 A l 76Oct. 3, 2013 tube without the derivatized metal foam was also set up as in the control experiment. The PCR tube with the metal foam was cycled twice through the gMAA device exactly as the control experiment (3 one minute exposures with demag after each exposure, and final vortex). Thirtly pi samples from both tubes were removed and heated to 37\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes and then read on the MR reader. The sample from the PCR tube with the derivatized metal foam read 41.5, and the sample from the PCR tube with the metal foam derivatized with the anti-creatinine antibody read 324.2, thus demonstrating spe\u00ad cific binding/depletion of the appropriate creatinine-deriva- tized magnetic particles from the aqueous volume read by the MR reader. Example 16 Detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms [0600] There are numerous methods by which T2 measure\u00ad ments could detect single nucleotide polymorphisms. [0601] The simplest application would involve discrimina\u00ad a This assay would require lysis of the sample material followed by DNA shearing. Adaptors could be ligated onto the sheared DNA if a universal amplification of the genomic DNA was needed. The SNP would be detected by engineering superparamagnetic particle bound capture probes which flank the SNP such that the 5' end of the 3' aminated capture probe would be perfectly complementary to one particular SNP allele and subsequent treatment with Tth ligase would result in the ligation of the two particle-bound capture probes. Liga\u00ad tion would therefore lock the particles into an agglomerated state. Repeated melt, hybridization cycles will result in signal amplification in cases where genomic DNA amplification is not desired because of the amplification bias risk. The same 5' aminated capture probe could be utilized in all case while the 3' aminated probe could be generated to yield 4 distinct pools (an A, G, C, or T) at the extreme 5' end. Detection would require splitting of the sample into the 4 pools to determine which nucleotide(s) were present at the polymorphic site within that particular individual. For example a strong T2 switch in the G detection tube only would indicate the indi\u00ad vidual were homozygous for G at that particular sequence location, while a switch at G and A would indicate the indi\u00ad vidual is a heterozygote for G and A at that particular SNP site. The advantage of this method is Tth polymerase has been demonstrated to have superior discrimination capability even discriminating G-T mismatches (a particular permissive mis\u00ad match and also the most common) 1:200 fold against the correct complement. While ligase detection reactions as well as oligonucleotide ligase assays have been employed in the past to define nucleotide sequences at known polymorphic sites, all required amplification either before or after ligation; in this particular example the signal could be amplified via a ligation induced increase in the size of the resulting agglom\u00ad erated particle complex and thereby increases in the mea\u00ad sured relaxation times (T2). [0602] A modification to this procedure could include hybridization of a particle bound capture probe flanking the hybridization of a biotinylated probe. When a perfectly complementary duplex is formed via hybridization of the particle bound probe, the ligase would covalently bind the biotin probe to the magnetic particle. Again repeated rounds of heat denaturation followed by annealing and ligation should yield a high proportion of long biotinylated oligos onthe magnetic particle surface. A wash to remove any free probe would be conducted followed by the addition of a second streptavidin labeled superparamagnetic particle. Agglomeration would ensue only if the biotinylated probes were ligated onto the surface of first particle. [0603] A hybridization discrimination approach could as well be employed. In this example, aminated oligonucleotide complements adjacent to known SNPs would be generated. These aminated oligonucleotides would be used to derivatize the surface of a 96-well plate with I SNP detection reaction conducted per well. Genomic DNA would then be sheared, ligated to adaptors, and asymmetrically amplified. This amplified genomic DNA would then be applied to the array as well as a short biotinylated SNP detecting probe. The ampli\u00ad the well-bound cap\u00ad ture probe and the SNP detecting probe would then bind to the tethered genomic DNA. Washing would be conducted to remove free SNP-detecting probe. A streptavidin (SA) mag\u00ad netic particle would then be added to each well. Washing again would be required to remove free-SA particles. T2 detection could be conducted directly within the wells by added biotinylated superparamagnetic particles to yield sur\u00ad face tethered agglomerated particles, or the SA magnetic particles could be eluted from each well on the array and incubated in detection reactions with biotinylated magnetic particles. [0604] Lastly a primer extension reaction could be coupled to T2 detection to discriminate which nucleotide is present at a polymorphic site. In this assay, a pool of dideoxynucleotides would be employed with one nucleotide per pool possessing a biotin (i.e., ddA, ddT, ddbiotin-C, and/or ddG). A super\u00ad paramagnetic particle bearing a capture probe whose last base upon hybridization lies adjacent to a SNP would be employed. [0605] The sheared genomic DNA would be split and incu\u00ad bated in four separate primer extension reactions. An exo- DNA polymerase would then catalyze the addition of a dideoxy complementary to the nucleotide present in the SNP. Again this reaction could be cycled if a thermophilic poly\u00ad merase is employed to ensure that most of the capture probes on the particle will be extended. A magnetic separation fol\u00ad lowed by a wash of the particles would be conducted followed by incubation with streptavidin superparamagnetic particles. Clustering would ensue proportional to the extent of biotiny\u00ad lated capture probe on the surface of the first particle. If two of the dideoxypools generated a gain in T2 (i.e., facilitate particle agglomeration), the patient would be a heterozygote. If only one pool yielded and increase in T2, the patient would be a homozygote. [0606] A final method to detect SNPs employs allele-spe\u00ad cific PCR primers, in which the 3' end of the primer encom\u00ad passes the SNP. Since stringent amplification conditions are employed, if the target sequence is not perfectly complemen\u00ad tary to the primer, PCR amplification will be compromised with little or no product generated. In general, multiple for\u00ad ward primers would be designed (one perfectly complemen\u00ad tary to each allele) along with a single reverse primer. The amplicon would be detected using two or more capture probe bound superparamagnetic particles to induce hybridization based agglomeration reactions. One advantage of this approach is that it leverages some of the work already con\u00ad ducted at T2 on PCR within crude samples, and would merely US 2013/0260367 A l 77Oct. 3, 2013 entail primers designed to encompass known SNPs. A disad\u00ad vantage in this approach is that it cannot determine de novo SNP locations. [0607] An additional method which can be used is simply relying on the discrimination capabilities of particle-particle cross-linking due to hybridization to a short nucleic acid target. Mismatches in base pairs for oligonucleotides have been shown to dramatically shift the agglomeration state of particles, and the measured T2 signal, due to reduced hybrid\u00ad ization efficiencies from the presence of a single base mis\u00ad match. Example 17 Diagnostic Candida Panel [0608] Testing was performed over the course of 45 days. C. albicans and C. krusei reference strains as well as C albicans clinical isolates were cultivated and maintained for the duration of the study. [0609] Materials: [0610] C. albicans and C. krusei nanoparticles: Two populations were for the par\u00ad bearing covalently conjugated to oligos complementary to species-specific sequences within the ITS2 region (see Example 14). The particles were stored at 4-8\u00b0 C. in TE (pEl 8), 0.1% Tween and were diluted to 0.097 mM Fe in DNA hybridization buffer immediately before use. [0611] Candida strains: Panels were performed using C albicans reference (GenBank FN652297. strain24210 (GenBank C albicans clinical isolates. The five C albicans isolates used were cultivated on YPD at room temperature. Single colonies were selected, washed 3 times with PBS, and then quantified via hemocytometer for preparation of whole blood spikes. The samples were stored as frozen glycerol stocks as -80\u00b0 C. [0612] Fluman whole blood: Whole blood was collected from healthy donors and treated with K2EDTA and spiked with washed serially diluted Candida cells at concentrations spanning 1E5 to 5 cells/mL. Cell spikes prepared in fresh blood were stored at -20\u00b0 C. [0613] Erythrocyte Lysis buffer: A hypotonic 155 mM ammo\u00ad nium chloride, and 0.1 mM EDTA was filter sterilized and stored at room temperature prior to use. Alternatively an erythrocyte lysis agent can be used, such as a non-ionic deter\u00ad gent (e.g., a mixture of Triton-X 100 and igepal, or Brij-58). [0614] PCR master master mix containing buffer, nucleotides, primers, and enzyme was prepared (20 pL 5x reaction buffer, 22 pL water, 2 pL 10 mM dNTP, 3 pL 10 pM forward primer, 3 pL 2.5 pM reverse primer, 10 pL HemoK- IenTaq, and 40 pL bead beaten lysate) and stored at room temperature. [0615] Particle hybridization master mix: A master mix consisting of nanoparticle conjugates, salts, surfactant, and formamide was 20xSSC, 88.3 pL lxTE+0.1% Tween, 7.5 pL CP 1-3', and pL CP 3-5') immediately before use. [0616] Glass beads (0.5 mm), used in mechanical lysis of Candida, were washed in acid and autoclaved and stored at room temperature prior to use. [0617] PCR Protocol: [0618] A general scheme of the workflow for detection of a pathogen (e.g., Candida ) in a whole blood sample is shown inFIG. 47. The protocol was as follows: (i) human whole blood spiked samples were allowed to warm to room temperature (-30 minutes); (ii) I mL of erythrocyte lysis buffer was ali- quoted into each tube; (iii) each tube was centrifuged at 9000 g for 5 minutes and the lysed blood discarded; (iv) 100 pL of 0.2 micron filtered TE was aliquoted into each tube; (v) 120 mg of acid washed glass beads were added to each tube; (vi) each tube was vortexed for 3 minutes at maximum speed (-3000 rpm); (vii) 50 pL of lysed sample was aliquoted into a tube containing PCR master mix (viii) cycle PCR reactions as follows: 95\u00b0 30-40 62\u00b0 C., 30 to form pellet clotted blood; (x) 5 pL of particle master mix was aliquoted into the tube for every 10 pL of amplified sample; (xi) the resulting mixture was well mixed and the sample denatured at 95\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes; (xii) the sample was hybridized at 60\u00b0 C. for I hour with gentle agitation; (xiii) the sample was then diluted to 150 uL with particle dilution buffer, and equili\u00ad brated to 37\u00b0 C. in a heat block for I minute; and (xiv) the T2 of the sample was measured using a T2 MR reader. [0619] Test Results [0620] Repeatability of Candida albicans detection in human whole blood: To determine the repeatability of the T2 measurement on C albicans infected human whole blood, we conducted an eight day study in which the same donor spiked and amplified sample was hybridized to the superparamag- netic particles (n=3) each day and the resulting T2 values were recorded. [0621] The within run precision is shown in FIG. 46A and in general is tight with the CV's of all measurands less than 12%. The repeatability observed over the course of eight days is shown in FIG. 46B with the CVs less than 10% across the range of Candida concentrations and 6% for the negative control. Importantly, a two population two-tailed Student's T-test was applied to determine if the difference in means between the mock Candida infected blood at 10 cells/mL and the healthy donor blood was significant. The results are sum\u00ad marized in Table 9. TABLE 9 The difference in means between 10 cells/mL infected blood and negative control is significant (p value < 0.0001) P value <0.0001 Are means signif. different? (P < 0.05) Yes One- or two-tailed P value? Two-tailed t, df t = 40.69 df = 23 Number of pairs 24 Mean of differences 287.7 95% confidence interval 273.0 to 302.3 R square 0.9863 of sample on Candida albicans and Candida krusei detection and reproducibility: Healthy blood from 6 donors was spiked with a range of C albicans or C krusei cells (1E5 cells/mL to 0 cells/mL). From the Candida albicans spiked blood, sixteen independent experiments were conducted. Each experiment consisted of PCR amplification of the IE5 to 0 cells/mL spiked blood with each amplification reaction subjected to three replicate T2 detection experi\u00ad ments; thus for C albicans a total of 48 T2 values were recorded at each tested concentration (see FIG. 48A). At the US 2013/0260367 A l 78Oct. 3, 2013 lowest test concentration (10 cells/mL), we failed to detect Candida albicans 37% of the time (6 out of 16 experiments); however at 100 cells/mL Candida albicans was detected 100% of the time. This suggests the LOD for C albicans is above 10 cells/mL but below 100 cells/mL. More concentra\u00ad tions will be tested between the 10 CFU to 100 cells/mL to better define the LOD; however we do not expect to observe any major matrix effects on assay performance. This is evi\u00ad denced by the CVs of the T2 measurements which are as follows: 12.6% at 0 cells/mL. This suggests the assay can robustly detect at C albicans concentrations greater than or equal to 100 cells/mL with no major inhibition of performance intro\u00ad duced through the donor blood samples. [0623] The same experiment was conducted using a refer\u00ad ence strain of C krusei. In this case 7 independent experi\u00ad ments were conducted as the remaining spiked blood was reserved for blood culture analysis. We did not detect at 10 cells/mL in any of the experimental runs but detected at 100 cells/mL for all experimental runs. This suggests the LOD between 10 and 100 cells/mL. Again a titration of cell con\u00ad centrations between 100 and 10 cells/mL will need to be conducted to better define the LOD. The CV's of the mea\u00ad surements across the 10, and 5.2% at 0 cells/mL. The results are shown in FIG. 48B. [0624] Preliminary determination of limit of detection: Five Candida albicans clinical isolates were spiked into 6 different donor blood samples at concentrations of 1E4, 1E3, 5E2, 1E2, 50, 10, 5, and 0 cells/mL. Each isolate was spiked into a minimum of two different donor blood samples. Ampli\u00ad fication reactions were detected via T2 measurement with the results plotted in FIG. 49. It is important to note that no data was removed for cause within this study. We did not detect C albicans 50% of the time at 5 cells/mL or 10 cells/mL; how\u00ad ever at 50 cells/mL C albicans was detected 95% of the time. These data were generated using different clinical isolates; each isolate contains a different number of rDNA repeats and the number of these repeats can vary as much as 4-fold from strain to strain (i.e. -50 units to 200 units). Since the input target copy numbers will vary slightly from strain to strain and certainly from species to species, there will be subtle differences in the absolute T2 values observed at very low cell numbers (i.e. 10 cells/mL). Based on our very preliminarystudy, the data suggests a cut-off of 10 cells/mL; however this determination cannot be made in the absence of final formu\u00ad lations of reagents as well as the instrument/cartridge. It does suggest that defining the C5-C95 interval will be difficult because at 10 cells/mL each reaction contains only 4 cells. Titrating at cell numbers lowerthanthis becomes challenging with this input volume of blood. Using the Poisson distribu\u00ad tion to calculate the number of reactions that would contain 0 cells at 10 cells/mL indicates only 2% of the reactions would not contain cells; however at 5 cells/mL, 13% of the reactions will contain no Candida cells, and at 2 cells/mL, -37% of the reactions would not contain Candida cells. To increase the assay's sensitivity to 95% at 10 cells/mL, we could increase the amount of lysate added to the PCR reactions from 40 pL to 50 pL and increase the amount of patient blood from 400 pL to 800 pL/reaction. [0625] Preliminary determination of sensitivity/specificity: Initially, quantification of input Candida colony forming units was conducted using a hemocytometer; however in this case the operator counted budding daughter cells as separate cells. As our data is reported in colony forming units/mL and not cells/mL, buds should not be quantified. Because of this error, fewer cells/mL of Candida are present at the various spike concentrations and our sensitivity at 10 cells/mL was only 90%, while our specificity was 100%. At 25 cells/mL or greater we observe 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In all cases, blood culture vials inoculated with Candida cells were blood culture positive by day 8. It should be noted that the default setting for blood culture is incubation for 5 days; however we needed to extend this incubation time as many of our inoculums required >5 days incubation. As an example, Table IOA shows the time from inoculation to culture positive recorded for four different C albicans clinical isolates inocu\u00ad lated into blood culture. [0626] The results of T2 measurements conducted on 800 pL aliquots from these spiked whole blood samples is shown in Table 10B. In all cases we were able to detect at 25 cells/ mL, or greater, however we were unable to detect clinical isolate C3 at 12 cells/mL. It is important to note the CFU's were quantified via hemocytometer and not Coulter counter for this particular method compare experiment. In total 51 blood culture bottles were inoculated with hemocytomer quantified Candida albicans clinical isolates and 35 negative blood culture vials were included in the experiment. The results for inoculums greater than 25 cells/mL are shown in the contingency table in Table 11.

Prelimi\u00ad nary results from 27 blood culture bottles are shown in Table 12. These preliminary results indicate we have 100% sensi\u00ad tivity and specificity at 10 cells/mL or greater. We have addi\u00ad tionally begun method comparisons using C krusei. Prelimi\u00ad nary results (from 36 vials) are shown in Table 13. Theresults indicate we have a sensitivity/specificity of 88%/100% at 10 cells/mL or greater and 00% sensitivity/100% specificity at 33 cells/mL or greater for Candida krusei. Another important change which was instituted prior to the new blood culture agreement comparisons was the employment of a multi\u00ad probe particle. In this case the T2 clustering reactions for C albicans detection were conducted using albicans/parapsilo- sis/tropicalis multi-functional particles while C krusei was detected using the glabrata/krusei multi-functional particles.

Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) plots describe the test's performance graphically illustrating the relationship between sensitivity (true positive fraction) and specificity (true negative fraction). The clinical accuracy (sensitivity/specificity pairs) is displayed for the entire spec\u00ad trum of decision levels. Using the data generated from the 10 cells/mL and 50 cells/mL clinical isolate spiked whole blood samples, two ROC plots were generated and are shown in FIGS. 50Aand50B. Theareaunderthe curve is often used to quantify the diagnostic accuracy; in this case our ability to discriminate between a Candidemic patient with an infection of 10 cells/mL or 50 cells/mL versus a patient with no Can\u00ad didemia. At 10 cells/mL the area under the curve is 0.72 which means that if the T2 assay was run on a randomly chosen person with Candidemia at a level of infection of 10 cells/mL, there is an 72% chance their T2 value would be higher than a person with no Candidemia. The clinical accu\u00ad racy of the test is much higher at 50 cells/mL with the area under the curve at 0.98. Again indicating that in a person with Candidemia at this level of infection, the T2 assay would give a value higher than a sample from a patient without Candi\u00ad demia 98% of the time. This is excellent clinical accuracy for infection levels of 50 cells/mL. ROC plots were not prepared for the 100 cells/mL samples or higher as the area would be translating to 100% clinical diagnostic accuracy. Final clini\u00ad cal accuracy is determined from real patient samples on the clinical platform. [0629] Assay turnaround time: The primary assay steps with estimated times are: (i) hypotonic lysis/centrifugation/ bead beating (8 min); (ii) PCR min.); hybridization of amplicon to particles (30 min.); (iv) hMAA (10 min.); and (v) transfer and read (10 sec.). The processing time for the assay is estimated at -178 minutes (-3 hrs), excluding reagent and equipment preparation. This is the workflow used for qualification; however we have demonstrated that the following modified work-flow with shorter PCR and hybrid\u00ad ization steps does yield the same detection sensitivity (see FIG. 51) (albeit with a reduction in the amount of amplicon generated for some Candida species (i.e., glabrata) and hence a smaller delta T2 between diseased and normal): (i) hypo\u00ad tonic lysis/centrifugation/bead beating min.); (ii) PCR min.); hybridization amplicon to particles (30 min.); (iv) hMAA (I Omin.); and (v) transfer and read (10 sec.). This modified flow generates a TAT of 133 minutes or 2 hours and 13 minutes (and this is without migration to a faster ther\u00ad mocycler). [0630] Conclusions [0631] This testing demonstrates a current T2 based molecular diagnostic assay for Candidemia with the follow\u00ad ing metrics: (i) detection of Candida albicans within whole blood at a range (5-log); (ii) detec\u00ad tion of Candida cells/mL; (iii) sensitivity/specificity of 100%/100% cells/mL; accuracy of greater than 98% for concentrations >50 cells/mL; (v) assay compatibility with whole blood (no major matrix effects observed using twelve different donor blood samples); (vi) repeatability OfT2 measurements (less than 12% within the same day and less than 13% across eight days); and (vii) reduced total assay turnaround time to 2 hours 3 minutes. US 2013/0260367 A l 80Oct. 3, 2013 [0632] We have tested higher input volumes of human blood and found that efficient hypotonic lysis is achievable with these larger blood volumes; further it has increased the reproducibility of detection at 10 cells/mL. [0633] Contamination was observed within 2 samples of the 50 titrations. To reduce contamination issues, the PCR steps may be separated from the detection steps. Further, chemical/biochemical methods may be used to render the amplicons unamplifiable. For example, uracils may be incor\u00ad porated into the PCR product, and a pre-PCR incubation may be conducted with uracil N glycosylase. [0634] The advantages of the systems and methods of the invention include the ability to assay whole blood samples without separating proteins and non-target nucleic acids from the sample. Because no losses in target nucleic acids are incurred through DNA purification (e.g., running Qiagen col\u00ad umn after lysis and prior to amplification results in >1 Ox loss in sensitivity; and use of whole blood interferes with optical detection methods at concentrations above 1%), sample-to- sample variability and biases (which can be introduced by DNA purification) are minimized and sensitivity is maxi\u00ad mized. [0635] Over 10% of septic shock patients are carriers of Candida ; this is the third most prevalent pathogen after S. aureus & E. coli, and there is an approximately 50% mortality rate for septic shock patients infected with Candida. Candida is the fourth leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Rapid identification of these patients is critical to selecting proper treatment regimens. Example 18 Viral Assay [0636] CMV genomic DNA was spiked into CMV-free healthy donor blood samples, 40 pL of this spiked blood was aliquoted into a 100 pL total volume PCR reaction. Amplifi\u00ad cation was conducted using a whole blood compatible ther\u00ad mophilic DNA polymerase (T2 Biosystems, Lexington, Mass.) and exemplary universal primers that were designed as follows: 24 mer end\u2014C6 linker\u2014CMV specific sequence, the exact sequences were as follows: (SEQ ID NO 1 1 , u n i v e r s a l t a i l p r o b e #1) 5 '-C A T GAT CTG CTG GAG TCT GAC GTT A - 3 ' (SEQ ID NO 1 2 , u n i v e r s a l t a i l p r o b e #2) 5 '-G C A GAT CTC CTC AAT GCG G C -3' (SEQ ID NO 1 4 , CMV US8 r e v e r s e p r i m e r ) 5 '-C G T GCC ACC GCA GAT ID NO 1 4 , CMV US8 r e v e r s e p r i m e r ) 5 '-G A A TAC AGA CAC TTA GAG CTC GGG-3 ' [0637] The primers were designed such that the capture probes (Te., the nucleic acid decorating the magnetic particle) would anneal to the IOmer region (IOmers are different on either 5' or 3' end). The final primer concentration in the reaction tube was 300 nM and PCR master mix which included 5 mM (NFl4)2SO4, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 6% glycerol, 60 mM Tricine (pFl 8.7)). Five separate sample reaction tubes were set up. Cycle PCR reactions followed an initial denatur- ation of 95\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes, and each cycle consisted of 95\u00b0 C., 20 seconds; 55\u00b0 C., 30 seconds; and68\u00b0 C., 20 seconds. At 30,33,36,39, and 42 cycles reaction tubes were removed andmaintained at 4\u00b0 C. Once all samples were ready, 5 pL of particle master mix (6xSSC, 30% formamide, 0.1% Tween) was aliquoted into the tube for every 10 pL of amplified sample; the resulting mixture was well mixed and the sample denatured at 95\u00b0 C. for 3 minutes; the sample was hybridized at 45\u00b0 C. for I hour with gentle agitation; the sample was then diluted to 150 pL with particle dilution buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween, 0.1% BSA), placed into a temperature controlled hMAA magnet for 10 minutes, and equilibrated to 37\u00b0 C. in a heat block for I minute; and the T2 relaxation time for each of the five separate samples was measured using a T2 MR reader (see FIG. 52). [0638] The primers were designed to allow the magnetic particles decorated with capture probes to anneal to the I Omer region (IOmers are different on either 5' or 3' end), providing particles with a universal architecture for aggregation with specific amplification primers. [0639] The results provided in FIG. 52 show that the meth\u00ad ods and systems of the invention can be used to perform real time PCR and provide quantitative information about the amount of target nucleic acid present in a whole blood sample. Example 19 Real-Time PCR [0640] Previous results showed that when particles were present in the PCR reaction the amplicon production was inhibited. We hypothesize that moving the particles to the side of the reaction tube during the thermocycling will allow pro\u00ad duction of amplicon. A simple magnetic separator/PCR block insert (FIG. 53) was designed to keep nanoparticles on the side walls during PCR reaction, thus minimizing interference and particle exposure to the PCR reaction components. Upon removal of the magnetic field, particles can be completely resuspended into the reaction mixture. [0641] In one experiment, we tested the rate at which par\u00ad ticles could be sequestered to the side of the tube and returned to solution. In this experiment, 100 pL of the C albicans (3' and 5') particle mix in IxTE baseline) three times through clustering/unclustering process at 95\u00b0 C. Thiswas followed by the following protocol [0642] I . vortex, incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for I min, measure T2; [0643] 2. heat at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 min on the magnetic PCR insert; [0644] 3. incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for I min, measure T2; [0645] 4. vortex 15 sec, incubate at 37\u00b0 C. for I min, mea\u00ad sure T2; and [0646] 5. go to step 2. [0647] The results of this experiment are shown in Table 14 below. TABLE 14 cycle # I 2 3 4 tube I 147 I 150 8 154 9 140 9 T2 unclus- tered 2198 C 5 1395 I avrg 1397 6 mcr % tube 2 143 5 147 4 150 4 144 2 T2 unclus- tered US 2013/0260367 A l 81Oct. 3, 2013 TABLE 14-continued cycle # I 2 3 4 2240 7 2141 3 2086 5 T l clus\u00ad tered at 95\u00b0 C % 2 9 1386 9 avrg %1467 I [0648] As shown in Table 14, fully reversible nanoparticle clustering was demonstrated at 95\u00b0 C. when using the tested magnetic separator. Particles are stable at 95\u00b0 C. for at least 3 clustering/unclustering cycles. [0649] We next tested PCR efficiency in the presence of nanoparticles in reaction solution. PCR was performed under two conditions: (I) nanoparticles are fully dispersed in solu\u00ad tion; and (2) nanoparticles are concentrated on the PCR test tube side walls using magnetic insert. [0650] Three PCR reactions (with nanoparticles concen\u00ad trated on the test tube wall; fully dispersed in solution; and no nanoparticles) were set up using C. albicans genomic DNA as a starting material. [0651] Successful target DNA amplification was validated using gel electrophoresis. decorated Seramag particles were used. reactions were setup using pre-made PCR mix and 100 copies of genomic C. albicans DNA as a starting material. C. albicans capture particle mix (3' and 5') in IxTE was added to reactions (I) and (3) (base\u00ad line -150 msec). Control reaction (2) did not have nanopar\u00ad ticles added (FIG. 54). [0653] No difference was observed in PCR product forma\u00ad tion when nanoparticles were present in solution (dispersed in solution or concentrated on test tube side walls via magnetic field) during PCR. Therefore, nanoparticles modified with capture probes do not interfere with PCR. Comparable amounts of product were generated in the reactions with and without nanoparticles present in solution as evidenced by gel electrophoresis. Also, magnetic concentration of nanopar\u00ad ticles on test tube side walls during PCR process does not have an effect on the PCR. Example 20 Internal Controls for C Albicans [0654] A variety of impurities and components of whole blood can be inhibitory to the polymerase and primer anneal\u00ad ing. These inhibitors can lead to generation of false positives and low sensitivities. To assure that clinical specimens are successfully amplified and detected, the assay can include an internal control nucleic acid that contains primer binding regions identical to those of the target sequence. The target nucleic acid and internal control are selected such that each has a unique probe binding region that differentiates the inter\u00ad nal control from the taiget nucleic acid. The internal control can be an inhibition control that is designed to co-amplify with the nucleic acid target being detected. Failure of the internal inhibition control to be amplified is evidence of a reagent failure or process error. Universal primers can be designed such that the target sequence and the internal control sequence are amplified in the same reaction tube. Thus, using this format, if the target DNA is amplified but the internal control is not it is then assumed that the taiget DNA is present in a proportionally greater amount than the internal controland the positive result is valid as the internal control ampli\u00ad fication is unnecessary. If, on the other hand, neither the internal control nor the target is amplified it is then assumed that inhibition of the PCR reaction has occurred and the test for that particular sample is not valid. [0655] The already amplified and detected Candida albi\u00ad cans sequence was examined for use in generating an internal control. The universal primer sequences were removed from the 5' and 3' ends. The residual internal sequence was sub\u00ad jected to a random sequence generator and a random sequence was generated. The universal primer sequences were replaced at the ends and the full internal control sequence was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO and was sequence verified. [0656] In designing these internal controls, the following criteria and features for use in diagnostic PCR assays were employed: I) the target and internal control DNA share the same primers; 2) the internal control and target DNA are easily distinguishable (i.e. different capture probes); 3) the amplification efficiencies of the target and internal control have been tested and are acceptable; 4) the source of the internal control is a plasmid DNA carrying the cloned internal control sequence; 5) the internal control is detected by sequence dependent hybridization; 6) the internal control plasmid is highly purified; 7) the concentration of the internal control is determined by titration; 8) the internal control plas\u00ad mid is added to the PCR mix to ensure equal distribution to all of the PCR tubes; 9) it has been determined the amount of internal control in the assay reaction tubes is 100-1000 cop\u00ad ies/reaction and this concentration has been determined to be the lowest amount that still elicits a signal via amplification. See Floofar et ah, J. Clin. Microbiol. 42:1863 The internal inhibition control for the Candida assay was designed to co-amplify with the Pan Candida PCR primers and contain a unique intervening sequence of similar length and base composition as the Candida species. The intervening sequence was developed by applying a sequence randomizing algorithm to the C ablicans amplicon sequence. Four then thermodynamically and bioinformatically characterized. A nucleotide mega- BLAST search was conducted for each sequence using both the human genomic+transcript database as well as the nr database. No significant alignments were identified with the four query sequences in either database. Each sequence was then subjected to UNAfold analysis to determine the extent of secondary structure present at the hybridization concentra\u00ad tion of monovalent cation (600 mM) at a temperature of 60 degrees C. Two sequences were excluded at this point due to the presence of extensive stems under these hybridization conditions. Two were further characterized to determine if capture probes could be designed complementary to the 5' and 3' ends of the strand amplified in excess that would be devoid of poly-G tracts, and have low probabilities of forming homo and heterodimers. One sequence met all the criteria and was ordered as a PAGE purified synthetic oligonucleotide and its respective complement from IDT Technologies (Cor- alville, Iowa). The sequence of the internal control that will be amplified in excess is: (SEQ ID CCT CGG TAC ACT GGG AAC A l 82Oct. 3, 2013 -continued AAG GCC TCA GAA AAG CAT ATC AAT AAG C A -3 [0658] The annealed complementary sequence is: (SEQ ID NO [0659] 5 uM of the annealed duplex in 2xSSC was sent to SeqWright facilitate cloning into a TA cloning vector. This construct was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. Upon transformation, 5 clones were selected and sequenced to confirm the presence of the correct insert. Upon verification of the correct cloned insert, the mini- prepped plasmid DNA should be digested with EcoRV and HindIII and the insert subcloned into pBR322. From this transformation, 5 transformants were selected and the insert verified via sequencing. Two E. coli hosts bearing the pBR322-IC were frozen in 30% glycerol+LB amp. A plasmid maxi-prep was conducted using the Qiagen and yielded ~1 mg of purified plasmid DNA. [0660] Capture probes were designed to hybridize nested to the Candida PCR primer T-9 linker was designed to complementary to the 5' end of the strand amplified in excess. A 5' aminated capture probe with a C12 T-9 linker was comple\u00ad mentary to the 3' end of the strand amplified in excess. These sequences are shown below: (SEQ ID NO AGT ATG ATG CAG-TTT TTT T T T -3 ' A m ino (SEQ ID NO 18) 5 ' A m in o - C 1 2 -TTT TTT TTT-TGG AAT AAT ACG CCG ACC AGC TTG CAC TA [0661] The predicted melting temperatures (Allawi, 1997) were 75 and 78\u00b0 C., respectively. Example 21 Rotary gMAA [0662] Three prototype rotary gMAA configurations were designed, built and tested with comparison to the conven\u00ad tional plate based gMAA (see FIG. 56A). The three configu\u00ad rations included varying magnetic field exposures\u2014side-bot\u00ad tom; side-null and bottom-null. The plate based gMAA used for comparison is the standard side-bottom. Assay functional performance (non-specific binding and and creatinine dextran agglomerator. The agglomerator was tested at 6 concentrations to provide a titration curve. Each concentration level was tested in tripli\u00ad cate. The T2 of samples with no agglomerator was measured before and after gMAA to assess non-specific binding. gMAA was performed at room temperature for a total of 12 minutes with I minute dwells at the magnet stations. [0663] With respect to non-specific binding, all rotary con\u00ad figurations yielded acceptable results (<10% difference) and were comparable to the conventional plate gMAA. [0664] With respect to aggregate formation, all rotary gMAA devices produced aggregation. The rotary side-bot\u00ad tom configuration provided the highest T2 signal at a given agglomerator concentration, followed by the comparison side-bottom plate configuration. Rotary side-null provides equivalent signal to the plate side-bottom; and the bottom- null produces the lowest signal (see FIG. 56B). Example 22 Candida Assay and Clinical Data [0665] A rapid, accurate, and reproducible molecular diag\u00ad nostic test was developed for the detection of five Candida species directly within human whole blood with a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 cells/mL and a time to result of less than 2 hours. The assay's clinical performance was deter\u00ad mined using 32 blinded clinical specimens and in this study we observed 100% positive and 100% negative agreement with blood culture while accurately identifying the causative Candida species within 100% of the candidemic patient samples. We further applied the assay to blood specimens drawn from Candida positive patients and observed a decrease in Candida detection concordant with the time course of antifungal treatment. This diagnostic method is rapid, amenable to automation, and offers clinicians the opportunity to detect multiple human pathogens within com\u00ad plex biological specimens. [0666] Magnetic Resonance Relaxometer [0667] A compact magnetic resonance (MR) system was designed and constructed for precise T2 relaxation measure\u00ad ments in order to perform the intended assay under the described conditions. This system was held at 37\u00b0 C. via temperature control and contains a samarium cobalt perma\u00ad nent magnet of approximately 0.5 T, corresponding to a pro\u00ad ton frequency of operation of 22-24 MHz. All standard MR components: radio frequency probe, low-noise pre-amplifier and transmitter electronics, spectrometer board, as well as the temperature control hardware are packaged in the system. The system uses standard AC power input and connects to an external computer via Ethernet. A user friendly graphical user interface allows users to set experimental parameters. [0668] The system has been designed to accept samples in standard 0.2 ml PCR tubes. The electronics as well as the coil were optimized to improve the measurement precision of the applicable sample volumes, allowing us to achieve single\u00ad scan run to run CVs in T2 of less than 0.1%. Instrument to instrument variability is under 2% with minimal tolerance requirements on the system components and without calibra\u00ad tion. US 2013/0260367 A l oxide superparamagnetic particles, consisting of numerous iron oxide nanocrystals embedded in a polymer matrix including a total particle diam- eterof 800 nm (see Demas et al., New J. Phys. 13:1 (2011)), were conjugated to chemistry. 8), 0.1% Tween-20. Iron concentration of nanoparticle conjugates were measured by dissolving the particle with 6M HCl fol\u00ad lowed by addition and subsequent spectrophotometric detec\u00ad tion as described in et ah, J Immunol Methods, 73:41 (1984). Oligonucleotide derivatized particles are then sub\u00ad jected to a functional performance test by conducting hybrid\u00ad ization induced agglomeration reactions using diluted syn\u00ad thetic identical in sequence to the sequences from the five different Candida spe\u00ad cies a sodium phosphate hybridization buffer 4xSSPE (600 mM NaCl, 40 mM sodium phosphate, 4 mM EDTA). Reversibility of the agglomeration reaction was confirmed by subjecting agglomerated reactions to a 95\u00b0 C. heat denatur- ation step, conducting a T2 measurement, and repeat hybrid\u00ad ization at 60\u00b0 C. followed by a second T2 measurement. [0671] PCR Primer and Nanoparticle Capture Probe Design [0672] Universal Pan Candida PCR designed complementary to 5.8S and 26S sequences that amplify the intervening transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of the Candida genome. A pair of oligonucleotide capture probes was designed complementary to nested sequences at the 5' and 3' end respectively of the asymmetrically amplified PCR product. The capture probe that hybridizes to the 5' end of the amplicon was 3' aminated while the capture probe that hybridizes to the 3' end of the amplicon was 5' aminated. A poly-T linker (n=9 to 24) is added between the amino group and the first nucleotide base of the capture probe sequence. HPLC purified PCR primers and capture probes were pro\u00ad cured from IDT Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). [0673] Inhibition Control Design [0674] A PCR was designed to co-am- plify with the Candida species and monitor factors within the whole blood specimens that inhibit PCR amplification. A synthetic template was designed to contain 30 nucleotide flanking sequences identical in sequence to the 5.8S and 26S regions of the Candida rRNA operon. The internal sequence within this template consists of a randomly scrambled C albicans amplicon. Capture probes were designed comple\u00ad mentary to the strand amplified in excess within the asym\u00ad metric Candida PCR reactions. Synthetic oligonucleotide ultramers were procured from IDT (Coralville, Iowa) identi\u00ad cal in sequence to the inhibition control. The oligonucleotides were annealed at a concentration of 5 pM in 2xSSC and cloned into Hindlll/EcoRV digested pBR322 (NEB, Ipswich, Mass.) using standard methods. Transformation was con\u00ad ducted via electroporation of I pL of the ligation reaction into electrocompetant E. coli Kl 2 cells and the transformants were plated onto Luria (LB) agar plates containing 100 |rg/mL ampicillin. Two ampicillin resistant colonies were selected and cultivated in 2 mL LB ampicillin media. Plasmid mini-preps were conducted followed by restriction enzyme mapping to confirm the clones contained the correct insert. Sanger dideoxy sequencing was then conducted (SeqWright,Houston, Tex.) to confirm successful cloning of the control and DNA maxi-preps were conducted on correct insert bear\u00ad ing clones. Titrations of the inhibition control in the presence of increasing concentrations of all 5 species of Candida were conducted to determine the lowest concentration of inhibition control that could be reproducibly detected. Confirmation of the function of the inhibition control was demonstrated by conducting PCR reactions in the presence of titrations of known PCR interferents (SDS, heparin, ethanol) and demon\u00ad that amplification the control was inhibited. [0675] Cultivation and C. krusei, tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis laboratory reference strains (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) used to prepare the in-vitro spiked whole blood specimens. Yeasts were cultivated on yeast peptone dextrose agar plates (YPD) and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. were selected and suspended in phos\u00ad phate buffered saline (PBS). The species were verified via ITS2 sequencing at Accugenix (Newark, Del.). The cells were then subjected to a low speed centrifugation (3000 g for 2 minutes) and washed three times with fresh PBS. An aliquot of the PBS washed cells was then diluted in ISOTON II diluent (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.) within a 20 mL Accu- vette and cells were quantified on a Multisizer 4 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.) following the manu\u00ad facturers instruction. Cells were then serially diluted to con\u00ad centrations ranging from 500 to 5 cells/100 pL PBS buffer. Fresh human healthy donor blood drawn by sterile collection in K2EDTA vacutainer tubes (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) was obtained from ProMedX. Typically five milliliters of human blood was spiked with 100 mL of quan\u00ad tified Candida cells. Whole blood spiked samples are then used immediately in the assay. [0677] Whole Blood PCR [0678] Erythrocyte lysis was conducted within I mL of the whole blood sample using previously described methods (see Bramley et ah, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta Acta., 2:178 (1973)), a low speed centrifugation is then conducted and the supernatant was removed and dis\u00ad carded. One hundred uL of Tris EDTA (TE) buffer pH 8.0 containing 1500 copies of the inhibition control was then added to the harvested pellets and the suspension was sub\u00ad jected to mechanical lysis (see Garveret 28:66 (1974)). Fifty pL of lysate was then added to 50 pL of an asymmetric PCR master mix containing a deoxynucleotides, PCR primers and a whole blood compatible thermophilic DNA polymerase (T2 Biosystems, Lexington, Mass.). Ther\u00ad mocycling was conducted using the following cycle param\u00ad eters: heat denaturation at 95\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes, 40 cycles consisting of a 30 second 95\u00b0 C. heat denaturation step, a 20 second 62\u00b0 C. annealing step, and a 30 second 68\u00b0 C. elon\u00ad gation step, and a final extension at 68\u00b0 C. for 10 minutes. [0679] Hybridization Induced Agglomeration Assays Fifteen microliters of the resulting amplification reaction was aliquoted into 0.2 mL thin walled PCR tubes and incubated within a sodium phosphate hybridization buffer (4xSSPE) with pairs of oligonucleotide derivatized nanopar\u00ad ticles at a final iron concentration of 0.2 mM iron per reaction. Hybridization reactions were incubated for 3 minutes at 95\u00b0 US 2013/0260367 A l 84Oct. 3, 2013 C. followed by 30 minutes incubation at 60\u00b0 C. within a shaking incubator set at an agitation speed of 1000 rpm (Vor- temp, LabNet International). Hybridized samples are then placed in a 37\u00b0 C. heating blockto equilibrate the temperature to that of the MR reader for 3 minutes. Each sample is then subjected to a 5 second vortexing step (3000 rpm) and inserted into the MR reader for T2 measurement. [0681] Candida Patient Sample Collection Protocol. [0682] Blood specimen discards that had been drawn in K2EDTA vacutainers (BD) on the same day as specimens drawn for blood culture (T=O) were obtained from the clinical hematology laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) or Houston University Hospital. Specimens were collected and catalogued from patients having blood culture positive results. Samples were stored within the original vacutainer at -80\u00b0 C. and the blinded specimen collection was shipped overnight on dry ice to T2 Biosystems. Clinical sample collection protocols were reviewed by the appropriate Human Research Committees. [0683] Statistical Analyses [0684] For each species, the limit of detection was deter\u00ad mined with the use of probit modeling. For each species, the 90% level of detection and 95% fiducial intervals were cal\u00ad culated. Each raw T2 signal was transformed as T2 msec over the assay's background. SAS v. 9.1.3 (Cary, N.C.) was used in the statistical calculations for the analyses for limit of detec\u00ad tion, agreement of spiked specimens with culture, sensitivity and specificity in clinical specimens, and serial assays to measure Candida clearance. [0685] Agreement of T2 MR Detection of Candida with Blood Culture [0686] The current gold standard for Candida diagnosis is blood culture. In vitro spiked healthy donor whole blood specimens were prepared using laboratory reference strains for C albicans and C krusei and clinical isolates of C albi\u00ad cans at concentrations of 0, 33, and 100 cells/mL. spiked specimens evaluated by T2MR. Blood culture vials inoculated with Candida cells were blood culture posi\u00ad tive by day 8 in all cases. In total, 133 blood culture bottles were inoculated with 90 Candida spiked blood samples (in\u00ad oculum of 33 cells/mL) or 43 negative blood samples. Ninety eight percent positive agreement and 100% negative agree\u00ad ment was observed between T2MR and blood culture. [0687] Clinical Specimen Data [0688] K2 EDTA whole blood patient specimens were obtained to test the clinical performance of the T2MR Can\u00ad dida assay. The patients presented with symptoms of septice\u00ad mia and blood was drawn for culture. Blood sample retains were stored at 4\u00b0 C. in the hematology lab and selected for T2MR if the outcome was blood culture positive for Candida, blood culture positive for bacteremia, or blood culture nega\u00ad tive to better represent the spectrum of samples that would be run on the platform. Fourteen of the samples were from can- didemic patients, eight were from bacteremic patients, and ten were from blood-culture negative patients. FIG. 57 shows the measured T2 values for all 32 patient samples. A single PCR reaction was conducted using I mL of each specimen. 750 copies of the internal inhibition control were added to each PCR reaction. Among Candida negative samples the average internal control (IC) signal was 279 ms with a CV across the 18 Candida negative specimens of 25%. In no cases was the IC signal below the decision threshold (128 ms,5 standard deviations added to the mean T2 measured in Candida negative detection reactions) suggesting that all negatives were true negatives and no inhibitory substances were present with the whole blood samples. The detection reactions were multiplexed based on IDSA guidelines, such that three results were reported as follows: C albicans or C tropicalis positive; C krusei or glabrata positive; and C positive. The average T2 measured in the Can\u00ad dida negative specimens is 114 ms, the CV for these mea\u00ad surements was 2.4%, and the decision threshold (calculated by addition of five times the standard deviation measured in the Candida negative detection reactions plus the mean T2 measured in Candida negative specimens) was 128 ms. In specimens positive for Candida, the IC signal was suppressed due to competition for the amplification reagents. In instances of high C albicans, some cross-reactivity was observed for detection with the C parapsilosis particles (e.g. patient sample #3) however this signal is not significantly above the cut-off (20 ms) and does not lead to a difference in antifungal therapy as both C albicans and C parapsilosis are suscep\u00ad tible to fluconazole. [0689] successfully identified samples of C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, or C. krusei which were con\u00ad firmed positive by blood culture followed by the Vitek 2 biochemical card. Furthermore, the detection was specific for Candida spp. as bacteremic patient samples with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase or alpha hemolytic Streptococcus remained negative. [0690] Serially drawn samples were tested from two patients who exhibited symptoms suggestive of candidemia, such as persistent fever after receiving antibiotics to demon\u00ad strate the assay's utility in monitoring Candida clearance. Blood draws for T2MR occurred the same day as blood draws for blood culture. Surveillance cultures were then drawn over a course of nine days for Patient A and over a course of five days for Patient B. FIG. 3 shows the results obtained with the T2MR method for both patients. Patient A had blood drawn for culture (t=0), was diagnosed with candidemia and admin\u00ad istered intravenous micafungin (C. glabrata) the following day via blood culture (t=l). Whole blood specimens were tested with T2MR at t=0 days, t=3 days, t=7 days, t=8 days, t=9 days. The T2MR values obtained were 320 ms at t=0,467 ms at t=3, 284 ms at t=7, 245 ms at t=8, and 117 ms (below cut-off) fort=9. Subsequentbloodculturedraws on day 3 and day 8 took 24 and 48 hours to culture positive, respectively. A series of serially drawn specimens were obtained from Patient B. C albicans was correctly detected with T2MR on day 0 (T2=426 ms). Blood culture came up positive on day 2 with subsequent C albicans identification. One day after the patient was administered micafungin, a sharp decrease in C albicans T2MR was evident (T2=l 69 ms) and three or more days after antifungal treatment was initiated no detectable C albicans was observed. All tests were completed in a total processing time of two hours, using a fast block PCR ther\u00ad mocycler and three step thermocycling procedure that was not optimized for speed. [0691] Conclusions [0692] We have developed and validated a whole blood T2MR Candida assay capable of detecting five clinically important species of Candida that leverages the advantages of non-optical detection to eliminate analyte purification, thus enabling enable more rapid turn-around times and more reproducible results. Asymmetric PCR was used to specifi\u00ad US 2013/0260367 A l 85Oct. 3, 2013 cally amplify the ITS2 region of the Candida genome directly in whole blood to achieve clinically relevant detection sensi\u00ad tivities. A T2 detection method was developed in which two pools of oligonucleotide derivatized nanoparticles hybridize to each end of the single stranded amplicon. The amplicons thus serve as interparticle tethers and induce nanoparticle agglomeration which yields a measurable and reproducible change in the spin-spin relaxometry (T2) of the protons in water molecules. We further constructed and implemented an internal inhibition control to monitor for PCR inhibitors that may be present in the patient samples. [0693] The assay was evaluated using reference strains and clinical isolates quantified by Coulter Counter and spiked into healthy donor whole blood. Assay repeatability was mea\u00ad sured using C. albicans spiked blood (same sample, same operator, same instrument) over the course of 10 days and we observe CV's less than 12.8% (n=30) over the entire dynamic response range (0 to 1E5 cells/mL). The analytical sensitivity and limit of detection of <10 cells/mL were measured for C albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis and >10 with 92.5% detected at 10 cells/mL for C. glabrata. Although not proven, a possible cause of the higher LoD observed in C. glabrata may be that the rDNA operon copy number is reduced in C. glabrata as compared to the other queried Candida spp since it is known that C. glabrata exists in nature as a haploid while the other Candida species are diploids. Agreement with the gold standard for Candida diag\u00ad nosis was high with 98% positive and 100% negative agree\u00ad ment observed for 133 in vitro spiked C. albicans and C krusei samples. It should be noted that the time to result was 2 hours for the T2 Candida test while the time to blood culture positivity was typically 2 days for C. albicans and - I day (18-24 hours) for Candida krusei. [0694] The 32 clinical specimens are similar to blood cul\u00ad ture results. The measured T2 was above a cut-off established at five standard deviations of the T2 values measured in the Candida negative specimens added to their mean. In this case the threshold was 128 ms (n=54). In no cases did we observe inhibition of the PCR reaction, as the internal control was detected within all 32 reactions with a reduced IC signal observed in Candida positive patients and a CV of 25% (mean T2 of279 ms) across the Candida negative specimens (n=18). The assay is highly specific for Candida detection as no cross-reactivity was observed with any of the bacteremic specimens (n=8). Candida positive specimens were accu\u00ad rately identified, the causative Candida spp. was accurately identified, and all within a time to answer of 2 hours. [0695] The potential for this assay to provide a rapid detec\u00ad tion of Candida clearance after administration of antifungal therapy was also demonstrated. Two sets of patient samples were drawn and subjected to T2MR (FIG. 3). Moderate to high T2 signals for C glabrata were observed in patient A at day 0 and day 3 with antifungal agents administered at day I . A decrease in C glabrata signal was observed over subse\u00ad quent days with none detectable after eight days of anti\u00ad fungal treatment. A strong C albicans signal was measured for patient B at day 0, and a sharp decline (delta T2of306ms) in T2 signal was observed one day after antifungal adminis\u00ad tration with none detectable after two days of anti-fungal treatment. Although preliminary, this data suggests the test could be used to monitor treatment effectiveness and Candida clearance in a real-time fashion. [0696] In conclusion, we have developed a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of candidemia caused by the fivemost commonly encountered Candida species. Early clinical results were encouraging and show that rapid diagnosis and species identification is achievable and could not only facili\u00ad tate early treatment with the appropriate antifungal but also provide a means to monitor Candida clearance. We anticipate that this nanoparticle-based T2MR method can be broadly applied to infectious disease diagnoses in a variety of speci\u00ad men types and pathogens. Example 23 Tacrolimus Assay Utilizing [0697] The tacrolimus is a homogeneous competitive immunoassay performed using an EDTA whole blood sample extracted to release tacrolimus from the red blood cells and binding proteins. A key component of the assay is a high affinity tacrolimus antibody, a reliable extraction method, and improvement of the buffer systems selected to promote spe\u00ad cific aggregation and minimize non-specific aggregation. This version of the assay utilizes a recombinant monovalent Fab with high affinity for tacrolimus. [0698] The tacrolimus assay was assessed using whole blood calibrators, commercial whole blood controls, spiked samples and patient samples. [0699] Assay reagents included: (a) BSA, and monovalent Fab antibody and blocked with mPEG-thiol+NEM (particle is diluted to 0.2 mM Fe in assay buffer); (b) C22 modified tacrolimus conju\u00ad gated tacrolimus to BSA input of 10:1 (diluted to 600 ng/ml in assay buffer); (c) Tween 80, (d) extraction ZnS04 in dH20. [0700] blood calibrators were prepared mg/ml Sigma FK506 Stock in 100% MeOH. EDTA whole blood was spiked at varying levels with the tacrolimus solu\u00ad tion. The spiked blood was incubated at 37\u00b0 C. with gentle mixing and then stored overnight at 4\u00b0 C. prior to aliquoting and freezing. Target levels were 0, 1,2, 5,10,20, 50,100, and 250 ng/ml of tacrolimus. The calibrators were provided to an external lab for value assignment by the Architect Tacrolimus assay. The samples were assayed by mass spectroscopy. Results show a correlation of 0.9998 for theoretical versus actual value assignment Quality controls consisted of 3 levels of UTAK Immunosuppressant Matrix Controls. Patient samples were obtained from transplant patients on tacrolimus therapy. [0701] The testing protocol was as follows: [0702] (i) Allow all samples, calibrators, QC and reagents to equilibrate to room temperature, mix by gentle inversion. [0703] (ii) Pipette 200 pL of sample, calibrator, or QC material into a 1.5 mL micro fuge tube. Add 200 uL of extrac\u00ad tion reagent and vortex for 30 secs. Allow the sample to incubate for 2 minutes at room temperature, and centrifuge for 5 minutes at 10,000 rpm. Transfer the clean supernatant to a clean tube and prepare a 2.5x dilution using assay buffer. [0704] (iii) pipette 10 pL of the diluted extract and 10 pL of diluted particle into the reaction tube, vortex mix and incubate for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Pipette 20 pL of BSA-tac conjugate into the reaction tube, vortex mix and incubate for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Perform gMAA for 6 cycles (12 min.). Vortex mix, incubate for 5 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. and read in the T2 reader at 37\u00b0 C. US 2013/0260367 A l 86Oct. 3, 2013 [0705] Calibrators were tested in triplicate for each test run (6 total runs). Individual run data were fit with a 5PL model using GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows, version 5.02, Graph- Pad Software, San Diego Calif. USA. The 0 calibrator was entered as 0.01 ng/ml and used in the curve model. The resulting calibration curves (Run Calibration) were used to back-calculate the tacrolimus concentration for all calibra\u00ad tors, whole blood spikes, QC and patient samples contained in the run. [0706] In addition, a Master Calibration curve was obtained by fitting data across the entire 3-day study (n=18) for each calibrator. All samples were back-calculated using the Master Curve and the resulting tacrolimus levels compared to those obtained using the Run Calibration. [0707] Areproducibilitypanel consisting of 13 members (9 calibrators, 3 controls and I spiked whole blood sample) was tested in triplicate for 3 days with 2 runs per day for a total of 18 replicates. Calibrators were stored at -80\u00b0 C. while the controls and whole blood spike were stored at 4-8\u00b0 C. for the duration of the study. [0708] Sample concentrations were predicted using the run calibration curve, as well as the master curve in GraphPrism. Within-run, within-day, day-to-day and total precision were calculated by ANOVA using MiniTab 15. [0709] Data predicted using the Run Calibration method total imprecision <25% [0710] Analytical sensitivity was calculated by the 2SD method. The standard deviation of 18 replicates of the 0 calibrator was determined. The tacrolimus level at the maxi\u00ad mum T2 (top asymptote of the curve fit)\u20142SD was then calculated and the concentration predicted using the Master Calibration Curve. Analytical sensitivity is 0.8 ng/ml. [0711] During tacrolimus antibody development and screening, antibody specificity was evaluated against five tacrolimus metabolites. ELISA inhibition was performed with each of the 5 metabolites and compared to free tacroli\u00ad mus for five affinity matured clones and seven clones with additional affinity maturation by cross-cloning. Data for two of the cross-clones and a state-of-the-art murine monoclonal RUO antibody are shown below. The only cross-reactivity observed was slight reactivity to the 15-O-desmethyl metabo\u00ad lite. A summary of tacrolimus below. Requirement Results 85-115% recovery Analytical Sensitivity (2SD) 8 ng/ml Precision @ 2 8 ng/ml 22% CV @ 6 ng/ml 4% CV Time to result 56 minutes Specimen type Whole Blood Pre-treatment Solvent-based extraction process demonstrated using functionality planned on instrument Sample volume 200 jiLExample 24 Preparation of Nanoparticles for Detection of Nucleic Acid Analytes [0713] Preparation of single probe particles: 800 nm car- boxylated iron oxide superparamagnetic particles, consisting of numerous iron oxide nanocrystals embedded in a polymer matrix including a total particle diameter of 800 nm (see Demas et ah, New J. Phys. 13:1 (2011)) were washed using a magnetic rack prior to use. The magnetic particles were resusupended in 66 pL of nuclease-free water, 20 pL of 250 mM MES buffer pH 6, and 4 pL of animated probe (obtained from IDT), at I mM concentration per mg of particle to be prepared. A 3' aminated probe particle and a 5' aminated probe particle were prepared (e.g., the probe for C parapsi- losis). The probe was added to the particle and the suspension was vortexed using a vortexer equipped with a foam holder to hold the tube. The vortexer was set to a speed that keeps the particles well-suspended without any splashing. N-ethyl-N'- (3-dimethy laminopropy I) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was then dissolved in water and immediately added to the vortexing particle-probe mixture. The tube was then closed and incubated with rotation in an incubator at 37\u00b0 C. for 2 hours. The tube was then placed in a magnetic rack and the reaction fluid was removed. The particles were washed with a series of washes (125 pL/mg particle) as follows: water, water, 0.1M imidazole, pH 6.0 with a 5 minute incu\u00ad bation with rotation at 37\u00b0 C., water, 0.1 M sodium bicarbon\u00ad ate, pH 8.0 with a 5 minute incubation with rotation at 37\u00b0 C. water. The particles were then subjected to a I hour heat- stress at 60-65\u00b0 C. in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.0 with rotation. After the heat-stress, the bicarbonate was removed by placing the tube in a magnetic rack. The particles were then resuspended in the storage buffer (Tris-EDTA, 0.1% tween 20) and vortexed. The storage buffer was removed and a final 100 pi of storage buffer was added to the particle preparation. The particles were stored at 2-8\u00b0 C., qualified using an iron test to determine the iron concentration of the particles, and tested against target nucleic acid (e.g., C paraplsilosis ITS2 oligo titration). In sodium azide as a pre\u00ad Preparation of dual probe particles: For the prepa\u00ad ration of a dual probe particle, the procedure is the same as above, except that equal volumes of a second probe (e.g., 3' aminated C albicans) and the first probe (e.g., 3' aminated C tropicalis) were mixed prior to addition to the magnetic par\u00ad ticles. Similarly, equal volumes of the 5' aminated probes were mixed prior to addition to the magnetic particles. Example 25 Candida Assay Improvements [0715] The limit of detection for the Candida assay of Example 22 was improved by washing the pellet. 2.0 mL of whole blood was combined with 100 pL of TRAX erythro\u00ad cyte lysis buffer 4-octylphenol polyethoxylate (Triton-X 100)) for about 5 minutes. The sample was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 6000 g and the resulting supernatant was removed and discarded. To wash the pellet, the pellet was mixed with 200 pL of Tris EDTA (TE) buffer pH 8.0 and subjected to vortexing. The sample US 2013/0260367 A l 87Oct. 3, 2013 was again centrifuged for 5 minutes at 6000 g and the result\u00ad ing supernatant was removed and discarded. Following the wash step the pellet was mixed with 100 pL TE buffer and subjected to bead beating (e.g., such as with 0.5 mm glass beads, 0.1 mm silica beads, 0.7 mm silica beads, or a mixture of differently sized beads) with vigorous agitation. The sample was again centrifuged. Fifty pL of the resulting lysate was then added to 50 pL of an asymmetric PCR master mix containing a deoxynucleotides, PCR primers and whole blood compatible thermophilic tems, Lexington, Mass.). Thermocycling and hybridization induced agglomeration assays were conducted as described in Example 22 to produce T2 values characteristic of the presence of Candida in the blood sample. The assay can produce (i) a coefficient of variation in the T2 value of less than 20% on Candida positive samples; (ii) at least 95% correct detection at less than or equal to 5 cells/mL in samples spiked into 50 individual healthy patient blood samples; (iii) at least 95% correct detection less than or equal to 5 cells/mL in samples spiked into 50 individual unhealthy patient blood samples; and/or (iv) greater than or equal to 80% correct detection in clinically positive patient samples (Te., Candida positive by another technique, such as by cell culture) starting with 2 mL of blood.[0716] This application claims priority to U.S. application Ser.
