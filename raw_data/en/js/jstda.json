Previous studies have correlated early administration with higher compliance with the recommended 2-dose regimen for previously unvaccinated young children. Objectives: To prospectively capture data on influenza vaccination practices and behaviors in U.S. pediatric practices. Methods: Data describing influenza vaccination practices was collected from 42 US outpatient pediatric practices during the 2007-2008 influenza season and 98 practices during the 2008-2009 season. Influenza vaccinations were tracked every half-month interval for children based on age, participation in Vaccines for Children (VFC), and first or second vaccination. Results: During the 2007-08 season, 42,252 children were vaccinated, 11,239 (27%) of whom received VFC vaccine. Administration of VFC vaccine began approximately 1 month following commercial vaccine, but both VFC and non-VFC vaccinations declined similarly from early November forward. Compliance with the 2-dose regimen was lower in VFC vs. non-VFC children (39% vs. 48%); the greatest difference was in children 24-59 months (30% vs. 45%). Vaccination coverage for VFC vs. non-VFC children could not be calculated, as the total number of children eligible for VFC could not be accurately estimated. During the 2008-2009 season, administration of VFC vaccine was also delayed; data on 2-dose compliance will become available as the season progresses. Conclusions: In the fall of 2007 and 2008, administration of VFC influenza vaccines was delayed relative to commercial vaccines. Children receiving VFC vaccine had lower compliance rates with the recommended 2-dose regimen, possibly resulting from the delay in administration. "}
