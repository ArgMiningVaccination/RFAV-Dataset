Although there has been equivalence in licensure and attendant privileging opportunities since then, the DO degree remains distinct through its osteopathic philosophy, application and practice of osteopathic tenets, and performance of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) [ [2](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_002)]. Whereas OMT is taught to all students in osteopathic medical schools, allopathic medical students and residents are rarely exposed to these techniques. This is a missed opportunity because MD students could, as part of their training, develop improved comfort with osteopathic philosophy and some of the medical conditions assessed and treated by OMT, as well as improved musculoskeletal physical diagnosis and pain management skills. In a previous study of 249 MD and DO students who were primarily DOs (66.3 %) and White/Caucasian (81.0 %), DO students reported being more comfortable with musculoskeletal physical examination skills compared to MDs (57.1% vs. 26.8 %), and 91.9 % thought that their education prepared them well for the musculoskeletal portion of licensing examinations (compared to 63.4 % of MD students) [ [3](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_003)]. The opportunity for shared skill sets among MDs and DOs is growing; the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) became a member of the American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 2014 [ [4](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_004)]. The creation of a single accreditation system for graduate medical education has dramatically enhanced the potential of collaborative effort. Furthermore, MDs can now participate in residency osteopathic recognition (OR) programs. Many DOs believe that OMT education for MDs can help increase awareness of and confidence in OMT knowledge and skills, and can lead to more referrals and improvement in patient care [ [5](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_005)]. In a study of 381 osteopathic and allopathic family medicine residents (60.9 % of which were MDs), 70.9 % of MD resident learners were interested in OMT [ [6](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_006)]. Exposure to OMT has been implemented in allopathic residency programs; some exposure to OMT has been reported in small program evaluations [ [7](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_007)], [ [8](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_008)], [ [9](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_009)], [ [10](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_010)]. In one such report, 9 of 16 military MD family medicine residents found the establishment of an OMT clinic to be important to their training [ [8](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_008)]. In a similar report of residents in an allopathic family medicine residency program, five DOs found the clinic helpful with integrating OMT into resident schedules, maintaining skills, and patient care [ [7](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_007)]. After a 1-month OMT elective, all five MD family medicine residents reported that the elective had access to regular teaching, precepting, and independent decision making, and that expectations and goals were reasonable and achievable [ [10](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_010)]. There is little literature related to interest in OMT among MD students prior to residency. In 2022, Ellson and colleagues reported on the challenges of creating a curriculum for premedical students by comparing in-person to virtual educational delivery platforms for a seminar series to increase appreciation for osteopathic medicine [ [11](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_011)]. In the post-session analysis, 52 students from the first session and 61 students from the second session provided feedback on preferences, with neither in-person nor virtual being effective in increasing the understanding of osteopathic medicine [ [11](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_011)]. The aim of this survey study was to assess awareness of, and interest in learning, OMT among the students at an allopathic medical school. Among those interested, we also assessed preferred mode of content delivery (hands on lab, clinical rotation, etc.). We hypothesized that MD students would be both aware of and interested in OMT. We also hypothesized that interest and awareness of OMT in MD medical students at our institution would be associated with prior exposure to OMT or DO physicians, prior application or interview at an osteopathic medical school, and interest in a career in primary care. Methods This study was reviewed and approved by the Penn State College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (STUDY#11809) and determined to be exempt. All participants in this study read a summary explanation of research prior to participation in the survey. Completion of the survey implied voluntary consent to participate in the research and approval of their information to be utilized and shared in publication. As an incentive, respondents were given the opportunity to enter a random drawing for one of five $25 gift cards. The study was unfunded, and trial registry was not applicable. Design The authors (A.D., T.O., and J.P.), assisted by a survey design expert (see Acknowledgements), designed the survey tool utilizing an iterative approach. Survey items were reviewed with the entire study team and pilot-tested with eight medical students who provided verbal feedback during a 1-h focus group to refine the survey. Population The inclusion criteria included all medical students (approximately 600 students) at the two campuses of the institution. Measure The 15-item survey took approximately 5 min to complete ( [Table 1](#j_jom-2022-0232_tab_001)). A definition of OMT was provided after the questions about OMT awareness (after Item 10). This was intentional because giving the definition prior to the awareness questions may have influenced their answer choices. However, giving students the definition of OMT prior to the questions about interest ensured a common understanding of the term to improve the accuracy of responses. Educational demographics included year in medical school, intention to go into a primary care specialty, and if they were on the MD/PhD pathway. |Survey question||Response options| |1.

Procedures The survey was available from July 24, 2019 to August 24, 2019. Students were invited to take the survey via email containing the link to the online survey hosted in REDCap [ [12](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_012)]. Information and invitation to the survey were also posted to a private social media (Facebook) group, where our institution's medical students can post and share information. A summary of the study was provided prior to taking the survey. One reminder email was sent after 2 weeks. Analysis Data analysis was performed by AB utilizing the R statistical program [ [13](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_013)] version 2.2 and summary package [ [14](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_014)] (version 1.7.0), and included descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and nonparametric tests for the ordinal and continuous variables. Awareness of OMT (aware and not aware) was defined as having \"heard\" and \"read\" about OMT. Interest in learning OMT (not interested, somewhat interested, and very interested) was defined as: interest in learning new tools to diagnose and treat musculoskeletal pain conditions, referring to a qualified provider for OMT, developing competency in performing OMT, and participating in a 2-week elective in OMT. Results The survey was distributed to all 600 medical students: 174 first-year, 172 second-year, 170 third-year, and 84 fourth-year students. The fourth-year medical student class was smaller because one site did not yet include a fourth-year class at the time of survey distribution. A total of 313 students responded to the survey (response rate, 52.1 %). A total of 296 (49.3 %) surveys were included in the final analysis (17 surveys were excluded due to incomplete responses; [Table 2](#j_jom-2022-0232_tab_002)). The largest response was from the first-year class (90, 30.4 %), followed by the second- (72, 24.3 %), third- (60, 20.3 %) and fourth-year classes (57, 19.2 %). |n, %| | Year ||12 (4.1) | | Intention to go into a primary care specialty || | |Yes||72 (24.3)| |No||132 (44.6)| Regarding awareness, 92 (31.1 %) participants previously read or heard about OMT. Of those that were aware of OMT, 44 (40.7 %) reported being very interested in developing competency in performing OMT, compared to those who were not aware of OMT (64 [59.3 %]; p=0.03). When assessing interest in learning new modalities to help diagnose and treat musculoskeletal pain ( [Table 3](#j_jom-2022-0232_tab_003)), the majority of participants who were very interested: (1) had previous exposure to OMT (85 [59.9 %]), compared to participants without previous exposure, the majority of whom were only somewhat interested (69 [48.6 %], p=0.02); (2) had a friend or family member treated by a DO physician (42 [71.2 %]), compared to those who did not (76 [46.1 %]) or were unsure (32 [50.0 %], p=0.008); (3) were pursuing a primary care specialty (43 [60.6 %]), compared to those who were not (60 [46.2 %]) or were unsure (45 [55.6 %], p=0.02), and interviewed at an osteopathic medical school (47 [62.7 %]) compared to participants who did not interview (103 %], p=0.01). |Variable, n=150 |p-Valuea| |Interest in learning new modalities to help diagnose and treat musculoskeletal pain| | | |Observed OMT in a friend or family member treated by a DO a primary care specialty (Family and Community Medicine, Internal Medicine, or Pediatrics)| competency in performing OMT| | | |Pursuing a primary care specialty (Family and Community Medicine, Internal Medicine, or Pediatrics)| utilized to compare group differences. OMT, osteopathic manipulative treatment. When assessing interest in developing competency in performing OMT ( [Table 3](#j_jom-2022-0232_tab_003)), the majority of participants who were very interested: (1) were pursuing a primary care specialty (36 [51.4 %]), compared to those who were not (39 [30.0 %] or were unsure (33 [41.2 %], p=0.01); (2) applied to osteopathic medical schools (47 [54.0 %]), compared to those who did not (63 [31.7 %], p=0.002); and (3) interviewed at an osteopathic medical school (42 [56.8 %]), compared to those who did not (68 [32.1 %], p=0.001). There was a clear interest in learning OMT through a designated curriculum, with 230 respondents (82.1 %) being somewhat or very interested in a 2-week elective course. Hands-on labs were the most popular didactic modality, with 272 (94.1 %) participants being somewhat or very interested, followed by clinical rotation (237, 82.0 %), lectures (172, 59.5 %), and web-based learning (113, 39.1 %) ( [Figure 1](#j_jom-2022-0232_fig_001)). Discussion This study found that approximately one-third of MD students at our institution are aware of OMT, but the majority reports interest in learning about OMT, including taking a 2-week elective course in OMT. Students are more likely to be interested in learning OMT if they have had previous exposure to OMT, have a friend or family member with previous exposure to a DO physician, are pursuing a primary care medical field, or have interviewed at an osteopathic medical school. This study assessing osteopathic interest among MD students is unique; previous studies have surveyed DO students [ [3](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_003)], or DO and MD residents [ [7](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_007)], [ [8](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_008)], [ [9](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_009)], [ [10](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_010)]. Similar to MD family medicine residents [ [7](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_007)], [ [8](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_008)], [ [9](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_009)], [ [10](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_010)], our MD students also expressed interest in OMT education. Our study also reported a strong preference for OMT delivery through hands-on labs, with online learning being the least preferred. The strengths of this survey include a high response rate [ [15](#j_jom-2022-0232_ref_015)] as well as good representation across all years of medical students. The main limitation is its survey of students in a single medical school, limiting generalizability. However, as a large academic medical center, our institution may share characteristics with similar institutions. The current project suggests that other institutions may benefit from conducting their own survey. Another limitation is that we did not provide unique links to students; therefore, we could not track whether a student took a survey more than once. MD students who had applied to DO schools may be better informed regarding osteopathic medicine, therefore the responses regarding osteopathic interest potentially may have been affected by this subset of students who had applied to osteopathic schools prior to MD school matriculation. MD students at our institution reported interest in learning osteopathic principles and techniques, which serves as a rationale for residency programs to pursue osteopathic recognition (OR). Any residency program considering pursuit of OR would likely find the results of this study pertinent to their MD residents. While our program was limited to a 2-week rotation per institution allotment, other medical institutions may benefit from a longer timeline, which can increase interest and exposure to OMT training. The authors do not currently have plans to expand on this study; rather, it has encouraged and informed the design of an introductory 2-week OMT elective curriculum for MD students. Conclusions At a mid-Atlantic allopathic academic medical center, we found evidence of low exposure but high interest in learning about osteopathic medicine and OMT among medical students. The project has encouraged and informed the design of an introductory 2-week OMT elective curriculum for MD students. These data may inform OMT-related policy or coursework at other allopathic medical schools.
