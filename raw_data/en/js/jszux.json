From its founding in 1965, the University of Southern Indiana has been an institution \"of the people, by the people\" as expressed on its University seal. Born of need, fueled by community investment, and sustained by alumni success, th e University has been a model for student- centered postsecondary education, delivering, as its founders promised, high-quality teaching at the most affordable cost among baccalaureate granting institutions in Indiana. The University was founded to bring higher educat ion to an underserved population in southwest Indiana and remains true to that mission. Students who choose the University of Southern Indiana find high-quality academic programs, affordable costs, an environment that promotes academic success, and opportunities for personal and career growth. It is not a coincidence that USI's dram atic development parallels the economic expansion of southwestern Indiana. USI has b een boldly redefining the higher education landscape for nearly 50 years, providing affo rdability, accessibility, and compatibility with employer needs. After existing for 20 years as a regional campus, USI became the state's fifth free-standing baccalaureate-granting public university in 1985. Innovative programs initiated by the founding Board of Trustees set a course to expand educational opportunity and to overcome financial and geographic barriers to higher education. 1Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Today, 82 percent of high school graduates in the region pursue higher education\u2014a figure that compares to just 33 percent in 1985, and which is nearly 20 percent higher than today's national average. This educational transf ormation is a result of USI's commitment to expanding access to high-quality, affordable ac ademic programs and to forging partnerships that benefit students, faculty, employers, and the community and st ate. Indeed, USI's reputation for strong teaching continues to attract exceptionally qualified students from Indiana and beyond\u2014drawing students from 91 counties in Indiana, 39 states, and more than 64 countries. USI is a key asset in the e ffort to grow and sustain Indi ana's workforce. Today, more than 70 percent of USI's 35,400 graduates remain in Indiana and 81 percent of that number reside in southwest Indiana. The University's is committed to meeting the needs of employers for a well-trained workforce and the stat e for a well-educated citizenry. The University of Southe rn Indiana's 2015-2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request addresses many of the strategic goals outlined in the Indiana Commission for Higher Education's 2012 Reaching Higher, Achieving More policy paper. The University seeks full funding of the state's performance in centive formulae to support success, current programs and services, and to respond to regi onal workforce and educational needs. UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN INDIAN A'S 2010-2015 STRATEGIC PLAN The University is now in year five of its strategic planning process. Significant progress has been made on the six major goals outlined in the strategic plan. Enhance Experiential Learning Opportunities Increase the Graduation Rate Preserve and Nurture Our Campus Community Provide Leadership to Indiana and the Region Increase the Diversity of Fa culty, Staff, and Student Body Become a 24/7 campus In order to continue to increase the gr aduation rate, a new core curriculum - known as Core 39 - was designed for implementation in fall 2014. Core 39 requires fewer credit hours and is more streamlined to work with a student's major. The new requirements are designed to help better educate students and provide them with a more intuitive academic experience. In 2012, the Indiana General Assemb ly passed legislation t hat limits the number 2Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 of credit hours required to graduate from a pu blic university to 120 credit hours with some exceptions. With implementation of the new 39 hour University Core Curriculum, most academic programs will meet the 120 hour limit. In the effort to increase the graduatio n rate, USI is partnering with the Indiana Commission for Higher Education on its Guided Pathways to Student Success initiative. During the 2013-2014 academic year, USI impl emented DegreeWorks, a degree audit system that allows students wi th their academic advisors to create individualized four-year degree maps with the intent of helping students stay on trac k to graduate on time. Degree Works' user-friendly interface provides studen ts with a more easily understandable summary of their progress towards a degree. Another go al of the transition to Degree Works is to improve the effectiveness of academic advising. USI is promoting the new statewide initiative 15 to Finish , to encourage students to enroll in 15 credit hours per semester to complete a bachelor's degree in four years. As part of the 15 to Finish campaign, the University has a link on its web site to the on-line video about the program; is sponsoring a marketing booth with giveaway it ems about the program at new student orientation; and, incorporating the 15 to Finish completion requirements in student degree maps. In addition, steps are being taken to ensu re students are equipped with the skills necessary to succeed in the rapidly -growing number of courses being offered in a distance education or internet-based hybrid format. \"The focus on improving our graduation rates gets to the heart of the strategic plan,\" said President Lin da L. M. Bennett. \"Throu gh better advising, more flexible ways to earn a degree, and other re tention efforts, we will give students a better chance for academic success - and produce more graduates for our state and region. Improving student expe rience and success is evident in each of our goals.\" The University conducted an Environmen tal Scan from January 2014 through July 2014. The project had four goals: to provid e an assessment of environmental trends; to provide an assessment of USI's co mpetitive strengths; to be dat a driven from authoritative sources; and to provide a view of USI through multiple external lenses. The project involved a trend analysis and a prioritiza tion of USI's strengths. 3Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 The Environmental Scan process will provide va luable information for the next iteration of the University's Strategic Plan. STUDENTS AT USI The University of Southern Indiana is committed to improving the postsecondary attainment level of the citizens of the sout hern Indiana region and throughout the state. Enrollment in fall 2013 was 9,902 and full-time-equivalent (FTE) graduate and undergraduate students numbered 8,215. Approximately 76 perc ent of all students or 7,513 enrolled as full-time students. Students age 25 or older represent 25 percent of the student population. With 47.4 percent of students enrolled in fall 2013 coming from its primary service area, the University is clearly committed to serv ing students in the regi on. In fall 2013, 59.3 percent of USI's students came from the 11-county regional service area and 25.1 percent came from other Indiana counties. The Univ ersity of Southern Indiana is committed to improving the postsecondary attainment level of the citizens of the southern Indiana region and throughout the state. Indiana Commission for Higher Education's 2012 Reaching Higher, Achieving More document states \"at least a quarter of all first-time Indiana public college students are not college-ready when they arrive on campus.\" Readiness for college is usually measured in terms of standardized test scores, placement tests, and grade point averages, but it includes other indicators as well. Indiana's Core 40 requirements for high sch ool graduates are intended as a statewide effort to strengthen student pr eparation for college. USI acce pts unconditionally any student who has met the Core 40 requirements and has a high school grade point average of at least 2.5 and the appropriate ACT/SAT scores. Among USI's 1,688 first-time, full-time freshmen from Indiana in fall 2013, nearly 42 percent completed the Core 40 diploma and 47 percent completed the Academic Honors Diploma. Near ly 31 percent of the new full-time freshmen were in the top 25 percent of their high school classes. The Center for Education Services and Part nerships is charged with coordinating a wide variety of educational services and prom oting partnerships between the University and P- 12 organizations in the region. The focus is to pull together University resources to support greater involvement in P -12 education; the goals are improved teaching and learning 4Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 throughout the region, expanded professional development opportunities for teachers, and increased learning opportunities for pre -college students. USI offers a range of dual credit opportunit ies. USI's concurrent enrollment program, the College Achievement Program (CAP), has been in existence since 1985. CAP has evolved in a deliberate manner to ensure sou nd partnerships with participating high schools and quality control of instructio n and curricula at the department level. University resources to support the program have increased to supp ort growing interest. CAP offers mostly introductory survey courses that are part of th e University's general education curriculum to high school juniors and seniors. Forty-one cour ses, a total of 209 sections, were offered at 29 high schools taught by 123 approved high school instructors during the 2013-2014 academic year. Approximately 1,931 students enrolled in one or more courses, generating 10,927 credit hours. Student enrollment increa sed by 12 percent and credit hours increased by 16 percent from 2011-2012 to 2012-2013. USI's CAP program received re- accreditation from the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (NACEP) in 2013. This recognition indicates the high qu ality of the CAP program delivered by the University. USI is one of only seven instit utions in Indiana and one of 92 institutions nationwide to have attained this accreditation. The impact of dual credit to on-time de gree is significant. In 2012-2013, 59 percent of the students who entered college with prior credit graduated in four years or less 5Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 compared to 28 percent with no prior credit. The University of Southern Indiana has been a leader in developing the College Achievement Program (CAP) and partnering with participating high schools. During the ten-year period 2004 to 2014, the number of degrees conferred by the University of Southern Indiana has risen ov er 40.5 percent, from 1,479 in 2004 to an estimated 2,078 in 2014. Important to the state and to the region is the number of students who graduate from the University of Southern Indiana and choose to stay in Indiana. Of the University's more than 35,400 alumni, 71 percent live in Indiana and, of that number, 81 percent reside in southwest Indiana. The University of Southern Indiana works closely with regional employers in designing and teaching courses to assure that highly skilled graduates meet their needs. The close relationship with area employers and employers' confidence in USI graduates help meet an important goal of the state retaining college graduates in the state. Several factors contribute to USI's success in graduate retention. The University has a strong internship and cooperative education program that places students in employer settings, allowing the students to gain experience and the employer to assess the students' sk ills and work ethic. Many of these experiences lead to full- time employment after graduation. At USI, students receive a combinatio n of academic instruction and real-world experiences that builds their confidence and enhances their effectiveness for employers. 02505007501,0001,2501,5001,7502,0002,2501,4791,604 1,5601,6871,6471,702 1,736 1,7281,8752,046 2,078USI DEGREES CONFERRED ACADEMIC YEAR 2003 -2004 THROUGH 2013-2014 6Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Many students, due to family and work resp onsibilities, often must \"stop out\" or interrupt college attendance for extended periods of time. With each interruption the chances increase that the student will not return to complete a college degree. In fall 2013, re- admitted students or individuals who re-enrolle d at USI after previously discontinuing their studies for various reasons for one or more ac ademic terms were over four percent of the student population. Older, part-time, empl oyed, and/or married students tend to not progress or graduate at rates comparable to traditional-aged students. To meet the needs of adult students with responsibilities for family and work, the Bachelor of General Studies (BGS) provides a more flexible degree program. Beginning in fall 2014, two new concentrations will be offered in the BGS program, focused on the needs of adult learners. Enterprising Leadership is a multi-disciplinary concentration designed for students working in business and industry who seek to expand their capacity for leadership and problem solving. The Public Service concentration is designed for adult le arners who are working in human service or publicly-funded organizations, and focuses on re search, advocacy, and public policy subjects. Both concentrations are offered via distance education. The University of Southern Indiana has cr eated an environment in which teaching and learning are its foremost mission and where the energy and dedication to purpose of faculty and staff have become a model for other univer sities. Among the state's baccalaureate institutions, the most productive faculty members may be found at USI, where they not only teach, but guide students' academic work as advisors and engage in service and scholarly work. The faculty's commitme nt to continual improvement in teaching has produced increasing quality of instruction and graduate preparedness. The University truly is a creator of opportunity for thousands of students, many the first in their families to attend college. AFFORDABILITY, PRODUCTIVITY, AND EFFICIENCY Maintaining affordability for postsecondary education is a primary goal of the University of Southern Indiana. According to the College Board's Trends in College Pricing 2013 , the national average for undergraduate tuit ion and fees charged by public four-year colleges and universities in 2013-2014 was $8,893. At the University of Southern Indiana, tuition and fees for full-time, in-state u ndergraduate students were $6,418 in 2013-2014 while the average charge for four-year public institutions in Indiana was $8,364. In-state undergraduate students attending USI full-ti me in 2014-2015 will pay $6,697, compared to the $8,519 average for other Indiana pub lic baccalaureate institutions. 7Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 In the 2013-2015 Biennial Budget Request, the University of Southern Indiana requested an increase in its base appropriation to support the need for additional full-time faculty. The University received a $2 millio n line item appropriation in each year of the biennium. The University appreciates the su pport of the Indiana Ge neral Assembly and the appropriation. The University has requested that the line item be included in its operating appropriation beginning in the 2015-2017 biennium. It is important for the state to monitor the differentials in appropriation per-FTE- Hoosier student at the public baccalaureate-deg ree-granting institutions. The University of Southern Indiana's 2014-2015 funding level per FTE based on resident FTE enrollment for 2013 is $5,304. With the additional line item appropriation included in its operating appropriation, the funding level would increase to $5,556, about $250 per-FTE-Hoosier student. The current method used to fund the performance-based funding formulae will not correct the differentials in funding. Targeted appropriation adjustmen ts are needed for any real progress to take place. Relying on the performance ince ntive formulae is not adequate because of the variations in the value of the me trics and the required institutional contribution to fund the metrics in any given year. In 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, the required two percent reallocation of operating and line item appropriations for universities resulted in an appropriation reduction of over $900,000 in each year of the biennium for the University of Southern Indiana. This was approximately one-half of the University's operating appropriation increase for 2013-2015. PRIVATE SUPPORT The USI Foundation is a not-for-profit corp oration established in 1968 exclusively to serve the University of Southern Indiana. The USI Foundation's mi ssion is to attract, acquire, and manage donors' charitable gifts to support and sustain the goals of the University of Southern Indiana. To provide the financial reso urces necessary to achieve the University's goals, the University of Southern Indiana Foundation embarked on a five-year $50 million capital campaign. Campaign USI: Elevating Excellence was made public on April 4, 2013, and to date over $42 million has been raised. The campaign will fund specific projects in five main areas aligned with the strategic plan of the University: Enriching the Student Experience Enhancing the Academic Environment 8Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Elevating Athletics Strengthening Community Partnerships Providing Ongoing Annual Support USI seeks innovative ways to increase student success and graduation rates through enriching the student experience. The USI Fou ndation plans to achieve this through building scholarship endowments, broadening student ex periential learning, and expanding support for students who live off campus. The University seeks to enhance the acade mic environment to fund new experiences for faculty through creating facu lty engaged fellowships. Endo wing faculty professorships will serve three main functions to enhance the academic environment by retaining talented faculty, attracting distinguished faculty, and a ttracting students who are eager to study with those professors. Additionally, USI will es tablish an endowment to fund an innovative Thinker's Speaker's series to feature globally prominent entrepreneurs and innovators to share expertise, provoke thought, and promote conversation. During the past five fiscal years, the University of Southern Indiana has raised an average of $7,207,503 per year in public and private support. MEASURES OF EDUCATIONAL QUALITY The University of Southern Indiana was established in response to community and regional needs. USI calculates its institutional effe ctiveness through a variety of performance indicators designed to meet its internal expectations, as well as those of external constituencies. Appropriate data and feedback loops are available and used throughout the organization to support continuous improvement. Assessment and accountability are fundamenta l principles of operation at the University of Southern Indiana. Over time th e University has layered a variety of assessment activities to measure the quality of education at the institution. Each layer contributes to a coherent assessment strategy with components including: Periodic and systematic scans of the regi onal environment to assess new programs needed and satisfaction with the quality of education offered at the institution. 9Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Assessment of broad-based educational skills among students including critical thinking, reading, and mathematics skills by a standardized test offered through the Educational Testing Service (ETS) calle d the Proficiency Profile. Scores are compared to previous years as well as a national average. Assessment of content knowledge within a range of academic majors through ETS's Major Field Tests (MFT). Scores are compared to performance by earlier classes of majors, and to the averages generated by hundreds of other participating universities. Each fall and spring semester, USI dedicate s a day to assessment. Classes are canceled and USI students are required to participate in various assessment testing activities. In the fall, the ETS Proficiency Profile test is given to all freshmen and seniors. The test is designed to measur e \"value added\" over time. Participation rates for the Proficiency Profile test exc eeds 90 percent each year. On the spring assessment day, a number of academic de partments require seniors to take a Major Field Test in their area of study. In addition, each of the four colleges uses the day to focus on academic assessment planning and review. A campus-based Academic Program Review process is required of all academic programs. Once every five years, a de partment conducts a small-scale self-study, followed by reviews from colleagues within the institution. These reviews used as accountability tools have he lped multiple programs to develop clearer learning objectives and enhanced objective measur ements of student learning. This program-level assessment was identified as a significant strength by the site visit team of the Higher Learning Commissi on during the University's 2006 re- accreditation process. The Voluntary System of Accountability (VSA ) is a voluntary initiative developed by the American Association of State Co lleges and Universities (AASCU) and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (NASULGC). It is designed to facilitate the dissemination of inform ation about member colleges and universities in a transparent, comparable, and understandable format: The College Portrait. Furthermore, the VSA allows colleges and universities the opportunity to demonstrate accountability and stewardship to the public as well as measurement of educational outcomes. The University of Southern Indiana strongly supports the intent of the Volunt ary System of Accountability (VSA) and was 10Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 an early adopter of the College Portrait. USI's College Portrait can be found at www.collegeportraits.org/IN/USI . CONTRIBUTING TO THE INDIANA ECONOMY Reaching Higher, Achieving More , the Indiana Commission for Higher Education's 2012 report, asserts that a workfo rce-aligned state higher educat ion system is critical to ensuring Indiana's economic competitiveness. USI is a proven contributor to Indiana's economy and embraces this challenge, as demonstrated by the institution's focus on: Increasing access to higher education for traditional and nontraditional students; Developing and expanding educational programs and services to address concerns about workforce preparatio n, including increased emphasis on improving teaching and learning options in science, mathematics, and technical (STEM) skills areas; Expanding opportunities for faculty with sp ecialized content expertise to support applied research and problem-solving initiatives critical to development needs in the region; Introducing certificate programs desi gned to increase employability of the unemployed and underemployed; Implementing academic and outreach programs focusing on innovation, entrepreneurship, applied research, and improved competitiveness; and Retaining Hoosier students. As a public comprehensive inst itution, the University of So uthern Indiana continues to assist with the economic development stra tegies of the state and the southwest Indiana region. The University's consistent record of program development and service expansion in response to, or in anticipation of, n eeds of the changing economy is clear. Increasingly, as the public comprehensiv e institution in southwest Indiana, the University of Southern Indiana is called to \"reg ional stewardship.\" The University is expected to take leadership roles in key regional development initiatives. While remaining focused on the University's central mission of providing quality teaching and learning, USI is a broadly engaged university providing resources and se rvices to support economic and workforce development. 11Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 The University of Southern Indiana is mindful of its obligation to serve the region and the state and is actively engaged in a variety of partnerships locally, regi onally, and statewide. The University of Southern Indi ana continues its strong tradition of service, particularly in the form of continuing ed ucation, applied research, and employee development training to meet the ever-changing needs of area businesses and i ndustrial firms, as well as of K-12 schools and the public sector. As implied by its nam e, USI is embedded in southern Indiana and responds, as resources permit, to regional expectations. 2015-2017 PERFORMANCE FUNDING METRICS The University of Southern Indiana is eligib le to receive funding through five of the seven Performance Funding Metrics in 2015-2017. The five metrics are: Overall Degree Completion On-Time Degree Completion At-Risk Degree Completion Student Persistence Incentive Institution-Defined Productivity Metric The University of Southern Indiana subm itted data to the Indiana Commission for Higher Education for each of the five Perf ormance Funding Metrics for 2015-2017. The University again demonstrated progress in each ca tegory for each metric. The University has increased significantly in the production of degrees. Overall Degree Completion Degree Completion for bachelor degrees for Indiana residents has increased 48.2 percent since 2005-2006 from 953 degrees to 1,412 degrees in 2012-2013. The number of master degrees for Indiana residents has increased 72.2 percent from 169 degrees in 2005-2006 to 291 degrees in 2012-2013. Over all Degree Completion increased 14.5 percent for the three-year comparison period for the 2015-2017 budget submission. 12Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 At-Risk Degree Completion At-Risk Degree Completion has increased over 100 percent since 2005-2006 from 193 degrees to 389 degrees in 2012-2013. For the three-year comparison period, At-Risk Degree Completion increased by 40 percent. DEGREE COMPLETION 13Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 On-Time Degree Completion On-Time Degree Completion has increased 80.2 percent since 2005-2006 from 207 degrees to 373 degrees in 2012- 2013. For the three-year comparison period, On-Time Degree Completion increased 13.2 percent. Student Persistence Incentive Metric Overall Student Persistence for the completion of 30 credit hours and 60 credit hours increased 11.3 percent since 2007-2008. 30 AND 60 CREDIT HOURS 30 Credit Hours 60 Credit Hours 14Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Institution-Defined Performance Metric A new metric introduced for the 2013-2015 biennium was the Institution-Defined Performance Metric. For the 2015-2017 biennium, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education selected three metrics and each institution was asked to choose one metric to submit in its 2015-2017 Biennial Budget Request. The University of Southern Indiana chose the College Affordability Index (CAI) metric. The index is an institution generate d measure that includes changes in: Indiana-resident undergraduate tuition and fees; Institutional grant and scho larship aid to students; Annual state operating appropriation; and Number of resident undergradu ate degrees awarded each year. In comparing the three-year average for 2008-2010 to 2012-2013, there was a 5.3 percent decrease in the Affordability Performanc e Metric for the University of Southern Indiana. From 2007-2008 to 2012-2013 there was an 11.1 percent decrease in the Affordability Performance Metric. The University of Southern Indiana demonstr ated significant improvement in each of the five Performance Funding Metrics it is e ligible to receive funding through in 2015-2017. $0$10,000$20,000$30,000$40,000$50,000$60,000$70,000 $62,086$65,095 $64,426 $64,700$59,712 $55,187AFFORDABILITY PERFORMANCE METRIC 15Executive Summary University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Proposed Metric Value and Impact The Indiana Commission for Higher Education has proposed the per-unit values for each of the metrics which are similar to the unit values in 2013-2015. If the metrics are funded at the level proposed by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education, USI would earn $3,148,300 for improved perfor mance on each of the metrics. SUMMARY OF 2015-2017 PROPOSED METRIC VALUE AND IMPACT The University of Southern Indiana reques ts support of its 2015-2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request to carry out its mission of providing high-quality education services to help achiev e the goals of the state and region. PFF Metric Value of Metric Overall Degree Completion $1,300,000 At-Risk Degree Completion $654,000 Student Persistence Metric $851,000 Institution-Defined Metric $150,000 Total PFF Impact $3,148,300 16 University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN INDIANA 2015-2017 OPERATING AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT INSTITUTIONAL REQUEST The University of Southern Indiana's 2015- 2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request was developed using the Performance Funding metrics created by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. Based on the budget instructions, the Universi ty is eligible to receive funding through five of the seven Performance Funding Metrics in 2015-2017. The metrics are: Overall Degree Completion At-Risk Degree Completion Student Persistence Incentive On-Time Graduation Rates Institution-Defined Productivity Metric The University is not eligible to receive funding through the High Impact Degree Completion Metric. This metric only applies to degrees awarded by the research institutions. The Remediation Success Metric only app lies to the two-year institutions. In the 2015-2017 biennia, the Indiana Co mmission for Higher Education has developed four possible recommendations to fund the Performance Funding Metrics in 2015- 2016 and 2016-2017. The Commission for Hi gher Education has recommended that the Performance Funding Formulas be funded at 7 percent in 2015-2016 and 8 percent in 2016-2017. In order to fund the formulas, instit utional operating budgets are reduced up to 5 percent in 2015-2016 and up to 6 perc ent in 2016-2017 to fund the Performance Funding Formula pool with an assumption of new state funding of 2 or 3 percent. The metrics are weighted at an adjusted unit value. Institutional performance in each of the metrics determines the recommended funding level for each year of the biennium. Based on data provided to the Indiana Commission for Highe r Education, the University of Southern Indiana showed improvement in each of the metr ics in every category; however, the impact of the Performance Funding Formulas varies based on each assumption. 172015-2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Institutional Request University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 2015-2017 METRIC ALLOCATION BASED ON PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE INDIANA COMMISSION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION OPERATING BASE BASE REALLOCATION PERFORMANCE FUNDING IMPACT TOTAL OPERATING FUNDING DOLLAR CHANGE PERCENT CHANGE FY16/FY17 Funding Based on Metric Values No $437,018 1.0% 182015-2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Institutional Request University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 SUMMARY OF 2015-2017 PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN INDIANA Based on Metric Values with No Unit Adjustments Fiscal Year 2016 Overall Degree Completion Metric - 3 Year Average Change CHE Value $8,000 $4,000 $2,000 Bachelo r Maste 8 $1,096,000 $188,000 $16,000 Total Annual Allocation $1,300,000 Fiscal Year 2016 At-Risk Degree Completion Metric - 3 Year Average Change CHE Value $6,000 Bachelo r PFF Impact 109 $654,000 Total Annual Allocation $654,000 Fiscal Year 2016 Student Persistence Metric - 3 Year Change CHE Value $800 $1,500 30 Credit Hours 60 Credit Hours PFF Impact 86 83 $68,800 $124,500 Total Annual Allocation $193,300 Fiscal Year 2016 On-Time Degree Completion in Four Years - 3 Year Change CHE Value $23,000 4 Year PFF Impact 37 $851,000 Total Annual Allocation $851,000 Fiscal Year 2016 USI Institution-Defined Metric CHE Value $2,000 PFF Impact Per 100 Undergraduate Resident FTE 75 Total Annual Allocation $150,000 Total PFF Impact $3,148,300 192015-2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Institutional Request University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 DEFINITIONS OF METRICS Overall Degree Completion: o Calculates the change in degrees conferred over a three-year period rolling average (2008 through 2013; average of 2008-2010 versus 2011-2013) o For resident students only (no reciprocity) o Applies to bachelor, masters, and doct oral degrees conferred at four-year institutions At-Risk Student Degr ee Completion: o Calculates the change in degrees conferred over a three-year period rolling average (2008 through 2013; average of 2008-2010 versus 2011-2013) o For resident students only (no reciprocity) o Only those students who we re eligible for Pell when they graduated from the institution o Applies to bachelor degrees conf erred at four-year institutions Student Persistence Incentive: o Calculates the change in headcount over a three-year period rolling average (2008 through 2013; average of 2008-2010 versus 2011-2013) o Applies to all resident undergra duate students (no reciprocity) o Progress points include credit hours a ssociated with dual credit and transfer credits; however, a student who transfers in credits must attain the credit hour threshold by earning additional cr edits at the reporting institution o For four-year non-research campuses, number of students who successfully complete 30 and 60 credit hours On-Time Graduation Rates: o Calculates the change over a three-ye ar period rolling average (2008 through 2013; average of 2008-2010 versus 2011-2013) o Applies only to resident, undergraduat e, first time, full-time students (no reciprocity) o Measures the graduation rate for institutions based on type of campus o For four-year institutions, the graduation rate achieved in four years 202015-2017 Operating and Capital Improvement Institutional Request University of Southern Indiana Summary of Operating and Capital Improvement Budget Request 2015-2017 Institution-Defined Productivity Metric: New metric introduced for the 2013-2015 biennium was the Institution- Defined Performance Metric For 2015-2017 biennium, the Indiana Co mmission for Higher Education selected three metrics and each institut ion was asked to choose one metric to submit in its 2015-2017 Biennial Budget Request University of Southern Indiana chose the College Affordability Index (CAI) metric Index is an institution generated me asure that includes changes in: o Indiana-resident undergr aduate tuition and fees; o Institutional grant and scho larship aid to students; o Annual state operating appropriation; and o Number of resident undergradu ate degrees awarded each year LINE ITEM APPROPRIATION REQUEST The University's 2015-2017 Operating Budget Request includes two line item appropriation requests. The University of Southern Indiana has been responsible for operating and maintaining the New Harmony historic sites si nce 1985. During this period, the University has been responsible for all operational expens es that exceeded revenue. In addition, the University performs, at its expense, all ongoing restoration to the hi storic sites. Portions of the repair and renovation expenditures come from the appropriations provided by the state to the University for maintaining of its educational facilities. New Harmony is an international treasure that must be preserved to showcase Indiana's role in the history of a developing nation. The budget for operational expenditu res is critical. Educational exhibits and programs must continually be updated and refr eshed with new ideas intended to encourage both initial and return vi sits to New Harmony.

The facility was approved by the Indiana General Assembly and it was constructed to provide needed classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices, and service areas for the USI College of Nursing and Health Professions and the Indiana University School of Medicine - Evansville Center. The IU School of Medicine - Evansville Center was divided between two locations, part on the University of Southern Indiana campus and the remainder on the University of Evansville campus. Construction of the Health Professions Center facilitated the unification of the medical education program on the USI campus, a move requested by the local advisory group to the IU School of Medicine - Evansville Center. The third floor of the Health Professions Center was designed specifically to meet the needs of the IU School of Medicine - Evansville Center. It contains classrooms, offices, a series of research laboratories, a large laboratory animal care facility, and various research support spaces such as warm and cold rooms, explosion proof chemical storage space, and a library. The facility was completed in 1995 . The IU School of Medicine - Evansville Center chose to relocate the Center in downtown Evansville in a new Multi-Instructional Academic Health Science/Research Center. The University plans to renovate the 26,000 gross feet of the third floor and enclose the four corner balconies adjoining the existing space to add another 4,000 gross square feet to the floor. Current plans are to decommission the laboratory animal care space and use the over 3,000 gross square fee currently assigned that function for other functions as well as repurpose the other specialized space designed for the IU School of Medicine. No design has been undertaken at this point for the renovation/expansion of the facility. Institution: Project: University of Southern Indiana Classroom Renovation/Expansion 1:46 PM This valuable and prime space, which is very well located to support the health science educational needs of the University must be repurposed to support the burgeoning health sciences at USI. The graduate medical research laboratories that currently compose the bulk of the space are not necessary or appropriate for undergraduate health science education, and USI faculty are primarily teaching faculty with limited need for such facilities. Need & Purpose Institution: Project: University of Southern Indiana Classroom Renovation/Expansion 1:46 PM Space Utilization Enclosure of the four corner balconies will increase the available space on the USI campus by 4,000 gross square feet. The primary purpose of the project is to renovate existing space that will primarily be used by the College of Nursing and Health Professions to support undergraduate health science education. Comparable Projects The University most recently renovated existing space, primarily science laboratories, in the Pott College of Science and Engineering to provide improved and updated laboratories, classrooms, teaching and laboratory support space, and faculty and department offices. The renovation resulted in a better teaching and learning environment with state-of-the-art laboratory and classroom equipment and space. In order to repurpose the Health Professions Center for current use, the University requests Special Repair and Rehabilitation funding. Background Materials Design and renovation of the Health Professions Center are not complete at this time.

Summary of the Impact on the Educational Attainment of Students Inter-professional training in health care is a new pedagogical paradigm that will prepare health care professionals for new protocols of practice that are far more interdisciplinary and team oriented than in the past. This team oriented, tightly coordinated approach to health care also holds the promise of better health care cost control in the future.

The improvement of regional health outcomes and the efficient and effective delivery of health care require more cooperation, communication, and coordination among health care professionals than ever before. It is incumbent on the educational programs that train aspiring doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals to evolve their educational programs and training protocols in ways that reflect this emerging professional practice standard. In the 2013 legislative session, the Indiana General Assembly approved $2 M in architectural and engineering funds for Indiana University to begin planning for the development of the Multi-Institutional Academic Health Science/Research Center. USI has been a participant in the planning process. The University of Southern Indiana will be one of four partners in the project. The 26,000 gross square feet requested in the project by the University of Southern Indiana will be occupied by the Doctor of Nursing Practice Program (DNP), the Master of Nursing Program (MSN), the Accelerated Bachelor of Nursing Program (BSN), the Occupational Therapy Program, the Center of Healthy Aging and Wellness, the Center for Health Informatics and the Dental Assisting Program. These programs will be relocated from the USI main campus to the new Multi-Institutional Academic Health Science/Research Center in downtown Evansville. The space will be composed of faculty offices, classrooms with on site instruction and for distance learning, and teach laboratories. Institution: Project: University of Southern Indiana Multi-Institutional Academic Updated: PM Indiana University School of Medicine - Evansville recently added a fourth year to the three years of medical school already offered in the region. Co-locating various health-related degree programs offered by the four institutions of higher education will foster the kind of interdisciplinary communication, cooperation, and coordination that is needed to train the health professionals of the future. Need & Purpose Institution: Project: University of Southern Indiana Multi-Institutional Academic Updated: 9/5/2014 1:57 PM Space Utilization The space requested by the University of Southern Indiana would be used to expand existing health care programs and to launch two new centers for Healthy Aging and Wellness and Health Informatics. The Accelerated Bachelor of Nursing Program (BSN) would offer new opportunities to individuals who have completed a degree to transition to nursing. The space requested would include faculty offices, classrooms for on site instruction and distance education programming, and specialized laboratories. Common space in the facility would be shared by the four partners in the project. Comparable Projects There are no comparable projects in the Evansville area. The Indiana University School of Medicine - Evansville has been located on the campus of the University of Southern Indiana for over 40 years. Background Materials Indiana University has coordinated the project and would be able to provide the background materials.

There are 16 units per building. Most of the apartments in the complex are over 30 years old and in need of major renovation and updating. Some of the updates to the apartment buildings include installation of new windows, kitchen cabinets, bathroom fixtures, light fixtures, carpeting, and the replacement of drywall. Summary of the Impact on the Educational Attainment of Students Renovation of the older apartment-style student housing units will make these units more attractive to students who choose to live on campus. The majority of freshmen students living on campus, live in the residence halls. It is important for the students who choose to live on campus as upperclassmen to have living units comparable to the residence halls. Given the age of the current apartment buildings, rehabilitating the apartment-style units will make them more desirable to students as an on-campus housing option. With nearly 2,600 students living on campus, ongoing renovation of the facilities helps keep them in working order and appealing to students. By updating these older units, more students will be interested in living on campus. The support services provided to students who live in campus housing will contribute to the retention and graduation of the students.

There are 16 units per building. Most of the apartments in the complex are over 30 years old and in need of major renovation and updating. Some of the updates to the apartment buildings include installation of new windows, kitchen cabinets, bathroom fixtures, light fixtures, carpeting, and replacement of drywall. The University has 43 apartment-style units that are between 15 and 40 years old. The University initially started the construction of its first residence hall unit approximately ten years ago. There are currently four residence halls which are located closer to the campus core than the apartment-style housing. A combination of aging apartment-style units and the greater distance from the campus core make the residence halls more appealing to the University's underclassmen. The apartment-style housing, because of its age, needs to be updated and rehabilitated. Per the University's current master plan, future expansion of student housing to accommodate additional students would be construction of residence hall type units. The resident hall units are more expensive to build; therefore, rehabilitating the apartment-style housing units is a better use of the University's housing reserves. Institution: Project: University of Southern Indiana Building 2:09 PM Rehabilitating the student housing units is important to the mission of educating the students enrolled at the University of Southern Indiana to ensure that the students who choose to live on campus have a viable option to meet their housing needs. Most of the students living on campus depend on the University to provide many of the amenities that alternative housing opportunities off campus are unable to provide. The University has nearly 2,600 students living on campus. A variety of services are available to students who live on campus such as dining plans, in-housing tutoring services, a 24 -hour manned security force to take care of their safety needs, and a campus shuttle service to assist students with their transportation needs. Many of the student housing buildings scheduled to be rehabilitated are over 25 years old. This project includes updating kitchen cabinets, bathroom fixtures, installing new windows, replacing the carpeting, and drywall. The renovations are needed due to the many years of wear and tear from students living in these units and the need to provide updated living facilities that are attractive to students. The alternative for students who do not live in on-campus housing is renting an apartment located more than three miles from the campus core. The University has considered constructing additional residence halls on campus in lieu of rehabilitating the apartment-style housing units. However, the apartments continue to be a viable housing option, if they are renovated and updated. The University has chosen to renovate the apartments. This approach is less costly per bed than construction of a new residence hall and will continue to provide quality housing to students at an affordable cost. Renovation of the older apartment-style student housing units will make these units more attractive to students who choose to live on campus. The majority of freshman students living on campus, live in the residence halls. It is important for the students who choose to live on campus as upperclassmen to have living units comparable to the residence halls.

The Welcome Center will provide a large meeting room where staff can show videos and make presentations to visitors. In addition, the smaller meeting rooms will allow guests to receive more personalized attention during one-on-one appointments with USI personnel. The Welcome Center also will provide a central location where anyone on campus can go to ask questions and receive directions. The Center will serve as the primary departure point for campus tours. The Welcome Center provides another opportunity to engage the community by providing ease of access to USI events, which is central to USI's vision.

The five strategic goals of the campaign include: - Enriching the student experience - Enhancing the academic environment - Elevating athletics - Strengthening community partnerships, and - Providing vital ongoing annual support of USI Under the goal of \"Strengthening Community Partnerships,\" the need to develop a center to welcome campus visitors was identified. Each year more than 200,000 people use the campus for activities other than academic classes. Visitors, including prospective students and their parents, deserve a warm welcome and clear directions. As part of the Capital Campaign, the University decided to seek private funds to construct a 6,000 gross square foot highly visible and easily accessible facility adjacent to the Orr Center. The Welcome Center will serve as the central point for convening all campus tours. The Welcome Center will include a reception area, a large meeting room with several smaller meetings rooms, and will serve as central meeting location on campus.

Indeed, those who shaped New Harmony later shaped the complexion of Indiana, drafting its Constitution, establishing its first schools, leading its first public universities, and promoting community development and scientific advancement in what was then America's frontier. The first communal group, the Harmonists, established a thriving community in ten years. In 1824, in dustrialist and social reformer Robert Owen of Scotland bought the entire town and set out to develop a community based on education and equality for all. As a result of the work of Owen and his partner William Maclure, the ideas and people of New Harmony had a profound impact on the nation. Designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1965, New Harmony brings further distinction to the State of Indiana through the national awards and honors it receives. In 2007, New Harmony was declared a \"Preser ve America Community\" by the National Park Service and the town's visitor center, Richard Meier's Atheneum, which is owned and operated by the University of Southern Indiana, won the prestigious 25 Year Award from the American Institute of Architects in 20 08. STATE, CORPORATE, AND UNIVERSITY INVOLVEMENT In 1937, the Indiana General Assembly passed the New Harmony Memorial Commission Act and a statewide one -mill tax for the Memorial Commission to fund the legislatively defined educational programs in New Harmony. The first New Harmony Memorial Commission was appointed by Governor M. Clifford Townsend in 1939. After a respite of several decades, the New Harmony Commission was reconstituted in 1965 by Governor Roger D. Branigin to ensure continued protecti on of the New Harmony area for the citizens of Indiana. The statutory mandates of the Commission include recommending legislation to protect all of New Harmony, conducting a survey and establishing a plan for the New Harmony area, and promoting and enhanc ing New Harmony as a tourist destination. The State of Indiana has taken an active role in acquiring and preserving historic and natural sites in and around New Harmony. In 1943, the Indiana Department of Conservation (the forerunner of the Department of Natural Resources) approved a preliminary plan for the development of the New Harmony State Memorial. Then, in 1955, several historic properties were placed in the custody of the Department of Conservation. During the administration of Governor Edgar D. Whitcomb, the importance of New Harmony was recognized and planning moved forward to develop the Harmonie State Recreation area to further augment the preservation of New Harmony and natural areas surrounding it. In a public/private partnership, the Depa rtment of Natural Resources division of Outdoor Recreation provided a matching grant to the town to create the Kenneth and Jane B. Owen River Trail. Following along the river from the Atheneum, the trail is enjoyed by citizens and visitors alike. Phase T wo of the trail project was just completed as a legacy project for the Bicentennial Celebration. In order to establish long -term management stability for New Harmony's educational programs and to maintain the historic facilities, the State of Indiana aske d the University of Southern Indiana to assume operational control of Historic New Harmony, Inc. in 1985. In addition to the programmatic responsibilities, the University accepted ownership of more than 40 historically significant properties. At the time of this transfer, there was general agreement that over time, state appropriations would be made available to support the preservation, education, and interpretive programs necessary to realize the mission of the site: \"By preserving its utopian legacy, H istoric New Harmony will inspire innovation and progressive thought through its programs and collections.\" In 1989, the State of Indiana, through the Sunset Commission, recommended there be a Unified Program for New Harmony's historical museum activities . This recommendation led to the unification of the Department of Natural Resources historic sites (now the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites, Inc. [ISMHS]) with the USI properties through a contractual agreement that established USI as the manager of the site with ISMHS providing curatorial support. A new strategic plan for the unified program was adopted in 2009 and was updated in fall 2011. It focuses activities on creating experiences for niche markets identified as having an affinity for New H armony's history and resources, and places specific emphasis on connecting USI faculty and students with the community of New Harmony. In 2009, New Harmony's role in the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution was celebrated in Washington, D.C., with a lecture and a behind -the-scenes -tour of the Smithsonian Castle, which was initiated and designed by the Owen brothers of New Harmony. In fall 2010, the first New Harmony Outreach and Engagement Fellowships were selected. These awards provide seed mo ney for service learning and applied -research projects for USI faculty and students in concert with a New Harmony partner. Examples of funded projects include: A professor of social work and a team of graduate students worked on data collection in New Harmony and surrounding areas to formulate \"A Model Elder Care Program for a Rural Community,\" which was presented to the New Harmony town council in fall 2011. An entomologist is working with students to \"re -collect\" the historic Thomas Say insect collectio n to highlight the pioneering scientific discoveries of the Owen Community which will be part of a new public exhibit in New Harmony, scheduled to open during the Bicentennial year. It will continue to be a working laboratory for USI biology students, and will be accessible to visitors on tour. USI geology faculty and students are collaborating with the Working Men's Institute on a new permanent exhibit in their facility that will highlight the role of New Harmony in the development of the United States for mineral exploration. A professor of communications developed a field school/residency to focus on the relationship between the World Heritage Site of New Lanark, Scotland and New Harmony, with students taking classes in both locations. Other departments a t USI are building on that format to create a summer program in New Harmony that will target issues of diversity and retention. New Harmony Gallery of Contemporary Art, in addition to its educational programming, offers rotating exhibits of work by artists of national and regional reputation. The New Harmony Theatre - managed by the USI Department of Performing Arts in the College of Liberal Arts and Indiana's only Actors Equity theatre outside of Indianapolis - offers three major productions in the summer months. In support of USI's goal of increasing diversity, a partnership has been developed between Student Affairs and Historic New Harmony to expand the definition of diversity to include religious traditions and concepts of spirituality. An intern works closely with faculty and student organizations to promote interest in and attendance at events on campus and in New Harmony that educate students, faculty, and staff about the various traditions and belief systems they encounter on campus and in society. STATEMENT OF NEED The University of Southern Indiana has been responsible for operating and maintaining the New Harmony historic sites since 1985. During this period, the University has been responsible for all operational expenses that exceeded revenue . In addition, the University performs, at its expense, all ongoing restoration to the historic sites. Portions of the repair and renovation expenditures come from the appropriations provided by the state to the University for maintenance of its educatio nal facilities. The repair and rehabilitation funds received by the University are needed to maintain the campus facilities. At the same time, the historic properties located in New Harmony continue to require rehabilitation and restoration to maintain t heir preservation value as tourist/educational facilities. Without the continued investment of state funds for New Harmony properties, maintenance of both the campus educational facilities and those in New Harmony will suffer. The budget for operational expenditures is equally critical. Educational exhibits and programs must continually be updated and refreshed with new ideas intended to encourage both initial and return visits to New Harmony. Fundraising through the Historic New Harmony Advisory Board , part of the USI Foundation, and support from volunteers in fund -raising activities enable the University to supplement the New Harmony operating budget by approximately $60,000 annually. The preservation mission of Historic New Harmony also requires the University to raise private money for capital restoration projects. Grants from private foundations provide limited additional sources of funding for selected projects and programs. Important as these efforts are, they are insufficient to cover the cost s associated with preserving the heritage of New Harmony while also providing the educational and cultural programs expected of a nationally known historic site. It is clear from reviewing the history of the state's actions to preserve New Harmony's histo ry and facilities, the state always intended to provide support, either through a tax levy or through the budgets of state agencies. OUTCOMES AND BENEFITS New Harmony is an international treasure that must be preserved to showcase Indiana's role in the history of a developing nation. There are many compelling reasons to provide funding for facility maintenance and programming. The funding will: Ensure the preservation and promotion of New Harmony's heritage as a model for community building in small rural towns across America. Allow the University to promote greater interest in the community's culture and history. The major metropolitan centers from which New Harmony draws visitors are Indianapolis, Louisville, St. Louis, Chicago, and Nashville. It i s estimated that three to five percent of guests at the Atheneum and on tour are international visitors. Because many of New Harmony's visitors come from other states and nations, the tourism dollars are new to Indiana's economy and, therefore, even more v aluable. Through its New Harmony outreach program, the University is able to provide educational opportunities for regional school systems. Sustain a living laboratory for University instructional and applied research programs. Ensure future collaborati on and opportunities for the USI community to expand upon the many special programs developed for New Harmony's 2014 Bicentennial. STATE APPROPRIATIONS FOR HISTORIC NEW HARMONY Fiscal Year USI Budget Request for Historic New Harmony As-Passed Budget % Change 2007 -2008 -2015 $574,387 $486,878 No Change BUDGET REQUEST The University appreciates the funding appropriated by the Indiana General Assembly in for the operation of Historic New Harmony; however, even with increased funding in 2013 -2014, the operating appropriation for Historic New Harmony is 15.5 percent below funding levels in 2008 -2009. It is critically important that cuts in funding be restored.

The Southwest Indiana region is poised for substantial economic growth with the impending completion of I -69 that links USI with the Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC -Crane) and will result in an easier route to Indianapolis. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs, specifically engineering and advanced manufacturing, will form the b asis of much of that growth. Since 2007, USI has responded to the need for additional STEM graduates, having increased the number of STEM majors from 650 to over 1,200 majors today. USI's Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) program has been in existe nce since 2002 with the first students graduating in 2006. The program has experienced rapid growth with over 400 students majoring in one of the three degree programs offered through the engineering department. In addition to increasing student demand f or engineering and associated programs such as Advanced Manufacturing, there has been a tremendous increase in regional business and industry requests for engineering and technical assistance, collaborations, and partnerships. It is proposed that permanent line item funding be added to the USI budget in order to fund the expansion and growth of USI's Department of Engineering that would enable USI to offer the following five discipline -specific degree programs: Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering; Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering; Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering; Bachelor of Science in Manufacturing Engineering (this would be the only program of its kind in the state); and Bachelor of Science in Civil Engin eering. Future expansion of the Department of Engineering includes degrees in: Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering , supported by a strong regional industrial base; Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering , one of the highest demand engineeri ng fields, supported by the new Indiana University four -year medical school in Evansville and multiple healthcare systems; and Bachelor of Science in Construction Management , a high demand technical degree supported by an Associate's degree program at Ivy Tech Community College. Funding in the line item would support the additional faculty and support personnel needed for these discipline -specific degrees. Another high demand degree area supported by Evansville's positioning as a regional logistics hub is in: Master of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. As part of growing the Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing offerings at USI, a number of supporting functions will need to be expanded. The School would require additional f aculty and support personnel and laboratory equipment to support the new degree program. DEVELOPING THE STEM PIPELINE In recent years, the Southwest Indiana Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (SwISTEM) Resource Center preemptively b egan positioning itself to meet the highly -technical workforce pipeline demands necessary to launch and sustain the I -69 Innovation Corridor. It is the mission of the SwISTEM Resource Center to facilitate a necessary influx of STEM professionals to fill t he region's lagging STEM pipeline with homegrown technicians, engineers, and scientists. A multi -faceted approach has been adopted by the SwISTEM Resource Center to achieve these objectives which include: Offering teachers rigorous and research -based STEM professional development opportunities that prepare them to actively lead K -12 students into ever -evolving careers of the 21stcentury; Making available a free equipment lending service to informal and formal institutions of education coupled with in -class instructional assistance and curriculum development; and Annually hosting multiple student -centered STEM outreach activities/events that provide students career pathways and networking opportunities with seasoned STEM professionals. In 2010, USI and NSWC -Crane formalized their outreach and academic relationship through a Partnership Intermediary Agreement (PIA) which opened the door for broader and more extensive collaboration between the NSWC -Crane STEM Outreach Team and the SwISTEM Resource Center at USI. Since 2010, the two organizations have worked in cadence to expand the geographic footprint of the area serviced by the SwISTEM Resource Center and to fortify a culture of student -centered, community/industry -supported STEM education involve ment. Results from this expanded partnership include, but are not limited to: Expansion of the equipment lending service to encompass seventeen counties in southwest Indiana o USI counties (Knox, Gibson, Posey, Pike, Vanderburgh, Warrick, Dubois, Spencer, Perry, and Crawford) currently have access to on -site delivery and pick -up via the SwISTEM Equipment Lending Service circulation vehicle. o NSWC -Crane counties (Daviess, Greene, Owen, Monroe, Lawrence, Orange, and Martin) currently have access to all equipment available through the SwISTEM Equipment Lending Service; however, patrons must retrieve and return equipment to WestGate Academy as there currently is no circulation vehicle or circulation assistant available. o Increase in student participatio n in STEM outreach events through active collaboration and shared supportive services (i.e. SeaPerch and Maker Space at Crane). o Integration of Crane professionals into SwISTEM outreach events and teacher professional development (i.e. FIRST LEGO League Q ualifying Tournament, SeaPerch Challenge, Girls Only STEM Camp, and Tri -State Science and Engineering Fair). It is expected that the demands on the Center will increase even further as a result of continued growth of the Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing programs at USI and the establishment of the I -69 Innovation Corridor. In order to adequately support outreach and recruiting efforts, additional personnel and resources are needed. There is an immediate need for additional personnel to support the expansion of the SwISTEM Resource Center. The Center also is in need of one -time funding for an additional circulation vehicle for the Crane region and permanent funding for outreach activities and recruiting operations. MANAGING THE I -69 INNOVATION CORRIDOR A key position that directly maximizes success of USI's STEM efforts is the I -69 Innovation Corridor Manager. Currently, this position is funded for two years, but permanent funding is sough t to maintain and expand the already important impact this position is having. In particular, the I -69 Innovation Corridor Manager is building and strengthening partnerships with advanced manufacturing businesses along the corridor which will expand the i nternship, coop, and employment opportunities for USI STEM graduates. In addition, this position is well -placed to expose regional entrepreneurs and businesses to our Applied Engineering Center's capabilities. Significantly, the corridor manager is worki ng on spearheading a partnership with the STRIVE Network, with a collective impact methodology aimed at building a talent pipeline from early ages to USI and beyond. BUDGET REQUEST The University of Southern Indiana requests funding for a new STEM Initia tive line item in 2015 -2017 to support the expansion of USI's engineering program into specific disciplines; to continue and expand USI's work with the K -12 schools and STEM programs; and, to strengthen USI's STEM efforts in managing the I -69 Innovation Co rridor.
