To summarize health care professionals' attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Methods. In October 2006, we searched Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED; 1985-2006), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE; 1980-2006), and MEDLINE Canadian or US studies of health care professionals' attitudes toward CAM, published in English or French. Results. A total of 21 surveys of physicians, nurses, public health professionals, dietitians, social workers, medical/nursing school faculty, and pharmacists were included that focused on beliefs about CAM efficacy, personal use, clinical practice use and referrals, communication with patients about CAM, level of knowledge, and the need for information regarding various CAM therapies. Physicians were more negative compared to other health care professionals. Positive attitudes toward CAM did not correlate with CAM referral or prescription patterns. Health care professionals of all disciplines wanted more information about CAM. Conclusions. Heterogeneity in the CAM definition and questionnaire items precluded summarizing health care professionals' attitudes toward CAM. Providing CAM education to health care professionals may help to integrate CAM into mainstream medical care. Advances in Medical Education and Practice Journal of Professional Nursing 2010 An Investigation on the Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviours to Complementary and Alternative Therapies among Physicians, Nurses, Patients and Patients' Relatives 2020 Background: Complementary and alternative treatment (CAM) methods have been practiced in every country since ancient times. Although it is used in different types and shapes in each group, it is very popular in recent years. Aim: The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours to CAM among physicians, nurses, patients and patients' relatives and to investigate this relationship according to positions. Method: The study designed in cross-sectional and descriptive type of study was performed in a private hospital. A personal information form was used to collect data for the study. The Pearson Chi-square test was used to examine the relationship between two or more qualitative variables. Findings: The study was conducted used totally 350 participants, including 57 of who were physicians, 114 nurses, 23 patients and 156 patients' relatives. The average age of study participants, 64.9% of whom were women and 61.4% single, was 30.34 \u00b19.01. Of the participants, while 53.1% said that they believed in the effectiveness of CAM methods, 61.1% said they thought complementary and alternative treatment techniques should be supported within the scope of the health insurance system. Besides, 33.7% of the participants expressed using CAM methods, and 77.4% said they thought that there was no difference between complementary and alternative medicine. Conclusions: The study found, by the position of participants, a significant difference between their usages of techniques other than medical treatment, their opinions on whether CAM poses health risks and their views on whether there is any difference between complementary and alternative medicine and their cognisance of animal-assisted therapy (p0.05). On the other hand, the study found no significant difference between participants' usage of CAM and age, gender, civil status, economic condition and whether the participant or a family member has a history of a chronic disease (p>0.05). The Egyptian Journal of Hospital Medicine 2018 Complementary Therapies in Medicine 2012 Journal of Applied Biobehavioral Research 2001 Participants (N= 148), including CAM users and general practitioner (GP) patients who had never used CAM treatments, read a series of 6 vignettes describing 3 medical conditions being treated using orthodox and CAM methods. As expected, results indicated that both CAM users and GP patients were more likely to agree that their own treatments were effective and were associated with fewer generic risks. Contrary to expectation, both CAM and GP patients were more likely to agree that orthodox treatments were associated with ... JRSM 2009 Complementary Therapies in Medicine 2003 2010 Background: Interest in and use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the United States is increasing. However, CAM remains an area of nascency for researchers and western practitioners. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine U.S. health educators' attitudes toward CAM and their use of common CAM therapies. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among members of a professional health educator listserv. Results: Health educators generally have positive attitudes toward CAM and about 90% have used at least one CAM therapy in the last 12 months. Differences in CAM attitudes and use were significant, with females reporting more positive attitudes toward and use of CAM. Discussion: Health educators' overall positive attitudes toward CAM are consistent with the limited extant literature. However, important differences were found by various demographic characteristics, not previously identified. Translation to Health Education Practice: The r...
