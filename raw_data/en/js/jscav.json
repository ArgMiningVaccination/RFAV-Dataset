There is no clear and consistent, universally acceptable definition of CAM, but here are some basic concepts: - Conventional Medicine (CM): This is what is commonly referred to as: Allopathic or Western or Mainstream or Regular or Orthodox medicine. - Complementary Medicine: includes treatments that are used along with Conventional Medicine but are not considered standard treatments. Using acupuncture to reduce side effects of some treatments is one example. - Alternative Medicine: includes treatments that are used instead of Conventional Medicine. Following Chinese or Homeopathic or Ayurvedic treatments instead of Allopathic, using a special diet to treat cancer instead of anticancer drugs prescribed by an oncologist. - Integrative Medicine: This is a Wholistic approach to medical care that combines both, the Conventional Medicine and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine.
