They vary in susceptible individuals and are associated with functional disability, impaired quality of life, psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, and social and academic difficulties. These disorders also pose a significant healthcare cost burden. ASSESSMENT Perform a detailed, thorough history and physical exam (HPE) with limited, purposeful evaluation. Pay close attention to duration, location, character and timing of pain, aggravating/ alleviating factors, and stooling patterns. The presence of red flags (below) help determine the need for a more comprehensive workup. Strive to make a positive diagnosis (versus one of exclusion) to prepare your patient for diagnostic and therapeutic success. MANAGEMENT/TREATMENT Follow a personalized, interdisciplinary approach and focus on improving functioning. If you would like additional copies of this tool, or would like more information, please contact the Physician Outreach and Engagement team at Cincinnati Children's.
