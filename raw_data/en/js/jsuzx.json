The second and fourth chapters or dm n:port prt\"sent the results of a survey of U.S. manne biotechnology research mstitutions and analyze econom:ic aspeLts of resench and de\u00ad velopment. AnalySIS of the MAR.BlO data revealed that, in the U.S. m 1991, about S40 million was spent by federal agencies, state gov\u00ad ernments, and mdusrry to support marine biotechnology research at universities, public research centers, and industrial laboratories. Of this total, by far the greatest share (86%) origmated from the federal government. Thus, of the total amount ~pent by the tederal govern\u00ad ment to support mann<' biotechnology research, the National Insti\u00ad tutes of Health (notably the National Cancer Institute) contributed 2H'Y,, the National Science f-oundation 13.5'%, the Office of Naval Re~earch (ONR) Oceanographic and ca. 7%, wh1le private mdustry funded a little less than 7'%. Although funding for marine bwtechnology research grew rapidly with the emergence of this technolob'Y in the early 1980s, funding was essentially lew! durmg 1 98H-1991, and survey respon\u00ad dents expected no real growth in the next several years. The analysis of MAR.BIO data also ~hows that rmcrobiology and moleculu biology were the areas in whtch most manne biotechnology research was being done, followed by natural products A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY ix d1em!stry. The type of research bemg\" pnformed most often was classified a~ ba~JC research (34%). Other area~ of driving progress in marme bmtech\u00ad nology, indicating that this field snll ism tts formative stage. Although not a maJor factor m the total U.S. snence program, marine biotechnology research to date has been productive, in terms of generating new applications. From the MAR.BIO data, we esti\u00ad mate that, for every Sl.l million spent in research at univer.;ity and pub he re~earch centers, one patent has been approved. We expect that th1s parem activity \\\\oill increase a5 researchers change from thelf current focu-; on basK research to research Wlth more pmsibihtie~ fi.Jr conunerCJal application. The MARBIO survey also encompassed industry. ApproxJ\u00ad matdy 85 companies in the U.S. were identified as bemg dedicated to marine biotechnology or sponsoring marine biotechnology R&D, either m-house or extramurally. The analysis of MAI-t.BIO data showed that most of the effort by industry was devoted to nat\u00ad ural products development. It 1~ a n()tablr achievement that three pharmacologtcal agents derived from marine biotechnology are in clinical trial, since they demonstrated, m one case, activity against tu\u00ad mors, in another, an ability to inhibit vtru-.e~ ;rnd, in the third, effica\u00ad cy in the treatment Approx:ii1L3tely five additional pound~ have ~hown stmilar prormse and arc in pre-dirucal trial. In contrast to natural products deve-lopment. the aquaculture m\u00ad dusrry m the U.S. L~ essentially nascent and there is a need for signifi\u00ad cant technolngJcal advancement fur it to develop to its fullest capaCI\u00ad ty. The general notion regarding aquaculture has been that it is de\u00ad mand drivt:n, when m fact, it ts _technological advancement, particu\u00ad larly genetic selection that ha, allowed this mdustry to spm off a few products. Marine biotechnology will contribute significant mnova\u00ad tion, a~ clmt:d system production becomes economically feasible in the U.S. The relatively low level of interest shown to date by the \\vider mdustrial conmmnity for manne biotechnology may stem from the f..1ct that most t:ompames are not aware of th1s field or, 1f they are )( THE GLOBAL CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY aware, have misconceptions abom the dJtllcully of workm!!; m the: marine environment. and/or arc: also uninfOrmed about the ~Ch::'nttf\u00ad ic/tcdnucal advances that have been ach1cved in marme b1olo~y to date. Our that mdustry more import:mdy, investment in marine biotechno!oh'Y 1r1 the United States is rdatively meager, compared to U.S. inw~tment in biotechnology over-all. As noted above, total filnlhng for nurint' biotechnology research wa; ra. $4(1 tn.ilbon m For purpmes of comparison, this sum ts bet\\vr:en 7% and 1 l '/{, of what the japar1ese spent on research in this field (see below). Shortage of capital m the U.S. for marine biote~.-hnology has limtted it from Jchievmg the ex\u00ad plosive ha<; occurred Hl other areas ofhiotcchnoluh'Y. The pohurs and funding policies of U.S. federal agenne~ and state government'>, related to manne biOtechnology, arc discussed and analyzed in Chapter 3. Our revtew of policies adopted by the Rea\u00ad gan, Bush, and Clintun administrations mJicato: that all have sup\u00ad ported important imtiatives in biotechnology, but marine biotech\u00ad noiOb'Y specifically has not been favored. Neither of the first rv.ro ad\u00ad numstratJOns had been p.Irticularly favorably disposed towards the ocean snences in general, so that funding decreased, m real terms. However, the Clinton admimstration appears to be attempting to re\u00ad verse this situation. For example, strong support has been given the National Sea Grant Program of NOAA. We expect the Clinton ad\u00ad rmmstration will continue to favor biotechnology and especially ini\u00ad tiatives supporting marine biotechnology, mcluding the and ment Act. The U.S. (:ongre.._, ha\\ been a strong supporter of the ocean sci\u00ad ences and biotechnology smce the early 19SOs and we expect this to continue for tht tOresceable future. The concrete steps that Congress is likely to take. which will favor manne biotechnology, are to fund the National Aquaculture Act pa ... ~d m 1980, but which, until now, has not been funded, Congress has passed the 1994 Manne Biotech\u00ad nology Investment Act, which provides $20 nnllion per year in new funds to support manne biotechnology research. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY xi In Ch:lpter .1 we ~lsu discuss funding of m.mne btotechnology by federal agenctes. As part of an inter-agency process uuuated by the Federal Coordinatmg Cotmcil on Science, Engmeermg, and Tcchnolot,y (FCCSFT), each agency the amount biotechnolo~')'. Unlike MARBIO data, \\\\lhich is derived from those who are rtciplent~ of federal funding, the FCCSET esti\u00ad m;Jte-. are made by tht\u00b7 providers of federal funding. From MARBIO data we estimate that federal agt.\"noes prov1ded ca. S34 million in l'J!Jl m support of marine biotechnology; FCCSET estimates that these ~ame agenne~ provided approximately $40 million. The differ\u00ad ence lS not easy to reconcile; perhaps the discrepancy is due to prob\u00ad lerm with definmg which activities should be considt\u00b7n\u00b7d manne biotechnology. Since there lS no single agrt'ed upon definition of the term among tCderal agennes, some may be overly generous in what they place under the rubric of manne biotechnology. Between 19RR and 1 Y91, three states, Maryland, North Carolina and CalifOrma, cstabli~hed dedicated marine bioteclmology centers. Wh1le the centtTS m California and North Carolina were built with funds providt'd by the respectiw states, rriaJOr funding for the Mary\u00ad land center \\:a.~ provided by the Office of Naval Research under the Uniwrsity Research Initiative. This program current1y i'\\ funding the establishment of another re<;earch center m California that will large\u00ad ly tOcus on marine natural products research and development. The direct contributions that state govermnents make to support marine biotechnology in generalts not so s1gnificant, a mere $2.8 million in 1 Y91. The i~~ue of the safety of marine biotechnology research and testmg 1s presented and analyzed in Chapter 5. We conclude that the himafety tssue to date has not been a barner to the advancement of marme biotechnology. Approaches that have been developed to en\u00ad sure safety m biOtechnology research generally apply directly to ma\u00ad nne biotechnology. However, most of the activities within marmc biotechnology so fir have related to research, which typically is not controversial.

Tht\"st' Norv,..\"t'gtan companies will be m a powerful position to compete in the ecmrs of the mternational market constituted by marine aruma! teed, diagnostic~, and therapeu\u00ad tics. Although these sectors are relatively swall, potentially they are lucrative and serve as t\"ntry-points for smaller biotechnology-based compamcs, which are likely to be the basts for lll.aJOr econonuc dc\u00ad vdopmeJJt m the 21st Ct:ntury. As made dear m Chapter 8, both the Japanese government and the mdustrial sector of Japan early realized the ln!portance of the manne environment for economic progress and took steps to pro\u00ad mote marine biotechnology, gomg much beyond simply promoting aquaculture and fisheries. The data indicate that japan spent ca. $357 milhon to $519 million in 1992 on marine biotechnology research and development, a sum that cerw.inly has increased every year smce then. About 80'% of this funding is supplied by mdustry, in contrast to the current U.S. mvestment pattern where government funding predominates. However, the japane~e government provides stgnifi\u00ad cant indirect support of industry in the form of special tax advan\u00ad tages, loan programs, well-funded schemes for mdustry-universiry cooperation in R&D, and n.\u00b7gional promotional activitie<J. The major areas of emphasis selected by the Japanese for research anc~ develop\u00ad ment are aquaculture, marine natural products, and biosensors, al\u00ad though mvestrnents in cnvtronmental applications are rapidly in\u00ad crcasmg. A~ a consequence of the scientific research and development ef\u00ad tOrt that the japanese have Ol.;!de to date with their focus on discov\u00ad ering new marine natural products, Significant dtscoverics have al\u00ad ready been made.

This work is volummous and will offer benefits by the 21st century, particul~rly to mternational effort~ aimed at Improving the enVIronment. Chapter 9 concludes the mbstJntivc part of the report. Re\u00ad searchers and funding agenue~ m the US were the first to recogmze the importance of manne biotechnology; this recognition re.ulted in an initial spurt of growth m R&D. However, funding levels have stayed about the same over the last three years, so no real growth is taking place in this fidd. As the funding level1s not likely to grow m the foreseeable future, the explo,ive growth that has occurred m general biotechnology cannot take place in marinl' biotechnology. Some additional growth could take place if mdustry became more mterested in marine hiotechnology, but this is an unlikely prospect since so tew applications from this field are m the pipelint>. Unless there ts a major effort to focus U.S. activity in this area, advances in tht> U.S. will be limited to the occaswnal chance discovery of a process, activity or application. National effort designed to produce m.anne biotechnology products and processes would be much more successful, and produce a far greater return to society, than one that relies mostly on chance.

INTRODUCTION Manne biotechnolo!-,ry ha~ emerged as a major component of the biotechnology revolution.lt is rooted in the traditions of manne\u00ad biolob'Y\u00b7 w1th ito; richnes.~ of literature and poetry of scientific discov\u00ad ery. Manne biology has contributed greatly to the over-all discipline of biology, weavmg m the tapestry of the hiologlcal sciences. Infor\u00ad mation from more than 100 years of observation, experimentation, and careful record-keeping is available for the pn:pared minds of molecular biologist5 to refine, probe, and to apply to mciet.il needs m the most environmentally protective ~oay ever possible. The fishes of the sea, strange and bizarre organisms living in the abyssal depths of the oceans, legmm of creatures from tht\u00b7 reefs, produce molecules with potential he-aling and nurturing properties that may be harvest\u00ad ed by clomng the genrs respomihle for the pathways by which these substances are produced. The pharmacopoeia of the sea now can be\u00ad come a reality. a truly remarkable source of new drugs, new cures, and new chemicals, new foodstuffi, and a rich ~ource of protein and nutnems. The tools of molecular biology should make this a reality by the tum of the century. The poetic sweep of the possibilities of manne biotechnolob'Y runs munter to the harsh fact that it ts, however. an underdeveloped science and technoloh'Y\u00b7 with Its own history tracing back only a decade. It is far from the highly mph1sticated stage that mcdtcal biotn\u00b7hnology ha; moved to, \\vhere the potential of gene therapy i~ very nearly reahty. Marine-biotechnology, in contr;~st, IS only in its infancy, still at the discovery stage. There is little or nothing known about the molecular generics of most of the invertebrates of the sea, nor about algae and manne bactena. The available mformation i~ 2 THE GLOBAL (HAUfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY much less than for the conunercia!ly valuable crmtaceam, such as the shrimp. It is ironic that countries like Thailand, Ecuador, and In\u00ad donesia have created maJor mdustnes out of shrimp farming (Ros\u00ad enberry, 1993), yet, little i~ known about genetic mechanisms con\u00ad trolling fertilization, development, growth, and health of shnmp speCies. Although much research and development related to the rna\u00ad nne environment is being done throughout the world, it 1s only re\u00ad cently that a subset of these activities has been termed manne biotechnology. In fact, marine biotechnology was first defined only a decade ago (Colwell, 1993, 1984a,b). Became of its newness, few outside the immediately affected snentific conununity even now arc aware of the richness of the field, its promises, or i~ problems. Our study has been hampered by the lack of a universally accepted defin\u00ad ition of the term \"marine biotechnology,\" as well as by the field's great diversity. In a strict sense, manne biotechnology may be de\u00ad fined a.~ \"a set of scientific techniques that use living manne organ\u00ad isms, or parts of marine orgamsms, such as cells, to make or modifY products, to improve plant<; or ammals, or to develop organisms for specific applications\" (OTA, 1984). However, this definition is be\u00ad lieved by many researchers to be too narrow, i.e., some hold that a host of different R&D activities rightfully are areas of marine biotechnology, including aspects ofbiologtcal oceanography, e.g., use of restriction fragment pattern analysi~ to monitor biological re\u00ad sources of the sea. Takmg mto account the lack of consensus on how marine biotechnology 1s bounded, we do not draw rigid disciplinary line.. in this report. Instead we view marine biotechnology as a field that en\u00ad wmpasses broad scientific and technological activities relating direct\u00ad ly to marine organisms or their parts and ernploymg classical bio\u00ad technology and/ or molecular biology techniques. Thus, a broad def\u00ad inition, and the one we use in this report, is a derivation of the Or\u00ad ganization of Economi..: Co-operation and Development's (OECD) definition (Bullet a!., 1982), namely, marine biotechnology is \"the application of scientific and cngineermg prmciples to the processing of materials by marine biological agent~ to provide goods and ser-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 3 v1ces.\" When molecular biology techniques, such as recombinant DNA, hybndoma/monoclonal production, protem engineering, polymerase cham reaction, and DNA hybridlzation, are used for re\u00ad search and development in certain applied field,., such as aquaculture, fisheries, and natural marme products, we include them under the rubnc ofmarme biotechnology (see Figure 1). This point is impor\u00ad tant because. as we discuss below, some researchers in, for example, the natural products chemistry area claim that they are doing marme biotechnology, while others involved with sm1ilar work assert that they arc not. To illustrate the diVersity of opinions as to what docs and does nm constitute marine biotechnology research and develop\u00ad ment, we include in Appendix l definitions of marine biotechnolo\u00ad gy formulated by snentist\\ l(}cated throughout the world. Even with an agreed upon definition, it is problematic to gener\u00ad alize about manne btotechnology research and development (R&D). This is because marine biotechnology does not define an industry but 1s, mstead, a broad category of technologJcal advance\u00ad ment involving a variety of mdustries, products, and production processes.

The best source of information required to pert{JTm this type of prospective analysis is mdmtry. Therefore, we interviewed scit\"ntists and managers of the small number of companies that could bt: identified as being dedicated to marme biotechnology, and the larger number of companies that had made investments in this field. Information derived from the~c interviews was also entered into MARBIO. Tht\" analysis of MARBIO data allowed us to di~cern corporate strategit--s for marine biotechnology, explore strengths and weaknesses m corporate R&D programs, and identify links ben.reen mdustry and universities. A relatt-d objective- of the project was to evaluate the economic potential of marine biotechnology products. We developed a con\u00ad ceptual framework of product life cycles and demonstrated the use\u00ad fulness of this framework in assessing the importance of marine biotechnology for a given application, e.g., aquaculture. Another major objective of the study WJS to evaluate the com\u00ad petitiveness of U.S. researchers and industry, compared to other countries expendmg resources to develop marine biotechnology as an industry. As we discovered, this is a difficult endeavor since most foreign researchers have only a hazy notion of the term \"marine biotechnology\" and few governments even use the term m their biotechnology strategiC planning. Of the countries we investigated, Australia, Japan and Norway provided subst.amial, useful information about their re<>earch efforts in nurme biotechnology. In each of these cases, we were able to estimate, with a high degree of confidence, those resources that the government and industry wa.~ allocating to thts field. Howewr, detailed information about research units, such as we have been able to compile concerning U.S. researchers, was not available from either official or private sources. Due to limited re\u00ad sources, we were unable to survey Japanese or other fore1gn-ba~ed scientist.~. to develop the kind of database we have compiled on U.S. marine biotechnology. Nevertheless, sufficient information was col-6 THE GL06AL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY lected from the literature and Interviews to permit meaningful com\u00ad parisons of accomplishments among the three countries and to draw some conclusions. Information about marme biotechnology research m countrtt'\\ other than Australia,Japan, and Norway is very hard to obt,un. One major difficulty hes in the difference in definitions, as discus~ed above. Thus, government and private reports on biotechnology m mo~t countrie-; do not list mannc biotechnology as a distinct catego\u00ad ry. If a country supports R&D activitie~ that fall within the purview of what we term marine biotechnology, these act1vities are usually hsted under such headmgs as agricultural, chemtcal, environmental, or pharmaceutical biotechnology. The task, then, of wmpiling data on marine biotechnology in most countrie~ ts arduom and some\u00ad for accurate as~e<:s\u00ad ments of marine biotechnology m specific countries. Therefore, sci\u00ad entific accompli5hments m marme biotechnology described or re\u00ad ferred to m this report, especially m Chapter 1, ongmate mostly fium U.S. and Japanese research institutions. We regret that a lack of resources precluded us from recording the many significant accom\u00ad plishments in this field by researcher.; from other nations. It has to be pointed out, however, that in general we found the level of interest in marine biotechnology to be extraordinarily high\u00b7 in many countries of the world, including industrialized countries (e.g., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and United King\u00ad dom), the newly industrialized countries (e.g., Korea, Tat wan, and Thailand) and developing countries (in particular, China, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, and Philippines).lt is unfortunate that we were un\u00ad able to consider marine biotechnology developments in these coun\u00ad tries and mclude them m this report. The information presented in this report is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, the scientific basis of marine biotechnology is sur\u00ad veyed. Considermg the diversity of marine biotechnology, a review of the field is more manageable for analysis by dividing it into six ar\u00ad ea\\. Examples of research being done m each of these areas are pro\u00ad vided, as well as specifics J.bout the researchers and laboratories in\u00ad volved.

In Chapter 3, we discuss the support that past pre~idential adrnmi~trations and U.S. Congresses have g1ven to the ocean sCJences, in general, and to biotechnology and marine biotechnology, specifically. We also consider support of the Clinton adnunistration and the US. Congress as constituted in 1993-1994. Major federal fundmg agennes and their support of ma\u00ad rine biotechnology research are described, as well a~ state-funded support. Chapter 4 1s a discussion of the economic issues related to manne biotechnology R&D, including product life cycle and its ap\u00ad plication to aquaculture. Chapter 5 discusses safety aspects of marine biotechnology and analyzes po'isible regulatory constramts and con\u00ad sequences for the field. Next, in Chapter 6, an oven'1e\\-\\' of marine biotet\u00b7hnology m Australia is provided, including estimates of smgu\u00ad lar 'itrength~ possessed by that nation. In Chapter 7, an overview of marine biotechnology in Norway 1s presented. Chapter 8 is focused on Japan and it~ endeavors in marine biotechnology. In the final chapter, the degree of U.S. competitiveness versus other countries in marine biotechnology is assessed and some predictions about the fu\u00ad ture direction of marme biotechnology in the U.S. and Japan are of\u00ad fered.

Chapter 1 SciENTIFIC BASIS OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY INTRODUCTION Marine biotechnology, s1milar to general biotechnology, has many aspects and directiom. For manageability, we subdivide the field into six areas: marine aquaculture and biotechnology, marine animal health, marine natural product~. biofilm and bioadhesion in the marine environment, bioremediation, and marine ecology and biological oceanography. Examples of notable research m each of these areas are provided below. MARINE AQUACULTURE AND BIOIKHNOLOGY During the past decade, the farmmg of manne finfish, shellfish, crustaceans, and seaweed has grown significantly in economic value world-wide. However, marine aguaculture in the U.S. has remained relatively limited in scope. For example, total world fish production yield~ from aquacuhure reached circa 14 million metric tons (mnu) in 1991, yet only 0.3 mmt wa.~ produced in the US, nearly three\u00ad quarters of which comprised freshwater organism.\\.

Furthermore, as IS shown be\u00ad low, aquaculture of 5eaweed and phytoplankton can yield high-value products, e~pecially algal-denwd poly~accharides and chemicals that comprise :1 significant fraction of the fisheries contribution to the trade deficit. The marine aquaculture mdustry faces many problems that must be solved before it can achieve significant growth a~ an mdus\u00ad try in the U.S. Non-biotechnolob'Y problem areas include the fol\u00ad loWlng. Further research is needed to advance the husbandry of im\u00ad portant fish and shellfish species, and conventional bree-ding tech\u00ad niques could tmpmve many of these species. Federal and state regu\u00ad latory and funding frameworks must be changed if grmvth of the in\u00ad dustry is to be encouraged. Resolution of a number of policy issues at the federal level would also assist the mdustry enormously (Na\u00ad tional Research Council, 1992). There are, however, contributions from marine biotechnology that could make the aquaculture mdus\u00ad try far more productive than it is at the present rime. Key are genetic mampulation of marine organisms of commercial importance and improved knowledge of molecular and biochemical proces~es of ma\u00ad rine animal and plant speGes. Both would allow for better utilization of the biological resources of the sea. A good example is the progrt'5s being made in regulation of the hormonal control of reproduction of finfish and shellfish in fish farming. Another example of a signifi\u00ad cant potential contribution that marine biotechnology can make to aquaculture is the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of manne or\u00ad !,>anisms grown in aquaculture facilities, an area of research that a~'Jits the full attention thac it deserves. Most of the contributions of biotechnology to aquaculture benefit both freshwater and marine aquaculture. In fact, the distinc\u00ad tion between the two ts rather .artificial, ~ince some species have both freshwater and marine stages in their life cycles. In general, the fol\u00ad lowing dlscus~ion applies to manne orgamsms, but some fundamen\u00ad tal advances of rck\u00b7v:ance for marine aquaculture have been made in freshwater organism~. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 11 Genetic Manipulation of Marine Organisms While we recogmzc that sdt\"Ctive breeding of tish histoncally has played an important role m the aquaculture industry (Hershberg\u00ad er. 1990) dunng the past decade, direct genetic manipulation of fish, usmg recombinant DNA techmques has revolutionized the aquacul\u00ad ture industry :md made it pns<>ihle to develop an entirely new ap\u00ad proach to fish farming. Fish are highly amenable to genetic mampu\u00ad lation, because fish eggs are cha.ractenstically large and, therefore, can be nucro-injcctcd with DNA constructs, after which external fertil\u00ad Ization and subsequent development will take place. MaJor research efforts in genetic manipulation have been directed at enhancement of growth and production of fish with superior resistance to cold temperatures. Also, devdopmg diseast'-reS!Sta.nt fish is an increasingly important objective, since intensive mariculture i~ becommg more common worldwide. Gmwth enhancement in animals induced by the mtroduction of foreign growth hormone (GI-l) genes wa~ first demonstrated a decade ago, using mice. Mice eggs nucro-mJected with rat GH gene constructs yielded larger ammals (Palmiter et al., 1982). Till~ prim:i\u00ad ple of growth enhancement was subsequently employed m fish spec1es of1mportance to aquaculture. The first successful growth hormone experiments using fish was the transfer into goldfish of the human GH gene fused to a mouse metallotbionein promoter (Zhu et al., 1985), y1elding transgernc offSpring signi.ficandy larger than the untreated, control fish (Zhu, 1992). Since then, several vertebrate genes have been fused to a variety of promoters and introduced into fish spectes. Examples mclude the expresston of a mouse metalloth\u00ad ionein-human growth hormone fusion gene in Atlantic salmon (llokkoncs et al., 1989) and bovine growth hormone (expressed from the Rous sarcoma virm long terminal repeat and carp B-actin gene promoters) in walleye !'.a.l.mon (Moav et al., 1992). Of more practical significance has been the achievement of growth enhancement using fish GH. T. Chen, at the Center of Ma\u00ad nne Biotechnology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute (UMBI/COMB) and D. Powers, then at the johns Hopkins Univer\u00ad ~ity and a joint faculty member of the UMBI/COMB, demonstrat-12 THE GlOBAL CHAlLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY ed that gro\\\\.rth hormone m rambow trout is encoded by rv,\u00b7o st\"pa\u00ad rate genes (Agellon al., 1Y88a). A large amount ofbtolo~Kally ac\u00ad tive r.tinbow trout GH was prepared by expressing one of tlw rain\u00ad bow trout GH genes m the bacterium Esrhm.fhia coli. This hormone was admimstcred to rainbow trout by injection or dipping, y1dding enhanced gtmvth of the trout (Agellon et a!., 1988b). Obviously, ex\u00ad large-scale aquacul\u00ad ture, since it 1s labor-intensive and reqmres individual treatment of each fish. A better approach is the generation of transgenic fish. This was first achieved by the transfer of a rainbow trout GH gene to common carp and channel catfish (Zhang et al., 19YO). However, a non-fish gene element was included in this construct since the GH gene was fused to the long tcrmmal repeat ofRous sarcoma virus. \"All-fish\" gene constructs have also been used for growth en\u00ad hancement of fish. E Hackett and colleagues at the University of Minnesota developed exp~ssion vectors containing the proximal promoter and enhancer regulatory element!> of the carp-6 actin gene and the polyadenylation signal from the salmon growth hormone gene (Liu et a!., 1Y90). Growth enhancement was subsequently ob\u00ad tained in Atlantic salmon using an all-fish gene construct. The con\u00ad struct was an antifreeze protein gene promoter linked to a chinook salmon GH gene. These transgenic Atlantic salmon demonstrated enhanced growth (Duet al., 1992). Inheritance and expres.\"iJOn of GH genes in transgenic fish arc complex genetic and metabolic processes. Important considerations in successful numpulation of these processes include tissue specificity and developmental stage specificity of the transcriptional control ele\u00ad ments (Moav et al., 1992), as well as stable mheritance and expres\u00ad sion of the GH genes in the offspring. The f:tst-growmg, transgenic fish, however, cannot yet be used in commercial aquaculture until further progress 1s made in research on these animals. For example, the physiOlogical, nutritional, and em'lronmental factors that maxi\u00ad nnze performance of individual transgenic fish must be determined. Also, safety and envtronmentallmpact issues must be resolved before the large scale, conunercial production of transgenic fish will be per\u00ad mitted by regulatory agenCies (Chen and Powers, 1990). A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AusTRAUA, AND NORWAY 13 Many mannc fish inhabrting cold waters produce proteins which act a_, an \"antifreeze,\" t.e., protect fish by inhibiting the forma\u00ad tion of ice crystals in their serum. almon lack genes coding for these proteins and, therefore, cannot survive m 1cy waters (Hew ct aL, 1991). The mechani<;m whereby antifreeze proteins bind ice crystal~ and inhibit ice forma\u00ad tion has been described (Raymond eta!., 1989). Genes coding for antifreeze proteins in Arctic flounders have been transferred, ex\u00ad pressed, and inherited m Atlantic salmon (Shears et al., 1991). Ex\u00ad pression of an adequate concentration of antifreeze protcms in salmon blood would extend the geographical range within which th1s fish can be cultured. Interestingly, antifreeze proteins from fish may also prove valuable for hypothermic preservation of mammalian organs, especially for transplant operations (Lee et aJ., 1992b). Not only finfish, but also shellfish are amenable to genetic ma\u00ad nipulat:Jon, especially for enhancing both the rate of growth and size of the adult. The exogenous application of bovine Gl I enhanced the growth rates of California red abalone (Morse, 1984). Similar re\u00ad sults were reported when biosynthetic rainbow trout GH was ap\u00ad plied to juvenile oysters (Paynter and Chen, 1991). In contrast to finfish and shellfish, arthropods, such as lobsters, shed their exoskeletons during gmwth, in a molting process which is under hormonaJ control. Thus, endocrine regulation of molting may improve growth effioency tn the lobster. The endocrine regulation ofmolrmg in Crustacea has been revtewed by Chang (1989). How\u00ad ever, knowledge of the molecular genetics of marine crustaceans (shrimp, lobsters, pr.lwns, etc.) must be elucidated before commercia] production of these species will be totally efficient and reliable, i.e., growth, development, and disease resistance have yet to be con\u00ad trolled, and, unfortunately, none has yet been fully achieved.

There is no doubt that molecular genetic information, when obtained, will elundate the mechanism of failure of some fish species to spawn m captivity. Deficie-nt expression of the GnRH gene or lack of GnRH secretion appear to be the best explanations for fail\u00ad ure of spawmng, at the presellt time. Understanding the regulation of GnRH at the molecular level may suggest new approaches to obtain rehable spawnin~. Clearly, by understanding fish endocrinology at the molecular level and appl)'lng this new mformacion to the control of fish reproduction, the aquaculture farmer will employ knowledge denved from molecular genetics increasingly in the industry. Great benefits in aquaculture can be achieved by the production of monosex, or sterile, populations of fish. For reasons not yet under\u00ad stood, in some fish species one sex grmvs faster or is more disease re\u00ad sistant. Furthermore, sterile populations usually achieve better growth rJ.tes, as no energy 1s diverted to gamete production. Mono\u00ad sex populatiom can he obtained by steroid treatment or manipula\u00ad tion of the set of chromosomes, both methods having proved useful in the production of sterile fish. This subject has been discussed in detail by Zohar (19H9) and Yaron and Zohar of gametes, compared to diploids. Triploid oysters contain an extra copy of chromosomes. The successful production of triploid oysters has resulted in a superior product during summer months. At this time of the year, diploid oysters become sexually mature, form soft reproductive tisme throughout the body and de\u00ad plete energy nch glycogen stores, which results in a less tasty product (Allen, 1988). Conditions fOr production of triploid oysters by treat\u00ad ment with the chemical cytochalasin D have been optimized (Dowrung and Allen, 1987). At the present time, triploid oyster pro\u00ad duction has grown rapidly and represent.; over 500/o of the total oy~\u00ad ter production of hatcheries in the Pacific Northwest (Allen, 1988). 16 THE Gt.06AL (HAlliNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY The success of the triploid Pacific oysttT in aquaculture~~ a dramatic illustration of the conm1ercial potential of manipulation of reproduc\u00ad tion in mvercebrates. Endocrine reh'lliation of reproduction may have applications in aquaculture of certain invertebrates, although these applications, in contra.~t to the situation with finfish, are not yet at a practical stage of use. Hormone treatment surely will be useful in shrimp culture, since these invertebrates do not become reproductively mature when grown in aquaculture ponds. ln fact, reproduction of shnmp must be stimulated by manual ablation of the eycstalk, which has negative effects on the animal, such as increased susceptibility to dis\u00ad ease. Purportedly, the purpose of eyestalk ablation is that it removes a gonad-inhibiting neurohormone (GIH) produced by the neurose\u00ad cretory complex located in the eyestalk. By eluCidating the structure and function of ClH, it should be possible to devise strategies to counter the inhibitory effects of GIH by peptide biotechnology, Algal Aquaculture i.e., seaweeds, has been prac\u00ad ticed for several centuries in Astan countries, particularly Japan, and products from these algae have been widely used as medicines and food. Microalgae culrure is practiced in Au~tralia, Israel, and the U.S. Macro- and microalgae yield a wide range of products, including food additives and suppicments, culture media, pesticides, plant gmwth regulators, and antibactenal, anti-cancer and antiviral agents (Harvey, 1988). Some of che bioactive compound~ isolated from ma\u00ad rin~:: albr.~e are discussed on page 25. Microalgae have proven usefitl for large-scale production of the long chain fatty acids, eicosapcntaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa\u00ad hexaenmc acid (DHA) (Kyle eta\\., 1991).

This potential is most likely to be realized by the formation of partnerships with industriali7ed countrie~. However, to achieve success, understanding of the molec\u00ad ular genetics and application of the techniques of modern molecular biology will be required (Singleton and Kramer, 1988). Although molecular techniques have not yet been widely applied to achieve strain enhancement or production of transgenic plants and algae of commerCJallmportance, thi~ approach is being taken m several labo\u00ad ratories in the U.S., Asia, and Europe. Most of this work employs protoplast fusion. However, protoplast fusion has been somewhat limited in application to seaweeds because of difficulties in obtaining plant regeneration from protoplasts of complex algae. Successful ge\u00ad netic manipulation, usmg protopla~t fu~ion, has been achieved in a few cases. For example, protoplast fusion has pmven to be a useful tool in production of red algae hybrids, specifically the commercially valuable, agar-producmg seaweed Gradldria (Cheney, 1990). Success\u00ad ful protoplast been are important since the edihle product, nori, is derived from Porphyra speCies. Direct DNA manipulation, using vectors for gene tramfer or techniques such as electroporanon or biolistics, have not yet been employed suc\u00ad ces.,fully m the genetic studies of the macroalgae. Development of these methods for macroalgae depends on advances in the molecular genetics of algae and algal aquaculture.

Animals raised in intensive aquaculture are especially vulnera\u00ad ble to disease.

Fortunately, several very useful vaccines havt: bt:en developed which confer immunity in fish to bactenal diseases. Vibrio vaccines are currently the most successful, although the constant presence of vibrios in seawater make vibriosts always a potential threat. Mu1tiva\u00ad lcnt Vibn\"o vaccines effective against several Vibrio species will proba\u00ad bly prove most dfective in dlseases caused by vibrios (Smith, 1988). Many of the vaccines in commercial use are killed vaccmes, based on bacterial cultures inactivated with formalin. Molecular methods will be useful in future vaccine development, notably in identification of specific tmmunizmg antigens which can then be produced on a large scale. Vaccines prepared using this approach should be less vari\u00ad able in reported efficacy than thme ba..ed on whole killed cells. A major contribution of marine biotechnology to disease con\u00ad trol m aquaculture has been the use of molecular techniques for rapid, sensitive diagnosis of fish pathogens. Specific DNA probes have been developed for detection of Aeromonas salmonicida (Barry, 1990) and Vibrio an,~uillan~rn Q. L Powell, University of Otago, New Zealand, personal communication). Monoclonal antibody detection systems have been used to detect several important bactenal pathogens, mcluding terium salmoninarum, a bacterium difficult to detect by conventional culture techniques because of its slow growth rate (Arakawa et al., 1987). 20.

A useful model iystem for the study of dinoflagellates, which arc common ectoparasites of marmc fish, is the dinoflagellate, Amyloodinium ofrlfatum, which has been ~ucces.~fully propagated on a fish gill cell line (Noga, 1987). A recently discovt>red \"phantom\" dinoflagellate has been identi\u00ad fied as the causative major fish kills m estuaries of the south\u00ad ea..~tern U.S. and may also be active in other geographic regions. This dinoflagellate reqmres ltve excystment, it releases a potent neurotoxin that causes fish death. Within several hours of death, the dinoflagellate encysts and settles back into the sea-bottom sediment, to await favorable conditions, when the cycle begins anew (llurkholder et al., 1992). Molecular techniques wiU be useful in elucidluon of the mecha\u00ad nisms of pathogenesis and devdopment of host resistance to these and other fish para~ite<i. Because so little 1s understood of the mecha\u00ad nisms of fish mmmmty to parasites, further research is necessary to assess the potential for vaccine development (Houghton et al., 1988). Diseases of Marine lnvertebates Bacterial, fungal, viral, and protozoan diseases also adversely af\u00ad fect both natural and cultured stocks of m.anne shellfish.

MARINE NATURAL PRODUCTS Ironically, enzymes resulting from marine biotechnology have made possible some important new techniques in biotechnology, e.g. high-temperature-resistant polymerases, which are employed in the polymerase chain reaction.

The latter compound ha~ heen licensed to PhannaMat, S.A., Spain (Anonymous, 1994). Sponges have proven to be an important source of bioactive compounds. Dysirun-type sesquiterpenes with antihelmintic activity (Horton et al., 1990) and several cytotoxic heterocycles (Qumoa et al., 1986) are among the compounds Isolated by researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Researchers in Sc4euer's labo\u00ad ratory at the University of Hawaii in Manoa have Isolated a number of cytotoxic compound~ from marine ~ponges (Akee et al., 1990; Carroll and Scheuer, 1990). The Harbor Branch Oceanographic ln\u00ad stirution, Ft.

For example, the National Cancer Institute (NCI). U.S. Pubhc Health Service, has established a st\u00b7reening system consisting of 60 in vitro cell lines representing seven cancer sites: blood cells; brain; colon; kidney; lung; ovary; and skin (Ansley, 1990). Extracts from many marine organisms are tested for their cytotoxic activity and additional tests are performed to detect anti-HIV activity, using a human lymphoblastic cell line mfected with the AIDS viru5. Some pharmaceutical companies also screen marine Isolates for anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and herbicidal ac\u00ad tivities, in addition to cytotoXIc and anti-viral screernng (Cardellina, 1986). 26 THE GLOBAl CHALLENGE OF MARINE BKJTECHNOLOGY Biooctive Compounds From Marine Algae Marine alga have been a major subject of investigation by Ger\u00ad wick's group at Oregon State nlalian msulin release modulator a potent manm1alian immunohormonc (Ucrnart and Gcrwick, 1988) are among the biomedically nnportant compounds Isolated from these algae. Red marine algae haw been shown to be a rich source of eico<;anoid-typc natural products. They produce several expensive and rare biochemicah that have previomly been Isolated only from mammalian sources (Gerwick et al., 1990). Researchers at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Ft. Pierce, FL have Isolated a compound from the marine alga, Hal\u00ad imeda tuna, that shows antiviral activity (Koehn eta!., 1991). Howev\u00ad er. the potential of marine microalgae ha.~ not yet even begun to be exploited and, therefore, a major search program is dearly warranted. Bioactive Compounds From Marine Bacteria Marine bacteria have enormous potential for the production of bioactive compound~ and pharmaceuticals, but have been relatively little investigated. William Femcal and his group at Scnpps Institu\u00ad tion of Oceanography are perhaps the most active and successful U.S. n:searchers ~tudying bioactive metabolites in marine bacteria. For example, they have isolated from deep-sea bacterium a series of novel cytotoxiC and antiviral macrolides, the macrolactim and have produced them by bactenal fermentation (Gustafson, ct al, 1989). Al~o. Fenical working with others isolated antibiotics with selective activity agamst Gram positive bacteria from a Streptomyces specit\"S ob\u00ad the surface ofajeUyfish (Trischman,et al, 1994). [c i~ possible that many of the compounds isolated from marine organisms, such as sponges, are produced by bacteria associated with those sponges. For example, several diketop1perazines previously as\u00ad cribed to the sponge, Tedania i.f!ni~, have been shown to be produced by a marine Mimc<,am sp. a.~sociated with thts sponge (Sricrle et al., 1988).

There an\" sev\u00ad ral practical advantages in the use of bacteria as sources of natural roducts. Many bactena can be readily grown in fermenters under ontrolled conditions, providing consistent y1dd of compounds of ttcrcst.

However, the molecu\u00ad .r genetics of invertebrates IS poorly understood, as cited previously ride .1upra). Production of compounds by bacteria can be enhanced, often y several orders of magnitude, by optimization of fermentation ::mditions and by selection nf high-pmducing mutants. ln addition, eneric manipulation of bacteria is relatively easy, and genes of mter\u00ad it can be cloned into expression vectors and transferred to bacterial Jecies that are well-adapted for producrion of compounds by fer\u00ad lentation processes. For these reasons, it is advantageous to mvesti\u00ad ate whether natural products ascribed to marine invertebrates may, I \" r ' I'' I ! l -,: ' ;; ' :; .. 28 THE GLOBAL (HAUENGE Of-MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY m fict, be produced by bacteria as~oCJated with the mvertebrates and co investigate spenfic species of manne bactena, in particular those bacteria closely associated with Invertebrates, e.g., symbionts, as po\u00ad tential sources of natural products. In some cases, bactena may be present m extracellular a.ssociations and readily cultured, for example as found with isolates from the Caribbean sclerosponge, Ceratoporella ni(hoL>oni (Santavy et al., 19'-JCI), some of with antibacterial and antineoplastic activity (Colwell eta!., 198lJ). There is a range of interdependence between bactermm and host and there is evidence that some bactcrial-mvertebrate symbioses may date from the Precambnan era (Wilkinson, 1984). In ca~es where true symbiotic relatiomhips exist between host and bacten\u00ad um, it may be exrremely difficult or impossible to isolate and rnam\u00ad tain the bacterium in pure culture. Molecular approaches are very useful m such cases. For example, luminescent symbionts of some manne fish have not yet been isolated into pure culture but have, in\u00ad stead, been characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Hay\u00ad good and Distel, 1993). Tota..l DNA can be extracted from the invertebrate (and tts resi\u00ad dent microbial population) and a composite gene library of the total DNA can be produced in an appropriate hmt. The genes coding: fi.Jr useful products can be tsolated fi-om the composite library by ming appropnate screening procedures. This \"genetic fishing\" procedure obviates the need for pnor determination of the cellular source of the products of imerest and has the potential of facilitating rapid, large-scale production of marine natural products. Actinomycetes iu the nLanne environment are a group of gram\u00ad positive bactena that have been little mvestigated but which are known to be metabolically versatile and to produce ma.ny bioactive compounds, including antibiotics. Terrestrial actinomycetes produce over two-thirds of naturally-occurring antibiotics, including many of medicaltmportance (Okami and Hotta, 1988). Although not com\u00ad monly regarded as an important microbial group in marine ecosys\u00ad tents, in which gram-negative bacteria are believed to dominate the microbial populations, several recent reports indicate that marine en\u00ad vironments are an important new source of actinomycetcs.

Marine Toxins Marine toxms may be defined as marine natural product~ that have specific pharmacological activities resulting m adverse effects in animals, generally at very low concentrations. Many manne toxms are pmduced by dinoflagellates and may be n:tained or concentrated through several trophic levels before exerting adverse effects on predators higher in the food chain (including man). Examples of toxin~ fium dinoflagellates capable of causing fatal poisonmg m man nguatoxin a11d ~axitoxin. Ciguatoxill 1s a sodium channel agonist and 1s generally considered to be produced by dinoflagellates associ\u00ad ated with coral redS (Swift and Sv.rift, 1993). There are, however, m\u00ad dications that ciguatoxin may be produced by bacteria, including the 30 THE GlOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY cyanobacterium Oscillatoria rrylhmra (Hahn and Capra, 1 992). An important marine toxin found in many marine animal~ is the potent sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxm, also kno\\vn as puffer 6sh toxin. However, this toxin abo has been found m a wide range of manne bacteria (Ya.~umoto et al., 1 Y86; Sirnidu et aL, 1987) The presence of thts neurotoxin in m.my distantly related animal genera therefore may indicate production of the toxm by bacteria as\u00ad sociated with these animals. Kogurc and coUeagtH_\u00b7s have discovered tetrodotoxin to be produced by sediment bacteria and burrowing animals (Kogure eta!., 19R8). A variety of bacteria, including Vi\"brio species, have been shown to produce tetrodotoxtn (Simidu et al., 1987). The production of tetrodotoxm by Vibrio dwlnae wa~ report\u00ad ed by Tamplin et (1987). Molecular approache-s will be useful in unden;tanding toxtn production and in dcvismg methods for detec\u00ad tion of toxins, such as the method recently described for the detec\u00ad tion of tetrodotoxin (Raybould et al., 1992). Soft corals of the genus Palythoa contain the marine toxin, paly\u00ad toxin, that may have application in treatment of cancer. A palytox:m prodrug was shown to be activated by a monoclonal cillin G amidase conjugate to give tmaci\u00ad ty to carcinoma and lymphoma cell (Bignanu et al., 1992a). A sensitive monoclonal antibody-based immunoassay has been devel\u00ad oped for the measurement of palytoxm m biological samples (Bigna\u00ad mi et al., 1992b). ToXlm are of mtert\"it in the context of manne natural products because they may have useful medical applications, if appropriate dosages and delivery systerns can be devised. They also have applica\u00ad tion as research tools, particularly in a smgle genus of predatory cone snails may prove to have pharmaceutica1 potential comparable to that of plant alkaloids or the fermentation products of microorganisms. Conus spenes (approximately 500 in number) produce a vast range of pharmacologically active, small peptides, the targets of which include calcium channels, sodium channels, N-methyi-D-aspartate receptors, acetylcholine receptors, and vasopressin receptors (Olivera et al., 199()).

With more methodical and ex-panding screening programs now underv.ray, the range and scope of bioactivity of manne natural products will yield a plethora of new com.pounds of biomedical interest, as weU as provide a better understanding of organism-orgamsm and organism-cnvuonment interactions in the sea. Cell Culture and Marine Nafunll Produds Production of natural products, from marine uivertebrates m particular, is frequently limited by ecological factors. Natural prod\u00ad ucts ace often present m trace concentratiom and the harvesting of a large number of marme invertebrates may be necessary to produce sufficient quantities of natural products for therapeutic use or even for charactenzation of their molecular structure to enable organic ~ynthesis. An attractive possibility to circumvent this barrier is the production of narural products by cell cultures derived from inverte\u00ad brates which synthesize the important product, i.e., the product of intere;c. Work to develop cell culture of marine invertebrates lags seri\u00ad omly behind that of other ammal species, even finfish, for which many cell lines have been established. There are no established ma.\u00ad nne mvertebrate cell lines available to date, aJrhough pnmary cul\u00ad tures of several mollusks, been re\u00ad ported (Pompom, 1 lj91). For example, the culture of unsp<.\u00b7cificd oyster cells (Perkins and Menzel, 1964) and cardiac tissue cells (Li et al., 1966) were described as early as the 1960s and the in vitro culture of presumptive nervous tissue from the oyster has recently been re\u00ad ported (Kleinschuster and Swink, 1992). There remains a large gap m developing cdl lines of invertebrates, especially crustaceans. Thus, it 1~ not surprismg that there are no reports of the pro\u00ad duction of natural products from cell cultures of marine inverre-32 THE GlOBAL 0-tAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLCGY brates, given the very limited succe<>.<; of cell culture m these ammak Efforts co develop marine mvertt'brate cell culture techniques fOr large-scale production ofbioacrive compounds should b~ dir~cted to specific groups as the sponges, bryozoans, and a<i\u00ad cidians, v.\u00b7hich yield compounds of substantial pbar\u00ad rnaceutical interest (Pomponi, 1lJ91).

Hyperthermophilic archaea grow at temperatures over lOWC and, therefore, systems that are suble at cndonudea<ics, have im\u00ad portam applications m molecular biology.

A recent development is the emergence of the ligase cham reac\u00ad tion (LCR), a new technique for detection of mutations m DNA (Murray, 1989). The ligase cham reaction employs a thermostable DNA lig\"ase to detect, amplify, and distinguish specific DNA se\u00ad quences. Thus, thermosuble DNA ligases will have significant, new applications m the future.

Alternatively, from these microorganisms the 1solation of enzymes suitable for particular m\u00ad dustrial applications v.ill be a productive path of research, as well. Abundant Marine Natural Products There are several manne products dut are available m very large quantities that may mcrease in importance ao; valuable resource' 34 THE Q08AL (HAillNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY through the applications of marme biotechnology. Three of these, chitin. polysaccharide<>, and kdp offer good examples and are consid\u00ad ered in detail here. Millions of pounds of chitin are generated annually as waste products by the seafood industry. This abundant biopolymer and its byproducts, chitosan and N-acetylglucosanune, can be useful in sev\u00ad eral mdu~trial and medical applications. Chitin has made it to market in a variety of forms, 1.e., as poultices to heal wounds, extenders, emulsifiers for photography. Applications of chitin products mdude t9R6), pharmaceuticals sutures al., 19H4). Demonstrating its wide scope of apphcations, when added to soil chitm has been found to inhibit the growth of fungi pathogeruc to plants (Mitchell and Alexander, 1962). Further, the marine polymer chitosan, whKh can be derived from crmtacean shells, is effective m protecting cer\u00ad tain crops against pathogenic fungi and other disease-causmg pathogens by activating disease-resistance genes (Hadwiger et al, 1 9H4). Thus, chitin and chitosan may have applications beneficial in agriculture. Current mechamcal and chemical methods for 1solatwn of chitin from shellfish wastes are relatively harsh and inefficient. Enzy\u00ad matic methods would be preferable for the purification of chitin and production of chitin byproducts. Many bacteria, mcluding marine bactenal species of the genera Vibrio (Wortman 1986) and Strrptomym (Pi~ano eta!., 1992), produce chitinases which may be usefill Chemotaxis of marine bactenum. degrada\u00ad tion of chitin oligosaccharides by this bacterium have been demon\u00ad strated (Uassler et al., 199tb), indicating that this bactenum also has potential fi.lr chitinase production. If and when the genes for chitin synthesis are cloned, produc\u00ad tion of thi~ compound will mcrease immea~urably since a stable source will tht\"n he available. Manne biotechnology has an es,sential role to play Ill the discovery and large-scale production of many oth\u00ad er marine natural products like chitin. Cloning of chitinase enzymes from marine bacteria (Wortman eta!., !9R6) is one approach that A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, ANO NORWAY 35 can bt: followed to d~vdop enzymatic systems for production of use\u00ad ful chttin derivatives. Many marine bacteria product: abundant polysaccharides, which may have commercial application as viscostty-increasing agents, gelling agents, or adhesives (Colwell et aL, 1985). Another marine source of polysaccharides is seaweed. Polysaccharides tTom seaweed~ are unpnrtant economically and are widely used in indus\u00ad try. For example, carrageenin from the red seaweeds is an extender in foods and related products, ranging from toothpaste to evaporated milk (Witt, 1985). Marine algae and seaweeds have many conune-r\u00ad cial applications and are discussed on pa~~;e 15. One aspect appropnatcly discussed here ts the use of kelp as a source of methane. The Giant Paci6c kelp. ,\\.faaocy.His pyr[(Cra, is par\u00ad ticularly suitable as a substrate in \"lnew of its high growth rate, high ratio of readily degradable organic compounds in its composition, and the soluble nature of its major orgamc constituents. A marine methanogenic consortium of bacteria capable of methane produc\u00ad tion from kelp was charactenzcd by Sowers and Ferry (1984). Methanogenesis from biomass offers several advantages. Notably, up to 90% of biomas.<; energy may be recovered as methane. The low solubility of med1ane facilitate\" collection and the methane is a read\u00ad ily usable and transportable fuel (Sowers and Ferry, 1984). BIOFILMS AND BIOADHESION IN !HE MARINE ENVIRONMENT Biofilms rapidly form on clean surfaces in ~eawater. The com\u00ad ponents of these films are, initialiy, organic molecules, followed by bacterial attachment and, subsequently, other microorganisms and larger animals, such as oyster larvae and barnacles. The study of biofihns has been directed at deVIsing strategies to control biofouling of surfaces, understanding mechanisms of bioadhesion, and investi\u00ad gating ecological relationshtps within biofilms and between biofilm~ and organisms m the surrounding water. The formation of biofibns on hulls of ships leads to biofouling, which greatly reduces fuel effiCiency. It ba_<; been t:Stimated that a 2t ){) 36 THE GLO&Al CHAllENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY j..Un-thick layer on a ship's hull can decrease speed by 20% (Curtin, 1985), with a concomitant reduction m fud effinency. Apphcation of anti-fouling but these paint~ frequently contam toxJC compounds, such as heavy metals, including tributyltin, which are tox1c and pollute the marine environment. The anti-fouling agents also inhibit larval de\u00ad Boyden et al., 1975; Calabrese et al, 1977). Copper and zinc were shown to accumulate in microbia.! biofilms and inh1bit oyster set even at sublethal water column con\u00ad centrations of these metals (Chang et al., 1993). Research on factors controlling formation of the initial ftlm by marine bacteria on sur\u00ad faces should lead to the development of non-toXJc methods for pre\u00ad vention ofbiofouling. Possibilities mclude use bio6lm formation and \"biological control\" of biofouling, using thin bacterial biofilms which restst further colonization. New types of\"non-stick\" pamts depend for their effectiveness on the in\u00ad ability of organisms to adhere strongly to them, rather than prevent\u00ad ing all fouling (Cooksey and Wigglesworth-Cooksey, 1992). The physmlogical activities of biofilm bactena frequently differ from those of freely suspended cells. Improved understanding of the un\u00ad derlying mechanisms ofbiofilm metabolism will be important in dealing effectively with biofi1ms (Aetcher, 1992}. Biofilms have been implicated m corrosion processes and con\u00ad trol of the biologtcal processes involved in formation of biofilms should, therefore, be important in preventing metal corrosion in sea\u00ad water. Microorganisms are hypothesized to be involved in hydrogen embrittlement, which results in loss of ductility and tensile strength of susceptible metals. The generation of sufficient hydrogen to affect susceptible metals has been demonstrated with bacterial films pre\u00ad pared using pure cultures (Walsh ct al., 1989a). However, the relative 1mportance of these laboratory findings with complex brofilms m natural marine environments is not yet clear. Bacterial biofiltru have been implicated as factors in corrosion of copper and nickel in sea\u00ad water (Little eta!., 1990). Corrosion of bare steel in seawater was in\u00ad creased two-fold by a mixed culture of marine bacteria but, interest\u00ad ingly, was decreased seven-fold by a different nuxed culture (Walsh A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 37 and Jones, 1990). The mteractions between biofibm, metals, and pro\u00ad tecuve coatings applied to metals are complex and \"decoating\" processe~, whereby consortia of marine bacteria initiate corrosion, W11l require a great deal more research. The molecular biology of these interactions IS under study and this information should prove hdpful ultimately m developing methods to prevent corrosion. The other, more positive side of biofilms 1s that they play an 1mporcam ecologtcal role in settlement and metamorphosis of ma\u00ad rine invertebrate~. This interaction has been studied m detail using larvae of the commercially important eastern oyster, Crassostrea vir\u00ad girlica, and the Pacific oyster, CrassostTra gJJ:as, UMilL Biofi\\m.s of the marine bacterium, Shewtmella cvlwelliana, were shown to be beneficial to \"set\" of oyster larvae {Weiner et aJ., 1989). \"Set\" is a general term that refers to both settlement and metamorphosis of larvae, although these processes may be triggered by different cues. Sculement behavior appears to be mitiated by L-DOPA and may also be triggered by ammonia produced by bactena in the films (Bonar et al., 1990). S. co!Jvel/iana synthesizes two ryrosmase the to L-DOPA, which appears be unpor\u00ad tant in the induction of settlement behavtor by biofilms. The me/A gene has been ~equenced (Wemer et al., 1991) and codes for a unique enzyme that mediates mdanogenesl.'i and may provide a positive cue, influencing larvae to cement permanently onto a sur\u00ad face. The meL1 gene j, essential for melanin biosynthesis in thi; bac\u00ad terium (Fuqua and Weiner, 1993). In addition, an acidic cxopolysac\u00ad charide 1s produced by S. wlwelliatw and this also appears to be an unportant cue for oyster set (Weiner et al., 1991). Detailed elucida\u00ad tion of factors important in oyster set is being used to develop meth\u00ad ods to enhance the setting process in natural waters and aquaculture facilities in commercial culture. Hioadhesion of bacteria, other microorgamsms, and mverte\u00ad brares 1s a sequence of events characteri~tic ofhiofilm formation that has been ~tudied by many investigators. One of several important ap\u00ad phcatiom i~ the production of water-resistant adhesives. Re-;ult<. of work at the University of Maryland on the marme bactermm, AI-38 THE GLOBAL bactenum has great potential a~ an adhe~1ve (Abu et al., 1 991). The adhesive strategies of marine mussels have been explored by H. Waite and coworkers at the University ofDela\\vare, who hav\u00b7e studied formation of byssal threads, by which the mussel> attach to ~olid surfaces (Waite, 19H3). The threads f0111prise a core of collagen and elastin, surrounded by a tough, durable vanmh denved finm a polyphenolic protein and catecholoxidase. The polyphenolic protem has a highly repetitive structure, rich in L-DOPA (Waite, 1991). Analogues of this protem have been produced by recombinant DNA technology (Filpula et al., 1990) and may be useful as protein-based medical adhesives (Strausberg and Link, 1990). Cell-TakT\u00b7~. a crude preparation of the polyphenolic protein extracted directly from mm\u00ad sels, is used to enhance attachment of cells and tissues in culture (Notter, 1988). Ahhough some progress has been made in the study of certain aspects of biofilms and bioadhesion, many basic questions remam concernmg natural biofilms. Complex factors involved in the inter\u00ad actions between bacteria and surfaces have been reviewed hy Fletch\u00ad er (19S7, 1990). Interesting scientific questions pertaining to biofilms that remain to be answered include: what organisms are present in natural biofilms, what are their metabolic and genetic interactions, and what IS the role of extracellular polymers in biofilm structure (Wahh et al., 1989b). Molecular techniques are becoming increasingly important for [he study of natural biofilms. For example, advances in the me of species--pecific DNA probes for identification of smgle microbial cells m nature (Gmvannoni, 19S8) (discussed on page 48) have proven extremely useful for investigation of the community struc\u00ad ture of bwfilms. With fluorescent rRNA-targeted hybridization probes, it is now possible to quantifY the cellular content of ribo\u00ad ~omes ofsmgle cells of in nmltJSpenes, anaerobic biofilms. Th1s scientific advance makes it possible to infer the generation time of cells in situ and, therefore, to compare cell growth in young and established biofilms A REFORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 39 (Poulsen eta!., 1993). Application of novel microscopic techmques to study bacterial adhesion to surfaces (Fletcher, 19HB) and of con\u00ad focal scanning laser mrcroscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy to examine intact biofihns are providing new ins1ghts. BIOREMEDIATlON Bioremediation of pollutanh in the marine environment is an fidd of rnanne biotechnology that is still in its infancy, but one that has great potential tOr dealing with pollutants that may be extremely difficult or impossible to remove usmg other approaches. The a~pect ofhioremediation in the marine environment that has received most attention is degradation of hydrocarbons, in particular petroleum products, which enter the marine environment from oil drliling, loading of tankers, catastrophic oil spills, and by natural seepage from oil-bearmg sediments. Environmental paramett:rs that affect micro\u00ad bial degradtt:ion of hydrocarbons m the environment and metabolic and genetic factors that are important in this process have been ex\u00ad tensively reviewed (Walker and Colwell, 1977; Atlas, 1981; Atlas, 1984; Leahy and Colwell, 1990). Biodegradation of petroleum in the marine environment is a complex process. PhysJCal and chemical factors that affect this process mdude chemical composition, physical state, and concentration of the oil or hydrocarbon, as well as temper\u00ad ature, salinity, oxygen and nutrient availability, and water activity. Im\u00ad portant biological factors influencing rate of biodegradation include the suite of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms that arc pn:sent and adaptation of these microorganism.~ by pnor exposure to hydro\u00ad carbons (Leahy and Colwell, 1990). In view of the complexity of microbial dcgradation of hydro\u00ad carbons, it perhaps 1s not ~urprising that the effectiveness of attempts to enhance natural degradation processes 1s not completely clear. Bioremediation attempts to treat oil spills have to date used nutrient addition to cnhanct: the growth of the indigenous bacteria, the addi\u00ad tion of laboratory-grown inocula, or a combination of the addition of an inoculum with specific fertilizer (Prince, 1993). Only the fi>r\u00ad mer has been shov.'ll to work unequivocally (Bragg et al., 1994), al~ though promising remits have also been reported for the combina-40 THE GlOBAl (HAUENGE Cf MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY cion of ~elected bactenal moculum plus a fertilizer designed to specifically stimulate dw growth of the inoculum (Rosenberg et al., 1992). Many other approaches have been suggested, mcluding the use of bacteria with dispersants, and the use of microbially produced surfactants. Nitrogen and phosphorus are frequently hmitmg nutrients in the marine environment and it has been demonstrated experimen\u00ad tally that the supply of these nutrients can limit microbial degrada\u00ad tion of hydrocarbons lJl es\u00ad tuarine water and sediment (Walker and Colwell, 1974). Encourag\u00ad ing result'\\ were obtained by Jzcrs in near-shore en\u00ad vironments. A potential effect of fertilizer addition IS a direct toxic effect on susceptible marme life; ecological and toXlcological cffccl~ off.:nilizers must, therefore, be monitored (Clark et al., 1991). Seeding ml spills with active hydro<\u00b7arbon-degrading microor\u00ad ganisms is hypothesizt:'d to reduce the imtiallag period before the indigenous community respond.<. to the oil spill (Atlas, 1991) or to nutrient addition. In a trial following an oil spill that came ashore in mar~hes in Galveston, Texas, portions of contaminated marshlands were treJ.ted with the bacterial bioremediation agent Alpha BioSea. However, the effectiveness of this treument was not dear (Mearns, 1991). Conversely, the use ofbioremediation to degrade oil on beaches in Alaska after the Exxon H.lldez oil ~pill, using a combina\u00ad tion of slow~rclea.se and oleophilic fertilizer, was generally successful at stimulating the natural rate of degredation several fold. providing the fertilizer was effectively applied (Bragg et al., 1(}(}4). In some cas\u00ad es fertilizer nutrients were not delivered to oiled sub-surface sedi\u00ad ments d~pite application to the beach, and it is dear that momtor\u00ad ing nutrient delivery should be an importanr part of any future ap\u00ad plications. Many bacteria that degrade hydrocarbons produce extracellular ~urfactants to render the hydrocarbons more bioavailable, and these biosurfactants have often been suggested as tools for spill response. For ex<~mple, Harvey ct al. (1990) reported laboratory experiments where biosurfactants enhance oil removal fium beach material. Such A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 41 products will have to compete m the market place with chemical products that generally are much cheaper, and it 1s not cle.ar that bio\u00ad surfactants w11l be commercially vtable for remediation. Biological surfactants have been useful in the emulsification and removal of res1dual oil moil tankers (Rosenberg et al., 1975), but, again, cost is an 1mportant tssue, and such products are not in use today. Never~ rhd~s work continues m this area. Thus, the alkane hydrocarbon\u00ad degrading- bacterium, Acitrctobactcr calwaceliws RAG-1, has been emulsify hydrocarbons efficiently by production of an emulsif)11ng factor, termed Emulsan (Rosenberg et aL, 1979). Ernul\u00ad san and Acinctobt.Utcr calcoareticus RAG-I have been extensively stud\u00ad ied and both top1cs were reVIewed by Rosenberg (1986) and Ros\u00ad enberg et al. (19R9).ln a recent study of the role of lipase in emulsi\u00ad fication of hydrocarbons by Acinetobaaer calcoa\u00a3Ciirus RAG-1, the physiology and growth of the wild type strain on hydrocarbons was compared to that and of fatty polysaccharide backbone of emulsan (Leahy, 1993). Undemanding the physiology and molecular genetics of surfactant production by marine strains, such a.<> Acinctobarter calcoacetirus RAG-1, will facilitate production of these sutfanants use m bioremediation in both manne and ter\u00ad restrial environments. Clearly, bioremediation was mccessful fOllowing the Exxon U1ldez spill, where it was used to stimulate the natural degredation of ml that landed on gravel shores (Price, 1993; Bragg et al., 1994). Bioremediation has not yet been shown to be effective on oil spills in the open ocean, and this warrants further investigation. An inter\u00ad esting suggestion made recendy is the use of hollow glass beads coat\u00ad ed \\VJth the catalyst titanium dioxide, which in the presence of light mitiates oxidation oflarge organic molecules such as hydrocarbons. The hypothesis is that natural microbial degradation should procet:d more rapidly with more soluble, partially oxidized molecules (Rosenberg et al., 1992). Another approach that has comiderable po\u00ad tential is the use of bacterial strams manipulated by recombinant .42 THE GlOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE 810TECHI'>f)l(X)Y DNA methods to improve capabilitieS for hydrocarbon degradation and suitability as seed organisms. The disadvantage of the mob:ular genetic approach 1s that use of genetically engineered microorgan\u00ad isms in the environment remains a contentious issue (Leahy and Colwell, 1990). Degradation of hydrocarbons in marine and estuarine sediments is likely to be dependant on degradativc pathways diffcn:nt from those occurring in the water column because of the anaerobic con\u00ad ditions below a thin surface layer of sediment. Preexposure to poly\u00ad cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was shown to enhance mbsequent rates of hydrocarbon degradation in orgamc-nch, aerobic marine sediments (Bauer and Capone, 1988). Also, degradation of oxidized aromatic hydrocarbons has been shown to occur under anaerobic ,.-onditions. It is important to note that microbial consortia are effective in metabolizing hydrocarbons other than oil. Such anaerobic degrada\u00ad tive processes were reviewed by Leahy and Colwell (1990), who concluded that bioremediation of pollutants in the marine environ\u00ad me-nt, other than hydrocarbons, has been too little studied. In gener\u00ad al, pollutants frequently are dispersed over very wide arca5, bccommg bFfeatly diluted tn the process. Furthermore, pollutants such as heavy metals. and pesticide res1dues may retain toxic effects for susceptible ntarine organisms, even at very low concentrations. Unfortunately, there\u00b7 is only very meager mfOrmation on the fate of pesticide residue-s m the marine environment, although biodegradation of pes\u00ad ticides m terrestrial (MacRae, 198'J). Bioremediarion may be the only practica\u00ad ble method for removal of these pollutants smce other options, e.g., incineration, landfill, burial, de. do not apply. In any ca.~e, application of molecular genetic techniques, such as the use of gene probes to detect and monitor organisms with specific biodegradative capabili\u00ad ties, will provtde useful tools for in 5itu treatments. Interestingly, it may be possible to monitor expression of specific b10dcgradative ~ene~ by detection of messenger RNA transcripts of those genes and these approaches are discussed on page 48. Another approach that has heen proposed is the usc of regulatory gene promoters that arc A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 43 highly cxpn\u00b7sst:-d m low nutrient conditions, such as those typiL\u00b7ally found m seawater, to give sdeaive expn.\u00b7ssmn of desired genes m mttabobcally sluggish populations ofbacteria (Mann, 1991).

Etfec\u00ad tiwness of in situ (or open system) bioremt:-diation of organic pollu\u00ad tants has been difficult to demonstrate m many cases.

Research on bioremediation and b10degradation processes m soil and groundwater can yield information useful for bioremcdia\u00ad tion of contaminated marine sites. For example, in a study of the biodegradation of creosote and pentachlorophenol in contammated groundwatt:r, it was found that mdigcnous microorganisms could degrade the majority of the orgamc contaminants. However, toxtcity and teratogenicity of the biotreated groundwater decreased only slightly, indicating that toxicity and teratogemcity were assoCJatcd with compound~ difficult to degrade by the mdigenous nucruorgan\u00ad !SnlS (Mueller et al., 1991). One approach, of course, 1'\\ to develop genetically engmeered microorganisms with specific ca.pabilitJe~ agairut the most toxic, recalcitrant components. 44 THE GlOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Heavy metal pollution of seawater and sediments may be par\u00ad ticularly damagmg to marine ecosystems. Heavy mctah pemst for long periods. For example, high mercury concentrations were found in marine sediments and m crabs, shrimps, and oysters ca. 21 yean after a mercury release from a chlor-alkali plant mto Lavaca Bay, Texas {Palmer et al., 1992). High contanunation of the coastal rna\u00ad nne enviTonment by many metals (and pesticide residues and hydro\u00ad carbons as well) has been found to be assocJatL'd with dense urban areas on the East and West coasts of the U.S. (Valette-Silver and O'\u00ad Conner, 1992). High heavy metal concentrations were measured in stranded Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins (Haubold and Tarpley, 1992), demonstrAting entry into, and concentration of these toXIC pollutants in, the food chain. Very likely, bioremediation of heavy metals in marine ecosystems will be a future beneficial application of marine biotechnology. Hacteria capable of concentrating silver (Goddard and Bull, 1989) and copper (Dunn and Bull, 1983) have been reported and an actinomycete was recently Isolated that accumulated uramum and lead (Golab et al., 1992). Meta1 resistant a<:tinomycetes have been isolated from heavily polluted sediments m the Inner Harbor ofBa1- timore (Amoroso et al., 1993). Bacteria that tolerate and accumulate metals or that convert metals to less toxic forms may be useful m bioremediation of heavy metal pollution in the marine environ\u00ad ment. However, application ofbioremediation for effective treatment of pollutants m the rnanne environment requires further research on the metabolic capabilities ofmanw: and estuarme microorganisms. Fortunately, the substantial progress made m bioremediation of soils and groundwater is likely to spur progress m marine systems. Devel\u00ad opment of molecular approaches to monitor microorganimH m the environment will be important. Issues associated with release of ge\u00ad netically engineered microorganisms into the environment will also influence progress in marine bioremediation. High accumulations of polyhalogenated and polynuclear aro\u00ad matic hydrocarbons and their degradation products have occurred in some aquatic ecosystems (Safe, 1984).

An alternative approach IS the use of eDNA clones of rain\u00ad bow trout cstrogcn-rcsponsiv!: gtnes and growth hormone gene as molecular probes (Chen, 1988). In appropriate rainbow trout cell culture S)'\"Stems, these probes could be used to detect the presence of xenobiotics and, thereby, serve to elucidate molecular mechanisms of toxicity. Microorganisms can be useful indicators of elev:ued levels of xenobiotics, notably with dilferent chemical species of mercury compound~, microbial communities were found to be resistant to Hg++, which was present at near toXIc levels, but nunimal. acclimation was observed fi>r CHJHgCl, which did not ap\u00ad toxic levels (Liebert et al., 11J91).

There have been some attempts to correlate 1sozyme changes to changes in physical environmental parameters, such as temperature and sa1inity. ror example, the gene frequencies of the heart-type lac\u00ad tate cit' hydrogenase locus from the fish Fundulus hetcroditus was found to vary in different populattons of the fish located along the east coast of North Amenca (Place and Powers, 1978). These allelic isozymes were fOund to be structurally and functionally different [re\u00ad VIewed by Powers (19YO) and Powers et al. (1991)]. A stnsitive method for measuring genetic vanability is the use of restnction endonuclease digestion dlloro\u00ad ts an extensively studied cytoplasmic DNA clement that i~ relatively easy to purify and char\u00ad acterize. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited, changes in mtDNA can be used to trace matriarchal lineage~ and distinguish between populations. Restriction analysts of several populations of E heterodi\u00ad tus revealed intergradation in these populations (Gonzalez- Villasenor and Powers, 1990). Size variation m mtDNA restriction patterns was used to discern dislTctc stocks of striped bass along the east coast of the U. S, within the Chesapeake Hay, and along the Gulf coast (Chapman, 1987; Chapman and Brown, 1990). Similarly, the geo\u00ad graphic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes in humpback whales re\u00ad vealed differences between populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as differences within each population (Baker et al., 1990). Isozyme and mtDNA analysis have usually given confirmatory results. For example, it was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of 31 proteins and analy~is of mtDNA that morphologically similar hake found along 1987;Becker et al., 1988). Furthermore, in other cases, mtDNA studies have answered questions about relatedness that could not be resolved by tsozyme studies. For example, the Atlantic eel of the genus Anxuilla, which migrates over vast regiom of Europe and America, was considered to be a separate species from the European 48 THE: GlOBAL CHAI.l.ENGf OF MARINE BioTECHNOLOGY ~:d, the coast that Eumpean eels were Sl).,'llific:mtly populations were scuditd usmg analy'iis of restriction patterns by Goff and Coleman (191-!H) and an ev.lhtJ.tion of kelp cpDNA was improvement, page 15) rdi~ on funda\u00ad mcnul l'l'!>l\"arrh of the biology and genetics of tht'\"se marine plants.

It can be 1own by mJCroautoradiography that a considerably greater prupor\u00ad on of the bactcnal community retains metabolic activity, even wugh they cannot be cultured (Meyer-Rei!, 1978). Bactena that mnot be cultured may belong to known bacterial groups that can e grown on laboratory media but may have entered a viable but om.:ulturable ~tate (Roszak and ColwrU, 1987). Alternatively, some f these bactena may belong to groups not previously Isolated (Gio\u00ad mnoni et al., 1990). Application of molecular techniques is essential in understand\u00ad Ig species composition, variability and metabolic activity of natural urine bacterial communities. A relatively rapid and smtplr: method 1at does not neces!>J.rily identifY indlvidual species, but that gives ~neral information about the variability of species composition, IS )mrnunity DNA hybridization (Lee and Fuhrman, 1990). This chnique gives an mdication of the proportion of identical or very osely related bactenal strains present in a given assemblage of hac\u00ad ria and in other assemblages sampled at different times or locatioru. his technique can be useful m the selection of the most frequently :currmg type of sample composition for more detailed and time\u00ad msummg individual spenes compositiOn analysis (Lee and Jhrman, 1990), such as by using 16S rRNA sequencing.

This proc-~durc can be useful in the identification of bacteria. A powerful molecular technique in the analyo;is of microbial communities rs 16S rRNA sequence analy~1s (Pace, 1986), in which ~quences derived from bacteria m natural sample~ are compared to known sequences by phylogenetic analysts. The 16S rRNA se\u00ad selectively retneved by synthesized from the 16S rRNA molecule; eDNA synthesis is primed with a synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to a urn\u00ad venally conserved region in the 16S rRNA molecule (Weller and Ward, 1989). Another approach is the cloning and sequencing (or direct sequencing) of 1 ()$ rRNA gene~ amplified by PCR {Ward et al., 1992). Analysis of 16S rRNA sequenfes, for example, revealed that a novel microbial group, the SAR 11 cluster, 1s a stgmficant component of the oligotrophic bactenal community in the Sarga.~so Sea (Giovannom et a!., 1990). This discovery and the subsequent identification of two novel eubacteriallineages in samples ofbactena from the Sargasso Sea provide support for the conclusion that a ma\u00ad jority of planktonic bacteria are probably new, previously unrecog\u00ad nized species (Britsfhgi and Giovannoni, 1991). Sequences that were not closely related to any known rRNA sequences from cultivated organisms were obtained from north central Pacific Ocean surface water samples. One of these rRNA sequences was nearly identical to those from some Sargasso Sea bacteria, suggesting a global diottibu\u00ad tion of these newly discovered bacteria (Schrrudt et al., 1991). The presence of broadly diverse microbial assemblages containing many phylogenetically undescribed groups was mdicated by the results of Fuhrman eta!. (1993) who used 16S rRNA ~equencing to compare samples taken in the western Califorrua current of the Pacific Ocean and m the Atlantic Ocean near Bermuda. In the 61 clones se\u00ad quenced, no more than two occurrences of the same sequence were found m a given sample, although tdentical sequences were found between samples four times, two of which were between oceans. A profound discovery, resulting from phylogenetic characteriza\u00ad tion of microorganisms based on 16S rRNA sequencing, was the existence of two pnmary groupings of microorganisms, the archae-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 51 bactena and the eubacteria (Woese, 1 YH7). These groupings have been termed domaim Arcbaea and Bacteria (Woese ct al., 1990). Archae are generally considered to be microorganisms present in extreme envuonmcnts, Le., in the oceans pnmarily found in or near the hydrothermal vent environments. However, 16S rRNA analysi> of samples of planktonic baC(eria has also bl!' part of tbl!' planktonic assemblage of microorganisms in coastal and oceanic waters. Fuhrman et al. (1992) found sequences from a previously undescribed archaeal group m oligotrophic ocean\u00ad ic water, and archaea from this group and from a second gmup, relat\u00ad ed to the methanogens, were found to be present m coastal surface water samples collected near Woods Hole, MA and Santa Barbara, CA (Delong, 1992). In some cases, use ofPCR to recover rRNA genes from natural communities can result in differential amplification of different rRNA genes. In particular, rRNAs of extremely thermophilic ar\u00ad chaea from hydrothermal vent communities appear to be difficult to amplify (Reysenbach et aL, 1992). Therefore, the interpretation of these data needs to be done carefully, i.e., with respect to extrapola\u00ad tion to other sites and other regions. However, the examples de\u00ad scribed above show that analysis of 16S rRNA sequence~ has dearly had a major impact on understanding the diversity of microorgan\u00ad ism~ in marine environments and will continue to provide exciting new finding; well into the next decade. Sequencing of rRNA molecules isolated from straim of marine bacteria in culture collections has been important in determimng taxonomic relatiomhips. For example, in addition to the 16S the SS rRNA sequenc~ of Shewanel/a, Vibrio, and AlteromoM~ strains has permitted better definition of the species comprising these gen\u00ad era (Ortiz:-Conde et al., 1989; Muir eta!., 1990), which are impor\u00ad tant m the marine environment. Recently a large, morphologically peculiar microorganism, Epulopiscium .fishelsoni, fOund in the mtestinal tract of a surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrojuscus, was confirmed to be a bacterium by rRNA sequence analysis (Angert et aL, 1993). This microorganism was previously considered to be a protist because of its large size and is the largest known bacterium to date, with mdi-52 THE Gi.OBAL (HAUENGt OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY vidual cells reported to be larger than 600 J.l.m by RO J.lm, ca. one hundred fold larger oligonucleotide probes ba.~d for phylogenetic tdemification of single cells (Distel et al., 1988) by fluorescent microscopy or nucroautoradiogra\u00ad phy of natural samples, an approach used for detection of marine nanoplankwn protist~ by Lim et al., (1993) and for localization of a bacterial symbiont in tissue sections of the shipworm, Lyrodu.s pcdirel\u00ad latus, by Distel et of bacterial symbionts of marme invertebrates and fish, many of whtch cannot be propagated in pure culture, has been possible by using 16S rRNA sequence analysi~. Sul\u00ad fur-oxidizing bacterial endosymbionts vents and three invertebrates from shallow coa.-;tal marine environments were found to be species-specific. Fur\u00ad thermore, the symhionts were concluded to be unique to their re\u00ad spective hom (Distel et al., 1988). The gill symbionts of a manne bi\u00ad valve, Thya.sira jlexuo.sa was identified by 16S rRNA sequeming and shown to be closely related to known syrnbionts of lucinid clams (Dts.tel and Wood, 1992). Previously, it was reported that the T.flexu\u00ad osa symbiont was identified as 17u\"ohacillus tlryasin\"s TG-2 (Wood and Kelly, 1989). However, the bacterium, Isolated m pure culture from giU tissue homogenates, was likely to have been on the gill surface and not an authentic intracellular symbiont of T. fiexuo.sa (I )is tel and Wood, 1992). Bioluminescent symbionts of fish (family Anomalopidae) and deep-sea anglerfish (suborder Ceratioidei),ex\u00ad tracellular parasites that were recently ~hown by phylogt'\"netic analysis of16S rRNA sequenct'\"s not to be previously described luminous bacterial species but, mstead, new groups related to Vibrio spectes (Haygood and Dis\u00ad tel, 1993). In addition to elucidating phylogenetic relationships and the identification of nucmorg.misms, molecular techmques are useful for the study of metabolic processes of microorganisms in the environ\u00ad ment.

A probe for a portion of the 23S rR.NA gene of PseudomondS was used to mvestigate the ratio between growth rate and nucleic actd content in thts manne denitrifying bacterium (Kerkhof and Ward, 1993).

An exciting development is the detection of gene expre-ssion in natural populations of nucroorganisfll.'i by mRNA analysis. Pichard and Paul (1991) used this approach to detect expressmn of the gene (rbcL) encoding the expres\u00ad sion wa~ greatest dunng the day and least at mght, as would have been expected. Expre~mm of the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase gene (xylE) on plasmid pLV1013 in a marine vibrio was detectable in the environment and gene expression was expressed, relative to gene dose, in this study (Pichard and Paul, 1993). Mea~urement of regula\u00ad tion of gene expression at the transcriptional level in marine mi\u00ad croorganisms (which complements measurement of enzyme levels) will be increasingly important in the understanding of activities of indigenous populations and microorganisms released into the marine envuonment for bioremediarion purposes. Gene exchange between microorgani~ms in the marine envi\u00ad ronment is currently of mtere-st because of the importance of assess\u00ad ing the probability of gene exchange with genetically engineered microorgani~ms that may be released into the marine or estuarine environment (see Chapter 5). Gene transfer has been demonstrated in micrucosm~ containing marme water and sediment (Pichard and 54 THE Gi.OBAL (HA.LL.ENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Paul, 1991) and a marine vibrio was shown to develop competence, i.e., ability to take up DNA, under a wide range of conditions, smn\u00ad lar to those found m tropical and subtropical e~cuaries (Frischer et aL, 1993). It has been shown that bactenal cells mamtain plasmids even after entry into the viable but nonculturable state (Byrd and Colwell, 1990; Byrd et al., 1992). Retention ofplasmi.ds by bactena, afrer release into the marine environment, ic envuonment. Molecular techniques, in addition to conventional culturing methods, will be needed to examine gene exchange m natural contrnunities of marine microorganisms. The recent discovery oflarge numbers of viruses m marine nat\u00ad ura) waters is provmg to be important for understanding microbial ecology and gene transfer in the environment. Abundances of 103 to lOH viruses ml-1 have been reported in marine waters (Bergh et al., 1989); Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990), estuarine waters (Wommack et al., 1992) and in a coral reef environment (Frischer eta!., 1993). There are mdJCanons that bacteriophages may be important in ma\u00ad rine bacterial mortality (Proctor and Fuhrman, 1990; Heldal and Bratbak, 1991) and that viruses may infect phytoplankton, reducing primary productivity (Suttle et al, 1991). As in other aspects of ma\u00ad rine biotechnology, molecular techmque\">, such as detection of virus\u00ad es and prophage by g:ene probing (Ogunseitan et a!., I 992) are al\u00ad ready proving useful in assessmg the ecological role of virusc~. It is clear that, although marine v1ruses have been studied for several decades (Spencer, 1955; Spencer, 1960; Chen et al., 1966; Baross et a!., 1978; Torella and Morita, 1979), the recent reports of virus abun\u00ad dance have stimulated new research. The widespread distribution of viruses in the marine and estuarine environment indicates that virus\u00ad es are likely to play an important role in marine microbial ecology. An important technique for molecular studies in marine micro\u00ad bial ecology is the extraction of nucleiC acids fiom water and sedi\u00ad ment samples. These procedures are also important for detection of pathogem m the environment by gene probing (see page 54). Ex\u00ad traction of I )NA from natural planktonic microorganisms can be achteved by filtration, followed by standard lysis procedures A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN, AUSTl!AUA, AND NORWAY 55 (Fuhrman, 1988; Somerville eta!., intact mRNA reyuires the use of RNAse inhibitors and satisfactory results have been obtamed usmg this approach (Pichard and Paul, 1991, 1993). Recovery of nucleic acids from sediment, compared to seawa\u00ad ter, 1s much more difficult and frequently a high content of hum1c substances can inhibit PCR reactions. Several method<; recently have been described winch involve extracting DNA in a sufficiently pure form that it can he used as a substrate for PCR reactions, without mhibition of the reaction (Pilla1 et al., 1991; Tsai and Olson, 1992a; Tsa1 and Olson, 1992b; Yi.mng et aL, 1993), making possible the sen\u00ad sitive detection of pathogens and other bacteria of interest. Advances in manne microbial ecology are likely to be greatly accelerated by application of molecular techniques, m combination with conventional approaches, where appropriate. This is well exem\u00ad plified by results of recent studies of the impact on benthic m1crobial ecology of disposal of sewage and sewage sludge into the deep sea. Results of enumeration of Clostridium peifringms spores by convt:n\u00ad tional plating were used to show that sewage dumped at the I )eep Water Municipal Sewage Disposal Site (ca. 100 miles off the coast of New Jersey m water depths of 2,600 m) had contaminated the ben\u00ad thic envmmment (Hill et al., 1993). Application of conventional techniques, such as enumeration of bacteria by microscopy and plate coums, combined with molecular methods for community DNA hybridization (Lee and Fuhrman, 1990), )'lelded data showtng that contamination of the benthic environment had induced changes in the indigenous benthic microbial assemblages (Hill et al., 1993b; Takizawa et al., 1993). These studies advance our understanding of pollution in the marine environment. Marine Ecok,gy and Human Heahh The quality of estuarine and marine water used for recreation and seafood harvesting has traditionally been assessed by enumera\u00ad tion of coliforms and fecal coliforlTI.'i, rather cltan by dirt:ct detection of pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Direct detection of pathogens has not been adopted as a standard method in the US. (American Public Health Assoctation, 1989) because the practical conclusion, before S6 THE GlCML (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNO\\.cx;Y t:he advent genetics metbod~. was that standard bacteri\u00ad ological culturing methods for direct detection of pathogens were expens 1ve, time-consuming, and not efficient. In addition, direct de\u00ad teClion of pathogem by standard microbiological methods is of ques\u00ad tiuna.ble value. Exposure of bacterial pathogens to the aquatic envi\u00ad ronment reduces effinency of recovery, when standard culture meth\u00ad ods are employed (Dissonnette et al., 1975). Several important bacte\u00ad rial (Rollim and Colwell, 1986) have been shown to enter a viable but noncul\u00ad ~urable state (Roszak and Colwell, 1987) in the environment, m '\"'hich they are no longer culmrable by conventional techniques but may retain pathogenicity (Colwell ct al., 1985; Colwell et al . 1990). Molecular approaches have Illdde it possible now to monitor water c=Juality by direct and reliable detection of pathogenic bacteria, even cells in the viable but nonculturdble state. Molecular methods for detection of bacterial pathogens in the aquatic environment that have been publi~hed to date include DNA prob~ (Knight et al., 1990) and PCR C'J/ay et al., 1993) for detec\u00ad tion of Salmonella species and PCR and fluorescent antibody meth\u00ad ods for detection of ShiJ!ella dysenteriae Type I (Islam et al, 1993) and Vibrio cholerae (Brayton and Colwell.1987; Hug et al., coli and enteric pathogens (Salmonella and S},i.f?el/a species) have been detected m environmental wnples with sufficient speci\u00ad tlcity and sensitivity for monitoring water quality by PCR amplifica\u00ad tion of the lamB gene {BeJ et al., 1990), and PCR amplification of the r1id gene that codes for 13-glucuronidase was used to detect Es\u00ad chen\"rhia coli and Slr~~e/la (BeJ et al., 1Y91). Detection of viru\u00ad lence factoN in E. coli isolates from water samples was achieved using seven differem DNA probes (Martins et al., 1992). PCR amplifica\u00ad tiOn of a region of the enterotoxin gene in enterotoxigenic E. coli and V dwlcrae was found to he suitable for detection of these organ\u00ad jstm (Knight et al., 1 991). Other examples include a biotype-specific probe that reliably differentiates between the El Tor and Classical hiotypes of the Vibrio cholcrae 01 scrogroup (Aim and Manning, 1990) and a monoclonal antibody-based test that allows rapid and A REPORT ON THE U,S., JAPAN, AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 57 sermtive detection of f<.' clwleme 01 in contaminated wate-r (Colwell et al, 1992). Enten.)V]ruses, which pose a public health risk in the envi\u00ad ronment and can be transmitted via contaminated v:ater, were de\u00ad tected in groundwater by PCR. This assay ts applicable for detection of enteroviruses in other environmental samples (Abbaszadegan et ~-. 1993). Contamination of ~hellfi~h. because shellfish are filter feeders and, therefore, concentrate bacterial and viral pathogens, can present a severe public health risk To assess the risk, molecubr tcchmques have been developed for detection of severaltmportant shetlfi.sh-re\u00ad lated pathogens, one of which is Vibrio vulnffiws, a human pathogen, assoCiated with oysters, that can cause septicemia after ingestion of raw oysters. V t>ulnffims septicemia has a mortahty rate of greater than 500/o (Morris and Black, 1985). A DNA probe with excellent speci\u00ad ficity and sensitivity for Vibrio vulnifirrts was developed from a frJ.K\u00ad ment of the cytolysin gene of this organ:ism (Morns et al., 1987). The hcmolysm-cytolysin structural gene vvhA was subsequently se\u00ad quenced (Yamamoto et al., 1990) and an alkaline phosphatase-la\u00ad beled oligonucleotide probe based on this gene was med for rapid isolation and enumeration of T-:' l!ulnificus without the need for en\u00ad nchment or ~elective media (Wright et al., 1993). A fluorescent-la\u00ad beled oligonucleotide probe has proven useful for enumeration of V t>ulnifuus (Heidelberg, 1993). Detection of another important shell\u00ad fish pathogen, Vibrio paruhacmolytims, m artificially contaminated oys\u00ad ters, accomplished oligonucleotide probe specific to the thermostable direct hemol)ll;in (tdl1) gene of the organlsm (Lee et al., 1992a). Molecular techniques are now available for detection of many imponam pathogens in water and shellfish samples. The use of direct detection methods can no longer be ignored. They are imponant for assuring public health and food safety, and \\Viii suppLant culture methods Ill the very near future. Use ol Biooenson and Remote Sensing There is growing interest in the usc of biosensors and remote (usually utellitc-based) scnsmg of the marine environment. B10sen-58 THE GLOBAL (HAUfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY sors may offer sensitive methods for detection of low levels of nutri\u00ad ents or toXJc compounds. Furthermore, remote sensing allows detec\u00ad tion of large-scale changes in such parameters as water tt:mperature, wind-induced ITllxmg, and phytoplankton biomass. This capabihty will be expanded by the NASA Sca-v1ewwg W1de Field-of-vieW Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Earth Oh\\erving (Hooker and Esaias, 1993; Hooker et a!., 19Y3) and remote sensing should be considered by biologists as a useful tool for envi\u00ad ronmental research and monitoring. Development ofbiosensors is dependant on the coupling of bi\u00ad ological material, such as enzymes, antibodies, or whole cells, to a transducing element which converts the biological signal of interest to some form of electronic readout. An example 1s the me of mid-ultraviolet range spectrophotometry (MUVS) to detect the re\u00ad dox state of bacterial cell~ immobilized in a gel membrane. ToXIns flowlng over the membrane cause changes in redox state, detectable by MUVS (Rlim, 1992). Biosensors will be particularly useful in detection of toxtc com\u00ad pounds and may allow development of true toxiCity sensors that would interact with any compound that is toxic; this could be fol\u00ad lowed by conventional chemical approaches that identify the specific toxic compound (Bains, 1992). One assay system of this type, which may he useful for biosensor development, measures luminescence of Photobil{ten'um phosph(Jre~Jm. Light generation by luciferase in this bac\u00ad terium is dependant on a high level of ATP, which is not mamtained m the presence of toxins that affect the intracellular ATP pool (Bu\u00ad lich et al, 1990). Biosensor; are also under development for detection of specific substances, i.e., development of optical and electrochemical enzyme-based methods for detection of very low concentrations of DNA (Downs et al., 19S8). A diversity of biological clements has bct.\u00b7n mcorporated into biosensors (Hendry et al, 1990). It is clear that sophisticated approaches to environmental sensing will have a significant Impact on the ability co gather information about manne ecosystems.

SUMMARY In 19R3, marine biotechnology was first recognized as an area of hiotechnolo!-,>y of great potential (Colwell, 1983). In the decade that has snKe passed, rather a'itonishing progress has been made. More than 1,000 publications describing new compounds, natural prod~ uct<;, discoveries of the molecular genetic~ of fi~h and ~hell fish growth, metabolism, and reproduction, and expansion of marine biotechnology research on biorcmediation, biofouling, and related aspects have appeared m literJture. Where only a few pioneer.. toiled in their laboratories, there are now major centen of marine biotech~ nology research and development m Bergen and TromsO, Norv;ay, Kamaichi and Shimizu, Japan, and in Baltimore, MD, Monterrey, CA, and elsewhere in the U.S. and across the globe. Promising new antibiotic~. anti-<.:ancer therapeutic agents, Im\u00ad proved aquaculrure stoch, marine polysaccharide~ a'i food additives, and potential new energy sources from the sea, driven by molecular genetic control of marme biological systems, are in the discovery, post~dlscovery, scale~up, and/ or production stages. There is no doubt but that there has already been, and will continue to be, maJor suc\u00ad ce!>Se\\, both intellectual and conmtercial, in marine biotechnology. Areas of marine biQ[echnology in the more~or~less expansive stage are btoremediation and marine biodiversity inventories and a,._ sessment'i. Yet to be fully exploited is the nucleic acid fingerprinting for global marine biological stock assessments and monitoring, al\u00ad though this applkation ts movmg rapidly. More futuristic are the ap~ plications of bio-s1gnaling and biosensor technology, especially m global change/global monitoring, where the role of microorganisms in weather regulation and weather processes is only vaguely <impect~ ed and poorly under<itood, the latter especially the case for biogeo\u00ad chemical cycling. The notion of a \"microbial loop\" and its role in global ocean processes has only relatively recendy been enunnated (Azam et al., 1983; Ducklow et al., 1986). This aspect ofmarme biotechnology IS very much m the future, perhaps 1 0~ 15 years down 60. THE Gt.OSAL CHAllENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHI'DI.OGY the road, although some mvestigators are currently pursumg bioscn\u00ad sors/biOimagmg and its applications (Rnns, 1992). Similarly, the use of microalgae fc:Jr addressing global warming ts being conmlered by Miyachi and colleagues (Kodama eta!., 1993). During the 1970s and early 1980s, ecosy~tem modeling was very much m vogue, later falling into lesser prominence, mainly be\u00ad cause the software (and in some cases, the hardware) was not suffi\u00ad ciencly sophisticated, nor were tht> data complete enough to pass the \"reality checks.\" Wtth thc extraordinary power of computing and the volume of data now able to be colle<ited, as well as historical data available in data banks, ecosystem modeling will provide a powerful means of interpreting nucrobial ecmy'iterns of the world oceans. Marine biotechnology is a long-term investment technology. There are some immediate commercial successes, notably in the food industry, but as the Japanese government has decided, the view should be with an 8-10 year investment ~tr.ttegy. The U.S. Congr~ has now passed a marine biotechnology initiative that will provtde up to $20 million for marine biotechnology research and develop\u00ad ment. Industry, over the past decade, has begun to move into marine biotechnology. The development of this aspect of marine biotech\u00ad nology, industrial marine biotedmology, is detailed m the next chap\u00ad tee. REFERENCES Abbaszadegan, M., M. S. Huber, C. 1'. G1~rlu and I. l.

Obtaimng the information needed to establish such a base is difficult smce manne biotechnology is rarely demarcated as a program cate\u00ad gory by academic mstitutions or private compames where research and development in marme bimechnology is taking place. In order to learn more about the kinds of research bemg con\u00ad ducted and the level of activity classifiable as marine biotechnology, a survey of marint: biotechnology research and development in the United Stares was conducted during 1991-1992.1n this chapter we discuss the survey methodology, as well as some general results. Where these remits are referred to in this document, they are refer\u00ad enced as \"MAR.BIO\" referring to the database created to store in\u00ad formation derived from the survey. Two slightly different survey instruments were prepared, one for academiC and public research mstitutiom, and another fin private in\u00ad dustry. Copies of the questionnaires are mcluded in Appendices 2 and 3.

GENERAL SURVEY RESULTS Affiliations Seventy-seven percent of academiC and public research msritu\u00ad tions mvolved in some type of manne biotechnolo~ry rt'St'.uch wt're directly affiliated with public or private universities. The n:maining units were either national, state, or independt'nt research institutes doing ~onw type of marine biotechnology resean\u00b7h. For units asroci\u00ad ated with private industry, 7?';[, arc U.S. corporations and 21'% multi\u00ad national corporations. Research Area Survey respondents were presented with a list of 25 major re\u00ad search art'as and a.<;ked to indicate which area represented their major activities. For academic units, none of the selected areas associared with marine biotechnology yielded more than 100/o response (Figure 2). Microbiology and molecular biology were listed by 9.4% of the respondents. Other research area~ listed that were mentioned by a significant number of respondents were natural products chemistry (8.8%) and aquaculture (7.7%). The tiJCus for research in private mdustry was on aquaculture (19%,) and natural product~ chemistry (15%) (Figun: 3), with the next most frequent bemg bioremediation and microbiology, each S.JO!.,. That academic research was less focussed on specific are.1s was not surprising. Indmtry, expectedly, showed sharply defined obJeC\u00ad tiVes, with 50% of the firms concentrated in just four areas of re\u00ad search. Areas mon: closely aligned to application such as aquaculture and natural products chemistry require more attention from industry scientists than the more basic science areas of microbiology and mol\u00ad ecular biology. 88 THE GLOBAl I 7 01. 2't o(% 6,. Figu~ 2. Academic U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 89 Applic:ations The distinction between academic and corporate research areas was further emphasized hy results of responses to the query con\u00ad ccrnmg the eleven areas of applications for research. (13.3'7\\.) and environment/bioremc\u00ad di.ltlon (11.9'){,) also were s1gnificant in the responses. None of the other areas were cited by more than 5% of the scientists. In companson, only 5. 7% of the corporate scientists listed basic research as the major focus of their work (Figure 5). The maJor items of interest were: aquaculture (21.4'%); pharmaceuticals/fine chemicals (l H.6%); fermentation processes (14.3%); and environ\u00ad ment/bioremediation (1{YY,,). Research Methods Research methods used by research workers m marine biotech\u00ad nology are dnven, in part, by research area and application. [n both academic and corporate research, cell culture methodology is domi\u00ad nant (Figures 6 and 7). A slightly higher percentage (19.7%) of the corporate scientists listed ce11 culture, compared with academic re\u00ad searchers (14.4%). For both groups, research methods m categories not listed on the questionnaire was the second most prevalent re\u00ad sponse. Two research methods stand out as being used at significantly different frequency in academia and industry. Classic genetic plant breeding wa~ mentioned as a major research direcnon by 9.6% of the corporate researchers, but only 1.6% of the academic researchers. Academic researchers, are more involved with DNA pro he construc\u00ad tion (9.6%), compared with corpor.~te researchers (1.4%). Organisms Used Both academic and corporate scientists rely on bacteria as the major orgamsm with whtch to perform their research in marine 90 THE GLOBAL CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAIJA, AND NoRWAY 91 ' I R ,f I Cell Cullur eDNA Librnry DNA Probe Construd ' r' \"\" '\" 14% Hybridorna/Monoclona PC R Protein Engineer Protein Sequencir-og RecombinCI'll DNA Gene Cloning Restrict.

Bacteria were mentioned by 16.2% of the academic scientists and 18.2% of the corporate scientists. Shellfish species {both crustaceans and mollusks) were important for both groups at 13.0%; however, finfish (14.6%) were used more of\u00ad ten by academic scientists than their corporate counterparts (10.4%). Fungi and microalgae (11. 7%) were used often by corporate re\u00ad searchers. While microalgae were important tools for academic re\u00ad searchers (9.2%), fungi was mentioned as important only by 1.1%. Industry-Academia Callabaratians Fifty-two percent of the academic scientists interviewed indi\u00ad cated that they had some form of collaboration with private indus\u00ad try. When researchers in private industry were asked about their col\u00ad laborations with academics, 77% indicated that they did, indeed, have a collaboration underway with an academic unit. These findings are not incompatible since there are many n1ore scientist-; than conlpa\u00ad nies, and not all academic scientists care to link with industry scien\u00ad tists, although this attitude is changing dramatically .. Foreign Collaborations More than 60% of the academic scientists indicated that they are carrying out some type of collaboration with foreign scientists in the area of marine biotechnology. In the case of private industry sci\u00ad entists, such collaborations were being undertaken by slightly less than 50% of the firms interviewed. Commercial Use/Marketable Products Both groups of scientists were asked if their research had result\u00ad ed in products that were currently in use or being marketed. A smaller percentage of academic research (23.2%) has resulted in a commercial/marketable product, whereas 48.7% of the private firms indicated that their research had resulted in commercial applications.

THE GLOBAL CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Patents/Patents Pending The acadcnuc scientists mterviev.\u00b7ed reported that they had re\u00ad ceived 72 patents from their marme biotechnology rc~earch, and had another 52 patents pending. Corporate sciemi~ts had 14 patents awarded and 54 patt'nts pending. Patents are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4. labo<atc<y Soaffing Significant variability in the size of laboratory staff and among types of personnel employed were noted. On average, the academic marine biotechnology laboratory comprises 2.6 snentim at the Prinopallnvesngator level, 1. 9 post-doctoral appointtTs, 4.4 gradu\u00ad ate students, 2.1 techniCJam, 0. 9 other faculty and 2.0 undergradu\u00ad ates. The corporate research laboratory typically comprised 4.5 St'\u00ad mor scientists, 3.0 junior snenti~ts, 0.3 post-doctorates, 4.5 techni\u00ad cians, and 1.1 individuals listed m the \"other scienti\\t\" category. Laboratory Budget The average research budget for the academic laboratory was. $204,000, m 1991. In private industry, the average budget was $362,000, for the same period of time. For both groups, the median budget was less than $200,000. Only a small number of laboratories had significantly large-r budgets. The latter tended to skew the aver\u00ad age budget to higher than the typical laboratory budget. Funding Source5 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health SerVICe represent the most important funding source for marine biotechnology research at academic institutions, accounting for CJrca 25',\u00a5,, of the total funding (Figure 10). Other major funding sources are the National Snence Foundation (14.4%), followed by the Na\u00ad tional Ocean1c and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) with A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 95 ' Seo Gron OtllerNOAA ONR/Navy I F NIH/NC NS USDA FDA I I l..l ' I:; DARPA Army Other Federo I '\" \"' Figure the ~upport. Most of the NOAA funding derives from the National Sea Grant College Program (10.7%). Private mdusrry ac\u00ad counted for less than S'.X, of the research being done at academic in\u00ad stitutions in 1991. Funding for marine biotechnology research m the corporate sector is nearly entirely generated internally (73.3%) (Figure 11). Joint ventures or contracts with other firms provided an additional 2.8% funding. The federal government, predominantly the NIH, Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Agnculture, ac\u00ad counted for 14.5% of the funding. State governments contributed 2.4% to pnvate research laboratory funding. 96 THE GLOSAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY lntemal -~ l I NOAA ONR/N(IV)' NIH/NCI ' MARBIO. Chapler 3 POLITICS AND fUNDING POUCIES IN THE UNITED STATES RELATED TO MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY This chapter comprises three sections: analy.~i~ of the perception of the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government, 'With respect to marme sciences and biotechnology; identification of public and private sources of funds used to support biotechnology and mannc biotechnology R&D, with an estimate of the amount of funding each source provides for marine biotechnology R&D; and discussion of future developments in manne biotechnology. VIEWS WITHIN nlE U.S. GOVUNMENT OF nlE MARINE SCIENCES The two branches of the US. government which have the most sigmficant influence on policies affecting manne biotechnology, es\u00ad pecially funding, are the Executive branch and the Legislative branch, i.e., Congress. 1he Executive The sciences in general were supported relatively well by pn:-si\u00ad dential administrations bt:tween 1972 and 1980. However, after the Reagan administration took over the reins of government in 1981, federal spcnding in support of nondefense R&D decreased sharply and, for ideologtcal reasons, a general effort vva.<> made to reorient the role of government vis-.1-vis industry. One of the Reagan admirns\u00ad tration's tenets was that the nation's natural resources could be han\u00ad dled mmt effectively and efficiently by the private ~ector. Another 97 98 THE GLOIW (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTKHNOLOGY was that the government could best help the pnvate sector by redw:~ ing its regulatory load. The Reagan adnumstration, more so than its predecessors, used the federal budget for duectmg change-by sharply reducmg or dimmating fund~ tOr ministration promoted major policy shift~ (l{jng and Jennings, 19R8). The marine sciences were not dehberately discnminated agamst by the Reagan administration, but because most ocean-related pro\u00ad grams were fimded from the approximately 25% of the federal bud\u00ad get not conunitted by law, they were easy to cut or eliminate. The U.S. Department of Commerce's (DOC) National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Adnnmstration (NOAA) was especially hard hit by cuts. Between 1 982-19R4 NOAA lost 136 staff, mostly program offi\u00ad cers. In addition, three NOAA research vessels were removed from service and some of its fisheries laboratories were dosed. The Office of Oceans and Coastal Resource Managemem was, for all practi-cal purposes, abolished, while the National Undersea Research Program (NURP) was barely able to keep functioning (see below) (King and Jenmn~, 1 988). In line with the Reagan administration's attempts to eliminate state-federal programs, NOAA's Sea Grant program was targeted for eradication-none of the eight annual fcderal budgets formulated by the Reagan adm.imstration requested funds for either Sea Grant or NURP. The Reagan admimstration 's reasoning appea~ to have been that the Sea Grant program had proven its success and should revert to the states. However, the Reagan admini~tration made no attempt to assess the ability of the states to take over the Sea Grant program, to evaluate national interest in it, or determine what to do m the transition period before transfer wa.~ completed. Only Congressional action limited the damage to NOAA, m general, and retained the Sea Grant program (see the next section). It was during the time of the Reagan administration that the biotechnology revolution commenced. Several federal agenCies soon recognized the importance of the emerging field and responded in vanous ways. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) early supported efforts to regulate possible risky activities, support which led to the development of the so-called NIH guidelines and A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AN) NOii:WAY 99 the cstJ.blishnwnt of the Recombinant e.1rly modern biottchnology tt\u00b7chmques the tield testing of gcnetically engineered plants. The OSTP\\ Life Sdt'nces Program also woperatt\u00b7d the 19Hfh with the Congrcs\u00ad SIOilal Olfke of 'l(:chnology Assessment (OTA) as the latter agt\"ncy performed a ~ent'~ of studies on biottchnology and the major public issues tht: field was generating that required scrutiny by Congres~. It was a.bo during (he Reabran Committt'l' (BSCC) wa.~ ~et up on Science, Engint'ering and li-dmology (FCCSEn, an inter-agency council on which all maJor government departments and agenCies were, and art:, represented. FCCSET was authonzed by Congress in the 1970s, but had been dormant for many years. The BSCC provided significant intera\u00ad gt:ncy coordination in relation to polices relevant to biotechnology prnmotion and regulation until it wa.~ replaced by the Biotechnology Re~l'arch Subcommittee (BRS) during the Bush admimstration (see below). Perhaps llSCC\\ most Important accomplishment was to ini\u00ad natt\u00b7 mtcragency funding for the National Academy of SCiences and National Research Council srudy, published in 19R9, which estab\u00ad lished fundamental pnnciples regarding biotechnology risk and reg\u00ad ulation (see Chapter 5) (NRC, 1989). Finally, the foundation for tht\" National Research lnniatlvc, which was to be autho!1zed and fund\u00ad ed dunng the Bush admmistration {see below), was laid durmg the Reagan adnunistration. The llush administration indicated early on that it intended w support strengthemng scJence and technology in the U.S. and took step~ to transform its words into action. For instmce, with respect to the oceans, in the fall of 1989 the Bush admimstration turned to an 100 THE GlceAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE ocean scLentist for A.

In 1 Y92, the Dusb administration again included Sea Grant as a budget item, although at a reduced level. The Bush administration wa.~ very supportive of bmtechnology. In 1990, the OSTP Director (and the President's Snence Advisor) Dr. Allan Bromley organized an interagency ta~k force on biotech\u00ad nology, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittet' (BRS), under the purview of FCCSET's Committee on Life Snences and Health. The HRS, which replaced the HSCC, wa~ chaired by Dr. David Galas from the Department of Energy (DOE). In 1991, the Sub\u00ad committee organized a Working Group on Marine Biotechnology, chaired by Dr. David Attaway from NOAA. The Subconunittee was giwn a broad interagency coordination and cooperation role regard\u00ad ing federal support of biotechnology research; its first activity wa~ to examine all government agency activitie' in biotechnology in order to identifY overlaps between programs, gaps that indicated weakness\u00ad es, and opportunities for future development. In February 1992, the Subconunittee'<; issued the report Biotrdmo!t1gy for the 21st Century, which delineated a far-reachmg BLotecbnology Re'it'arch Initiative (BR.I) (Committee on Life Sciences and Health, 1992). The report has bt'en extensiwly described and discussed in the popular press and professional journals. For purposes of discussion here, consideration of the report is limited to sonK' general com\u00ad ment<; about budget allocations, objectives, and treannent of marine bioh:chnolob'Y\u00b7 The URI was the largest of five special federal initiatives, often called \"crmscuts,\" for the fiscal year 1993 (FY 1993) budget (the oth\u00ad en related to h1gh-pc.'\"rfonnance computmg and communications, advanced materials, global change, and math and science education). The goal was to \"Sustain and extend U.S. leadership in biotedmolo\u00ad gy research for the 21st Century to enhance the quality of life for Amencans and the gmv,rth of the U.S. economy.\" It comprised four A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 101 ''strattgic objectives\": extending biotechnology's sc1entific and tech\u00ad meal foundations; developing sufficient human resources to ensure that bwtechnology can be extended as planned; accelerating transfer of research results to the applied sectors; and realizing biotechnology benefits for \"the health and well-being of the poplllation and the protection and restoration of the envlronment.\" If the strategic ob\u00ad Jectives were ach1eved, the hoped-for result would be that U.S. biotechnology industry would benefit. Sales of biotechnology prod\u00ad U(tS could be expected to increase from $4 billion per year to $50 billion per year by 2000. The DRI proposed federal funding for biotechnology research, which had steadily increased during the late 198(ls and early 1990s to $3.76 billion m FY 1992, be boosted by an additmnal7% for FY 1993, to $4.03 billion. The twelve federal agennes identified by the Subcommittee as supporter; ofbiotechnology researrh were integral cornpont'nts of the DR!. But, by far, most of the FY 1993 funding were destined for the Department of Health and Human Scmces (DHHS), $3.125 billion, followed by Snencc Foundation (NSF), $206 million, and USDA, $167.7 million. The DOC (including NOAA) provided a minuscule $13 million for biotechnology research, while the Department of De\u00ad fense (DOD). including the Office of Naval Research (ONR), spent $S6.6 million for this purpose. Under the BRI, three research area.<; merited special attention: marine btotechnology; structural biology; and genome research. However, rv 1993 support for these areas was not specified but was included under the headings of BRI's \"six primary research areas\" (agnculturc, energy, environment, health, manufacturing/bioprocess\u00ad and general foundations) and \"two supporting components\" (so\u00ad Cial impact research and infrastructure). Nevertheless, 5 pJt,>eS of the 125 page report was devoted to marine biotechnology. Additional reference-s to activities that could be considered manne biotechnolo\u00ad gy were scattered thmughout the document. Estimates for FY 11)92 funding of marine biotechnology by federal agencies were 11\\ted. The total federal mvestmcnt in marine biotechnology re~earch for FY 1992 \u00b7was e\\timated at $43.9 million. The section of the report on marine biotechnology concluded as follows: \\02 THE GlOBAL (HAllfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY \"No area of llldrinc lHotedmology has yet been completely explored cxploitnl, ;md breadth or re>t\"arch 60) the Clinton adrmmstratJOn, Vice President A.

The Clinton adminiuration considers science and technology key to the future growth of the U.S. In general, it appears that the admm1stration ts focused on supporting \"small\" sctcnce, technology transfer, and cooperative proJects between industry and government.

While the Clinton adnurustration's view of the ocean sctences is A REPORT ON THE U. 5., JAPAN AuSTRALIA, AND NORWAY 103 not yet J:i,cermbk biotechnology V.'tll continue to be a high prion\u00ad ty area whether or not the mter-agency \"crosscut\" stands. The Vice Pres1dent, m the past, has shown interest m biotechnology, outlirung his general position on biotechnology mues in late 1991 (Gore, 1991). In the first mstance, the Vice President will concentrate on reguldtory issues, perhaps to institute a unified federal regulatory ap\u00ad proach tO\\vards field teo;ting of generically engmeered organisms and biotechnology-denvt>d foods (Fox, 1992). Hased on what he has written, Mr. Gore can be considered a very cautious proponent of biotechnology, borne out by some of his writing and latest pro\u00ad nouncements (Gore, 1994). How biotechnology will fare during FY 1995-FY 1997 is not yet dear, but as this is written the President's budget projects Ill\u00ad creased support for this field. In addition, the Presidential Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has requested that the NSTC's Biotechnology Re~earch Sulxommittee prepare a repon on issues and opportunities m biotechnology. The report is expected to be released m 1995 and will highlight agriculture, environment, manufacturing/bioprocessing, and marine biotechnology (Grimes, 1994). Somewhat concurrently, several executive agencie-., including DOE, NOAA, and NSF, are sponsoring a study undertaken by a committee of the NRC's Commission on Life Sciences entitled \"Opportunities for Advancement of Marine Biotechnology in the United States.\" The committee, headed by Dr. Michael Greenberg, Whitney Laboratory; Umvcrsity of Florida, is tasked to: examine the importance of marine biOtechnology and related research and development policy issues to provide a compre\u00ad hensive perspectiv<' Oil the current and future direction of marine hmtechnology in the Umted States. The conmuttee will identifY and assess opportunities for development of ma\u00ad rine biotechnology; research, suppon, and infrHtrucrure needed to meet and obstacles to the ad\u00ad vancement of manne bmtechnology in the Untted States.

In 1992, these states were represented by 60 of 100 senators and 355 of 435 House representa\u00ad tives (167 representatives came from district~ that touch on an ocean or a Great Lake). Therefore, a fairly strong ocean constituency exists in Congress. Over time, a strong Congressional bipartisan consensus on the U.S. ocean policy had evolved, which Wd.\\ based on several assumptions, mcluding: (1) the U.S. must maintain a strong science and technology capability in the oceans; (2) academic mstiturions are coUcctively a critical source of expertise and idea.~ and, as alternative funding sources are lacking, the fi.!derJ.I government mu~t bear the major burden for m.aintainmg oceanograpluc capabilities at these in\u00ad stitutions; (3) the role of the federal government in manne resource management is to balance competing claims between preservation, conservation, and development; and (4) the oceans are vital co na\u00ad tional security, hence there are powerful mcenrives to safeguard their international character. Due to the efforts of a small group senators and congressmen who sought to maintain a strong U.S. capability in the ocean sci\u00ad ence~. most of the attempt~ by the Reagan administration to curtail NOAA programs were deflected and funding for NURP and the Sea Grant program were msr;:rtcd m each year's budget. The overall effect wa.~ that NOAA funding remained level, in absolute terms, but actually suffered progressive diminution, because of inflation. Be\u00ad tween 1980 and 1990 the oceans programs are estimated to have lost more than SSOO million due to inflation (Kitsos. 1988). Some pro\u00ad grams received no funding; for example, the 1980 National Aqua\u00ad culture Act, potentially a boon to U.S. aquaculture, was not funded (although the USDA has increased its funding in this area). In effect, Congress shifted the emphasts of ocean science programs from ocean/coastal/fisheries to annosphcre and satellites. To illustrate, in 1980 the first category received 46% of NOAA's budget; m 1988 just 36% (Kit'\\OS, 1988). A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 105 In tht\" Reagan administration's last year and during the Hush administration, interest m the oceam was rekindled in Congress. NOAA was allocated $613 million over ten years to replace its aging research vessd fleet. and there was a new willingness to strengthen NURP and Sea Grant. A hearing was held in 1989 on the future of aquaculture and marine biotechnology in the U.S. (United States Congress, 1989), but it did not lead to CongressiOnal actton until t 993. in the early months of the Clinton administration, when leg:~s\u00ad larion on mannc biotechnology authorizing $20 million m FY 1995 and $25 million in FY 1996 was mtroduced m the House and Sen\u00ad ate. Congress has shown :i high level of interest in biotechnology ~ince the late 1970~. when the safety of recombinant DNA became a public tssue (Zilinskas and Zimmerman, 1986). Beginning in 1979, Congressional conunittees n:quested OTA to undertake a senes of studtes on biotechnology. The fir~t. completed in 1981, explained bmtechnology to non-technical persons and delineated its expected impact on American society (OTA, 1981). Durmg subsequent years, OTA studies dealt v:ich biotechnology patent~. field te<iting of genet\u00ad ICally engineered organisms, public perceptions of biotechnology, and other subject~ (but not marme biotechnology). An OTA study released October 1991 examined the impact of biotechnology on maJor industrial sectors and efforts taken by governments of 16 na\u00ad tions to influence the development of biotechnology in theu coun\u00ad tnes (OT A, 1991 a). It is reasonable to conclude that, as a result of the OTA studies, as well as position papers by the Congressional Re\u00ad search Service, Congresspersons and their staff are well acquainted with biotechnology. Further, this acquaintanceship is in general posi\u00ad tive, since Congress voted to support federal programs funding biotechnology reseJrch. Conversely, it is curious to note that the OTA studies, each of wh1ch contains a set of options for congressional action, have not been followed up by legislation. That is not to say that bills have not been introduced; several have, dealing with a variety of issues, such as bioinformatic~. patents, testing, etc. However, with minor exceptions, 106 THE GlOBAl CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Congress appears to be content With following tht Executive lead, regJ.rding government initiatives in biOtechnology, as wdl a~ sc1ence and technology, in general. For example, the fund~ Congress appro\u00ad priated for R&D m FY 1992 were within .01% of that reqm:sted by the Bush adminio;ttation (Norman, 1992). Congress made some attempt~ to cut the federal budget in the waning days of the Bush administration, when the 1 'J90 budget agreement with Congress was to be implemented, dictating spend\u00ad ing caps on three separate categories for FY 1993 (Long, 1992). This was taken up by Congre~s, in the Clmton admimsttation 's first year. Following the Clinton administration's lead, Congress has v1cwed \"big ticket\" items, such a..~ the Superconducting Super Collider and the Strategic Defense Initiative Y.:ith a jaundiced eye, because of the need to cut the budget, but funding for most agencies supporting R&D, including NSF and National Institutes of Health (NIH), wiU increase. NIH is scheduled to receive only a very modest overall in\u00ad crease, with the biotechnology interagency crosscut uncertain. In early 1 993, Representative G.E. Studds mtroduced a bill, called \"The Marine Biotechnology Investment Act of 1993\" (H.R.. 1916), which would provide matching project grants duough tht: National Sea Grant College Program (Anonymous, 1994b). At the time, Studds noted that the federal government spends over $4 bil\u00ad lion per year to support biotechnology, but only about 1% of that funding supports marine biotechnology. In late 1993, the Senate Commerce Committee approved the Act, which stipulated that the President's SCience advisor develop a ten-year national strategy for marine biotechnology and authorizes $32 milhon in funding to NOAA (including $20 million to Sea Grant) to support marme biotechnology research and other activities (Anonymous, 1993). The Act wa~ pa..,~ed in 1994. PUBUC AND PRIVATE FUNDING OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY R&D Two methods \\Vere used to determine the amount of money governments and pnvate agencies provide ro support marine bioteclmology R&l ). The first was to consult official sources, such a..-. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 107 annual reports mued by agencies, OTA stud1es, and the 1992 and 1993 rC:CSET Reports, and extract information relating to marine biotechnolOb'Y\u00b7 While this i relatively easy to do, this method has a serious shortcomm~the analyst ts entirely dependent on the offi\u00ad cial source's determination of what constitutes marine biotechnolo\u00ad gy and how the reporting agency calculates the amount of funds for research m th1s fidd. The following example illustrate~ the problem in achieving accurate tabulations. Certam types of research funded by the USDA that we would thmk of a~ aquaculture research was designated marine biotechnology by that agency, while some re\u00ad sean:h supported by the NJH\\ National Cancer Institute (NCI), which we would consider manne biotechnology, was termed \"nat\u00ad ural products chemistry\" by that mstltute. The second method was to define marine biotechnology R&D and marine biocechnology-related R&D (sec Introduction), then ask each reoearcher how much outside support ht' or she received for re\u00ad search in each category and from whence the funding came. This was done to the extent possible and the information collected was t'ntered in the MARBIO database. Analym of the MARBIO data and projection of the findings to cover the entire U.S. research estab\u00ad lishment permitted determmation of the funding amounts and pat\u00ad terns for the period FY 1990-1991. This method also has shortcom\u00ad mg;. Specifically, the analyst is dependent on the veracity of the re\u00ad searchers interviewed and the1r ability to discern research activities according to the defininom formulated. In addition, since less than 50% of the researchers conducting marine biotechnology R&D were actually intervtewed, sampling error can bias the analysis when results are projected to represent the entire marine biotechnology re\u00ad search community. Funding of marine biotechnology is discussed in the followmg three sections. The first addresses the maJor source of public funding, namely, the U.S. government acting through federal agencies. The second fo(.\u00b7ussc:s on state governments, which provide funds for re\u00ad search, but at much lower amounts than the federal government. Private sources, including mdustry and nonprofit funding agencies, arc discus.~d in the third section. 108 THE GLOBAL (HA!.LENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Federal Funding Each subsection that follow~. except the last, covers one agency. In the first part of each subsection the amount the agency in question spend~ to support biotechnology, in general, 1s quantified; second, we express fimding that the agency under comideration offi\u00ad cially danns that it assigned specifically for marine biotechnology; and, third, amounts of funding determined by the analys1s of the MARBIO data. For illustrative purposes, dJscussion of selt>cted ;~gen\u00ad cies mcludes examples of the types of marine biotechnology R&D they have funded. Depo\"'\"\"\"l of Commerce (DOC) In FY 1992, the DOC spent an estimated S 13 nnllion on biotechnology research; this sum remained roughly the !>J.tllt' for FY 1993. In FY 1992, NOAA was estimated to support n1anne biotech\u00ad nology and aquaculture R&D at about $5.f! n1illion (Grimes, I Y91; Committee on Life Sciences and Health, 1 ?92). MARBIO data in\u00ad dicated a similar amount of NOAA funding, mea $6.1 million. The NOAA Sea Grant College program was key, m that the National Sea Grant College program aim~ to direct resources of the nation\\ universities for wise use of its marine resources (Ragotzkie, 1988). At present, more than 150 instituuons m 35 states and Puerto Rico participate in the Sea Grant College program. Sea Grant has identified marine biotechnology as a program area and employs a specialist at the national headquarters who is as\u00ad sJgned to monitor grants in this field (OTA, 1988). Out of its 198Y annual research budget of approximately $36 milhon, an official source ~tated that Sea Grant allocated ctrca $2.3 million to marine biotechnology, exclusive of aquaculture (Sea Grant funding for ma\u00ad nne biotechnology is not presented in the BRI) (Attaway, 1990). All Sed Gram funds have a multiplier effect, smce they must be matched by JWnfederal support. Thus, S 1. 7 million from vanous sources should be added to the Sea Grant funding, for a total of$4.1 million for marine biotechnology R&D derived from this agency. Another A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 109 approximately $5.3 million total was directed to aquaculture re\u00ad search. AnalySIS of the MARBIO data indicated that Sea Grant con\u00ad tributed $4.58 million, or approximately 8.8% of the funds allocated by fede-ral funding agennes, !Or marine biotechnology R&D. This sum, considerably less than provided by NIH and NSF (see Figure 10m Chapter 2), placed Sea Grant as the d1ird largest contributor to marme biotechnology R&D. Of the $2.3 rnillion Sea Grant reported it provided for marme biotechnology R&D, $837,000 was spent on biochenustry and phar\u00ad macology, $710,000 on genetic englneering proJects (DNA technol\u00ad ogy applied to microorganisms, algae, finfish, and mollusks), $361,000 for biochemical engmeermg (reactors and and microbiology, and physiology. Al\u00ad though Sea Gr.mt funding for rL-search grants IS relatively small, rang\u00ad mg from about $4,000 to $93,000 and averaging approximately $40,000 annually per mdividual investigator, the results have a signif\u00ad ICant local1mpact. For exan1ple, a Sea Grant research project begun m Maine on the American oyster Crassosura virginica led to results that were applied in anotha Sea Grant research proJect m Washing\u00ad ton State on the Pacific oyster Cra.\\SCistrea gigas (Allen Jr., 1988). The first project resulted in the development of triploid oysters (oysters having three rimes the haploid number of chromosomes), which arc sterile. The techniques developed in the Maine project were then applied by oyster hatchenes in the Pacific Northwest to produce triploid~. The advantage of triploid oyster.; have over their wild rela\u00ad tives are that they grow larger and available for harvesting at times of the year when wild oysters cannot be taken. For these reasons, tnploid oysters have become a major contributor to the economy of the area, representing approximately 500/o of the total hatchery pro\u00ad duction of oysters m the Pacific Northwest. In addition to Sea Grant, the National Undersea Research Pm\u00ad gram (NURP) undertakes proJects that include marine biotechnolo\u00ad gy-related components. NURP, an agency established m 1980, has proved popular with Congress, which has increased it~ funding fium 110 THE GLOBAl CHALLENGE OF MARINE BKJTECHNOLcx;Y an mitial $3.3 million to Sl6.3 milhon in 1991, even though the program wa~ opposed by the Reagan and Bush administrations. NURP supports undersea research projects, including studies on coral reef<;, submanne volcanoes, and thermal vents on the ocean floor. None of the research imtitutiom surveyed for MARBIO re\u00ad ported receiving support from NURP It IS, therefore, probable that research supported by NURP would not fall mto a strict defimtion of marine biotechnology. However, NURP fUnd~ proj(\"(.:ts that con\u00ad tribute to marine biotechnology. For example, organim1s collected from undersea sites are being screened fOr natural produl\u00b7ts m nunne biotechnology laboratories. In addition to Sea Grant, NOAA provided c1rca $1.7 million fi1r marine biotechnology R&D was million, rnost to fisheries research, i.e., i.n 1992 NOAA made available $1 million for r~earch aimed at strengthening and developing the U.S. fishenes industry. Research topics in marme biotechnology mcluded marine biotoxin fishery safety, microbiological safety of fishery products, de\u00ad veloping new, low--cost methods to monitor environmental contnn\u00ad inants in fi~hery products, and developing envuonmentally sound methods to UtiliZe byproduccs and fish \\vastes. More ~pecifically, an additional $1.8 million from NOAA wa_~ desJgt1ated for re~earrh to improve Gulf of MexKo and South Atlantic fisheries. However, ad\u00ad ditional fisheries-related research included fish stock assessment and tracking and enumerating pdag1c fish, reef fish, coastal herring and gmundfish. Deporlment ol DelwnS<1 (000} DOD prov1ded an estimated $81 million m FY 1992 for b1otechnology R&D (Committee on Life SCiences and Health, 1992). The total amount of DOD funds directed to marine biotech\u00ad nology wa~ not determined. However, ONR, the U.S. Navy's re\u00ad search arm and the major funder of marine biotechnology within DOD, officially was estimated to have spent $7 million on marine biotechnology (Grimes, 1991). Data in MARBIO indicated that A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRALIA, AND NORWAY 111 ONR provided $3.09 nullion, or approximately 7.2% of facilities, fellow~hips, and other training activitit>S. MAR\u00ad BID data, however, rd1ect funds spent directly to support manne biotechnology R&D. ONR interest in manne biotechnology ts pursm\u00b7d matnly through the HJO!ogical Sciences Division, which had two programs in FY 1991-1992, Molecular tliology and Systems Biology. The ob\u00ad Jective of the tlrst was \"to extend our ba!>ic understanding of the pnnctplcs of biological processes at the molecular level, '.'.>ith an em\u00ad phasis on marine organisms,\" while the second was \"to support basiC research on responses of complex organisms, particularly man, to the environment'' (Office of Naval ReM:arch, 1989). Thus, ONR funds extramur.ll basiC and applied re-;earch at universities and navallabora\u00ad tones, focussed on biochenustry, marine microbiology, biopolymcrs, biosurfaces, extreme en.,.,ronmental habitats, and molecular recogni\u00ad tion. ONR can support high risk research projects which otherwise would probably go unfunded. However, once a risky project shows promise, ONR encourages the investigator to seek funding from conventional sources (Alberti, 1990). Three categories ofONR funding are available for marmc biotechnology research. 6-r Research. According nnately S2 m1lhon per year, including $150,000 for training, was provided for basic research in FY 1991-1992, e.g., investigation of biochemical and phys1ological functions of mannc-organisms. In pamcular, that adhc~10n, biofouling phenomena, formation of biofilms (Bryer<>, 19), and novel processes carried out by marine organlsms, including formation of biopolymers. Major recipients of 6-1 funding in 1989 were: the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute Center of Marine Biotechnology (COMB}, Baltimore, MD; University of 112 THE GLOBAL (HAtl.ENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY California Scripps Institute; UmveTSJty of Delaware; Umversity of Southern California; Umvers1ty University of Washington. In addition, ONR fimdcd traming courses relevant to marine biotechnology at Duke Univnsity, the Wood~ Hole Oceanographic Ins.titutwn, Woods Hole, MA, University of California at Los Angeles, and other higher education insntutiom. 6-2 F11ncl;ng lor Exploratory Development. Approximatdy $700,000 \\ova.s provided by ONR in 19R9 for R&D likely to lead to commercialization of6-J proJect findings. As the title of the program suggests, this activity set the scientific/technical bas1s for production. Recipients of 6-2 almost mvariably worked with industry, and industrial concerns were also ebgible for funding. Several projects that started out under 6-1 advanced to 6-2. Some progressed further and are now being commercialized. Commercial products that have been realized (although still in the testing stage) are several b10polymers from marine organisms and a mussel adhe<>1ve. The last, developed by Dr. Herb Waite at the University of Delaware, was tested for use as an artificial skin and glue m bone surgeries. Another project close to commercialization involves a natural antifouling compound for treating hulls of ocean-gomg vessels or adding to paints used on boat hulls. Unlike anti-fouling pamts prevwusly available, wh1ch contain heavy metals, this compound is both nonpollunng and nontoxic for workers. Other 6- 2 projects of commercial interest mclude compounds from marine organisms that offer possibilities as blood substitutes, imnmnolog~cal adjuvants, agents to speed wound healing and anti-inflammatory compounds. Univers;,y Research lniliatives (URis). The URis is a tri-servJCe program, that was funded at a level of approxinutely $230 million in 1992, that aimed \"to strengthen the capabilities of the universities tO perform research and to educate scientific and engineermg personnd in key disCiplines important to the technologies that underlie a strong national defense\" (Office of Naval Research, 1987). Of the three services, only the U.S. Navy supports URis related to A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAIJA, AND NORWAY I I 3 mJ.rine biotechnolo~-,ry_ Through this program, the ONR assisted in the establishment of scientific centers of excellence in areas that were poorly funded but that ONR believes to be important. Manne biotechnology was included in this category. Accordingly, tn t 986 ONR supported establishment of two centers: COMB (circa Sl ntillion per year tOr five ycars-----\"CC below) and a JOint University of Tennessec/Scnpps Institute of Oceanography Center. The latter, supported at about $750,000 per year, included investigative programs on biofouling, protein dynanucs, and the effect of pressure on marine organisms and gene t.:xpression. A third URI supports a joint effort between the California Institute of Technology and the Unive~ity of California at San Francisco, focussed on mvestigating the effect of pre~sure on madne organisms and gene cxprrssion, funded at circa S750,000 per year. The U.S. Navy funds two other programs that touch on marine biotechnology, but whose impact cannot yet be assessed. The ONR Young lnvestigawr Program, which supports 14 academic re\u00ad searchers for three years with each investigator rcccivmg $75,000 per year m research support (marine biotechnology is an eligible re\u00ad search area); and the Office of Naval Technology postdoctoral ap\u00ad pointments at naval laboratories, of which approximately 40 were awarded per year, with length of service one or two years and indi\u00ad vidual stipends ranging from $36,000 to $52,000 per year. Agam, marine biotechnology is considered an eligible field of study. Deportment ol Health anJ Human Services The major funders of biotechnology R&D within the DHHS are the NIH and, to a lesser extent, the Food and Drug Administra\u00ad non (FDA). NIH. In 1992, the NIH tou.l budget was nearly $9 billion and of this mm, the agency spent approximately $2.8 billion for biotechnology R&D (Committee on Life Snences and Health, 1992). The amount the NIH spent on marine biotcdmology R.&D in 1992 was officially estimated to have been $11.9 million (Grime<>, 114 THE GLOBAL (HAU.f~E OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY ]991), correlating well w1th MARBIO data, whKh estimated NIH (including NCI) funding to be $10.54 md!Jon for manne biotechnology R&D. This ts 24.5% of the total funds supporting researching in marine biotechnology. Thus, NIH has been a maJor source of support for marme biotechnology research m the U.S. In addition, NIH supports marine biotechnology research in other countnes. NIH undertakes or funds mannc biotechnology-related research within several of it~ subsidiary centers and agencies. In biochenustry and chemistry, there are about 12 programs related to investigation ofbioactive compounds. In the mfectious disease area, a few programs are funded which relate to antibiotic discovery and development, as well as ci.TdJO-vascular and card!O-act!ve compounds. However, the maJOr fonder of marine biotechnology R&D withm the NIH ts the NCL FCCSET estimates indicated that the NCI spent about $8 mil\u00ad lion on marine biotechnology of its total $1.7 bilhon FY 1992 bud\u00ad get. MARBIO data are at variance, however, with that estimate, mill\u00ad eating NCI funding of $3-4 million tOr marine biotechnology, in\u00ad cluding marine collections. This discrepancy can be understood after examining projects funded by NCI. As discussed below, NCI l>up\u00ad ports significant marine bioteclmology-related R&D carried out by fOreign researchers, the data for which are not captured by MAR\u00ad BIO. While the sum spent on U.S. marine biotechnology by NCI is relatively small, it is, nevertheless, very 1mportant, because it is so strongly targeted. All NCI funding in the marine area is allocated to natural products R&D. NCI has sponsored development of natural products agents for more than 30 years. Among the drugs that have resulted from research supported by this program is taxa!, one of to\u00ad dJy's most promising anti-cancer drug. In addition, NCI scientists have pertOrmed clinical research on a host NCI established the NaturJI Products Repository, wherem are stored extracts from plants collected m 20 tropical countnes, as well as marine micro-and macro-organisms, collected mainly m the Indo-Pacific reg10n.

The NCI Division of Cancer Treatment admmisters the Na\u00ad tional Cooperative Drug Discovery Group Program (NCDDG), the rationale for which is that dficacious researd1, development, and {'Valuation of a m:w treatment requires an interdtsciplinary team. It IS, therefore, useful for the NCI to asstst m the mobilization of cre\u00ad ative scientists, regardless of affiliation, lllto a unit where mterdi~cipli\u00ad nary cooperation is promoted. Often this meam that sctentist~ from both university and mdustry partake in joint proJects. The fim two NCDDG groups were formed in 1984; their research focussed on investigations related to the general mechanism of action-based anti\u00ad cancer treatment. By April, 1990, 12 groups had been set up, mclud\u00ad ing two that are marine biotechnology-related (SuA\"Tiess, 19<Jt). The first group aimed at discovcnng new anticancer drugs from cultured and collected marme organisms, mcluding sponges, lusks, macroalgae. marine bacteria, corals and microalgae. AppmXI\u00ad matdy 3000 extracts were collected and examined each year. The Principal Investigator ts J.C. Clardy, Cornell University, and the team includes researchers from Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Univer\u00ad sity of Rhode Island, University of Utah and the Bristol Myers Company. The proJect will be earned out during 19H9-1994. The second NCI >DG group established an objective of discov\u00ad ering antimmor from marine symbionts. Among the specific anru. was to identify manne organisms that produce chemicals structurally different than those obtained from terrestrial sources. The PrinCipal Investigator of the group is Or. PO. Crews, University of California at Santa Cruz and includes researchers from Oregon State Universi\u00ad ty. University of Oklahoma, and Syntex Corporation. This proJeCt runs from 1990 through 1995. With respect to conuncrcial possibilities of drugs discovered in the course of NIH-supported research, the NIH-supported grantee or contractor ha.~ primary patent right~ to them. Similarly, ~upplien of drugs submitted to the NCI for screening retain patent rights. However, NCI may patent discoveries resulting from internal NCI A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 117 researrh. further, if the pnmary prrson or organization chooses not to exerme these patent nghts, the NCI can apply for a patent on the di~cuvcry. In case of patents resulting from internal NCI research, the patent is issued m the name of the NCJ n.-searcher(s) who discowred the compound and the NCI. Thereafter, tht\u00b7 compound is made available to mdustry for development. The mdustry retains profits tfom commen:ial successes, if any, except for a share that accrues to the NCI researcher/invemor, who may realize a maximum of $100,000 per year from any one invention. FDA. The FDA is officially estimated to be spending $3.4 mil\u00ad lion on marine biotechnology, $3.1 milhon on molecular genetics, and $0.3 nnlhon on aquacultun: (Grime~, 1991). From the MARBIO data, we concluded that the FJ)A prov1ded research scientists interviewed in our own survey With a total of~ $0.13 million. The discrepancy in this case ts readily explained; the FDA spends almost all of its funds on intramural research. mainly food safety, including research on marine toxins. Specifically, the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition performs research to develop efficient methods to detect, identifY, and quantify pathogens associated gastrointestinal disease-causing viruses. In addition, the FDA supports studies on the incidence of antibiotic resistant pathogens in catfish aquaculture facilities, including the ability of plasmids to transfer reststance among vanous bacterial species (Salsbury, 1991). Notional Science Founclarion NSF's mi\\sion ts to fOster research and education tn all fidds of science and engineering and promote the interchange of scientific information among scientists and engineers in both the U.S. and in\u00ad temationally. NSF's mandate is to ensure a continuing flow of funda\u00ad mental knowledge without the constraint of a missmn of goal-ori\u00ad ented agenda. Thus, the NSF, with a total budget of$2.7 billion in 1992, wa.~ at that time and remains today the largest funder of basic 118. THE GL.CeAI. CHALlENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLcx;Y research in the U.S. In 19lJ2, NSF provided circa S17H million tOr ocean science research activities, funding approxunatdy 70%J of all basic ocean sncncc research m the U.S. (Clark, 1993), and ~pent an estimated $174 million for general biotechnology R&D (Commit\u00ad tee on Life Sciences and Health, 1992). NSF IS fourth 111 the FCC\u00ad SET list of agencies supporting biotechnology R&D, far behind NIH but just slightly after DOE and USDA in total expenditures. Marine biotechnology bas been ~upported mostly through the NSF's Biological Oceanography Program and Polar Biology Pro\u00ad gram and, to a lesser extent, Medicine Program. The Biological Oceanography Program bas supported two workshops that focussed on marine biotechnology:\"An Initiative for the Accelerated Transfer of Biotechnology to the Ocean Sc1cnces,\" held September 16-18, 1988, in Tucson, Arizona (Anonymous, 1990), and \"Molecular Ma\u00ad rine Biology and Marine Biotechnology Applied to Oceanographic Problems,\" held March 2-3, 1990, m Monterey, Cahfornia (which wa.<; co-sponsored by the Ocean Studies Hoard of the National Re\u00ad search Council) (report is as yet unpublished).lloth workc;hops strongly recommended an increased effort in U.S. marine biotech\u00ad nology. More directly, the Biological Oceanography Progran1 began in 1989 to invest $500,000 per year in support of a competitive fellow\u00ad ship program, encompassing both post-doctoral and senior re\u00ad searchers, to facilitate the transfer of biotechnology methods to the areas of ocean sc1ences and marine ecology. This program also sup\u00ad ports the acquisition of equipment for support of marine biotech\u00ad nology at manne laboratories and field stations. More recently, ma\u00ad rine biotechnology was identified as one of five focus areas for the NSF 1993 biotechnology initiative (Committee on Life Sciences and Health, 1992); i.e., it was identified as a growth area in which the NSF has substantial strengths but which 1s currently under-fund\u00ad ed relative to its potential pronuse (Duguay, 1994). Acwrding co official sourc~. NSF spent an estimated $9 million co support marine biotechnology research in 1992 (Grimes, 1991), but an analysis of MARBIO data indicates a lesser figure, i.e., we found that the NSF spem $6.19 million for this purpose. The latter figure would mean that the NSF paid for 14.4% of all federally sup-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AusTRA!JA, AND NORWAY 119 portt:d rt:scan:h m marmt: biOtechnology. The discrepancy between the two estimate~ most likely denves from different definitions of manne biotechnolq,>y. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) The USDA began a competitive grants fUnding program al\u00ad ready m 19HI, whkh grew from approximately $17 million to $40 million m 1!)86. Hmvever, total USDA funding for biotechnology in 1992 was $179.4 million (Conmlittee on Life Sciences and Health, 1992). According to official estimates, the USDA spent appmxmute\u00ad ly S2 million for molecular genetics and SA-.1 million for biotechnol\u00ad ogy as related to aquaculture and mariculture (excluding the opera\u00ad tion of the National Aquaculture Library m Beltsville, MD) (C;nmes, 1991). However, MARBIO data indicates that USDA-funded rna\u00ad nne biotechnology R&D was $3.09 m1llion, or 7.2% of the U.S. marme biotechnology R&D fundlng m 1992. The most likely ex\u00ad planation for the variance is that the definition of marine biotech\u00ad nology used to compile MARBIO data differs from that of the USDA; also possible is that the USDA included support for some aquaculture n:scarch under the marine biotechnology category. Department of Ene<gy (DOE} Total DOE funding for biotechnology in 1992 was S182 mil\u00ad lion, including circa $59 million for the Human Genome Project (Comnlittee on Life Sciences and Health, 1992). DOE funded rna\u00ad nne biotechnology at an estimated level of$560,CXIO in 1992.1n ad\u00ad dition, through its Division of Biological Energy Research, it spent an estimated $2 million on marine algae research, to investigate the promtse these plants hold for energy production. Recently, DOE in\u00ad augurated a molecular biology initiative Within its Ocean Margins Program, and funding for this initiative was set at nearly $3 million for FY 1994 (Grimes, 1994). It also bears mentioning that, in addition to the foregoing, the DOE sponsors an extremely mteresting and innovative program, called \"Deep Probe,\" as part of its Subsurface Science Program. Thi~ Program commenced in 1986 and has funded the collection and 120 THE GlOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOI.OGY preservation of organ1sms from subsurface sites, e.g., more than 7,000 microbial organisms are being mamtamed under this program by Dr. D. Dalkwill at Florida State Univenity and by Dr. D. Boone at the Oregon Graduate Institute (Anonymous, 1991b; Grimes, IYY4). Re\u00ad search scientists have access to these cultures for investigations of their potential pharmaceutical properties, the1r ability to degrade and decontaminate pollutants, or other purposes. Ollrer Federol Agencies In addition to the federal agcncJes listed above, other agencies fund marine biotechnology-related R&D, albeit at lower levels. Oth\u00ad er federal agencies are officially estimated to have inwsted a total of Sl.3R million m 1992 on marine biotechnology R&D (Grimes, 1991), e.g., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spent $550,000 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service $270,000. These affinal estimatt>s compare well with our findings from MARBI() data, which indicated that approximately $1 million was spent by other federal agencu:s on manne biotechnology research, compnsmg 2.3% of the total (MARBIO). SmaH Businen Innovative Research Program A crosscut program; the Small Busmess Innovative Research (SBIR) program, whose scope encompasses all major agencies, de\u00ad rives from the Small Bminess Development Act of 19Hfl (PL \":19- 443) which enjoms federal agennes that spend more than $100 mil\u00ad han per year on extramural research to set aside 1.25% of those funds t(Jr the SHIIt program. The SBIR program was reauthonzed in 1993 for five years. Only companies having fewer than 500 employees and ov.'lled at lea~t 51% by US. citizens are eligible to apply for SBIR funding. The prowam constitutes three phases, as follows. Phase I covers pro\u00ad Jects that art selected for scientific merit and feasibility. Awards are for up to $50,000 and usually cover no more than six months. Phase II projects are for development of Phase I results. Awards are for up to $500,000 for no more than two years. Pha~e Ill projects are those A REPORT ON iHE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 121 that are bemg commercialized and requ1re private, non-SBIR fund\u00ad ing <>ources. The largest contributor to the SBIR program is the NIH, wluch spent $73 million for this purpose in 1990 (OTA, 1991 b). The SBIR program, m t3.cr, has provided major funding for risky and/or mnovative research performed by small firms in the U.S. and serves to encourage the development of an expanded busi\u00ad ness base on new technolo!-.'Y\u00b7 By 1991. the SDIR program funded about 15,000 projects at a totaJ cost of about $1.H billion. According to the OTA, biotechnology compames have done well through SBIR, although the exact criteria for success are not specified (OTA, 199lb). The FCCSET Report does not list SBIR funding for biotechnology, nor does any other official source to date. Several biotechnology companies included in the MARlll 0 survey have had proJects funded by the SBIR program, but company offi\u00ad cials have been reticent about releasing deuils of research funding. The MARHIO data indicate fimcting to the extent of S2Jc!6 million from \"Other Federal Sources,\" a sum which probably is, to a great extent, SBIR functing. Stale Funding States spent a total of approximately $1.2 billion m 1988 to sup\u00ad port R&D, less than 1% of the totaJ U.S. outlay for R&D (Acisher, 1990). Mmt of this funding went for health-relatl-d R&D ($285 mil\u00ad lion); research aimed at developing natural resources was ranked sec\u00ad ond. Most state funds come from general funds. Interestingly, thirty\u00ad three ~tares actively promote biotechnology, spending about $150 miUion per year for this purpose (OTA, 198H). About $2.8 million, or 6.5% of the total state funding for R&D, supported marine biotechnology in 1991. Three states allocated fund<> to emblish ma\u00ad rine biotechnology centers, as components of larger institutions and for other endeavors promoting marine biotedmology. California The state of California's major initiative for promoting biotech\u00ad nology is the System-Wide Biotechnology Research and Education 122 THE GLOBAl. CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Program, admim~tered through UCLA. Funded at approXImately $2 million per year, lt provides seed money fOr re~earch projects and training programs. Six projects were funded m 1992, brmgmg the total number of grants funded by the Program to 56. Fund\\ providt'd by the Program must be matched, m part, by the recipient. If salary equivalent of instructors is included, the ratio 1s about 3 parts from the state to 1 part from the umversity. Program grants have provided seed funds for establishment of several ne\\'1\" research centers within the University of Califorma system, indudmg the Marine lliotech\u00ad nology Centt:r at the Umversny of Califorma at Santa Barbara, which received about $600,000 over four years to support, in part, training of graduate students and post doctoral positions.

The Marine Biotechnology Center on the edge of the Pacific is housed in a building completed in 1989 at a cost ofS7 million, plus $1 million for equipment, paid mainly for by the State of Californid. As this is written, a second large research pro\u00ad gram dedicated to marine biotechnology has been established Ill Califorma, namely the Center for Marine Biotechnology and Bio\u00ad medicine, Uniwrsity of California at San D1ego. Thi~ center will host a ~eminar called \"Marine Biotechnology: Emerging Econonuc Opportunities for California\" dunng October 1994, which is orga\u00ad mzed by the California Consortium for Manne Biotechnology. Mmyland The Center of Marine Bwtechnolog)' (COMB), one of five renters constituting the University of Maryland Biotechnology In\u00ad stitute (UMBI), was established on july 1, 19B5. Until completton of the Columbm Center (se-e below) it has been located on the Harbor Campus of the Community College of Baltimore m the Inner Har\u00ad bor ofBaltinmre. Facilities housing COMB were provided using $1 million from lhe Maryland Industrial and Conunercial Redevelopment Fund and S 112,000 fi-om the ( :ity of Baltimore. Present facilities comprise ap-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 123 proximatdy J2,000 square feet of building space, housing 14labora\u00ad tones. The permanent home ofCOMI::I will be the Columbus Centt>r of Manne Research and Exploration (Columbus Center). The Columbus Center, under construction on Piers 5 and 6 of Baltimore city's inner barbor, ts nearly complete at the time of this writing. Other component\\ of the C:olum bus Ce-nter arc the Center of Ma\u00ad rine Archeology, the Maritime Museum, an exhibition area, and a traimng centn. Total cost of the Columbus Center ts $160 million, of which ctrct $5.'i null ion 1~ dedicated to facihtu:s for COMB. When fully operational, COMB will occupy 11':1,000 squal\"t' feet of the-Columbus Center and, by 1997, will be staffed by 213 scientists, graduate ~tudent\\, techmoam, and support personnel. In addition to funding CO Mil, the state of Maryland estab\u00ad lished the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIP) program, which mcorporates marine biotechnology projects. Under this program, fimded at $1.4 million in 1990, the State seeks to fOrm pannerslups between industries and the University m four fidds: enginet:ring; computmg; life sciences; and phy~ical science. The State funds joint cooperative R&D projects between a firm and a laboratory to a maximum of$50,000 per year for one to three years if (1) the firm in question mpports sm;, of the project; (2) the firm and laboratory have Maryland as their home base; and (3) the project is judged to have high potential for creating jobs within the state. Grants are highly competitive, thm specific proposal~ are critically reviev.\u00b7ed. North Carolina The North Carolina Biotechnology Center was established in November 1981, making it the oldest center of its kind. In 1985, the Center formed a Marine Biotechnology Advisory Committee to develop a state program in marine biotechnology (Toyota and Nakashima, 1987). The Advtsory Committee ended its work by rec\u00ad ommending that steps be taken by the state to develop a strong ma\u00ad rine biotechnology progr..un, mcluding makmg certain that steps are taken to \"expedite application of research results for economtc bene\u00ad fit to North Carolina.\" 124 THE GlOBAl CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY The report of the Advisory Committee languished for five years (Anonymous, 1991a). It was not until january, 1990, that a small step was taken to realize one of its objectives. At that time, the Center for Marine Biotechnology in Botany, which is part of the University of North Carolina Center for Marine Science Research at Wilmington NC, came into existence. The Center's work was supported in 1992 by the NSF ($110,000 per year); Sea Grant ($60,000 for two pro\u00ad jects); and the North Carolina Biotechnology Center ($100,000 per year) (Bird, 1990). Private Sources of Funds lor Marine Biotechnology Research Based on MARBIO data, industry provided $2.11 million and private sources $1.49 million for marine biotechnology R&D in 1992. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Marine biotechnology is a relatively new component of biotechnology and, as such, has not yet been accorded the status of a distinct budget item by most agencies. R&D activities categorized in the MARBIO study as marine biotechnology are usually included under more well-defined biotechnology areas, e.g., agriculture (aquaculture), environment (bioremediation), and health (marine natural products). More rarely, marine biotechnology projects and programs may be found under the heading of marine biology or bi\u00ad ological oceanography. The approach taken in this report to address these difficulties in defining marine biotechnology was to collect and analyze information pertaining to biotechnology-related and marine sciences activities funded by agencies, to determine which of these were marine biotechnology or marine biotechnology-related, ac\u00ad cording to the definitions given in the Introduction, and to quantity funding levels for these items. As an aside, as mentioned above, recently a bill was introduced into Congress authorizing funding for marine biotechnology. We would expect that in order to clarity what kinds of projects can be A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AusTRAl!A, AND NoRWAY 125 t\\mdni und1..T th1s h1IL cide on .1 dcfinitton of 111,1rine bmtechnolo~. the uncertain situation we tJ.ced when performmg this ~tudy may change soon.

For thts reason, we believe the Committee's final fib'llre can be considered only a very rough estimate. The e~timate based on MAR.BIO data for the amount of feder\u00ad al funding supporting marine biotechnology R&D during 19\\J0- 1 fJlJ1 is S33.4 million. In addition, marine biotechnolob\"Y R&IJ was ~upported to the extent of $2.HH million by state governments, $2.16 mill! on by uniwnmes, S 1.49 million by private sourcl\"S, such as foundations, $2.11 million by industry and $0.9H million from otbcr stlurc6.

Chapler4 ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY R&D INlRODUCnON Economic theory can be quite useful in evaluating marine biotechnolob'Y research and development. The role of the pubhc sec\u00ad tor m providing direct and indirect support for R&D can be clari\u00ad fied when it ts examined through a cost/benefit analysis framework An e~timation of the potential for marine biotechnology to rmprove the overall welfare of the citizenry is an essential component of this type of analysis. Generally, when there is a high potential payoif from R&D, there ts greater interest in public sector funding. However, assessing the potential of an \"emergtng\" technology is difficult, at be~t. Mistakes are commonly made when a sound frame\u00ad ~vrk for assessmg the technology is not readily available. One mts\u00ad take is to project linearly from the existing siruation. For example, if a technology shows rapid expansion in a short time, the tendency would be to project future expansion at the same rate. The differ\u00ad ence between the \"technological optimist\" and the \"technological conservative\" (OECD, 19S9) is how the recent history of the tech\u00ad nology is vtewed, and the time frame they are projecting from. An\u00ad other frequent error is to assume that all other technologies hold constant while the technology of interest is being analy:zed. For ex\u00ad anlpk aquaculture is usually embraced as an area where application ofmarme biotechnology should overcome the shortcommgs of cur\u00ad rent methods of harvesting wild fish. What 1s often ignored in such an argument, 1s that depletion of wild fish stocks c:m (and in mme 131 132 THE GtOBAL Ow..l.ENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHf\\IOLOGY cases already has been) reversed by making technologically stmple, but often politically difficult, changes m managcmcnt practices. Two examples arc the rebuilding of the Atlantic surf clam stocks, and the Cheupeake Bay striped ba.~s fishery. In the clam fishery, a moraton\u00ad um on new entrants was placed on the fishery along with an annual harvest quota and minimum size limit. More recently, individual transferable quotas have been asstgncd to fishmg vessels. The mrf dam ~tock now harve~ted at near maxtmum sus\u00ad tainablt'\" yields. The Chesapeake Bay striped bass stock wa~ so severe\u00ad ly depleted that by the m.id-1980s, Maryland's Department of Nat\u00ad ural Resources completely dosed down the recreational and tom\u00ad mercia! fisheries, and made it illegal for anyone to possess stnped bas.~. The ban on fishing remained m dfett for about five years, and now the striped bass stock supports a tightly managed recreational and commercial fishery. The problem is that application of economic theory as a predic\u00ad tor and measurement tool works best in Situations where there 1s no great structural and technological change occurring. Tills is not the case with marine biotechnology. What economin does otTer is a logical cunstrtKt within which one can understand the growth and development of marine biotechnology. By understandmg this con\u00ad struct, or '\"framework,\" it becomes possible to afit-ct change in the course of marine biotechnology development through carefully crafted poliCJes. In this chapter, we focus on two frameworks that m\u00ad volve understandmg marme biotechnology. One is the framework of the role of R&D m induscrial development. The second framework is a broader view of product or mdustry development in general, the product life cycle. We apply the information gathered in the course of thi5 study to these frameworks to further our understanding of the econonuc~ of marine biotc:chnology. MfASURING R&D AND ITS RETURNS Theoretical Considerations One of several possible ways to view marine biotechnology 111 a collectiVe and cohes1ve sense, 1s to accept the premise that the A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRALIA, AND NoR:W\"V 133 knowledge In order to conc~ptualize m.tTliK biotechnology restan:h, rtco~nizing that some in\u00ad ventions are not patented, and many others art patt\"lltt'd but never devdopcd.

However, if we are interested in ultimate benefits related to increasl\"S m tht: knowledge base of marine biotechnology, exanunation on an mdus\u00ad try by industry or product by product basis will be required. Marine Biotechnology R&D Given the above framework for analyzing research expenditures and the empirical information provided by MARli!O, we analyzed the current results of marme biotechnology rt'search at U.S. mstitu\u00ad tions. The procedures med were as follows. Based on the survey data, total research expenditures in marine biotechnology in the U.S wa~ approX11natdy .$65 million in 1991. Of that amount, $40 million was bemg spent at academic mstiwtiom and on1y $25 million by mdustry. According to survey respondents, funding would grow from SSO million m 1988, to reach .$105 mil\u00ad lion by 1994, if no significant changes in funding policies occur in the intwm (Figure 14). Growth in industry R&D is expected to be greater than R&D at academic institutions, so that by 1994, mdmtry will be spending S65 nllllion, compared to acaderma's S40 million. Da.u are presented in nominal dollars (not adjusted for inflation). In real terms, there has been no significant growth m funding for ma\u00ad nne biotechnology research in the academic ~ector. To verify the fundmg estimates, we used information provided by the National Sea Grant Office, the only federal agency li~ting ma\u00ad nnc biotechnology as a separate category\u00b7. Since funding by the Na\u00ad tional Sea (~rant Office in \\989 for marine biotechnology research at a(ademic institutions was S2.3 million ($4.1 if matching fund~ are included). and dau from survey respondents showed Sea Gr.mt pro\u00ad viJmg 1 0.7'% of total funds, an estimated budget for marine biotechnology was becv.\u00b7een $22 and .$3K million for 1989. The esti\u00ad m:tte from the MAR.BIO data for 1989 was approximately $36 mil\u00ad lion, within the range estimated from tht: National Sea Grant Office <hta. Hy extrapolating back from the survey results for budget growth during the last three years, a.ssuming that prior to 1984 there was no A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 135 $100 sol~,:.~,~.J~,J':,;;,J'l,.,!~,,.,~,~\"\"'~'~'~m 1w1 lhe Uniled ~- funding targeted for marine biotechnology research, since .a complete fund\u00ad ing history for marine biotechnology research in the U.S. Based on results of this analysis, the U.S. has expended S218 million through 1991 on marine biotechnology research at academic in.o;titutions, and private industry expended S 114 million. The figure of S218 million estimated for research expenditures at academic institutions has resulted in 184 patents to date, and an additional120 patents have been applied for (MARBIO). According to OTA 1988), th_e pat~!!t ~c~~p_tancc ra~_~in bj_Q!~c-~~wlogy is approximately applying that factor to the 120 mari~~ .biOtechOOfogiP~te;;_ts being applied for, yields an estimated 49 patents that will be appmved from the research e.>..-pcn\u00ad ditures ro date, the total then being 233. The ratio of research ~x-136 THE GLOBAl CHALlENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOtOOY penditures to patents i~ then just below $1 million per approved Patent. Considering the nature of our sample bemg mainly aC.ld~~\u00ad ically oriented, and therefore with an emphasis on ba.~ic research, this is a remarkably large number of patents per research dollar. In fact, the ratio of patents to research dollars expended by pri\u00ad vate industry is stgnificandy le~s than for academic expenditures at thi~ time. By late 19Y2, only 25 marine biotechnolo!O' patents had been granted to mdustry, with applications for an additional 97 in process. Therefore, we estimate that the $114 million m R&D ex\u00ad pendirures to date will result m a total of 64 patent~, or one patent per $1.78 million Itt mdustrial research expendirures. Following Griliches (1990) framework, one can conclude that marine biotechnology has already been very successful in mcreasing the stock of economically important knowledge. Value, however, de\u00ad rives from application of the knowledge to new product and process development. Estimates of the value of specific marine biotechnolo\u00ad gy products are difficult to come by. Gnliches (1990) reported that, on average, after a patent was 1ssucd the stock market value of the: company rece1ving the patent increased by $810,000. Marine biotechnology patents are expected to have significant value, espe\u00ad cially if the resulting products are high-valued pharmaceuticals or fine chem1cak TH\u00a3 PRODUCT (INDUSlRY) UFE CYCLE Theoretical Considerations A product (industry} life cycle offers a way to present the broader view in explaining the time path of the sales volume of a product (industry). Simply stated, sales volume equals price multi\u00ad pliN. by quantity, so the life cycle explaim changes in both the price and quantity of a product. In economic term~. it otfen an explana\u00ad tion of the causes of ~hifu m supply and demand for a product. The product life cycle concept has been discussed in numerous busine-;s economic articles (e.g., Wells, Jr., 1972; Rink and Swan, 1979; Onkvisit and Shaw, 1989) and criticized m others (Dhalla and Yu-s\u00ad peh, 1976). A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 137 The typical product life cycle model follows an S-shaped curve (Figure 1.5) winch can be divided into four stages (Kotler, 1980). The first stage 1~ the product innoduction phase. In this phase, prod\u00ad Uct prices and production costs are high became of the small quanti\u00ad ty of output. There may still be technoiogical problems in produc\u00ad tion, and distributors and customers are reluctant to deal in the product because of supply uncertainty. Lack of familianty wtth the products and 1b attributes and its high price contribute to consumer resi~r:.mce at this stage. A..~ the product enters into a grov.rth stage. sales increase as new customers start mmg the product, and new competitors start pro\u00ad ducmg u. Decause the product 1s expanding into new markets, prices remain high despite the increased production. Production FifJVff! 15. The product life cycle. 138 THE GLaiAL (HALlfNGE OF ~RINE BIOTECHNOLOGY costs are lower during tim pcnod because techmca! difficulties m production (e.g., scale-up) have bt.:cn oven.:ume, Jnd production quamities are high enough to allow tlrms to enjoy economies of scale. Profit margins are highest during this stage of product develop\u00ad ment. The maturity stage of the product life cycle, itself, comprises three stages. Growth maturity represents a period of slow down ln the rate of increase in sales a.~ the market becomes saturated with the product. Eventually, the market reaches <.aturation and enteN a phase of stable maturity. At this stagc, ~alt:s are level on a per capita basis, so that absolute growth is dependent on population growth. Finally, some products reach a stage of decaymg maturity where sales actual\u00ad ly decline as competition from other products mcreases.ln fact, some products may reach a fourth stage, obsobcence. A maJor criticism of the product hft:-cycle concept i~ that not all product!. pass through every pha.~. and the length of time a prod\u00ad uct stays in a given phase can vary greatly among products. The magnitude of changes in sales growth can also differ greatly among products. Within a product line, change m sales growth between phases can be very large or very small. In other words, the product life cycle concept 1s so general that it provides little predictive power for projecting the changes in sales for a ~pecific product. Despite these shortcomings, the product life cycle offers a useful paradigm whereby information about shifts in supply and demand can be pre\u00ad dicted and/ or studied. Marine a;ote<hnology and the Product Ule Cycle In the 1989 OECD report, the product life cycle framework was u~ed to discuss the potential for diffusion of biotechnology-re\u00ad lated mdustry. Marine biotechnology has the potential to affect the product life cycle of a given product or indmtry tn a number of ways. A Sl!:,>nificant contribution of marine biotechnology develop\u00ad ment 1s in the downward shift (increased effi.ciem:y) m an industry supply curve through development of a new or improved proce\\\"S for producmg an existing product. Even though the product may al\u00ad ready be m the mature or declining phase of its life cycle, the new A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 139 proce>S may allmv a lower price of production, and therefore, a lower price to comL111H':rs. The lower price may then increase the quantity per demand unit and, thereby, sales per capita mcrcase. Note that to\u00ad tal demand does not mcn:ase in this case, but the lower pnce means more of the product will he purchased with the same demand. Manne biotechnology also has the potential to increase demand for products by producing them via processes appealing to the public in terms of health, safety and ethics. One example is the use of ma\u00ad rine cdl line~ t(Jr pmduct assays and testmg, eliminating the need to me mammals, alleviating the concerns of consumers who would otherwise avoid Lbe product. Products may be manufactured by methods enhancmg the nutritional quality of the final product, or its perceived and/or actual safety to the consumer. For example, one of the virtues claimed for aquaculrured fish 1s that they are grown in a controlled environment, free of harmfi1l chemical residues that may be present in fish harvested from the wild. There 1s no question that marine biotechnology will YJdd a va\u00ad riety of new products and processes in each of the categories cited in Chapter 1. In the following section, application of the product life cycle framework to assess the potential of marme biotechnology potential for a specific industry, namely aquaculture, is discussed. Economic: Aspects of Marine Biotec:hnology Applications to Aquac:ulture At the international level, shrimp and salmon aquaculture repre\u00ad sent major success stories of the past decade. Domestically, farm\u00ad raised catfish sales compmed approximately 459 nllllion pounds m 1993, with a value of$325 million pondside (USDA, 1994). Growth of the aquaculture indu~try has not resulted from consumers increas\u00ad ing thetr consumption at high prices for aquacultured products. In\u00ad stead, much of the increase in aquaculture production ha., been mar\u00ad keted at lower prices. Figure~ 16 and 17 show Norwegian salmon and U.S. catfish production and farm prices over a several year time span. The real pncc of both products declined significantly over time. The result, hov.rever, wa~ a <;et of product life cycle curves that closely resemble the classical form (Figures 18 and 19).

That 1s, the product Is initially avadabk with many new markets to penetrate, allowmg production to expand without putting significant downward pressure on price. As the markets be\u00ad come saturated, with fewe-r new market'\\ to penetrate (or marginal marketing costs increase). the only way to increa.o;e sales in a saturated market i~ to ,e\\1 the product at a lower pnce. Technological change allows producers to lower price while the market continues to ex\u00ad pand. To date, most of the technologJCal change mcorporated into aquaculture has been via application of traditional annnal husbandry technology to fish production. For example, a genetic selection pro\u00ad gram, employed for many years in Nor\\.vay, mitially increased the growth rate for Atlantic salmon by I 0-I 2'% per generation (N orwe\u00ad gian Fish Farmers' Breeding Center, undated). As application of tra\u00ad ditional methods enter a phase of declinmg marginal returns, marme biotechnology offers an opportunity to return to, or keep the pro\u00ad duction of some aquacultured products, m the profitable growth phase by lowering production costs through technologlcal improve\u00ad menK In addition, many high-valued seafood products can not be produced profitably using traditional aquaculture techniques.. Marine biotechnology applications offer the prom1se of economically feasi\u00ad ble aquaculture production. Three production areas for which ma\u00ad rine biotechnology offers the greatest potential for lowenng produc\u00b7 tion costs are growth and feeding, hatchery production, and dosed systems or recirculating aquaculture production. Whatever produc\u00ad tion benefits are derived from manne biotechnology applications to aquaculture will have to be tempered by the as yet unknown level of consumer resistance to foods a>mciated with genetic engineering and other forms of marine biotechnology. Feed is the hight!it operating w~t component of most aquacul\u00ad ture production. Basic research in fish nutrition has provided un-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 143 pr()ved t\"t-ed~. !owning production cmts. For example, a feed that cost~ $0.20 per pound that results in SO'Xo survtval and a 2.5:1 feed conversiOn ration contributes a cost of$0.83 per pound offish raised to one and a half pounds. On the other hand a $0.20 per pound feed yielding 90% survival and 1.5:1 feed conversion TJ.tio contributes only S0.47 to the cost per pound. In 1992, aquaculture production of >almon in the U.S. wa~ estimated to be about 13,000 tons of fish. From the example above, the saVIngs m that limited market due to improved growth and survival would be at least $10 million. Traditional selective breeding programs are aimed at producmg fish with a low feed conversion ratio, given the existing feeds and production methods. Faster growth, even with the same feed conwr\u00ad sion ratio, lowers cost~ because of the time cost of money (diKount rate), and the ability to increa.~e final output, thus lowering average fixed costs. The ability to produce three crops of shnmp per year from a given pond makes shrimp aquaculture profitable in equatorial regions, but of questionable profitability in the US., where only one or two crops can be harvested per year. Transgemc fish, triploids, and other products of genetic engt\u00ad neering offer the promise of unproved feed conversion, better growth rates and enhanced survival of fish in existing aquaculture production as well as new products. Since production costs are most ~ensitive to a cornbmation of these factors, aquaculture could benefit great1y from th~ marine biotechnology mputs. Hotthery Produrnon Another major operating cost for aqm.culturc operations is for the \"seed,\" i.e., fry. fingerlings, smolt, spat, etc. A low unit cost and a steady supply of 'eed for stocking aquacu1turc operations are impor\u00ad tant. For example, a maJor stumbling block for the further expansion of shrimp aquaculture is the availability of post-larval sbrimp for pond stocking (National Marine Fishenes Service, 1992). Only re\u00ad cently have hatcheries become the major supplier of post-larvae; most still rely on wild harvest. Marine biotechnology offers the promise of reducing seed cost and increasing availability by control 14.4. THE GLOSAL CHAllENGE Of MARINE BIOTECI-INOlCX7'1' offish breeding. Control of disea~e, also 11l1portant 111 grow-out, IS another area where marine btotechnolot-,')'. by increasmg survival at all stages of fish production, can have J. stgnificant cost lowering ef\u00ad fect. Closed s,_ Technology Production technology is dl-pendent on the type of aquaculture sy~tem employl-\u00b7d. Water temperatures maintained for optimal growth and survival have a distinct .1dvantage (;Ompared with sys\u00ad tems relying on ambient conditions. If !J.rge quannties of naturally heated water (e.g., geothermal wells) are not available, then water temperature control makes econom1c sense only Ill a water reu-se system that keeps the costs of maintaining water temperatures to a minimum. Although several type~ of dosed systems are currently in operation in the U.S. for raismg striped bass, tilapia, catfish and other species, to our knowledge, none have demonstrated profitability. Technological constraint~ of closed systems are associated principally with efficiency of the filtration system and ability to mamtain sati~\u00ad factory oxygen levels. In addition, off-flavor can be a major problem. as well, in closed systems. These te<.:hnological difficulties are not sp..:cific to a particular specie~. thus aquaculture is improved across the board 'Arith each improvement in dosed system technology. Many closed aquaculture systems rely on biological filters for waste treannent. Advances in effictency of the filters, and re~ultam lower costs will contribute significantly to economi(; viability of dosed systems. Control of disea.~e w\"ill be crucial for economic prof\u00ad itability, especially in systems where fish arc maintained in high pop\u00ad ulation density. Genetically engineered vaccines and biotechnology\u00ad derived aquaculture drugs v..ill be important components of this fish health system. Doubtless, marine biotechnology will play an impor\u00ad tant role in the development of dosed system aquaculture. Other Products and Industries In Chapter 1, an overview of potential products and applica\u00ad tiom deriving !Tom marine biotechnology research was provided. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 145 The type of tiamcwork discussed above for evaluating aquaculture can be applied to each industry or product as they are developed and more information is gained. Diffusion processes in pharnuceutical manufacturing developed through marine b10technology will be much swifter and more efficient than for most other products. For diseases and illnesses for which there arc few treatments, any new drug enters the market with virtually no competition. Obviously, pa\u00ad tients are not as concerm\u00b7d about the use of genetic engineering in producuon of a drug, as long as it is effective and safe. In contrast, when the consumer has choices between genetically-engineered and \"natural\" products, the fear of genetic engineering enters more strongly into the choice process. The consumer 1s more willing to accept the lifc-savmg genetically engmeered drug without hesita\u00ad tion, but buy1ng the genetically engineered tomato is another mat\u00ad ter. In general, the fewer alternatives to any product, and the greater the demand, the more rapidly will the product diffuse through the market, and the greater the absolute level of production. This princi\u00ad ple applies dramatically to an area such as bioremediation which hold~ such great promise. The alternatives for cleaning up contami\u00ad nated sites are few and very expensive. In comparison to bioremedi\u00ad ation, aquaculture holds less dramatic promise because there are so many kind~ of seafood, as well as many alternative protein sources. A study v.ras done by OTA (tlJ91) of the potential of biotech\u00ad nology m a vanecy of sectors, including pharmaceutical, agriculture, chemical and environmental. There is no reason to assume that ma\u00ad rine biotechnology will play out any differently in its development than biotechnology in general. The finding of the OTA {1988) ana1ysis certainly t~ relevant here: \"Biotechnology is a tool employed by several sectors. Each sector faces its own unique advantages and hurdles in the commercialization process. As biotechnology becomes fully integrated, it is often subsumed into the financial market;, regu\u00ad latory requnemcnts, patent tssues, and personnel needs faced by those industries.\" Curtin (1985) suggested another approach to looking at prof\u00ad iuble areas for growth m marine biotechnology products. One ap\u00ad proach is to produce low-priced substitutes for products that have 146 THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY broad, high-volume industnal uses. such as agarose, a food additive. Another profitable direction IS in manufacture oflow-volume, high\u00ad value products, including fine chemicals \u00b7with specialty uses in labo\u00ad ratones or manufacturmg of mediCal products. Highest profits usual\u00ad ly are earned with product~ that are both high-volume and hi~-v:ll\u00ad ue. Many pharmaceuncah have the potential to fit ~uch a market niche, which is why tht>re 1s stgnificant mterest m marine natural products with bioactive charactemtic~. Examples of Potenlial Payoffs from Marine a;otechnology A question chat continually i~ a.\\ked with respect to public and private mvestmcnt m marine biotechnology ts: Will it be worth tt? Another is: how much funding IS appropriate for this kind of re\u00ad search? These questions arc: difficult to answer with precision. A real\u00ad istic approach is to analyze selected industnes where marine biotechnology research and development have reasomble potential to make a valuable contribution. It should be pointed out that, in any of these estimates of potencial sales or savmgs, the correct mea\u00ad sure of benefits to producers are profit~ noc sales. For consumers, the measure of benefits is the difference between what he or she, the consumer, is willing to pay for a quantity of the product and what is actually paid. For products such as life-saving drugs, willingness-to\u00ad pay can be far higher than the amount actually paid. Examples of potential payoffs from aquacuhure have already been diKussed. Bdow, the potential for two other mdustries, phar\u00ad maceuticals and hioremediation, are cited. The global pharmaceutical market is estimated to be more than $15!) billion. with a U.S. share of 30% (OTA, 1991). Biotechnology\u00ad denved products were valued at S2 in 1990. Manne biotech\u00ad nology can conrriburc to thi~ market at least in two important ways: (1) offering less cosdy alternatives for existing drugs; and (2) yielding development of new drugs for which no substitute currently exists. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 147 Less costly drugs contribute to the cost-containment cris1s pTt'scntly loonung b~:fon: the health the argu\u00ad ments rdated to contammg: costs that pharmaceutical firms nn re\u00ad cover from the .We of drugs i~ that this wlllmhibit invesmtent m re\u00ad search omd development of new drug;. But if biotechnology can lower the cost of drug production, or increase the probability that an CJ,:p1.:riment.al drug: will be effective, this can offiet the lower revenues from the sale of the drug. The market for a new drug can be huge. For example, Amgen's biotechnology produced drug Epogen, used to treat dialysis anc\u00ad nua, y1clded $300 milhon in revenues in 1990 (OTA, 1991). The promise of economic and social benefits from drugs and vaccine~ de\u00ad rived from marine biotechnology n:search and development is pre\u00ad diCLed to exceed, by several orders of magnitude, expenditures pro\u00ad posed in this area. Bioremecliation According to the U.S. General Accounting Otlice, American mdustry and gove-rnment are currently spending about $115 billion a year to meet environmental goals resulting from legislation enacted over the la~t 20 years, and that number is expected to increase to $\\60 billion by the end of the decade. In a market this size, any kind of product or process resulting fium marine biotechnology resean:h and development has a great potential to garner ~vings and also be the impetus for the development of a bioremediation industry. Remedial effort~ at superfund and other sites are often prohibi\u00ad tivdy expensive, and the use of biotechnology may eventually pre\u00ad sent the onJy financial VJable alternative for cleanup. Companies faced with liability for lost use value of unique en\u00ad vironments due to environmental darnage may see biotechnology as a means to limit the1r liability. The sooner the area can be returned to use, the lower their financial responsibility under Superfund regu\u00ad lations. There are many other applications in marine biotechnology that can be profitably exploited, such as new enzymes, biopolymers, and both fine and bulk chemicals. Thus, marine biotechnology, m 148 THE GlOSAJ. CHAllENGE Of MARINE BloTECHNOLOGY effect, n:prescnts a new, emerging sector of the economy that IS, as yet, nascem, but highly prorrusing.

Chapter 5 MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOSAFElY INTRODUCTION fu marme biotechnology develops and advances are made, the question inevitably ames wheth~r this field poses additional risks to those of general biotechnology. This que~tion is imporu.nt not only for public and environmental health, but also because new manage\u00ad ment procedures and regulations will have to be formulated and in\u00ad stituted to meet any added risks. This could result in delays in re\u00ad search, field testing, and product manufacturing while new measures and regulations are formulated and adopted by legislatures and regu\u00ad latory agencies. Therefore, it is necessary and timely to here assess whether manne biotechnology acriviti(._-s in fact do pose novel nsks and, if so, determine the capability of the existing regulatory frame\u00ad work to meet them. In view of its short history, and because its activiti<.--s have so far been limited chiefly to research, marine biotechnology itself offers few examples that may be used to clarifY questions about its safety or risk. We instead must scrutinize the history and experience of the tw<l fields from whence nw-ine biotechnology stems-aquatic biol\u00ad ogy and general biotechnology-and draw lessons from them. Ac\u00ad cordingly, m the following sections we: (1) examim: aquatic biology, to evaluate the effects of past introductions of exotic marine organ\u00ad Isms mto new envtronments and consider national and internationaJ policy responses to them; (2) examine general biotechnology, to identify problems that its activities have generated pertammg to biosafery and consider measures that were taken to alleviate them; (3) 149 150 THE GLOBAL CHAlLENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY use lessons from the prcccdmg two subject area~ to analyze ntJrinc biotechnology activities m terms of safery; and (4) state some con\u00ad cluding thoughts on the advisability of testing transgemc marine or\u00ad ganisms in the open env1romncnt. DISPERSALS OF MARINE SPECIES TO NEW ENVIRONS Like the atmosphere, oceans are continuous-thett' are there\u00ad fore no geographic or gwlog~eal barriers preventing the spread of orgamsms from one site to another. Further, except for the abyssal depths, ocean water (and particles suspended in it) is nt>ver static; ed\u00ad dies, currents and wind are fOrever creating movement. The conti\u00ad nuity of the oceans and movement of water favor dispersal of marme species, whether by accident or design. Of course, most often a species is well adapted to its native habitat, so 1ts mdividual members usually will die when carried away from it. Sometimes, however, a species will be transported outside its usual territory, will find an ecological suitable niche in the new enVIronment, and will succeed in establishing itself. In domg so, the introduced species, at times, has caused scnous damage to indigenous wildlife and habitat. A.5 sCien\u00ad tists and the public have become aware of problems introduced species have caused, more attention ha~ been focussed on developing and applying procedure~ tOr alleviating damage from exotic speCJes that have mcceeded in establishing themselves, and preventing fur. ther introductions. Thus, the subject of damaging dispersals in the 1nanne environment recently has been addressed by om: nuJor con\u00ad ference (DeVoe, 1992) and a book (Rosenfield and Mann, 1 g92), as well as numerous articles m newspapers and magazines. We believe that past examples of successful dispersal~ of marine organisms beyond their natural boundanes provide case studies from wluch data can be drawn that would be useful in assessmg nsk that may be inherent in certain manne biotechnology activities, includ\u00ad ing the future field testing of genetically engineered marme organ\u00ad isms. Accordingly, next we consider natural and medlated di~persals and what may be learned from them, and attempts by the U.S. and international community to prevent and control damaging disper\u00ad sak A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 151 The Dispersals of Marine Spec:ies In tht\u00b7 discussmn th;lt .m.'

Of the two, the most \\.'ammon is range expansion, Lt'., tht\u00b7 normal probmg and breachmg terri tonal boundar1e~ members of a ~pecies. Th1~ phenomenon has been insufficit'ndy studied in the marine en\u00ad vironment and this lack of mtOrmatlon prevents us from fully under\u00ad st.1nding why and how species at rimes are able to successtUlly popu\u00ad late an exotic site. Since we know so little about the forces that stim\u00ad ulate and affect the range expansion of wild species, no predictions can he made about the range expansion possibilities of an oq..>anism, whether p;cnetically engineered or not, once it has been mtroduced or tr.msferre-d into a new site by human activity. This lack of sCientif\u00ad ic data about how species disperse naturally creates problems for the investigator who attempts to assess the risks associated with a planned deliberate introduction of a marine spenes to J. new locale. Mediated dispersals of 1runm\u00b7 species occur when human acriv\u00ad nie~ LlU~e them to be deliberately or accidentally introduced in or transferred to an area where they have never existed before. Since the time when humankind took up sailing, by chance or accident people have affected aqueous habitats throughout the world's oceans, rivers, Jnd lakes,just as people have intluenced terrestrial habitats. Ship~ have carried organi~ms finm om: place to another in their bal\u00ad lasts, encrusted on their hulls, and bored m their wooden hulls (Carl\u00ad ton, t9Y2a; Carlton and Geller, 1993). The ever expanding global nenvork of interoceanic and inter-lake canals have gtvcn organisms many new routes for migration. 0\\vners of personal aquariums have rdt:ased orlllillentalfish and other animals into local waterways (An-152 THE Gt.aw. (HAUfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY drew~, 1992). Traders have carried crmtaceans, fish, and mollush long distances from fishing-grounds to market places. PJthogens that atllict these fishery products have been swept along (Carlton, !1}89). Thus, smce transoceanic trading commenced humam have moved manne species numbcrmg m the thousands across the globe in innu\u00ad merable pancrns. Many ac-cidental introductions of exotic specie> into the U.S. have been recorded but, fortunately, only a fl\u00b7w have caused cxten\u00ad stve damage (Hedgpeth, 1993). Perhaps the best example of an ex\u00ad tremely adverse accidental introduction 1s the zebra rntL~sel (Dreissena polymorpha). It probably originated in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, but by the 20th century had spread throughout Europe. Some\u00ad time in the 19ROs, it was transported to the Great Lakes, probably in the ballast water of a ship that passed through the St. Lawrence sea\u00ad way. Tht' zebra mussel was first identified in Lake St. Cla.1r in 19HX, but irs spread since that ume ha~ been extraordinary. It 1s now widely distributed throughout the Great Lakes, as well as in the upper reaches of the Hudson, Illinois, Mississippi and Tennessee nvers. Based on 1ts range in Europe, the zebra mussel potentially can spread over 80'Yu of the continental territory of the U.S. (Aquatic Nmsancc Species Ta~k Force, 1992). The zebra mussel's faculty to inflict severe damage stems from its high reproduction rare and ability to ~ectle on,and colomze. a wide variety of surfaces, mduding stone, ~teel, concrete, wood, plastic and gla~s. Under favorable circumstances, its population density can be a.~tounding--over 100,000 individuals per square meter. As a re\u00ad sult of these attributes, its biofouling capabilities are high. Zebra mussels have fouled water intake pipes at dcctric power plants, pub\u00ad lic water supply facilities, and conventional and nuclear fuel power plants. The weight of colonizing animals has sunk marker buoys and mussel larva have been drawn into the cooling systems of ships, where they settle and grow, causmg overheating that damages en\u00ad gmcs. Mussel biofouling also has damaged harbor structures, canal locks, and flood control mechanisms. Unless contml mea~ures can be developed that ~low the spread of the animal into new territories, as well as limit or dimmate present infestations, the cost to pay for A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AusTRAUA, ANO NORWAY 153 dnnage caused by the zebra mussel will rise to a.~tronormcal height~. The economic damage that the zebra mus~d will cause by the year :WOO is estimated at $5 billion {Aquatic Nuisance Spem:s Task h.Jrce, 1 Y92). HaVlng recognized the peril the country faces, in 1991 the U.S. Congress passed a public law that seeks to meet the dangers posed by the zebra mussd (see below). llesides an:idental introductions and transferrals, humans have deliberately transportt\"d marine species from their home territories to new sites for some preconceJved purpose. lJeliberatc mtroduc\u00ad tiom of exotic manne specie~. like the deliberate introductions of animals and plants on land, most often have been done to develop aquaculture and fisheries, or for envuunmental reasons. Introductions have occurred in waves throughout the 20th cenrury as .aquacultur\u00ad !Sts have succeeded in breeding new, more desirable strains of fish, shellfish and crustaceans (Wdcommc, 1986; Stickney, 1992). In the 1950s and 1960s, there were large-scale deliberate introductions of fish and shellfish throughout the Third World to establish new aqua\u00ad mlture industries, including the Afrtcan Tilapia to Asia and Latin America, Indian major carps to Southeast Asia and Latin Amenca; and the black tiger slmmp (Penaeus monodon) and the white shrimp (J? orienta/is) to many Asian and some Latin American countries. De\u00ad liberate introductions sometimes have been done for purposes other than aquaculture, for instance, to Improve human health or alleviate enVJronmental problems. Thus, larva from the fish Gambusia affinis and Lebistes retkulatus preferentially on mosquito larva, so these fish have b<.\u00b7en mtroduced into several parts of the world where malana is endemic The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), which is a voracious grazer, is used to control the overgrowth of marine plants in canals and other waterways. In the late 1970s and early 19HOs, large-scale mtroductions in\u00ad cluded striped bass (Marone saxatilis) coast, the Pacif\u00ad ic oyster ( Crassostrea ~~\\las) to the U.S. and Canadian west coa..o;t~ and to France, Pacific salmon (Otuorhynrhus species) to Atlantic waters, the pink sahnon ( 0. gorbuscha) to the Arctic Sea coast of tht: fonner USSR, a shrimp species from Panama (P. stylirostris) to Hawaii; and the Pacific seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) to BlOTECHNO\\.OGY 1986; Sinderm.mn, spinosum was transporte-d from the Ph1hppines to Zanzibar, where it i~ now cultured, and the dned product is expon\u00ad ed to Europe where polysaccharide 1s extracted for use a<> a food condittoner (Zilinskas and Lundin, 1993). Many of delibt\"rate benefitted local pop\u00ad ulations and 1mproved the l'conomics of countries. for example, France harvests over 100,000 tons of the Pacific oyster. The intro\u00ad duced fish l..imnothrissa IS a new protein rt\u00b7soun.:e m Africa, yielding about 4,000 tons from Lake Kivu and 12,000 tons from Lake Kari\u00ad ba, and Sn Lanka's entire mland aquaculture produt:tion of 32,000 tons consist~ of introduced fish and crustaceans (Wekomme, 1986; Sindermann, 1986). In the U.S., most of the state of Washington\u00b7~ mariculwre production consists of the exotic Pacific oyster C. gigas (39,000 tons m 1988) and the Atlantic salmon (Stickney, 1992). In some CaSt..\"S, however, like introduced ~pecieo; on land, aquatic introduced species have camed damage, ranging in severity from the barely discernible to serious. The mosquito larva-eating fi~h tend~ to eat eggs and larva of other fish. The grass carp transm1t~ a cestode cau~ing disease among several species of fish. The Pacific seaweed Sa~I!4SS!IIn mutiwm was inadvertently introduced with C. g(\\!as, even\u00ad tually growing so deme in the English Channel along the English and French coasts that it tnterferes with transport and recreational activities. In 1981, scienti~ts di~covered that the widely introduced shrimp P l'tlltltatnci wa.'i the carrier of the pathogen infectious hypo\u00ad dnmal and hcmatopmetic necrosis virus, which has decimated shrimp stock~ in aquaculture facilitie~ throughout the Pacific rim countne'i. Sometimes it appears mitially as if an introduction is successful, but in the longer term 1t proves to be detrimental. This may be illus\u00ad trated by two examples of deliberate introductions that were mitially successful, but which ended up disastrously. First, after several at\u00ad tempt~ had been made during the 1950s to mtroduce the Nile perch (Lates 11ilorims) mto Lake Victoria, the fish became e<>tablished in the middle 1960s.

In the worst case, the introduction of an exotic species may lead to the extinction of one or more wild species. Generic degradation of the host stock may result from its in\u00ad troduction into a new locale. When an introduced species breed~ with wild species, some of its advantageous genetic characteristics may be lost or degraded. Genetic degradation of wild species inhabiting the locale where the alien species is mtroduced may take place. For ex\u00ad ample, if the introduced species breech W1th mdigenous wild species, adaptions for surv1val that the wild species Juve evolved may become diluted or disappear in hybrid progeny. Even worse, important genes may be lost if the exotic species replaces the wild species. When a exotic stock is intentionally transferred to a new lo\u00ad cale, exotic disease agenTh infecting members of the intro\u00ad duced stock may be accidentally introduced at the same time, and these pathogens could attack susceptible indige\u00ad nous spectes. The exotic species may damage or disrupt some aspect of the habitat mto which it is introduced, thereby upsetting natural balances, leading to degradation or destruction of the local environment. Once an introduced species colonizes a locale, it may be\u00ad come endemic and imposstble to elimmate. From the foregoing it is dear that the extent of long-term dam\u00ad age of accidental or planned intmduct10ns in the marine environ\u00ad ment of exotic amma! specie~ usually cannot be reliably as..~essed at the time of introduction, nor is it possible to determine with cer-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAliA, AND to manage and regulate mannc mtroductions have been described, including those by Cahtimm. (Collins, l'N2), Hawan (Hrock, 1992), Florida (Wilbs, 1992), Georgia (Smith, 1992), and South Carolina (Tompkins, 1992). However, since U.S. govern\u00ad ment agennes have the major re~ponsibility for ensunng biosafety (the NIH for laboratory research and the USDA and EPA for con\u00ad fined and open field test expenments), we will not l\u00b7onsider further the role of states in this report. Attempts by the US govt-rnment to prevent d.an~Yt\" to the nat\u00ad ural environmt\u00b7nt by deiibente introduction of exottc sp<:cies has .1 short hi~tory. In the 19th century, the Supremt\" Court enunciated the pnncipJe that wjJdJife I~ the property of a1J the people md that ~oVt\"rnment is the pubbc trmtec in wildhfe conservation. Until 1900, sutc p;overnment~ exdus1vdy fulfilled this rok However, that year the Con~ress adopted the Lacey Act, which seeks to pre~erve wildlife through the re!,>Ularion of interstate commerce. A~ onginally mtended, H had three objectives. First, it sought to sttengtht\u00b7n and supplement the wildlife conservation laws of states. Second, it allow~ sutcs to prohibit the mtportation of wild.hte killed legally or illq,>ally 1t1 other states. Third, it empowers the Secretary of Agriculture to adopt whatever measures are necessary to prevent importat1011 of bud~ or animal~ that have the potential of harmlll~ U.S. agnculture or hornculture (Bean, 19!B). I 58 THE GLOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY The original objectives have been considerably expanded dur\u00ad ing the 94 year old history of the Act. Important addltwns were the Black Bass Act of 1920, which extended the Act's coverage tu to\u00ad elude fish, and an 1960 amendment that banned the tmport of ani\u00ad mals that not only could 111JUTe U.S. agnculture ;md horticu!tun.\u00b7, but also U.S. remurce'i. Howt-ver, the most Impor\u00ad tant augmentation was the Lacey Act Amendment of 19H 1. According to Neushul d a/ (Nemhul et al. 19lJ2), the !981 Amendment was adopted by lawmaken who learned about various damaging introductiom of exotic speCJes, mduding the uuportations of rabbits and prickly pear cactm into Austraha, and the walking cat\u00ad fish, Brazilian pepper trees, and water hyacinth into florida. The Lacey Act Amendment of 1981 simultaneously repealed the Black Bass Act and most of the Lacey Act while consoltdAttng and ~trengthening their functions. SpecifiCally, the Amendment's provt\u00ad sions pertaining to specimens taken, transported, or sold in violation of state, federal, or foreign lav.os now apply to all wild animals, mclud\u00ad ing those bred in captivity and to certain plants. Animals that were formerly excluded, such a.<; moUusks and crustaceans, are now cov\u00ad ered. Penalti~ for violations, which can be assessed against importers, exporters or dealers, were substantially increased; the maximum fine is now $20,000 and the maximum jail sentence is five years (Bean, 1983). Title 50 of the Lacey Act Amendment prohibits nnportation of members of the familie~ Chlariidae and Salmonidae. The first m\u00ad dudes a particularly damaging species-the walking catfish (Clarias batradms), first mtrodueed into Florida in the late 1900s. The prohi\u00ad bition of salmonids is not absolute; salmonido; may he tmported 1f they are certified to be free of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus and l\\tlyxosoma cerebra/is. the parasite causing whirling disease. In J99ll, Congress passed Public Law 101-646, also known as the Nonmdigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (hereafter the 1990 Act). Although the primary impetus fm the 1940 Act was mngressional concern about the zebra mm~el in\u00ad festation of the Great Lakes, it provides a framework for addressing A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 159 acCJdental introductions generally. It has five objectives: (1) to prevent the mtroduction and dispersal of exotic spec1es into U.S. waters through, for example, ballast water management; (2) to coordinate federally supported research and prevention activities on aquatic nui\u00ad sance spt'C!CS, especially the zebra mm>el; (3) to institute control measures to prevent and control non-intentional mtroductwns of exotic spccu:s through means other than ballast water; { 4} to mim\u00ad mize impacts when exotic species become established; and {S) to es\u00ad tablish a national program for ass1sting states to control zebra mussels (Kern and Rosenfield, 1992). In response to the 1990 Act, a Federal interagency Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Task Force, whose co-chairmen are Dr. Demm La~suy of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Dr. Fred\u00ad erick Kern from the National Marine Fisheries Service/NOAA Co\u00ad operative Oxford Laboratory, MD, was established. Its maJor aim 1s to try to develop a coordinated and cooperative approach among Fed\u00ad eral agencies, state agenCies and the private sector towards unmten\u00ad tiunal mtroductions (Wilkinson, 1992). The ANS Task Fon.:c devel\u00ad oped an action program to implement the provJSJons of the Act; a draft program proposal wa~ finished durmg the sunmter of 1992, and then was distributed to the public for critique and comments (Aquatic Nmsance SpecK'S Task Force, 1992). The ANS Task Force has finished it~ report, which includes recunm1emiations for congres\u00ad <;ional actions, and it will be released after review by the U.S. General Administration Office. In addition to the 1900 Lacey Act, public laws that form a body of federal wildlife lav. mdude the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, the Endangered SpeCie~ Comervation Act of 1969, the 1976 Marine Manun.al Protection Act, the Fishery and Conservation Act of 1976, and Executive Order 11987 issued m 1977 (which restncts the In\u00ad troduction of exotic species mto natural aqueous or terrestrial ecosystems). Most of the U.S. wildlife laws. including the Lac~.ojl Act, are adnurustered and enforced by the FWS. Although it \"\\vould seem chat the federal regulatory structure seeking to prevent and control accidental or deliberate introductions of exotic aquatic species into the U.S. is sufficiently comprehensive 160. THE GLOSAL CHAUENGE OF MARINE BioTECHNOLOGY to accomplish its intem, in fitct severe problems have impeded its op\u00ad eration. In partiCular, as explained by People\u00a7 er al. (Peoples Jr. et aL 1992), the FWS has been thwarted in its attempts to formulate policies for enforcing wildlife regulations by a combinatiOn of na\u00ad tional politics and inertia by the U.S. executive. According to Peoples et al., by early 1970s it became generally clear that the reactive approach taken until that time had not pre\u00ad vented dJmaging mtroductions of exotlc aquatic org.mi~ms (Peoples Jr. et al. 1992). This approach depends on idl\u00b7ntif)ring and listing a small number of species considered as being able to cause enormous damage if they were by chancl\u00b7 or on purpose mtroduced into the U.S.; the 1mportation of the listed orgamsrru was prohibited. Because it dld not work well, evidenced by a numher of damaging mtroduc\u00ad tions, a proactive approach was propo,ed, which had as it~ bas1s the concept that unless otherwise proven, it should be assumed that the importation of any exotic species will have damaging effects. Thus, only specu.'S that were determined by the FWS to pose a small threat to indigenous wildlife, agriculture or forestry can be imported. Clearly, under thJs approach the importer would have to shoulder the burden of proving the safety of species proposed for 1mport, rather than the FWS havmg to prove that it~ introduction would be hazardous. Due to oppo~ition mainly from the pet industry, the proposal for the proactive approach went through several changes, but was ul\u00ad timately defeated m 1978. So the reactive approach, with it'i ~hort list of prohibited spenes, is currently employed by the FWS. However, the FWS IS trying to improve it. Working from the pre-nuse that it IS ne1ther feasible, nor desirable, to prohibit all importation or intro\u00ad ductiom of exotic aquatic species, FWS's strategy for controlling m\u00ad troductiml'; include expanding the list of prohibited species, clarifY\u00ad mg: critena whereby the potential of speCies to pose a threat .is as\u00ad sessed, and ~pet'ding up the procedure whereby species can be added to the proh1bited list.

O( particular importance was the adoption of the the International Council for the Explo\u00ad ration of the Sea (ICES) in 197] (and revi'>ed m 1979). Other codes of pr.actices, position statements and conventions on the subject have bt'en n1adt' by the American Fisheries Society (1973), the UN Confer\u00ad ence on the Law of the Sea (I 982), the Council of Europe (1984).

Tht\u00b7 overriding objective of these codes .md state\u00ad ment~ j, to coordinate mternational actions to avert fumrc accidental introductiom and to prevent adverse effects from deliberate intro\u00ad ductiom. Due to the uneven implementation of the ICES code by na\u00ad tions, Dr. Carl Sindermann ha~ (Smdermann, 1986; Sindermann, \\9Y2). The overriding strategy is for UN agencies and non-j.,'overn\u00ad mental organizations to educate the public, policy-maken J.nd na\u00ad tional rebru.latory agency personnel about the potential damag~ that the unportatton of a non-indigenous species can do to nat1ve stocks 162 THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY and the local env1ronrnent. This education, 1t 1s hoped, will lead to the understanding among politicians that 1t is in the best economic Interest of a country to have a strong regulatory rcgm1e m place to prevent unauthorized tntroductiom and delineate tht: conditmns un\u00ad der which authorized introductions may proceed. Another strategy is suggested for larger, industnalized coumru:s. [t emphasizes regional approaches to controlling thl\u00b7 where the feder.at f.,>overnment ensures unit{nntity and con\u00ad tinuity. Whatever approach is adopted, it should be implemented ac\u00ad cording to the general operatmg prmciples set forch m the ICES code. These are based on the assumption that mks from introduc\u00ad tions are never zero. National regulatory reg1mes therefore should des1gned to nunimiu risk.~ from proposed mtroduction.

It 1s particularly important that the scientific unplicatiom of a proposed introduction be an..tlyzed before the event, including clarifying ecological consideranom, such as competition and predation; genetic consideratiom, mcluding poten\u00ad sideration, mduding interactions between the mtroduced and native species; and pathological considerations, including the possibility that the introduced spl'CJes will carry new mfectiom di~eases (Sinder\u00ad mann, 19H6; Sindermann, 1992).

Most hioscienusts believed that the pm.~lbility of any of these events or\u00ad ntrring was diminishingly small, but little data existed to support the1r opinion. In rt\"Spunse to public concern and because of the lack of information on the subject, scH.:ntists &om throughout the world met dunng 1975 at Asilomar, California to assess the possible risks of rDNA technology. The conclusiOns of the Astlomar conference were used by tht' U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to tOrmu\u00ad late a st't of guiddines for regulating rDNA te$earch. As mentioned t'arlier, these so-called NIH guidelines JOr rDNA research were fil\"'lt published in 1976, but have since been reVIsed several times (Umtes State~ National Institutes of Health, 1986). Although they were binding only on re~earchers funded by the NIH, the entire U.S. sn\u00ad e-ntific l~tablishment quickly accepted the NIH guidelines. Initially, the NIH bruidelines: require-d total containment for rONA experiments and set forth the conditions under which this research could take 164 THE GlOBAL (HAUfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY plac.:e. These ranged from the kast secure condition, initially designated PI, but now termed Biosafety Level 1 (I3L 1 ), to b1gh security containment, or BL4. Some types of expen\u00ad ments were not allowed. BL 1 and l3L2 work require mostly common sense procedures, such as the cleaning of working surfaces, the weanng of laboratory coats, and the frequent washing of hands.

Difficult problems that require policy deci\u00ad SIOns are referred to the RAC. With the enactment of rhe NIH guidelines, snentist~ began to perform a sene~ of nsk assessment experiments to deliberately try to create pathogens. These confirmed rhat the possibility of accidentally creating pathogens in the laboratory was infinitesunal. Ther-e are three lllJJOr reasons fOr the safety of research employmg genetic en\u00ad gmeering. First, the successful invasion, colonization and infection by A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 165 a p:lrasae that cau~es disease in the host is a complex process. Not only lS the number of genes mvolwd on both side<i large, but also the interactions between these many genes are to a considerable extent dependent on their locations in a three-dimensional space. The probability of recreatmg this complex milieu by accident when ma\u00ad nipulanng only one or a few genes is minute. Second, genes mclude n:gulatory DNA sequences, called opemns, that control til a positive or negative way the expression of gt\u00b7ncs in each particular celL !t is unlikely that complex regulatory opemns would be created by acCI\u00ad dent in the laboratory. Third, the mscrtion of foretgn genes in a mi\u00ad croorganimi usually weakens that organism in some way, dimirmh\u00ad mg its ability to compete with wild orgamsrns or to survive the many stresses of natural conditions outside the laboratory. Paradmacally, risk a.%e%ment experiments also led to the devel\u00ad opment of new laboratory procedures whereby certam laboratory procedures could be made safer when genetic engmeering was em\u00ad ployed. f-or example, genes from virulent viruses could he safely cloned m nonpathogenic bacteria for further study rather than di\u00ad rectly handling the whole virus as IS done in conventional research. In reference to biotechnology-related research in agriculture, the USDA takes the lead. The USDA's Agricultural Biotechnology Research Advisory Committee (ABRAC) develops biosafety guide\u00ad lines and rev1ews indtvidual projects on a case-by-case basis. AHRAC's review process is modelled after that of the NIH and make~ use of existing TUCs. The USDA also has established the Co\u00ad operative State Research Service (CSRS) to facilitate the safe field testing of transgenic organisms (see below). In addition to directed risk assessment experiments, actual prac\u00ad tice has demonstrated the adequacy of the NIH guidelim.-s. Since the NIH guidehnes first came into effect about 18 years ago, thousand~ of research projects have been done in the agricultural, biological, in\u00ad dustrial, medical, microbiological, and other fields w-ithout apparent negative side effects. This record indicates that properly conducted research cmploymg genetic engineering techniques 1s safe. As data accumulated proving the safety of biotechnology re\u00ad search, the RAC progrcsstvcly relaxed the NIH guidelines. Since the 166 THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOL<X;Y late 197fk, pubhc fears ahout rDNA have largely di~appeared. Biosofety in Reference to Field Test;ng As biotechnology generated pmmismg results with potential ap\u00ad plications useful 1t1 agnrulture .md industry, a biotcchnology-ba.~ed industry grew. By 1993, a b.rge bioindustry had developed m the U.S., consisting of nrca 1,400 companies that are either dedicated bioindustrial firms, or more traditional firms that use biottThnology techniques in some of their research, development and manufactur\u00ad ing proce~~e'i. In either case, general biotechnology can engender two types of products~inammate pmduct and genetically altered living organisms. Each poses serious questions about their safety: Do manimate products produced by genetically engineered orgamsrru pose unique risk$ (i.e .. , nsks over products) to humam, other ammals or plants? Would release mto the envin:mment of genetically en\u00ad gmeered nq..,ranim1s pose unique hazards to existing life forms or the environment? Considering each question m turn, most inammate products from biotechnology are known chemicals or compounds produced via fermentation. However, some of these products could previously be procured m only very small quantities. Substances such as inter\u00ad ferons and interleukins, which have promising anti-cancer and anti\u00ad viral properties, could not be investigated to the extmt they merited since so little of each was available. However, a~ production systems utillZlng genetically engineered bactena were developed, the large\u00ad scale production of an ever-growing number of formerly unavailable bioactive compounds has become possible. Many of these products are now under re~earch and te~ting, and a few arc commercially available. A~ a result, new marketing mches have been created, the concept of mtellenual property has changed significantly and, at times, new treatment reg1mes and procedures have raised ethical dilemmas .. However, to date no gcnencally engineered biotechnolo\u00ad gy product ha.~ posed ri5l ~ above t\"xist:ing products or created unique -~ A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 167 hazard~ that \\Vcn: nut prc~cnt in products manufactured by conven\u00ad tional means. The main lesson from the experience gained by U.S. regulatory agencies .~ince 1981 when the fim genetically engineered product, human msulin, came up for review is that the testing of genetically engmeerrd products need not differ from that of conventionally pro\u00ad duced product'\\; the same criteria of safety and efficacy apply equally to both. Th<: ~trinness of the resting protocol will, of course, depend on the product's intended me. If the product 1s mtended tOr animal or plant use, or is a non-consumable commodity, tts testing need not be so rigorous. Conversely, if the product is a human drug or other excipient, it~ testing must follmv exacting procedures, mduding clin\u00ad ical phases. The U.S. government has met concerns about the safety of biotechnology products by applying eXIsting protocols and regula\u00ad tions to ensure the adequate testing of the product under scrutiny and to monitor testing procedures to make certain they are rigorous\u00ad ly followed. The FDA, for example, does not treat biopharmaceut.i\u00ad cals produced by advanced biotechnology differently than conven\u00ad tional drugs (Fox, 1992). Similarly, the agency regulates human foods derived from genencally engmeered plant<; using extsting approaches (Dcparnnent of Health and Human Services, 19Y2). The situation 1s similar elsewhere in the world. Biosafety regula\u00ad tory program~ in other developed countries, the European Commu\u00ad nities, and elsewhere have evolved to the point where regulators as\u00ad ~e~s inanimate products from advanced biotechnology on the same basis as products from conventional reseJTCh and development. A~ far as we are aware, no country has enacted new regulations aimed specifically at mammate biotechnology product<;. This i.~ al<io the ap\u00ad proach of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Devel\u00ad opment (OECD) and World Health Organization (WHO) (Direc\u00ad torate for Science, 1986). for example, WHO tests a vaccme the same way, whether it was developed and produced using rDNA technology or by a conventional cell culture system. The second concern, the so-called deliberate release 1ssue, 1s currently recetvtng much attention by the scientific conununity and the public. The two pos.~ible major risk.~ of deliberate release are: can 168 THE GlOBAL CHAlLENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY the introduced orga11ism dire-ctly harm the environment or any of its mhabitants, and can any of the genes that the introduced organism carries disperse and become tntcgrated m the gcnornes of non-target orgamsms? The U.S. National Rtsearch Council (NRC) has scruti\u00ad nized the issues related to the field testing of genetically engineered microbes or plants in terrestrial situations and concluded that there are three essential critena fOr evaluating the risk~ associated with a proposed release (United States National Research Council, 19fl9): Are we familiar with the properties of the organism and the\u00ad environment into which it may be introduced? Can we confine or control the organism effectively? What arc the probable effects on the environment should the introduced organism, or a geneuc trait it carrie~, persist longer than intended or spread to non-target organisms? The OECD, which began to consider the biotechnology ~afety issue in 1983 (Teso, 1992), published it~ guideline~ of the field te~ting of genetically manipulated organisms in 1992 (Directorate for Sci\u00ad ence, 1992). For the purpose of evaluating the ~afety of field testmg manne organisms, which 1s dealt with in the next section, it is mcful to review specific criteria deve-loped by the OECD related to evalu\u00ad ating the field testing of plants and tnicroorg.mism.~, a.'i well a.~ the ~ite where to proposed test 1s to take place (Directorate for Scicncc, 1992).lts approach ts substantially the same a~ that of the NRC. Al\u00ad though the OECD critena pertam to the terrestrial cn..-ironment (as do those formulated by the NRC), they provide a framework for our wnsideration (below) of the carrying out of field test~ m the marine enVJronment. P/onl$.

Specific methods for safdy managing thl' fidd testing of generi\u00ad cally engineered organisms are Ill a state of l'Volution. Referring to the experience of the U.S. in thi~ area, proposals for testing generical\u00ad ly engmeered organisms in the field are dealt with on a ca_~e by ca_~e basis by the USDA, specifically by it~ CSRS.

It must convmcingly evidence a conclmion that the proposed release would probably not significantly alter or harm any aspect of the envtronment or its btota. Permission for testing probably would not be forthcommg if the orgamsm to be tested was likely to present high risk to non-target animals or plants; for example, because it possessed characteristics such a~ enhanced fitness, mcreased patho~ J-,'L'rllcity, or pro\u00ad jeCt as having negligible 1mpact on the envJronment, this finding is publislwd in the h'deral Register before a final dectsion is made in or\u00ad der to g1ve the opportunity to the public and its representatives to scrutinize the assessme-nt report and to conuncnt on it.

For example, carbamatt\"S, lactones, ahd tcrpenes will have in common gentr:tl characteristics whether they were ISOlated from a sponge or a tern:~tnal plant, although the1r structurt's may vary widely. Undoubtedly, as mort: orgamstm from extreme t'll.Vironmt'nts are collected, screened And compound-., showtng antibiotic, anti-viral, anti-tumor and otht'r propertics, will be found. However, if the experience of gener\u00ad al biO(echnology is a guide, no matter how novel the structure of a marine natural product, it will nor crt'ate a unique situation, or un\u00ad conunon hazard, demanding a nt:W nsk assessment scheme or regu\u00ad latory n:gune. For example, if a uniqut' marine toxin is discovered, its physiOlogical action is not likely to differ markedly from that of a known toxin; neither v.rill its toxicity be significandy greater than tt.-sting done according to t:Stablished proce\u00ad dures would elucidate the chemical structure of the new compound, t'xplain its mode of action and, eVt'ntually, clarifY its effectiveness and safcty. Sim.ilar to naturAl inammate products, when a cell culture sys\u00ad tem using genetically modified mtcroorgamsm 1s developed by ma\u00ad rine biotechnology, it will not create an unusual situation demanding extraordinary control measures or regulations. For example, the de\u00ad velopment of a recombinant killed vaccine agatnst a vir.ll fish disea..~e 17 4 THE GLOBAL (HAllfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY would most probably be done usmg prou:durcs ~nni!J.r to thme used to develop vaccme~ for other animals: the fidd testing of the fish vaccine would most likely follow established animal vaccme resting procedures; and the developmental and testing process would be monitored adequately by existing national regulatory authorities. Consequently, present protocols for re~ting products produced by conventional or advanced biotechniques are appropriate for use in the testing of marine biotechnology product\\. Field Testing of Transgenic Morine Organisms No one so far ha.~ proposed to field test genetically modified or~ ganisms in the open manne environment However, our review of industrial activities gives us reason to beheve that >everal U.S. re\u00ad search institutions and firms soon will apply for permits to field test transgenic marme fish, algae and marine bacteriaJ species. It is there\u00ad fore timely to consider the problems that these prnpmals are likely to generate. Some U.S. rel-,'Ulatory agencies have begun to nvtew their re~ sponsib1lities m such endeavors. For example, the prospective inten~ tional mtroducuon oftransgemc organi1m~ is mentioned in the ANS Task Force's report, but the issue is not deal with m depth because the ANS Task Force felt ir lacked the expertise to do so. The report suggested that any transgenic marine orgamsm should be considered as an exotic. For a more detailed consideration of this subject the reader is referred to the position paper by the American Fisheries Society (Kapuscinski and Hallcrman, 1990). Since no Federal agency has yet developed criteria to evaluate possible nsks associated with the field testing of marine organisms, we must refer to the general criteria published by the NRC (e.g., pages 124~125) and the nearly identical criteria by the OECD for guidance on what would consti\u00ad tute thl\u00b7 ~afe and effective field testing of marine organisms. Sew-raJ author; have already considered bios.afety aspects of the future fidd te~ting of various tnnsgenic marine organisms (see Table 1). We draw much mfOrmation from rhis body of work to summa~ rize the most important biosafety concerns related to the field test\u00ad ing of marine Ofb>anisms in genera], and the more specific concerru A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 175 m regard to macroorgamsms (indudmg transgenic finfi~h. sheUtlsh, moilu~ks ,md other Jtwertebrates, to microorganisms (marine bactena and nlicroalt-,rae). Genergl Marine Biolechnology Safety Concerns To consider the pmsible concerns that marine biotechnology activities may generate, it Js nece.'i~ary to n..1,rard each step that a prod\u00ad uct goe~ through, from n:search to marketing, before it reaches the consumer. Thus, m the process whereby an idea or t\u00b7oncept is trans\u00ad formed into a commercial product (the concept devdopment proce:;s), the process moves through differing facilities, each pre~ent\u00ad ing Vdrying challenges (Zilinskas, 1989). At the first stage of the process, that of R&D, scientists mvolved wlth research, development and testing ofrransgenic manne organ\u00ad Isms \\vould endeavor to ensure the containnll'nt of the test subject through physical and biolog~cal containment, just as usually is done when scientists handle transgenic terrestnal orgamsms. NIH guide\u00ad lines specifY conditi()ns under which research may proceed, mclud\u00ad ing containment leveL A~ was noted above, most times by far re\u00ad search will he dont' under BL 1 or BL2 containment level condi\u00ad tions. Therefore, at this stage of the development process there is no difference between safety issues posed by research on a terrestrial or marine organism. Further, the likelihood of the orgamsm under in\u00ad vestigation, whether a macro-or micro-organism. escaping and es\u00ad tablishing itself m the environment is very low. After advanced research and development has indicated that the test subject has commercial or other promise, it undergoes pilot plant testing.lfthe test subject is a transgenic manne macroorganism, growing it m a contamed outdoor pond is the approximate equiva\u00ad lent to \"p1lot plant\" testing because here characteristics useful for aquaculmre, including growth, reproductive and behavioral. traits, are ~tudicd. The contained, open-air testing of transgenic carp and cat\u00ad fish (discussed below) arc being done for these purposes. At this stage of the concept development process, the conditions under whiCh testing is performed are specified on a case-by-case basis by the USDA and/ or EPA. Due to the many precautions that have been 176. THE Gt.OSAL CHAL1\u00a3NGE OF MARINE BioTECHNOlOGY taken, the probabibty of some t(:st sub_1ects escaping and e~tabli,hing themselves is very low, <l!> IS the probability of adverse effects by the test organism. If outdoor testing demonstrates that the test subject 1s more valuable to aquaculture than present strains, it would require more extensive field testing; 1.e., a large number of test subjects would have to be grown and propagated under condnions closely resemblmg those of intensive aquaculture, but with gre.ner security. Thus, trans\u00ad gemc fresh water fish would be fidd tested m large pond, connected with watcrways, or in pens sited m lakrs or nvers, while marine fish most likely would be grown in net pem located in protected marine sites, such as inlets and estuaries. At this stage of testing, n:gardlcss of precautions bemg taken the probability of one or a few test subjects ~apmg is rather high. Escapes may occur as a result of inclement weather damaging net pens, predators such as seals tearing holes m nets, boats accidentally crashing mto pens, animal rightists \"liberat\u00ad ing\" imprisoned animals, or for many other reasons. Since the proba\u00ad bility of small-scale escape is high, it i~ important to know the likely ecological and biological consequences of these escapes. Once field testing has proven the commercial feasibility of the test subject, the organism will be raised in large numbers m aquacul\u00ad ture facilities. Since the probability of large numbers of the trans\u00ad genic organism~ eventually escaping would be high, its safety in the envuunment must have been previously established dunng field test\u00ad ing, therefore, no additional biosatCty issues are raised once the de\u00ad velopment process has proceeded this far. Of course, aquaculture op\u00ad erators would stiU be responsible for meeting local and feder.tl. envi\u00ad ronmentalla\\vs and regulations, but that is another issue. As can be seen, the stage of field testing is exceedingly impor\u00ad tant m the concept devdopment process m that not only does it demonstrate the practical feasibility of the product, but also its safety (Zilinskas, 1994).

If spectes valuable to aqua\u00ad culture could he engmeered to settle in a controlled manner, the efficiency of aquaculture operations would increase sig\u00ad nificantly. Although research on larval settling is in progress (see Chapter 1 ), practical applications are far from realization. Improved reststance to diseases--an organism\\ abtlity to resist pathogens may be increased by engineering it to produce more or different cytokines, higher concentrations of anti\u00ad bodies agamst common bacterial, viral and fungal pathogen~. and/or immune enhancers. Research on the application of marine biotechnology to animal health is discussed in Chap\u00ad ter I. Improved food quality characteristics-traditionally, conven\u00ad tional breeding has been done to improve the characteristics of animals and plants used for human food, such as texture, color, fillet size, and nutritive content. ln this vein, thought is being given to modifYing edible Pacific seaweed tOr tmproved use a.~ sushi and transferring food properties from Pacific sea\u00ad weed to Atlantic seaweed that presently cannot be used as food. Although re~earch in this area is not yet bemg under\u00ad taken, a.~ far a.~ we know, it could connnence at any time since sufficient knowledge and appropriate techniques are available. Improved behavioral patterns--since some species bemg raised m aquaculture have the destructive trait of eating their eggs and fry, attempts can be made to change this behav10r trait. Such research goals are theoretical. 182 THE GlOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTKHNOLOGY In view of these research and development objectives, and as\u00ad suming that some members of the species undergomg field testing will escape, any combination of the stx possible effects that have at\u00ad tended past mediated dispersals of mtroduced organi~ms could result (see bdow). For example, if the escapee is a transgenic fish, its larger stze may make it a more powerful predator than the wild form, al\u00ad loWing it to disrupt or destroy wild species; or the t\"\\capee rnay inter\u00ad breed with wild species and in doing so pass on it' genetic traits to sub~equent generations of hybrids, perhaps to their detriment m term~ of them becoming less adapt for survival; or the escapee may be more vulnerable to attack by pathogens than wild species; or the escapee may be able to feed on local fauna or biota that wild species do not, thereby disrupting the local habitat; or the transfer of the an\u00ad tifreeze gene into striped ba.ss may allow the transgenic fish to nil\u00ad grate northward, to Labrador for example, upsetting feeding systems there. One additional Important factor has to be noted when dis\u00ad cussing the possible field testing of transgenic macroorgamsms, namely the reproductive cycle of marine shellfish and mollusc species. Parent orgarusms emit cloud' constituted by nJ..i.llions of fer\u00ad rilized eggs, which are carried off into the distance by currents and eddies, eventually to settle on surfaces where the correct chemical cues are present. Unless there was a sure method to sterilize these e~, the genetic material present in them would be dispersed during a field test. No one has yet proposed the testing of a transgenic marine macroorganism in unsecured facilities or the open marine environ\u00ad ment. Before th1s can occur, technical barriers must be overcome and enVIronmental risks reduced. The techmcal barriers relate to the cost-effective transfer of valuable genes and promoters into large number of fi~h; the ready identification of transformed mdividuals among the treated group; and the selective breeding of transformed fish to develop superior progeny. In 1990, it was estimated that it will take a nummum of ten years to overcome these techmcal barrH:rs (Kapuscmski, 1990).

The probability of a trans\u00ad formed bactenum passing the gene to cyanobacteria is [owr:r. h is reasonable to believe that dispersal by conjugation would be more likely in water populated by very large numbers of bacteria due to contamination by sewage and human wastes than in oligotrophic oceanic water containing low numbers of bacteria. It is important to note that large populations of novel bat1erial spec1es have been discovered in oligotrophic waters. These spenes are at present unculturable in the laboratory and nothing IS known about their ecology, physiological capahiliti~. or ability to exchange genetic material (Giovannoni et al.1990; Britschgi and GJovaJmom, \\991; Schmidt et al.1991). This recent discovery forcibly Illustrates our rudimentary understanding of marine microbial ecology and h1ghlight~ the need for research in this area. The second gene exchange mechanism is tr.msduction, where a wctor transfers genetic material fium onr: cell to mother. For exam\u00ad ple, viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (or phages), may transfer gt:nes between bacterial cell~. In general, phages are spe\u00ad cific, one type of phage will attack only a single bacterial species. Results from recent research demonstrates that an immense number of v1ruses and viral particles populate the ocean surface Layer (Proc\u00ad tor and Fuhrman. t 990; Suttle et The~e data mdicate that one milliliter of surface water can contam between 107 and W'' virme~, which means that the one milhmeter thick mrface layer of the world's oceans would contain a total of3.6 x 10~' viruses (Anonymous, 1990b)l The role ofv1ruses in the ma\u00ad rine envuunment is unknown, although it is believed that most of them are phages, attacking ~pecies of marine bacteria, microalgae, plankton and other organisms. Whether transduction occurs in na\u00ad between manne bacteria and cyanobacteria--or between differ\u00ad ent cyanobacteria~1s not known, but may be possible and is under active study (Ciferri et ai.19H9). The third mechanism 1s transformation, where a plasmid or naked DNA is taken up by a cell from the inunediate enVIronment. Transformation can bt: relativdy easily accomplished in the laborato\u00ad ry under appropriate, controUed conditions. As far as 1s knuY<'!l, trans\u00ad formation is exceptionally unusual in the atmospheric and terrestrial environment~.

Chapler6 MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY IN AUSTRAUA 1Nl110DUC110N In this report, we consider in some detail the status of marine biotechnology in three countries-Australia, Norway, and Japan. These countries were selected because each has significant activities underway in marine biotechnology. Analysis of each country is pro\u00ad vided in seven sections: background, government support of science and technology, research and development related to marine biotechnology, industrial activities related to marine biotechnology, academia-industry cooperation, international projects related to ma\u00ad rine biotechnOlogy, and conclusion. BACKGROUND Australia is exceedingly well endowed with marine biological resources. Its marine territory is impresstvely large, i.e., almost nine million square kilometers encompa.~sing a larger area than 1ts land area. The world's largest coral reef system, the Great Barrier Reef, lies off the eastern coast of Australia, stretching more than 2,200 kilometers. Australia's marine environs include tropical, temperate, and than.aux_<_>tl_le_r_natjgp. For example, the Great Bar\u00ad ner Reef is populated by approximately 2,000 fish species (which is twice as many as the second richest habitat located in New Caledo\u00ad ma) and 500 coral species (compared with 300m New Caledonia) (Groombridge, 1992). Other olf---coa\u00ab: regions of Australia, particu- 197 198. THE GtOBAL CHALLENGE Of MARINE BKlTECHNOLOGY larly \\Wstern and southern Australia, may have the most diverse algal flora in the world, with an unusually large proportion of endemic species and gcnerJ (M.A. Borowitzka, 1994). The rich biodiversity ()( animal~ and plants present in Australian waters forms a tre~_ure ttovc of raw material, amenable to sustainable economic exploitati'~n-Via marine biotechnology. However, the rich marine biologi,ar-re:: sources of Australia arc only lightly explored and just bcginnirlg_~o be utilized. Australia has 33 universities and technological institutes and one maritime coUege, plus a vanety of other colleges and advanced edu\u00ad cation institutes (Department of Industry. 1994). Between 1983 and 1987, an average of 25 doctorates and 15 master of science degrees were awarded annually in the marine field and this was predicted to increase to 35-40 doctorates and 25-30 masters degrees by 1991. Two~thirds of these marine science degrees were in marine biology. The major degree-granting in~titutions are the Universities of Syd\u00ad ney, Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and James Cook (Review Committee on Manne Industries, 1989). It should be pointed out, however, that almost every Australian university of\u00ad fers courses in marine-related subjects. The biotechnology industry in Austraha went through a diffi\u00ad cult early period--several of the biotechnology companies es~\"\"&\u00ad lished in the early 1980s went bankrupt (Gumm, 1992). For exam\u00ad ple, one of these, Biotechnology Australia, at one time was Australia's largest dedicated biotechnology company, having developed seven natural products to the point where they were being marketed (Aus\u00ad tralian Trade CommissiOn, undated). Initial returns from product sales were disappointing, however, so investon pulled out, apparently unwilling to finance research that had only long-term prospects. Thus, Biotechnology Australia failed (Yuan, 1992). The last three years have \u00a7hown the bioindustria.l climate: _in Australia to be significantly imp~ved~ most likely a rest1lt of !it;l.:kt measures, described below, taken by the Australian government. Sev\u00ad eraJ small biotechnology companies show signs of success, including Bresatec Ltd., Biodone Australia Pty. Ltd., Memtec Ltd., Cal gene Pacific Pty. Ltd., Australian Medical Research and Development Corporation Ltd. (AMRAD Corporation), Progen Industries Ltd., A REroRT ON lHE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAlJA, AND NoRwAY 199 and Peptide Technology Pty. Ltd. {Roseby. 1994). During this peri\u00ad od, the Australian biotechnology mdustry has moved from being dommated by a few large institutions and several smaller specialized firms (often associated with an educational and/or research institu\u00ad tion) to being much more diversified, with a wide ranging institu\u00ad tional base and more large multi-interest firms entering the 6eld at both the state levels (Roseby, t9'J4).

Non-business marine R&D expenditure (mostly funded by Commonwealth and state governments) in 1990-1991 totalled approximately 3% of R&D expenditure in all fields: $91 mil\u00ad lion {measured by socio-economic objective of the R&D) or $96 million (measured by field of research) (Deparnnenc of Industry, 1994). Of the latter, marine biology accounted for $25 million, ma\u00ad rine aquaculture $10.6 million, and biological oceanography $2 mil\u00ad lion. It is not possible to estimate expenditure on marine biotechnol\u00ad ogy from either of these surveys since it is not defined as such. Major Australian federal ministries and departments supporting marine-related research are Industry, Science and Technology; Em\u00ad ployment, Education, and Training; and Primary Industries and En\u00ad ergy. Within the latter's portfolio are-18 Research and Development Corporations and Councils, most of which obtain significant fund\u00ad ing from industry levies. In the case of the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, about 20% of the funds derive from the 200. THE Glo&AL OW.l.ENGE OF MARINE BiOTECHNOLOGY fisheries industry (Fisheries Research & Development Corporation 1993). The Department of Employment, Education, and Training i responsible for funding the Australian Research Council (ARC), a well as providing general financial support for universities. The ARC (together with the previously tided Marine Science and Technol~ Grants Scheme) contributed circa $1.8 million to marine-related re\u00b7 search in 1987 (Review Committee on Marine Industries, 1989) The main areas funded were marine biology, plant and animal ecolo\u00b7 gy, animal physiology, reproduction and genetics, taxonomy, bio chemistry and the metabolism of microorganisms, and parasitolor; and pathology. Grants are provided mainly to researchers in highe education institutions on the basis of scientific excellence. Unti 1990, the ARC (incorporatmg the former Marine Science an~ Technology Grants Scheme) funded marine sciences as a priorir area. However, experience showed that applications in marine sci ences (including marine biology) were highly competitive in attract ing funds against other applications in the same discipline. Thus, des ignation as a priority area was deemed unnecessary (Fayle, 1994). In addition, the Antarctic Division of the Department of th Environment, Sport and Territories has responsibility for Australia national research effort in the Antarctic and southern oceans, an, conducts and supports major research projects in marine biola~ fisheries, and oceanography. The taxation climate in Australia for industrial research and !k velopment (R&D) is attractive and highly competitive, compare with other countries (Birch and Shaw, 1993). Governmeni:.lncentivt tO Australian firms to undertake R&D include a 15QOA tax concC'! sion, and a comprehensive scheme ~f~ts and lo~,J2._f_indllStri R&D. Firms wishing to take advantage of a tax concession mu: make a substantial investment in R&D, typically 30-60% (Roseh' 1994). Nevertheless, at this concessional rate, a company's afrer-ta cost of research is reduced by about 500;6 (Anonymous, 1994). The Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) program w~ launched in 1990, to develop R&D links between academic an government research institutions, CSIRO, and commercial comp; A REF'ORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 201 nies, and to build centers of research concentration in order to achieve worthwhile commercial applications of the research. Three CRCs of relevance to marine science are the CRC for Reef Re\u00ad search, the focus of which is the Great Barrier Reef, CRC for Antarctic Research, and a recently formed Aquaculture CRC, which coordinates work in a large number of imtitutions and aqua\u00ad culture companies across Australia. Biotechnology aspects of the R&D of the latter two CRCs are described below. The CRC pro\u00ad gram, which is now reaching rn.aturity and j., an integral element of research funding in Australia, by late 1994 will be supporting 61 centres conducting collaborative scientific and cng~neering research. The CRC program and grants and loans for industrial R&D are funded through the Industry, Science and Technology portfolio. Two-thirds of the budget ofCSIRO, Australia's largest research agency, is also allocated through this portfolio, a~ is the allocation for the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). lncl;red Support: lncluoll'y In the late 1980s, Australia enacted a series of measures to at\u00ad tract firms. The financial sector was deregulated, tariffS lowered, for\u00ad eign exchange controls removed, corporate tax rates reduced to 39%, foreign tax credits arranged, and unrestricted repatriation of profits allowed. The corporate tax rate was again lowered during 1993, to 33%.

RESEARCH ANO DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY The number of marine biotel\u00b7hnology-related research projects being undertaken at Australian universities is small, com par~ J3?an and the U.S. Howe-ver, the research bting done is wide-~ng\u00ad i!lg, iUustrated by the following examples. At the Queensland Uni\u00ad venity of Technology, research on the ecology of ciguatoxin is being done. At Deakin University at Gee long, Victoria investigators are studying abalone attachment and growth, and at the University of Mdbourne nutritional factor; for the gmwth of abalone, and deter\u00ad mination of age in both abalone and lobster are being investigated. Resem:h with applications in aquaculture includes the development of virus-free prawn ceU lines at the James Cook University, and study of.fu_h g~ hormones at Deakin University. A group at the Uni\u00ad versity of Adelaide has isolated eDNA sequences for the ~th hormone from both bream, Acanthopagrm butchcri coUaborarion with the South Australian company Bresatec, these cDNAs were used to produce recombinant fish growth hormones. The same group has successfully evaluated the application of genetically modification techniques to 6sh, using the widely accepted zebra-fish model. Oth\u00ad er research bdng performed at univenities and institutes in Australia includes extraction of biologically active compounds from marine organisms, analysis of marine toxins and anti-venoms, developmint of i!l_dustrial g_!agnostic ero~~~~J.or pathogens of marine animals (Review Conunittee on Marine InduStries, 1989). Sdentists at Murdoch University in Perth, Western Australia, are working in three areas of marine biotechnology. First, they are devel\u00ad oping large-scale closed tubular photobioreactors to culture microal\u00ad production of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. Second, they are genetically engineering high carotenoid-producmg algae to 1mprove carotenoid yields. Third. the A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAI.JA, AND NORWAY 203 Murdoch UmversJty researchers are collaborating with colleagues from the University of Tasmania and CSIRO to develop a PCR\u00ad based test for toxtc dinoflagellate species so they can be detected and moniton:d Jn ships' ballast \\Vater. aquaculture !inns, and elsewhere (M.A. Uorowitzka, 1994). Besides universities, public research institutions play important rol~ in carrymg out R&D in marine biotechnolq.,>y. Instirutes with a major activity m marine science arc described bdow, but it must be emphasized there are significant projects being worked on at oth\u00ad er loeations. At the Queensland Imtitute o( Medical Research in Brisbane, for instance, scientists are testing cytotoxic properties of Bistratene A, a compound isolated fium the ascidian species, Usso\u00ad dinum bistratum, collected at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef. Bistratene shows activity agamst certain leukemiC cells, providing nt:w possibilities for studying mechanisms governing cell growth and dHferentiation (Watters et al., 1994). The following sections describe major Australian institutes with programs in marine biotechnology. Au5tralian ln51itute of Marine Science (AIMS) AIMS, established in 1975. is a Statutory Authority within the Department of Industry, Science, a.nd Technology. AIMS conducts marine R&D and facilitates the use o( research re5ults nationally and internatmnally. The Institute's headquarters are located on the north\u00ad east coast of Australia near Townsville, Queensland. In October 1994, an additional research facility will be opened on the north\u00ad Wt:St coast of Australia at Dampier, Western Australia. The Institute concentrates on research peruining to tropical coastal and continen\u00ad tal shelf waters of Australia. It has three multidisciplinary programs: Coastal and She!( Processes: Coral lteef Ecosystems; and Environ\u00ad mental Studies and Biotechnology. In 1993-1994, AIMS had a bud\u00ad get of S 16.9 million of which 15% was obtained from nongovern\u00ad mental sources. External funding will increase to approximately 21% of the total budget m 1994-1995. Several projects undertaken by AIMS endeavor to provide commercial opportunities, especially those in environmental management, resources and conservation, 204 THE GLOBAL (HAU.ENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLcx:;Y marine natural established cotlabor.ftlons with commercia! partners. An AIMS team headed by Drs. ll Chalker and W.

In a project lead by Dr. J. Benzie, AIMS scientists are currently developing methods to close the life cycle of prawns and to produce genetically improved strains through a breeding program. The long-term goals of the breeding program are complemented by re\u00ad productive resean:h addressing critical and immediate tssucs of larval supply. AIMS has also undertaken research on a range of tropical mol\u00ad lmks, such as the pearl oyster. AIMS has a maJor contribution to make in reproduction, genetics, and broodstock management area.~ of the CRC for Aquaculture (see page 209) that will link key AIMS expertise with several state and university research groups and with CSIRO. These programs include research on crustacea, espenally pra ..... ns, >hellfish, especially pearl oysters, and tropical fish. Commonwealth Scientific: and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) CSIRO ts Australia's national scientific research organization and emphasizes application-oriented research. CSIRO has about 5500 professtonal and technical staff, and accounts for 13% of all Australian R&D expenditures (AustrJ.de, 1992). In 1994-1995, it is estimated that CSIRO wlll have a total budget of$678 million, two-thirds of which is from government appropriation ($461 mil\u00ad lion), and the-other third from industry, earned revenue, and grants (Commonwealth of Australia, 1994). Its marine laboratories head\u00ad quarters are located in Hobart ncar the Southern Ocean, which is the site of tvvo of CSIRO' s diV1slons, the Division of Oceanography and the DiV1sion of Fisheries. Re>earch with biotechnologJcal applications is carried out in the Marine Resources and Pollution Program of the Divtsion of Oceanography, led by Dr John Volkman, through projects on Ma-206 THE GLOSAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE rine Products, led by Dr Pl:'tl._.r NH.:hols, atld Manculture NutritiOn. Research has focussed on explorm~ waste products and convert\u00ad ing these to comnH.\u00b7rcial producb through collaborative proJects Wlth local industry. For example, waste from the deep-\\\\'ater trawl fishery of orange roughy is processed oil marketed~ Hand creams are al~o marketed ;md other products are in development (Nichols et al., 1993). A process has been devi~ed to produce lugh purity squalene fi-om livers of deep-sea )harks. Recent work is concentrated on Identification of commercially valuable sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids from nucroalgae, fish, and bacteria. Dactt\"riological studie'i are part of the Microbi~l Processes Subprogram of the CRC for Antarctic and Southern Ocean Environment (see page 209). AntarctlC nucroorganisms ap\u00ad pear to have potenrial for particularly as sources of novel biologically active compound~. A screening pro\u00ad gram has been initiated with support from AMRAD.

An cxtcmtvt: databa.~e has been developed and n:ccnt studies have shown how culture conditions can be modified to enhance production of lipid, protem, and sugar constituents. This research is designed specifically to underpin future studies examming produc\u00ad tion of algal IYlJ4).

Research of the Divi\u00ad sion is organized imo five programs; three focus on pdagiC, tropical, and temperate and deep-water fishenes resourcrs, and the remaining two on marine environmental research and mariculture. The Divmon obtains 35% of its funding from other govern\u00ad ment agencies and indmtry and an increasing proportion of its re\u00ad sources arc devoted to mariculturc research. The Di\";sion provides focus for major new research initiatJVes by CSIRO in support of aquaculture and is heavily involved in the recendy established CRC for Aquaculture (see page 209). The Divmon maintains the CSIRO Culture Collection, mcluding the largest algal culture collection in Amtralia (which in 1986 contained about 150 species of algae), housed at the Algal Culture Laboratory, also located in Hobart (Communications Officer, 1986). The Laboratory is the major sup\u00ad plier of alg.d >tarter cultures for research agencies, universities and in\u00ad dustry. The Division recently comnussioned a major new aquacul\u00ad rure facility at its Queensland laboratory (Fayle, 1994). Research undertaken by the Manculturc Program in the field of biotechnology includes proJects aimed at development of long shelf-life storage products (pastes and powders) produced from se\u00ad lected nucroalgal species and suitable for use in hatchery and nursery systems to control maturation of tropical prawn species through spe\u00ad Cial diets, and development of transgenic methods for use with prawn embryos to enhance performance in culture and provide bio\u00ad logtcal markers for stock improvement (Martin, 1994). National Centre for Teaching ond Researc:h in Aquacuhure The National Key Centre for Teaching and Research in Aqua\u00ad culture ~'lS established in 1988 at the University of Tasmania.

Aquaculture research and training renttT'i smlilar to the Bribie Island Aquaculture Centre are located at Launceston, Tasmama, aud West Beach, near Adelaide (Rose by, 1994). State Fisheries Research Laboratories State Fisheries Research Laboratories undertake research on wild fish stocks, aquaculture, and coastal environments (Review Committee on Marine Industries, 1989). Funding com~.~ from both state government appropriations and external sources, predominantly the F1sheries Research and Development Corporation. In 1993- 1994,$3.4 nulhon (45'%) of the funding from the Fisheri~.~ Research and Development Corporation \\'IJS directed toward ~tate and terri\u00ad tones fish erie~ research institutions.

[he h10tt'chnology research is focused on Antarctic microorgamsms. Antarctic microorganisms have been determined to be usetUI for biotechnology, notably in their adaptation to env1ronmental ex\u00ad tremes of low temperature and water availability. Production of polyunsaturated fatty acid~ (PUFAs) essenoal for growth and survival of larval fish and crustaceans, arc used m mariculture, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industnes. Currently, algae and fish oils are the major source of these fatty and~. Production of unsaturated fatty acids in w1th growth at decreased temper\u00ad ature. CRC researchers have targeted the permanently cold sea ice enVIronment as the source of psychrophilic bacteria in which mem\u00ad brane fluidity is maintained by elevated concentrations of PUFAs. Some bacterial strains can produce up to 1 H'% of their membrane fatty aCids as PUFAs. Both elcosapentat\"noic acid and docosa\u00ad hexaenoic acid have been detectt\"d among the PUFAs synthesized by bacteria. Centre for Marine Biotec:hnoktgy The University of New South Wales formed a Centre forMa\u00ad rine Biotechnology during 1994. This is based primarily on marine biofoulmg research aimed at development of new environmentally bemgn, biologically derived antifoulants. Additional programs will include in marine industries earned $21 billiou and $5.5 billion was earned from exports (McKinnon, 1993). However, at this time industncs related to marint\u00b7 biotechnology constitute only a small fraction of tillS total. The marine natural products industry in Australia ha.~, until re\u00ad cently, been limited to only a few firms, e.g., Betatene Ltd. and West\u00ad ern Bwtechnology Ltd., culturmg microalgal species, mainly Dunaliella salina, to produce beta carotene. Total sales of beta A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 211 carot~:nc, us<\"d for ammal feed, human dietary supplements, and fOod coloring, were $2 mil1ion m 19H7-19l:!8 (Review Committee 1989). Sale~ mcreased to SSmillion by 19(}2-1993 and continue to rise (L. Borowitzka, 1994). Reflecting the increasing s1zc of the beta carotene market, Western Biotechnology expanded producnon facilit1e~ at Hutt Lagoon in Western Australia from 50 to 75 hectares of ponds (M.A. Borowitzka, 1994). Hoth comparues re\u00ad main profitable as thi~o is written. The Australian aquaculture industry, although larger than the marine naturJl products industry, is at an early stage of development, w-ith much of the tecimologies utilized being imported. In 1987, the aquaculture industry compmed small firms, with an average capital\u00ad ization ofS15U,OOO. h employed 1,700-2,000 workers (Review Conunittec on Manne Industries, 1989). However, by March 1994, there were 693 aquaculture businesses with at least one employee, and these businesses were operating in 747 locations throughout Australia (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1994). The vast majority (92%) were firms with less than 10 employees. The largc~t publicly listed aquaculture company, Tassa.l in Tasmania, in 1992-1993 had a turnover of $32 million and employed circa 140 persons (Bureau of Industry Economics. 1994}. Tassal aquacultivated 1,400 tons of fish m 1992-1993, mostly high quality Atlantic sahnon. Since compilation of comprehensive annual aquaculture pro\u00ad duction stati~tics was begun in 1988-1989, there ha.<; been a 2~/o in\u00ad crease in the tons produced and a staggering 87% increase in value (this does not take mto account effect of inflation). In 1988, aquacul\u00ad ture products earned a S 1 OS million, of which S93 million came from pearl oysters (IR&D Board Workshop, 1989). In 1991-1992, almost 16,200 tom of product were harvested, with circa 19.3 mil\u00ad lion juveniles (mostly finfish fry) being produced in hatcheries for recreational and conservation stocking (some 4 million aquarium fish are included in these figures). Together these are worth $254 million (farm gate value), an mcrease of7% over the 1990-1991 val\u00ad ue of production. The most important sectors were pearl oysters (in 1990, $119 million), sa.lmonids ($55 million), edible oysten; ($45 ($10 million), and southern bluefin tuna ($5 million) (O'Sullivan, 1994). 212 THE GLOBAL (HA.UENGf OF f.MRINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Biottxhnology in general mdmtry in Aus\u00ad tralia. The number of per capita (or per GDP) _ _J~ smlllar to that of the U.S., though the largest such firm m Austr.~.lia has under 250 biotechnology employees, and the average size is well below that of the U.S. (Fayle and Playne, 1 t./93; Depart\u00ad ment of Industry, 1994). These biotechnology compames are very actiw m bringtng new product~ onto the market, with product~ for agricultural and vetennary application and medical diagnostics at the forefront. Commercial interest in marine biotechnology has started to grow, indicated by an mvestment of $20 million over the five year~. beginning in 1994, made by AMRAD Corporation for screenmg marine and other organisms for pharmaceutiCally useful metabolites. In addition to pursumg agreements with Australian rc\u00ad H~arch mstitutes to access collections of indigenous terrestnal and marine plants and microorganisms, AMRAD has made an agree\u00ad ment with the Seattle-based company, Panlabs, to use that company's screening ~ystems to new lead~ from biolog1cal ~ourres (M.A. Borowitzka, 1994). ACADEMIA-INDUSTRY COOPERATION It has been widely recognized that cooperation between acade\u00ad m.ia and mdustry in the field of R&D has been rudimentary, at beo;t. in Australia. This deficiency is being addressed at several levels in the universities, at CSIRO, and in state research mstuutwns, with all putting higher priority on industry need-. and on securing mdustry funding for research, while rural R&D corporations (including the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation) and the Indus\u00ad trial Research and Development Board empha~ize commerCial Im\u00ad plementation of the research being supported by these agencies. \"Generic\" grants for biotechnology R&D, with the primary aim of fostering collaboration between commercial enterprises and research institutions to develop new technologies of strategic signifi\u00ad cance, have been available since 1983. A good example of the value of this scheme 1s the recently awarded $1.5 million grant to AM\u00ad RAD and the Centre fi.Jr Drug Des1gn and Development (Universi\u00ad ty of Queensland) to work on the development of peptidomimetic A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRALIA, AND NORWAY 213 druw; based on peptide leads from the venom of cone shells (An\u00ad drews, 1994). The marine natural products area specifically 1s attracting mdus\u00ad try imerest and, therefore, presents good opportunities for mdustry\u00ad university collaboratiom. For example, in late 1993, th~: international company Astra PharmaceutiCals signed an agreement with the Queensland Pharmaceutical Research Institute of Griffith University to mvest $10 million in a program to screen Australian native plant~ and marine organisms for potential new drugs. The agreement calls for university researchers to collect for analysis more than 100,000 extracts during the next ten years (M.A. Borowitzka, 1994). INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Australia participates in several international projects under the auspices of the International Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), including the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and the Tropical Ocean and Global Armosphere Program. HOMA coordinates Australia's international programs and exchanges of in\u00ad formation (HOMA, 1993). International contacts between individ\u00ad ual scientists also are coordinated through the Australian Academy of Sciences. A mccessful example of international collaboration is the re\u00ad s.earch project between the James Cook University and the Interna\u00ad tional Centn: for Livwg Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM) focu~sed on the giant clam (T. gigas). The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has com\u00ad mitted S5 million to this proJeCt. IC:LARM, which became a Mem\u00ad ber of the Consultative Croup on International Agricultural Re\u00ad search network m 1992, includes six countries in the Asia-Pacific re\u00ad gion, with headquarters in the Philippines and a Coastal Aquaculture Centre m the Solomon Islands. The giant clam grows to a 50 kg weight wtthin nine to ten years, producmg a delicious meat highly prized in countnes throughout the Pacific and Asia. In addiuon, g1ant clam shells are 214 THE GlOBAL (HAU\u00a3NGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLcx:;Y sought after by tounsts. Because ~o popular. fish~:rmcn, mamly frum Ta1wan, have dccimJ.ted the giant dam population in the Pacific tslands, almost to the pomt of extinction. However, a multitude of giant clams tbrive on Great Barrier Reef bt'\"cause they arc one of Australia's protected natural resources. ~\u00b7ork done at James Cook Umwrsity Orpheus Island facility on the Great Barrier Re(,.-f bas resulted in an effective flow-through culture of the settling of giant clam larvae and rate of meta\u00ad project's operatiom panded to include other sites m Australia, a.~ well as the Philippines, the Cook Islands, Fiji, and Tonga (Smith, 1994). CONCLUSION Australia possesses several of the clements that any nation rt'\"\u00ad qlllres to use marine biotechnology .~ucce'i~fully for economic devel\u00ad opment. The marine biodlversity of Australia may well be the nch\u00ad est in the world, both in variety and quantity. There JS a strong ba.<;e of well-educated, highly trained biologists in Australia and many of them are skilled m key biotcchnologles, such as genetic manipula\u00ad tion, cell fus1on, cell culture, and fermentation processes. The num\u00ad ber of Australian bioproct:Ss engineers ts small but adequate Committe<.\u00b7 on Marine lndustnes, 19S9). Australian re~ean:h insti\u00ad tute<; usually an: well equipped and housed in adequate facilities. The country-wide elements that can be considered a national marine program in Australia favor baste research, with marme biolo\u00ad gy a b'Ood example, to applied research or technology, although this attitude is changmg rapidly. Thus, the program tends to support coral reef/tropical marine studies, marine ecology, physical oceanography, targeted aspects of fi~heries research, aquaculture, and utilization of remote sensing techniques for oceanography and mctcorolob'Y\u00b7 Ap\u00ad plied research pertaining to biological chem\u00ad Istry, and marme biotechnology, for example, ts not nearly so well supported by the government or industry. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, I>NJ NORWAY 215 .Although Australia's scientific capabilitit:S and naturJl resources 1re substantial, the capability of industry in Australii to carry rcsearcb results to commercial application is extremely limned. ~pplications ofbJOtechnology to aquatic activity has generated only one--S~CCess: ful product in Australia--beta carotene. Commercialization of ma\u00ad nne natural products is in its infancy, exemplified by development of ;cveral product~ that have experienced protracted ddays. A 1 Y89 report suggested tbat four areas hold the b~t opportu\u00ad mtie) for the Australian tnanne biotechnology marine natural biofouling (R~view Committee Marine lndustne'i, 19B9). However, few Australian marine biotechnology compames presently have the re\u00ad ;ources over the long term to invest in the necessary R&D required tOr return on investment. Conversely, many Australian companies :hat might have the resources to fund long-term projects are sub\u00ad ;idiaries of large multinational corporations, with research pnorines :hat may not be most applicable to Amtralia. From a review of Australian scientific literature focussed on the marine sciences, biotechnology, and mdustry and from infOrmation Jrovidcd by Australian scientific colleagues we deduce that several ~actors impede utilization by industry of research findings, including: lack of a national plan for the manne biological sciences, in~ eluding manne biotechnology, delineating objectives for re\u00ad seJ.rch institutions and industry; impatience and nsk-avenion of major Australian investors, who therefore are unwilling to invest in long-term opportu~ nitics in marine biotechnology; lack of widespread interest by industry m commercializing al\u00ad ready existing opportunities; inadequate support of university research by the federal gov\u00ad ernment; 216 THE GlOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLCGY poor career stmcture for manne snentists; low level of activity in applied rt-search and technological as\u00ad pects of marine biotechnology; less than optimal communication between research mstitu\u00ad tions and industry. Most of these are bemg addressed by Australia m an effort to compete with Japan and the U.S. m selected areas of marine biotechnology. It is noteworthy, for mstance, that an Australian Ma\u00ad rine Industries and Science Council is being established to formulate a marine industn~ development strategy and that a national aqua\u00ad culture strategy is in preparation. A manne industries development program is already m place, including the MARl NET (Australian Marine Industries Network). which allows industries to neru:ork through workshops, senunars, and conferences. The institution of a CRC program has greatly improved communication between re\u00ad search inst:itutiom and industry. From the mformation we have analyzed, it seems to us that a mtional strategy to analyze Australia's strengths, including its lugh1y qualified marine and biological scientists, and its umurpassed manne natural resources, and to link these strengths m a c1rcumscribed, tar\u00ad get-oriented program in marme biotechnology would be likely to s1gmficantly advance marine biotechnology in that country. Govem\u00ad ment fi.mding should be increased, or shifted to researchers interested in applied mannc sc1ences. The Australian Marine Industries and Science Council could be a strong force for improving coordination and cooperation between government agencies, researchers, and in\u00ad dusrnes. An t'\"asily accessible network of information on current re\u00ad search in marine biotechnology should be established and additional R&D programs involving collaboration between researchers and in\u00ad dustrialists should bt'\" initiated. Specitic mcentives and support of\u00ad fered by the government to small companies interested in R&D leading to manne biotechnology products could make a significant difference in Australia's competitiveness at the international level. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 217 Lastly, che compctinvc position of small Australian (\"Ontpanies might nnprovc if they formed strategtc alliances or jomt ventures with oversea\\ firms that have the necessary capital to carry a project to its conclusion.

M Chapter 7 MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY IN NORWAY BACKGROUND Norway is bordered by the North Sea to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the we~t. and the Norn\u00b7t\u00b7gian Sea to the north. No~a.J0 coast is indented by numerous fjords, creating_?l,OOO km ~fj_o_<!St\u00ad ilne. Many fjords offer shelter to harbors and aquaculture--facilities. enabling Norwegians easy access to abundant marme resources. Tra\u00ad ditionally, Norway's economy has been heavily dependent on_!_i'!~ sea; its fishing and whaling fleets are ranked among the largest in the '.vorl d. Fisheries constitute Norway's third large~t e:>..-pol}: !_ndu_sl:!l: (pe\u00ad troleum is the largest), with sales offish and fish products in domestic and foreign markets totaling over $1.54 billion per year (Norv.:egian fisheries Research Council, 1990) (tht:\"Conv~~Si;n ~l[e used here is $1=7.4 Norv.regian crowns). However, in the early 1980s, Norwe\u00ad gJan companies, facing steadily growing costs for landing fish and in\u00ad creasmg competition from fore1gn operdtors, began to invest heavily m the naSC\"ent aquaculture industry. The growth of the industry was spectacular, within ten years over 1,400 hatcheries and fish_f~rms were established. By 1992, these farms were producing 79_-8Q%_of th(: world's aquacultured salrl)~-~-ln 1990, they gene~atcd 160,000 tons of fish per year worth S6 70 million, or almost 500/o of the value of national fisheries landings (Dodet and Malmcrona, 1991). The main crop by far is salmon; most of it IS exported, pnnctpally to the countries of the European Communities (EC) (SOO/o). 219 220 THE QOBAL OiAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY In addition to salmon, other aquaculture and aquaculture-relat\u00ad ed exports generate export income for Norway. Seaweed products earn $52.2 million annually, and the supply of aqmculture-mpport equipmwt to domestic and fore1gn markets nets over $870 million per year {Norwegian Fisheries Research Council, 1990). GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY In 1985, Norway elaborated Its first national program in biotechnology, which ended in 1989. The first program was imme\u00ad diately followed by a second, expanded program called \"National Plan for Research and Development in Biotechnology,\" \\Vh1ch con\u00ad tinued through 1992. The second plan, henceforth rd!:-rred to as the National Plan, specified governmental support for R&D in cell and gene technology, medicine, agriculture, aquaculture, mdustry, envi\u00ad ronmental protection, and biotechnology for developing countries. Funding for biotechnology under the program m 1992 was about $24.1 million, plus support for equipment at $1.47 million, for a to\u00ad tal of less than $26.1 million. Undoubtedly some additional funding for what may be considered biotechnology research IS provided by mirmtries and research councils under other research areas, such as agnculture, health, t:nvironment, etc., but we were unable to quantify these fund~. As this repmt was finalized during the summer oft 994, we had received mfor111ation that a far-reaching reorganization of Norwe\u00ad gian research orhranizatiom had taken place. Perhaps must important, the former system that consisted of five research councils (fisheries, Agriculrure, Technology, Science, and Humanities) is now orgamzed a~ a smglc General Council, subdivided along new lines with Hio\u00ad production and Biotechnolot.'Y m different mb-councils (Dundas, 1')94). However, smce we are not m a pmition to take into account these developments Ill this assessment, what follows IS a description and diKLtsston of Norwegian research as it operated in 1993 and be\u00ad fore. Mu<\u00b7h of this structure still exists of course and, as tar as we know, no drastic m.\u00b7w directions have been taken. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 221 Before 1993, five re'>earch council~ funded ba~ic and applied re\u00ad search in Norway. Two of the previous councils are relevant to this report; the Agncultural the Norwegian _Fishenes Research Council (NFFrl) was the major sponsor of living marine reS~uf~\u00b7~-rel~teiriest:arch. m N~~y (Raa, 1990). In addition, the NFFR developed and put mto. effect the \"R&D in fisheries-1nnovation plan,\" which was a public mfor\u00ad mation network that provided easy access by fishermen, industries, government bodies, J.nd others to research results (Central Board, 1990). NFFR was mainly funded through the Royal Mmmry of h\\heries; the total budget for NFFR m l 990, excluding capital in\u00ad vestments, was $24.36 million (Norwegian Fisheries Research Coune1l, 1990). The NFFR's three pnmary objectives were to: (t) promote and finano:\u00b7 fishenes and aquaculture research and industrial applications by planning and budgeting research activities; (2) coor\u00ad dinate national fisheries and aquaculture research efforts; and (3) serve as the main adv1sory and admim~trative body to the Norwe\u00ad gJan government in fisheries research and development policy. In formulating it~ national research efforts, NFfR was guided by cer\u00ad tain objectives, including the continual improvement of natural re\u00ad sources management for fisheries and aquaculture, the improvement of aquaculture technology, support equipment, and production processes, and the development of state and local, market-oriented mdustry. To ensure meeting its objectives, NFFR established pro\u00ad gram boards, responsible for evaluating its re~earch system and for choosing, coordinating, and presenting the results of specific research project~ (Norwegun Fishenes Research Council, 1990). NFFR had nine specific goals for 1990-1994. They are to: (I) develop the knowledge that will enable aquaculturists to farm new fi~h species that conform to the Norwegian environment and pre\u00ad sent favorable possibilities for commercial development; (2) improve the competitiveness and profitability of .almon and trout production through research that enhan-ces fish health, prevents and treats dis\u00ad case~. 1mprove~ feed resources, and upgrades production facilities; (3) strengthen manne and ecological research in Non.vay to the extent 222 THE GtOMl CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY wht.\u00b7n\u00b7 the country wtll it to innt:~se productivity .md prntiwbilny m Nor.wgtan fishent\"'i .and may he nt resean:h were emphasized: (I) tOr 19Yl). A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 223 In late 1993, the Umvemty of Bergen and the University of Maryland e..,tablished a cooperative program in research and educ\u00ad tion. which includes using video-teleconferencing commumcation between Bergen and Baltimore MD. More JOint trans-Atlantic senu\u00ad nars and courses of instruction are to commence m the fall of 1994. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RElATED TO MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Most of the remarkable marine biotechnology_ research ts car\u00ad ri~-~-out at ten univer~itie;; _and specialized research mstitu!i2.!!S: Of these, two are located in TromsO, three in Bergen, three in Trond\u00ad heim, one m Stavanger, and one in Fyllingsdalen (StrOm and Raa, 1993). In TromsO, over 100 scienti~ts and engineers are involved m re\u00ad search related to aquaculture. Approximate-ly 50 scientists work in marine biotechnology (StrOm and Raa, 1993). Ba_~ic research ts car\u00ad ried out m \\-'arious departments of the Uruversity of TrormO and the Norwegian College of Fishery Soence (NFH), aho within the uni\u00ad versity. Scienti~ts at the NFH's Department of Marine Biochemistry perform research in microbiology, microbial ecology, genetics, lm\u00ad munology, and biochemistry; research m other departments encom\u00ad pa~s fish genetic~. fish development, .and fish maturation. Applied re\u00ad search is done at the Norwegian lnstirute of Fisherie~ and Aquacul\u00ad ture (Fiskeriforskning) that focu~ses on manne enzymes, enzymes in fish processing, and fish health including vaccine development. An important component of the Troms.O infrastructure 1s the Aquacul\u00ad nue Station and its laboratory where researchers can perform chal\u00ad lenge expenmcnts (StrOm, 1994). In Bergen, various universities carry out re~earch in manne bwtechnology primarily focussing on aquaculture. In addition, two institutions an: involved m marme biotechnology. The Bergen High Technology Center (HID), ov.ned by the Bergen Foundation ofSci\u00ad ence, was created to increase collaboration between basic research and industry. In 1990, HIB opened a biotechnology department 224 THE GLOBAL (HAU\u00a3NGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY dedicated to aquaculture and marine biotcchnolo~ry. The second m\u00ad stitution, the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, 1s affiliated With the Ministry of Fishenes and is funded by NFFR and various external sources (Dodet and Ma1ml.TOna, 1491). A total of about J(l scientist~ in Bergen arc focussing on marine-biotechnology research (StrOm and Raa, 1993). Trondht\u00b7im i.~ the nat10nal center for technological research. MaJOr institutions include the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) and the Umwrsity of Trondheim. Approximate-ly 80 Kien\u00ad tists and engineers are engaged Ill work on marine biotechnology topics, including manne biopolymers, aquaculture, molecular genet\u00ad ics fermentation, enzyme technology, and environmental engmeer\u00ad mg related to mannc systems. Notable research is performed at the NTH Institute of Biotechnology as part of the \"European Coopera\u00ad tion m the Field ofS1..\u00b71entific and Techmca1 Research\" pro\u00ad gram on nucroalgae, and on salmon cell cu\\tun: systems at the Uni\u00ad versity's Center for Molecular Biology (UNIGEN). Also located in Trondhem1 is the No~V>~egtan Biopolymer Laboratory, which ism charge of the national program on industrial use ofbiopolymers.lt conducts fundamental and applied research on marine poly~an:ha\u00ad rides, primarily algmate and chitosan, as well as biopolymer engi\u00ad neering based on generic, enzymatic, and chemical method ... Anoth\u00ad er institution, the Foundat1on of Scientific and Industnal Research at the Norwegian Institute of Technology (SINTEf), is the largest in\u00ad stitute for contract research in Northern Europe and has a staff of 2,000. It 1s engaged in work on enzyme tcchnolo[zy related to ma\u00ad ruw products and bioremediation of oil spills and is highly al..\"tive in the dl\u00b7vdopment and fcedlng of fish fry for aquaculture (Dodet and MalnKrona, 1991).lktwet'n 10 and 20 researchers m Trondhetm are worklllg on manne bwtechnology research projects (StrOm and Ra:t, 1 Y9J). Followmg arc some examples of projects being carried out within Norway:~ marine biotechnology program related to aquacul\u00ad ture, the utilization of certain marine natura.l products that have ap\u00ad plicatiom in aquaculmre, and marine animal health. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 225 Aquaculture Aqudculture research m Norway focusses on reduction of pro\u00ad :luction cosh and improvement of quality and quantity of farmed 5sh. Most of this research relics on the use of classical techniques to 1rhieve adv;mces m aquaculture production, so they therefore are not considered in this review. However, some resean:h on tran~_g~!?JC 5sh is being performed in Norv.ray. For example, microinjectlon and expressmn of a growth hormone g~ne __ in Atlantic salmon has been a.ccomplished by K. Gautvtk. at the lnstitl;te of Medical Biochem\u00ad istry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Oslo (Zomzdy-Neurath, 1 989). Dr. Gautvik has also JSolated salmon prolactin and grov.'th hormone to develop methods for quantitative determination. His work on transgenic salmon may become an im\u00ad portant model system for studying the effects of multiple copies of growth hormone genes. Having high-quality brood~tock is of utmost importance to fish farmers. A program bemg undertaken at the Institute of Marine Re\u00ad search in Bergen seeks to secure the availability of the best gjmoo broodstock for future aquaculture operations. Institute researchers used DNA \"fingerprinting\" techniques to tag a total of70,0tKI indi\u00ad vJdual fish representing three different salmon stocks from as many rivers that were released durmg the sprmg of 1991. Probes devel\u00ad oped m Ireland will be used to detect \"fmgerprinted\" individuals when they return to their release sites m two to three years. and will allow researchers to assess the return rates to select the best perfiJrm\u00ad ers for hrood~tock (Anonymous, 1991a). Also of potential value to the aquaculture of salmon is the re\u00ad search proceeding at the Agm:ultural University of Norway m fu. A re~earch team at the university i~ using fast-growing zebrafish as a model for studies on the mtluence of msulin on carbohydrate me\u00ad tabolism and on the genes mvolved in the sexual maturation of salmon. The zcbrafish is also used at the Institute of Medical Biology m Tromsi:i for embryornc development studies (Evaluation Commit\u00ad tee, 1992). 226 THE Gl.o8Al (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY An mtt>resting marine hiutechnology-relatcd program bean mentioning. In the past, Nmv:ay has been a maJor t>xporter of fish\u00ad meal, but 19H8 the fet>d demands of the burgeonmg: aquacul\u00ad ture industry forced Norway to become d net importer of fish fet'd. One solution being advocated by scientists 1s the use of Norway's plentiful mineral gas as an energy source to produce microbial b!?\u00ad mass (single cell protein, or SCP) for fish feed. SCP could partialiy repl.ice the protein, vitamins, and minerals that are now used m fish feed and, additionally, could be fortified by component~ th::tt stimu\u00ad late disease resistance in fish. If a well-balanced SCP feed 1s devel\u00ad oped, it would help Norway save ~pending money on imported fish\u00ad meal and SCP could in itself be an export commodity (Raa, 1990, 1991). Marine Natural Products and Products From Fish Wastes While small-scale and dispersed aqua<:ulture can be environ\u00ad mentally benign, the very large aquaculture industry in Norway has created problem<>. Some of these problems are amplified by the up~~\u00ad ation of concurrent fisheries industries. In particular, the disposal of umreated wastes, especially fish viscera, from fish processmg mto coastal waters ha~ created a pollution problem m Norway. To allevi\u00ad ate the situation, re~earchers at the University ofTtom<;ri and Fisken\u00ad forskmng mitiated a study on potential applications of the complex mixture of enzymes and other biomolecules that constitute fish waste. They developed a product, a de-oiled fish silage, that can be used to feed domestic animals, including farmed fish. As a result of tillS development, fish wastes are now a valuable r'esource, collected and proce~sed by firms to produce fish silage, thus gen~rating addi\u00ad tionalmcome the aquaculture and fisheri~ indu<>trie.~. An important side-effi.\u00b7ct, of course, 1s that one source of marine pollution has been nearly dumnated (Jtaa, 1990). Fio;h wa~tes may also he a source for biochemicals uscfulm re\u00ad search and industrial practices. For example, fish pepsins have a high\u00ad er pH optimum than other pepsins and are active at lower tempera-A RePORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 227 tun:s and rc~istant to autolysis at low pH. These enzymes act differ\u00ad ently on vanous tissues due to diftenng pH optima, thus enabling the pepsins to separate targeted biological tissues .. Enzymes that have been separated from fish wastes may be used by ~earchers as tools to btochemically dissect and ~eparate biological tissues (Raa, 1990). Sinular research is proceeding at the Nonwgian Institute of Ftshenes and Aquaculture in TromsO for utilizing shrimp wastes.ln this ca.~e. water from melted ice used to store whole shrimp after they are caught is processed to recover enzymes valuable to mdmtry, indud\u00ad mg alkaline 1990). One probh:m peculiar to aquaculture pertains to the use of an\u00ad tibiotics to prevent and treat fish bacterial diseases. Antibiotics for controlling fish disease are generally administered through ft.-ed. Sur\u00ad plus feed and fish feces containing antibiotics settle to the bottom of fish tanks and ponds and, eventually, spread throughout the marine envlfonmcnt, where they are encountered by various marine mt\u00ad croorganisrm and bacteria. At one time this problem was particularly as.~:~te for Norway, where a significant amount of antibiotics was used by che aquaculture indmtry to counter damaging fi~h diseases. In particular, a severe outbreak of Httra dtseasc (coldwater vibriosts) snmulated a rise in antibiotic consumption, from 4.5 tons in 1980 to 48.5 tons in 1987, but down to 19.4 tons in 1989 (Anonymous, 1990b). During 1990-1992, Norway experienced an outbreak of fu\u00ad runculosis, which led to an increa5C in antibiotic usage, to almost 39 tons in 1990, but decreasing thereafter to about 30 tom m 1991 and, .again, m 1992. With the mtroduction of new Hitra and furunculosis v.accines in 1988 and funmculmis vaccine in 1992, antibiotJC usage fell drastically, to about 8 tons in 1993 (Anonymous, 1994). The fear in Norway, as elsewhere, was that the aquatic environment would become a large reservotr of orgamsms that arc resistant to antibiotics commonly used in aquaculture; some of which were also are signifi\u00ad cant in human medicine .and veterinary practices. Reststance genes from these tnarine bacteria could be transferred to bactena that are pathogenic to man. Additionally, antibiotics could have adverse ef\u00ad fects on marine ecosystems. 228 THE G\\.OBAl CHAllENGE OF MJ..RINE BIOTECHNOLcx;y In view of the uncertainties aswciated with antib1otic use, re\u00ad searchers have been searching for alternative ways to manage fish dio;\u00ad eases. Possibly the most nnponant alternative i~ vaccines, which are discussed in the next section. In addition, some Norwcgtan re\u00ad searchers have focussed their mvestigatiom on lower mvertebrates and algae, which have elementary immune systems that depend on a set of non-specific defence mechanisms. One of these mcchamsms incorporates a secreted, low molecular we1ght antimiCrobial sub\u00ad stance that is naturally degraded in the biochemical cycles of the ma\u00ad rine ecosystem. Re~earchers have discovered tsolated from mussel MyrilrH edulis a group of com\u00ad pound~ that of salmonicida, Vibrio anguilarum, and Vibrio ordalii, but which does not affect the flora present in the fish gut (Raa, 1990). Scientists at the Norwegian College of Fishery Science are studying the properties of specialized protein'\\ called lectins (Raa, 1990).

Researchers in Norway al'\\o have discovered a ly~ozyme with strong antibacterial activity that functions effectivdy in cold environ\u00ad ments. This enzyme, which ha.~ the ability to kill bacteria by break\u00ad ing down their cell walls, was isolated from the shell of the clam Cfllamys is/at1dica. The activity of the lysozyme at 4\" Cis RO'% of its optimum level at 45\" C, which is up to Several hundred times more active at 4D C than lysozymes from warm-blooded animals. In addi\u00ad tion, marine lysozymes in general have better antibacterial acnvtty than other lysozymes due to their peculiar molecular structures (R<U, 1990). Marine AnimallieQith Aquaculture in Norway like elsewhere m the world is suscepti\u00ad ble to adverse effects from fish disea.~e-~. Matntaining marine anin~a). A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA., AND NORWAY 229 health 1' therefore vital to the economic well-being of Norway. The major hactenal fish diseases afflicting Norwegian aquaculture are Hi\u00ad tra disease, caused by Vibrio salmotJridu, and furunculosis, caused by Aerommws salmonrida; the viral disease of importance m Norway is Jnfectwus Pancreatic Necrosis (lPN), whKh is caused by the IPN v1rus. Much of Norway's research effort is concentrated on mcreas\u00ad mg knowledge about these fish pathogens and their association with hosts, the prevention of disease spread, and developing vaccines to counter bacterial and viral diseases. The research program of a new fish re<>earch center, opened in june 1989, encompa.~ses these four ar\u00ad eas. This center, called AkvaVet is located at Vikan m central Nor\u00ad way, was build at the cost of about $2.61 million, provided by the NLVF, has excellent facilnies and cqmpment, mduding a large hall contaming about 80 test tanks, and ten \"research cells,\" each of wh1ch have up to 30 300-liter test tanks. The environment of the tanks is computer controlled, allowmg the operator to precisely vary salinity, temperature, pH, and flow of water (Anonymous, 1989). Some publicly funded research has led to commemal develop\u00ad ment of several fish vaccmes. For example, m 1979 much damage was caused by a previously unknown disease, subsequently named Hitra disease or cold water vibnom. The causative orgamsm of this disease, which has a mortality rate of greater than 80%, was identified and characterized m 1981 by researchers at the University ofTromsO and the lmtitut<.' in Bergen as a previously unknown Vibrio species, named Vibn\"o sa/mot1icida.

Olhe< Marine B;otochnology Areas While research related to aquaculture seems to be of most mter\u00ad est to the NorwegJJn research community, some noteworthy re\u00ad search focusse1 on environmental problems. At the Department of Microbiology of the University of Bergen, investigations are aimed at discovering and developing novel microorgamsms that co~ld be used m environmental pollut!on __ c;smnol (Zomzely-Neurath, 1989). At the Department of Microbiology -~f the University of Trond\u00ad heim, sctentists are engaged in studies of.~crubia] degradations of e~vironmental pollutants at low temperatures (Zomzely-Neurath, 1989). Norwegian oil companies are supporting research in marine biotechnology areas vital to their interests, such as the bioremedia\u00ad tion of petroleum pollution m the marine environment (Dodet and Malmcrona, 1991). INDUSTIIIES Fourteen small and medium-sized firms constitute the manne bimeChnology industrial '>ector in Norway. Of these, five are located i;1-Troms0, three in Oslo, three in Bergen, and one each in Skien, Haugesund, and Drarrum:n. Norway's largest biotechnology company is Protan in Dram\u00ad men, which is a subsidiary of the chemical and oil company Nonk Hydro. It claims that it is the world's third largest ~tH:!~pany in the microalgal sector, producing algina~es,)amjn~n. chitin, and chitosan. Protan also has production facilities in Canada and the U.S. (Dodet and Malmcrnna, 1991). In TmmsO, several small, spin-otfbiotechnologx typically employ appmxim.ately ten people Cacfl -~d maintain close connections with the university and public research institu\u00ad tions.

Among them are Manne iliochemJcal'i 1991, Dodet and Malmcrona, t 991) Marine BmchemJcals A/S, created m 19R6 as a subsidiJ.ry of Nonk Hydro and now owned by private investors, concentrates on extraction of biocbenncals from marme raw lllatenals. It produce~ enzymes, crC\"ated in J9H6 by the Department of the Norwegian Pharmaceutical Group Apothekernes Laboratorium, produces classical fish vaccines and starter cultures for pre~ervation purposes. Rieber & Company produces fish silage concrntrate, attractants in fish feed, and fish ft..-cd from waste. However, of the companies located in TrmmO the most interesting, in terms of variety uf products and innovative research approaches, might be KS Biotec-Mackzymal. Among it.\" more tradi\u00ad tional products arc concentrates to be used m fi~h feed\\ pepton<.:S for use as microbial growth media, and food flavormg. More recent products include DNA, nucleosidcs, and marine en\u00ad zymes for uses as fine chemicals, and MacroGuard, a glucan from yeast cell wall, which i~ added to fish feed because of its immunos\u00ad timulant properties (Hoffinan, 1990). Company scientists have devel\u00ad oped enzymes found m marine organisms for use as \"biological knives,\" for example, in the production of caviar to separate fish roe particles from the connective tisme of the ovaries, enzymatic deskin\u00ad ning of fish and squ1d, and enzymatic cleaning of scallop (Raa, 1990, 1991). An enzyme mixture, sold under the tradename Hyz.ym, I<; used in automated processes to descale fish. In this proc~s. gutted or unguttcd fish arc immersed in a waterbath containing Hyzym, which removes slime and loosens scales. After incubation, the treated fish an: treated with water jets that remove scales without damaging the fish. A completely automated process, which sells for approxl\u00ad mately $00,000, can be operated by one person and has a claimed capacity of 1.3 tons of haddock per hour (Svenning ct a!., 1993). Hyzyrn per kilogram, an amount sufficient to tn:at A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 233 16.5 tom of haddock. Hyzym can also be used to descale ocean perch. red snapper, white fish, and silver carp. Other small Norwegian R&D companies are BioNor in Skien, which spt<cializes m rapid diagnostic tests for fish diseases and m bar\u00ad tenologKal control methods for fish farms; Primex A/S, wh1ch a product used a~ an in fish teed and 19lJI); and Martens ;mdjahres Fabrikker,subsidiaries ofNorsk which is engaged in the production uf polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oils for food (Dodet and Malm\u00ad crona, 19Y1). Norbio A/Sin Hergen develops and produces vaccines and diagnostics. In addition to these products, Norbio markets vac\u00ad cmes against various serotypcs of coldwater vibrios and Red Mouth Disease (Anonymous, 199lb). It is testing vibrio vaccines for use in cod and turbot (Anonymous, 1990a). Norbio is now developing a second generation furunculosis vaccine using recombinant tech\u00ad ruques. This work involves cloning genes that encode certain extracellular protcim (Anonymous, 1991b). ACAOEMJA-INDUmJAL to facilitate gn:ater mteraction between industry and research throughout Norway (Zomzely-Ncurath, 1989). In addition, a unifying research founda\u00ad tion tOr the Oslo region has been established called FOSFOR. It seeks to facilitate and stimulate cooperation between research insti\u00ad tutes and firms in Norway's only science part at Gaustad (near the Uruversity of Oslo). INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND INTERNATIONAL REIAilONS NFFR was Norway's primary agency for promotion oflnterna\u00ad t:ional research cooperation and technology transfer. Presently, coop\u00ad t'ration ts maintained through informal contacts between scientists and rest\u00b7arch centers around the world, or between organizations through participation in international projects, multilateral and bilat\u00ad eral agreements, or organizations such as the International Council 234 THE GLOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY for the Exploration of the Sea (Centrallloard, 1990). A~ tlus IS writ\u00ad ten, the Norwegian Research Council has a scholarship <;.ystcm to support visiting scientists. Norway also participates m the \"Nordic Collaborative Program on Biotechnology,\" a collaboration b~ . countrit'\"s. This program supports marine biotechnology proJects throu~h the Nordic lndmtry Fund and falls under the Jurisdiction of the NordiC Council ofMmistcrs (Dodet and MJ!mcrona, 1991). ProJect,\" commenet:d n:\u00ad ccntly and Involves Norway, Sweden, and Iceland. This proJect tO\u00ad cusses on the control of sexual maturation in salmon, the area's most important aquaculture crop. Currently, Norway IS negotiating to de\u00ad velop additional international projects and collaborations with the EC. CONCLUSION The condition of marine biotechnology in Norway mdy be dis\u00ad cussed in terms of research, development, and industry. Observers agree that some research teams are performmg world-cla'i.~ re~earch. but the general level is mediocre. One .analyst has, for instance, com\u00ad pared the ScandinaVIan countries and found that biotechnology re\u00ad search in Norv.'ay is more comervative and less mnovative than that m Denmark and Sweden (Zomzely-Neurath, 1989). A more defim\u00ad tiw assessment of Norway's biotechnology program supported this view. An international scientific team that rev1ev.red Norway's Na\u00ad tional Plan and it~ accomplishments made note of the high qualicy of some research teams, most of whom we have mentioned above. But in the final analysi<;, the team summarized its findings about biotech\u00ad nology related to .aquaculture as follows (Evaluation Comnuttee, 1992): lllUit h<' in Norway. The quality ~nd mtnnJtiOllJ.I competinvenes~ varies among the groups and from locatwn to locatiOn.

It is bdieved that a men~h,\u00b7ning of the b.as~e science will lead to the required advann:lllent within applied research and. m due nme, in\u00ad dustrial development. We have noted that even though Norwegian marine biotech\u00ad nology research mostly is directed towards aquaculture, its achieve\u00ad ments to date are impressive. However, the sector it servL-s is m trou\u00ad ble, and this may ultimately affect Norweg1an research institutions. To illustrate, in 1989 approxmutely 700 fish farms operated in Nor\u00ad way. Lately th1s mdustry has expenenced financial reverses, and an csumated 150-200 farms have closed down operations (Larsen, 1992). Production decrea.~ed from a record high of almost 160,000 tons in 1990 (Anonymous, 1991c), to 14fi,OOO tons in 1991 and 138,000 tons in 1992 (Hempel, 1993). Four factor'l have contributed to the crisis in the industry: First, an over-pmduction of salmon has created an oversupply situation in world markets (Anonymous, 1992a). As, supplies continued to increase and prices dropped, profits for farmers have become marginal. Second, a general downturn m the market for salmon has occurred and the decreased demand has exacerbated the oversupply problem. Third, US. and EC, Norway's primary foreign markets, have raised their tariffs on imported Nor\u00ad wegian salmon (Anonymous, 1992a). Fourth, the bankruptcy of the Norwegian Fish Farmers Salr..-s Association at the end of 1991 has rc-236 THE Gt.OML (HAUENGE OF IAARINE BIOTEGlNOlOGY suited by inve.~ton in the tndustry (Anonymous, t992b). These convergence of th~e factors resulted in diminishment of the profit margins for fish farmers, and the climate of economic reces~ion and elusive profits led to investors being unwilling to mject additional capital into what has become a mky venture. It is reason\u00ad able to believe that salmon production 111 the future v.,jll probably re\u00ad flect the-;e problems and uncertainties. Norway has several major barriers to overcome before it once again can become an international competitor Ill marine biotech\u00ad nology: (1) The lack of financing ha~ led to Norwegian business making mmimal inve~tments in production facilities so m many cases only laboratory scale production of products is possible,limiting marketing poss1bilitie~. (2) Since Norway's <>mall biotechnology com\u00ad panies do not possess the resources and credibility needed to serve internatiOnal customc~ and markets, commercialization of research result~ may be delayed five to ten years (Raa, 1991). (3) Scientists at universitie~ and research mstitutions tend to neglect to adequately document the1r work, thus decreasing the credibtlity of products. (4) Technical solutions must be developed in order to overcome prob\u00ad lems m the aquaculturing of <ipecies such a~ cod that result in 50- 90% !ossa between metamorphosis and harvest, including adequate 'upplies of liw feed, the recapture of cod fry, and the weaning of fry from live to artifioal feed (Holm, 1989). (5) The Norwegians' level of distmst towards biotechnology is high, possibly equal to, or ex\u00ad ceeding, the level found in Denmark and Germany. This creates problems pertaining to the public acceptance and commercia] au\u00ad thorization of biotechnology products. For example, the company Manne Genetics in Bergen worked on the transfer of the growth hormone gene m salmon. Despite what appeared to be successful re\u00ad search, it tJ.iled due to difficulties related to public acceptance of its work (Dodct and Malmcrona, 1991). (6) Unlike the past when Nor\u00ad wegun biotechnology companies were able to open and begm op\u00ad eratiom on shoestring budgets, new compames must invest $13-18 million m cqmpnK\u00b7nt, tacihties, and documentation befOre start-up. This amount of money is considered very high in Norway, nuking it difficult for entrepreneur; to raise capital (R.u, 1991). A REPORT ON lHE U.S., JAPAN AUSlTWIA, AND NoRWAY 237 A maJor difficulty ficing Norwegian aquaculture concerns trade barriers. The U.S. once was Norway's srcond largest market for aquacultured salmon. However, in 1991 the U.S. raised the import tax on fishery products from Norway, pnmarily because Norweg:tan product~ were being sold cheaper than those produced by U.S. fish\u00ad ery companie!l, helping drive these compames out of business. Prac\u00ad tically no Norwegian salmon is now imported by the U.S. Even if Norway succeeds in lowering the cost of aquaculture production through, for example, the application of efficacious fish vaccines and Hnproved feed conversion, the U.S. can offi:et the gains by continu\u00ad ing to raise Import taxes. A similar scenario may evolve m Europe where the EC has placed tariffi: on Norwegian value-added products and imposed minimum-price levels on frt-sh and frozen sahnon. Al\u00ad though minimum-price levels and tariffS were discontinued as of, re\u00ad spectively, January and February of 1992, a precedent has been set foe the implementing of future restrictions (Anonymous, 1992a). In 1993, the situation improved tOr Norwegian salmon produc\u00ad ers due to a reorganization of the industry, a relaxation of strict own\u00ad ership rules by the govcrnmt:nt, and the ~ell off of frozen ulman sur\u00ad plus stocks (Hempel, 1993). Total production of salmon increased to 175,000 tons in 1993 and iS predicted to surpass 200,000 tons in 1994 (StrOm, 1994). Further increases are expected for 1995 and thereafter (Hempel, 1993). To sum up our assessment of marine biotechnology in Norway, Norwegian research IS internationally competitive in selected areas, e.g., fish vaccines, DNA tagging to monitor wild salmon, and devel\u00ad opment of fish speCies new to aquaculture. Norwegian research per\u00ad taining to the utilization of by-products from fish processing is the most advanced of its kind in the world. Overall, the level of Norwe\u00ad gian marine biotechnology research is one of, a.~ yet, unfulfilled but tremendous potential. The Norwegian aquaculture industry, although beset with problems, will continue to be the world's foremost. Eventually, pro\u00ad duction of salmon m Norway could peak at becween 350,000 and 400,000 tons in 2010 (Hempel, 1993). Applications from marine biotedmology research can have important local effects, helping the 238 THE G.OBAL CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY mdustry cement 1t~ already powertul compet1tive pmitmn, but little of this research is likely to bt> appl1cable to aquaculture in other countnes.

The mformation presented herem is denved from the scientif\u00ad IC literature, japanese governmem reports, and mterviews with Japane\u00b7sc and non-Japanese sctentists. For convenience, all monetary measures are set forth in dollars, on the basis of 110 yen t\u00a5)=S 1. The names of japanese organizations are spelled out in English according to a format developed by the Foretgn Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) (Foreign Broadcast Infornution Service, 1993). All references that include the notation \"in Japanese\" were translated by the FBIS. A> is the case with other large, mdustrialized countries, Japan's activities in marine biotechnology comprise a rather small part of the country's total sc1ence and technology program. To analyze how marine biotechnology fit~ into the national picture for Japan and to determine its relative importance, one must be cognizant of the sig\u00ad nificant federal agency and local government support of science and technolog)'; a.-. \u00b7well as the extent of the support in Japan that is pro\u00ad vided to marine biotechnology, industrial inltiarives in the field, rele\u00ad vant government-industrial cooperation m R&D, and other activities that directly 1mpact on marine biotechnology. These factors are con\u00ad sidered m this chapter. Accordingly, the chapter is divided into six sections. In the first section, we provide background mformation on Japan, cons1sting of data on relevant national demographic and geo\u00ad graphic characteristics, including marine resources.

BACKGROUND Geographical ond Demographic Facts Japan 1s au archipelago, cornpu~ed of thousands of island_~ ex\u00ad tending 2,500 kilometers {km) in tht\" Pacific. The fimr main islands of japan arc Hokkaido, Honshu (the largest of the four, whrrc Tokyo is located), Shikoku, and Kyushu. The total land area is 378,000 square km (slightly l~:ss than the ~ize ofCaliforma), representing J.rca. However, extremely irrc-gul.u cm~tline of Japan stretches more than 33.000 km. Further, Japan possesses an Immense 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), encompassing circa 3.86 nullion square km, approxtmatdy twelve times brger thm its land area. For purpmes of comparison, the EEZ ofjapan is approximately half the size of that claimed by the U.S. Japan lies m the tempcrJ.te zone and its climate ts significantly influenced by two occJ.n currents. The warm Japan current (K11ro.1hil,) originatt!'s north of the Philippmcs, flows past Taiwan, thl'll dtvides mto two streams----one stream courses along the eastern sidt of Shikoku and Honshu and the other flows west of Kyushu. The cold, t!:rtile Kurile current (Oyashio) begins in the Bcrmg Se,a J.nd rum along the eastern shores of Hokkaido and Homhu. These two current~ acate tt'Sultlng in an J.bund.mt, lughly varied marine biodiversity, much of which is protected mJapan's 15 marine park.~. A REPORT ON THE U.S., .lAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 243 Althouf!;h the totJ.lland area of Japan 1s relatively large, most of it i~ mountainous (74%) or otherwise not suitable for agnculture or human habitation. Of the nation's population of approximately 124 million, 77%, liw m cities, mostly located in the coasul zone where the population density ts extremely high. By world standards, the av\u00ad erage Japanese citizen ts well off economically, with an average in\u00ad come of$25,43U m 1990 (World Bank, 1992). Japan's research inti-astructure is composed of thn:c types of in\u00ad stitutions. The first consists uruversity laboratories. Of japan's 98 na\u00ad tional, 41 prefectural, and 400 pnvatc universities, in 1992, it was es\u00ad timated that 30 of them are perfornnng high level S\\:ientific research (Arima, 1992). Similarly, circa 30 universities have faculties, depart\u00ad ments, or laboratories that relate to marine biotechnology and/or support basic research m marine biotechnology (Simidu, 1994). Sec\u00ad ond, federal ministries support a total of 83 natJOnallaboratones (Research Development Corporauon of Japan, 1 Y93). Third, applied and development.al research 1s stmngly supported at the local level by prefectural governments, which promote and help fund kosetsushi and third-sector research centers (see below). In 1991, there were 170 kosrtsu.<hi and 121 third-sector centers in prefectures and cities (Anonymous, 1993k; Science and Technology Agem:y, 1993a). Japan'5 Marine Resources Due to the scarcity of arable land, and became past government pohcies have disproportionally favored industry over agnculturc, JapanS agriculture produces only a small proportion of the food re- 4uired by its population. For example, m 1990,Japan imported 27 million tons of cereal, making it the world's !argot importer of this commodity. To make up for shortfalls in agricultural production, the nation 1mports some of the animal and plant foods ir needs and, for the rest, draws on marine resources. Japan, more than any other major industrialized country, seeks to utilize the oceans maximally. Japan 1s the world's largest fishi_~g natiOn, evidenced by its ~hf.rie_s_p[.9g~_ljion of 19.5 millio!J. tons m 1990 (Chopin, 1993), and also the world's la~g~~t cons~;ner ~f_fish Products. For example, m 1989, the per capita consumption was 161.7 pounds pe-r perso~, live weight equivalent. In compari~on, it 244 THE GLOBAL CHALlENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY _w~~ 4_5 pound<> live we1gl1t eqmvalent for the U.S., rnore than thn:c fold less. Animal protein comurned daily by the Japanese i~ predomi\u00ad nantly seafood (45%), compared to 4% in the U.S. In 1992,Japan was the world's top importer of sea products, accounting for 28% of the world's total trade valued at S12.X billion, mostly from the U.S., Ko\u00ad rea, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, and Canada Qosupeit, 1994). At the same time. the nation exported sea products worth about $1.5 bil-\u00b7 lion. In economiC importance, fishery products were the second highest valued of the imported commodities in Japan, after petrole\u00ad um. Japan is the world'~ leader in aquaculture, when the entire range of species (over 30 specieS are being cultured) and culture env-iron\u00ad ments are considered (fuji, 1987). Aquaculture, wluch is one of Japan's oldest industnes, is growing rapidly, ~bowing an increase of circa four times 10 production, from 300,000 tons in 1960 to 1.1_ million tons in 1984 (Nakahara, 1992). In 1989, the aquaculture m\u00ad dustry produced goods valued at $4.4 bilhon, equivalent to 22% of the total Japanese fishenes market. Marine aquaculrure production in 1989 com1sted of 180,000 tons of scallops, 260,000 tons of oysters, and 400,000 tom of non (an edible dried seaweed of the genm Por\u00ad pflyra), as well as smaller quantities of ye-llowtail jack, seabream, salmon, brown algae, and salmonid<; (Kano, 1991). Its fre~hwatt:r aquaculture produces mainly carp, cd, and rainbow trout (Nakahara, 1992). Japan is making a significant effort ro expand 1ts indigmous aquaculture. In particular, Japanese researchers are attempting to add to an already abundant harvt\">t by developing species for aquaculture that no one has yet been able to culture, such as bluefin tuna. devil stringer (a type of scorptonfish), moara grouper, and spiny lobster (Anonymous, 1992a). For example, m early 1994, Deepwater Fish Fanmng Technology, a research institution based in the Iwate Pre\u00ad fecture, reponed success in culturmg sturgeon, whose flesh is similar to illgh-value fish such as blowfish and flounder and whose eggs are used for caviar (Anonymous, 1994f); similarly, the Maruha Group is successfully culturing artificially hatched bluefin tuna in the Nagasa\u00ad ki Prefecture (Anonymous, 1994g). Fully grown bluefin tuna can reach a weight of 300 kilogram, one fish can sell for up to S27 ,000 at A REPORl ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 245 Tokyo\\ TsukiJI wholesale fish market. Became maJor fishery re\u00ad sources in Japan's coastal water~ are being depleted (Chopin, 1993). we ..-xpen that the Japanese aquaculture industry w1JI continue to grow 111 ~ize and diversity for the foreseeable future. However, envi\u00ad ronmental constraints (see belo\\v) dictate~ that most of the future gmwth will be net pens emplaced in open water relatively far from shore or m on-shore, dosed systems. Closely assooated with the aquaculture, yet a distinct economic entity, 1s larvJCulture; i.e., the production offish fry by hatchenes that, in turn, sell them to aquaculture farmers. Presently,Japa!' is the world's largest producer o! fis~ fiy, having sold circa 200 million fry in 1993 for approximately $0.75 each (Sorgcloos et al., 1994). In comparison, the second largest producer, the Mediterranean coun\u00ad tries collcctivdy, produced 100 million fiy that year. Most of the fry produced by Japan in this com\u00ad mercial field largely has come about as a result of research applied to improving nutritton and controlling the microbial flora of fish hatcheries, espectally bacterial species pathogenic to fish (Sorgeloos et al., 1994). An example of a new mitiative m fry production is the ancmpt by the Japanese Fi~hery Agency to artificially spawn eel fry. This proJect, which commenced in 1987 and is expected to be completed in 1996, 1s extremely Jifficu!t because the eels caught in Japanese rivers usually spawn m the ocean ea~t of the Philippmes. Promi~ing results have been achieved by inJecting mother eels with special hormone<> (Anonymous, 1994b). Initiatives in aquaculture land to be used for aquaculture and fisher\u00ad men's cooperative assoCiations allocate sub-areas to individual aqua\u00ad culturists at no charge. Further, on..-of the most powerful support org-J.ruz.ations for aquaculture and larviculture 1s the Japanese Prefec\u00ad tural Imtitutes ofFisherics. Detracting from what should be a rosy future for aquaculture, the japanese face severe environmental rf?Qlems1_S_9n!c_.5'f ~!J-ich is a consequence of intensive aquaculture practices. In fact, until only a 246 THE GLOBAL CHAllENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY few years ago, dome~tic and mdmtrial wastes from Japanese cities were released untreated into the sea, creating a succession ol envi\u00ad ronmental mghtmares, the most extreme example of which was Mi\u00ad namata syndrome, a serious physiolop;Kal condition assoctated with lesions m the central nervous system caused by orgamc mercury concentrating m fish from mercury-pollutt:d waters. In 1993,Japan's Environment Agency (EA) estunated that there were urea 20,000 factories and waste dispmal plants, each of which dumped more than 50 tons annually of elfluents mto Japanese bays and seas (Anony\u00ad on-shore sources semi-enclosed bays, the multiplication of phytoplankton that constitute toxic \"red tides.\" The Japanese coastal zone also has been adversely impacted by landfills, which began on a large scale in 1956, with many of these artsing from construction of Japan's more than 4,000 harbon. Since the number of protected coastal areas accepublc for aquacul\u00ad ture is limited, and because some areas have become over-saturated with net pens, effluence from aquaculture facilitie~ is adding to the total load of pollutants ongmating from on-shore sources. Tb_t;_ con\u00ad s~quence of unbridled pollution is enormous damage as the ~water ln extensive areas along Japan's coastal zone is polluted and the shores spoiled (Nakahara, 1992). Natural coast line and rich fishing grounds have been destroyed. In 1985 it W.tS estimated that the natural coast line was reduced to 46'% of the total (Shapiro, 1991); coastal zone debasement contmued largely unchecked until the Environment Agency acted to protect m-land sea~ in 1993 (see below). 511UJCIURE OF SCIENCE AND ltCHNOlOGY IN JAPAN In this overview, the federal agencies and ministries involwd Ill science and technology, m general, as well as in marine biotechnolo\u00ad gy, are identified and the major, relevant activities of each agency or mmistry are bnefly explained.

Council of S<ience and Technology The Council heads the government science h1crarchy. It 15 composed of ten members, including the Prime Mimster, cabmet nnnisters. the chairman of the Science Council of Japan, and selected corporate executives. Its maJor functions arc to provide advice on scientific matters to the Prime Minister's Oflice and the mimstnes and to formulate government policies m science and technology. The general policies are converted to specific programs at the minis\u00ad terial level. The Council works very closely wuh STA. The STA coordinates basic research supported by the ministries and derived from policies formulated by the Science and Technolo\u00ad gy Council. It is the leading sponsor of non-university scientific R&D in Japan. STA's budget for supporting R&D was $5.29 billion in 1993 (Planrung and Coordination Bureau, 19lJ3a), mcluding $241 million for general biotechnology (Anonymous, 19931 ). A signifi\u00ad cant proportion of the support it prov:idt-s to scientific activitie-s are funneled through one of four major programs. Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology. This is a grant-in-aid program which supports bas~e research and sponsors international sCJemific meetings. In 1 ~3, the budget was about S1.1 billion. Explorawry Research For Advanced Technology Program (ERATO). In 1981, STA set up ERATO, the aim of which is to foster cooperative research projects bt:tween industry and uniVersities to develop new industrial technolog:te'i. ERATO, whKh is admim~tered by the Research and Developmem Corporation of Japan ORDC), sponsors large projects m the A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY o 249 tune frame of no longer than five years and earned out by groups of 15-20 young researchers. Each proJect\\ total bud\u00ad get must fall within the range of$10-15 million. In 1992, ERATO was sponsormg 37 projects and its budget was about $85 million (Normile, 1994). As far as we have been able to dctemune, of the 37 active ERATO project\\ only one is ful\u00ad ly a marme biotechnology project. A group, headed by N.

In early 1994, it was announced that, for the fint time, two foreign re\u00ad search groups, both from the U.S., \\Vere to be granted ERA\u00ad TO funding (Normile, 1994). Frontier Research Program. This program, which is adnrinis\u00ad tered by the Institute of Phystcal and Chemical Research (R.IKEN), supports research that develops new scientific knowledge that may be used for industrial technologies in the 21st century. Under this program, foreign researchers are mvited to set up cooperative projects with Japanese workers. It was budgeted at $20.76 nullion m 1992 (Sctence and Technology Agency, 1993b). For Embryonic Science and Technolo\u00ad gy (PRESTO). PRESTO, which commenced m 1991, aims to encourage especially creative individual researchers in Japan, proviiling them with up to $500,000 for thocc years to engage in research of thetr choice. PRESTO is admimstered by JRDC (Science and Technology Agency, 1993b). The JRDC's major objective ts to search for promising research being done in universities and public irutitutes, contracting industry to develop applications from this research. In particular,JRJ)C funds high ri~k development projects, i.e., proJects that would not other\u00ad Wise be pursued by mdustry. Even though JRDC does not have lab-250 THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY oratories of its own, it has a significant impact on how Jap:tnese sn\u00ad ence is utilizcd.JRDC's budget m 1992 was $155.5 million (Science and Technology Agency, 1993b). STA has an important dual role in developing the ocean SCI\u00ad ences (Sc1ence and Technolo~'Y Agency, 1993b). It coordinates all federal gowrnment programs related to ocean development, mclud\u00ad ing such diverse activitir>s ao; fishery and aquaculture exploitation, port facilities construction, and coastal maintenance. It also promotes ocean science and technology proJeCts, which usually are executed by the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center UAMSTEC). Three types of projects are supported. The first 1s deep sea explo\u00ad ration, including the discovery and investigation of extn:mophiles. This programmatic area LS considered in detail below. The second involves projects focussed on understanding the processes of the oceans, especially those associated with the global enVIronment. This programmatic area has a large international component. The third program seeks to utilize the oceans etfectively through new applica\u00ad tions of research, for example, development of wave energy technol\u00ad ogy, creation of calm sea areas for aquaculture, and improvement of the confined marine environment inside-bays and inlets. Many of the projects carried out in this third programmatic area have significant local involvement. In 1992, STA 's marine science and technology budget was $114.5 million. In comparison, the total marine science and technol\u00ad ogy budget of the Japanese government, mcluding MIT!, MAFF, STA, and six other agencies, was $457.4 million in 1992 (Anony\u00ad mous. 1992d). STA directly supports three national research institutes, includ\u00ad ing RIKEN, one of Japan's leading physics and chemistry research mstitutions. RIKEN also conducts biotechnology-related research and, through MITI's Frontier Research Program (see below), fosters international cooperation in this field. STA's mvolvement in manne biotechnology, however, largely IS through the operation of JAM\u00ad STEC. JAMSTEC, which was established in 1971 m Yokosuka City, is Japan's leading R&D org.llllzation m marine science and technology. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 251 In 1992, 1b budget was S 110 million (ScJencc and Technology Agency, llJY3b). Perhaps jAMSTECs mmt important as~et is its collection of deep-sea exploration submersibles. Impetus for constructing a deep sea exploration fleet may have come afi:er japanese enhrineers vi~ited Woods Hole m 1973 to inspect the U.S. Navy's submer~1ble, .1/vir~.

In 19H7, Alvin and its support ship stopped by in Tokyo, where they were vtsitcd by Crown Prince Akihito, who now JSjJ.pan's emperor.

JAMSTEC's the with its 1,553 ton support ~hip, A1atsushima, was commissioned in 1982. It can operatt: to a depth of 2,000 meters. By 1989, the Shinkai 2000 had nude 630 dives, collecting organisms that live near hydrothermal vents on the sea bottom, including horse mussels and tube worm~. In 1987, the unmanned submersible system, Dolphin 3K, capable of operating at a depth of 3,300 meters, was commis\u00ad sioned. It pmvides backup support for the $hinkai 2000. In 1990, the Shiukai 6500 and its support ship, the 4,500 ton Yokosuka, became operational. This submarine, the world's deepest-diving research sub\u00ad mersible, enables its operators to study and collect marine organisms to a maximum depth of 6,500 meters, potentially permitting scien\u00ad tist~ access to 98% of the world's ocean floor and 96% of the ocean floor within japan's 200-mile limit (Karube, 19R9; Arat, 1989; Anonymous, to this submenible fleet, Kaiko (\"trench\"), v.ras completed in early 1993, and finished perfor\u00ad mance w;ts in 1993.

DEEPSTAR recently reported 22 new strains of oil-degrading micruorgamsms r<.\u00b7covered from the sea floor or ocean water proxi\u00ad mal to Japan's coa.~t. Despite heavy shipping traffic, little oil pollution has been recorded on or near the coasts of Japan. To explam this finding, Japanese scientists hypothesized that the oilts degraded by microorg:amsms. Support for this hypothesis came in the late 1991 when a DEEPSTAR group reported isolating a bat:tenum from samples collected at a depth of 1,600 meters in Suruga Bay. The bac\u00ad terium produces a surfactant that enhances oil degradation. Aside hom obvious applications in oil spills, this micruorganlsm nught also find use in tertiary oil recovery from terK\"\"Strial wells. While interest\u00ad ing, these findint,>s arc not new, since many others have reported sim\u00ad Ilar findings preVlously (Leahy and Colwell. 1990).

Ml'rl strives to provide optimum conditions for development of the private sector and shapes industri\u00ad al technology polines to promote and encourage those fields that are difficult for the private sector to implement on 1ts own. These in\u00ad clude high-nsk areas of essential field~ and fields that fidfill community need~. such as medical treatment, public welfare, and the environment. Because of their risky character (in term~ of return on invesoncnt), and because theJT applications, if any, are likely to be distant in rime, mdustry typically ha~ been un\u00ad willing to fund research to develop these uncertain technologies. In 1993, MITI's budget for supporting R&D was $2.56 billion (Ge:ner-254 THE GlOBAl (HALLfNGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY al Coordination DivJSlOll. 199.3) MITT's funding for general biotechnology is not known for I Sl93, hut m 1 'J92 it was S79 million (Anonymous. 1992c).

In 1')')3, AIST spent $251 mil\u00ad lion to support 16 national laboratories that employt-'d 3.567 re\u00ad ~earchers (Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 1993a). AIST also provides technologlCalleadenhip to the second MIT! agency, the New Energy Development OrgaoizJ.tion (NEDO), whose primary functions are to fund the research and development of industrial technology, equip base facilities for th1s research, and promote international coUaborativc research (Anjo, 1989). MIT! also oversees Japan's Patent Office. Ont> of the mechamsms that MIT! employs to advance fields it deem.~ important 1~ to mstitute large-sca1e, long-term national pro\u00ad grams addressing R&D required to develop those fidds. Typically. national programs run for five co ten years and are constituted by many interlocking smaller projects, each focnssed on some facet of the field of interest. Until 1993, MIT I supported six such national programs. Broadly speaking, three were focussed on mdustnal tech\u00ad nologies and three on energy and environmental technologies. Referring to the first ~roup of the three, the oldest national program was the \"Large-Scale Project,\" which commenced in 1966 and was budgeted at S3 billion. Its aim was to support research to develop technologies that appeared futuristic at the time of their in\u00ad troduction. but believed to hold furure promise for Japanese industry. Eventually, the Project supported 30 projects, whose topics included manganese nodule mining systems, underground space develop\u00ad ment, supenonic transport propulsion, and human sensory measure\u00ad ment apphcation technology. The second national program, \"The MedicJ.l and Welfare Equipment Technology ProJect,\" started in 1976 and was budgeted at .$118 million. it sought to develop a serit'S of technologies to assist handicapped and older persons. The third national program, begun in 1981, was named \"The Next Gen-eration A REPORT ON lHE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 255 Project.\" Its budget wa~ $600 million, and it focu~scd e.g., photo-active materials, superconduc\u00ad tive materials, and btoactive devices. The oldest national program in the second group was \"The Sunshine Project,\" which began in 197 4 and concentrated on devel\u00ad oping new, environmentally benign eneq.,>y ~y~tems based on coal, solar power, and geothermal energy. The related \"Moonlight Pro~ ject,\" started m 1978, stressed development~ related to more efficient methods for transferring and storing power. MITI allocated $5.4 bil\u00ad lion to fund these t\\vo national programs. The third program, \"Glob\u00ad al Envtronmentallndustrial Technology Program,\" which began m 1990, had as its dual aim the development of technologies that would help Japan meet its mternational obligations with respect to decreasing emissions of greenhouse gases and C02 from Japanese in\u00ad dustry and tcchnologie<; of use to developmg countries. Its funding was $180 million. In 1993, MIT I appears to have redirected its mission, possibly in order fOr it to be more responsive to the heightened interest of JapaiK-se citizt>ns in matteN related to the quality of their lives and concerns about environmental degradation. As part of MITI's re\u00ad alignment, the sJx national programs were consolidated into two new programs. The first three programs, related to industrial tech\u00ad nologies, were transformed into \"The Industrial Science and Tech\u00ad nology Frontier Program\" (Frontier Program). The Frontier Pro\u00ad gram, in general, focusses on basic research and industrial technolo\u00ad gies auned at improvmg human welfare and quality of mous, 19\":J4h). In 1993, the Program's budget V.'aS $22R million. Similarly, the three national programs in the second groupmg \\Vere unified in \"The New Sunshine Program\" (Anonymous, 1994h). Specifically, \"The New Sumhine Program\" promotes and funds research that leads to the development of technologies re\u00ad qmred to meet the government's goals for decn:asing Japanese sources; mcreases collaborative international research pro\u00ad jects that aim to reduce emissiOns of greenhouse gases; and leads to the development of environmentally benign, but efi:ective, technolo\u00ad git>s that may be transferred to Asian developing countries. Much of the research to be undertaken under this program will be c.:.mied out 256 THE GLOSAl CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY at the Research Institute of Innovative Technology (RITE), which is a private institute established with funding provided by MIT! and private sources. MIT I ha~ allocated $7. 1 billion through :woo to fund \"The New Sunshine Program.\" MIT! recognized the importance ofbiotechnolob'Y to Japan's future in the late 1970s and, since then, plays a major role m e~tab\u00ad lishing biotechnology as a key technolobry for future industries. In 1981, it declared biotechnology an area of special interest, giving it the recognition it previously lacked, and, thereby, facilitating financ\u00ad ing of research and development in th1s field. Several large-scale biotechnology projects form part of the \"Frontier Program,\" includ\u00ad Efficient Uttlizauon Technology'' Friendly Technology for the Produc\u00ad tion of Hydrogen\" (1991-199S) (Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, 1993b). AIST also is the major funder of five national institutes when: significant biotechnology ~earch is performed and a si.xth that is in the process of being established. They are: National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology. This insntute was founded in 1993 in Tsukuba Sctence City when the Fermentation Research Institute was combined with elements from the National Chenucal Laboratory for Industry, Industrial Products Research Instllute, and Research Institute fOr Polymers and Textiles. It is dedicated to perform\u00ad ing ungmal baste research in the fields of biotechnology, bio\u00ad medical engineering, and human englneenng (medicine and wdfare.lit\"t>stylc assets, etc.). Its first Director-General is Dr. A REPORT ()1\\1 THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 257 (hamu Suzuki, who was the former ch1ef of the Fermenta\u00ad tion Research Institute.

In 1993, the institute employed 221 pen;om and its total budget was 513.8 million (Agency oflndustrial Science and lechnology, 1 Y93a). The institute is taking part in three biotechnology-relat\u00ad ed national programs -\"Fine Chemicals From Marine Or\u00ad ganisms\" (see below), \"Molecular Assemblies for Functional Protein Systems,\" and \"Production and Utilization of Com\u00ad plex Carbohydrates.\" biotechnology-related institute snentists also are mvestigating algal species for the1r potential m CO, fixation, microecosystems with respect to solidification and-dean-up of oil spills at ~ea by rrucroorgan\u00ad isms, bioabsorbent and biodegr.1dable chemicals produced by marine microorganisms, and oxidation biocatalysts in mi\u00ad croaqw:ous systems (Agency of Industrial Snence and Tech\u00ad nology, 1993a). Joint research with both public and pnvate institutions, as well as with mdustry, 1s given much attention by the insti\u00ad tute. Thus, the oil spill project is being done in cooperation v.ith the Governmental Industrial Research Center. Shikoku (see below), research on breakdov-rn of sulphur compounds by marine bactena with Marine Biotechnology Institute (MBI) (see below), R&D on basic marine life technologies with MDI, and R&D on biodegradable plastics with the non\u00ad profit corporation Research Institute ofinnovative Technolo\u00ad gies fur the Earth (Agency of Industrial Science and Technol\u00ad ogy, 1993a). Cooperation with industry includes JOint projects with Asahi Chemical Industry Company and Eisai Company, a leading pharmaceutical company; a marine biotechnology\u00ad related proJect IS being done m cooperation with the Taiyo Fi~hery Company, Ltd., and involves research on new lectin in American crab species that specifically bind sialic acid. 258 THE GlOBAL CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY In Aut-,TU.st 1993, STA designated the institute as one of Japan's first three Centers of Excellence. The objective of STA's Centers ofExcellence program is to provide the desig\u00ad nated mstitutes with extraordinary support to enable them to rise to the highest level in the world in then respective fidd~. Thus, the Institute will receive an additional $3.04 nnllion annually for five years, whl(h will be used to develop its Biosignalling Department. The Department will use the new funding to form a 27 -per~on research team to mvestigate sig\u00ad nals that trigger cell ahring and other phenomena within cells (Anonymous, 1993z). Government Industrial Development Laboratory, Hokkaido. The laboratory conducts rt\u00b7search in three areas-resources and energy, applied chemistry, and new materials. Its biotech\u00ad nology-related research aims to develop new catalysis tech\u00ad nology using enzymes, mduding enzymes from marine ex\u00ad tTemophiles, the functional analysis having com\u00ad and deep-sea C02 fixmg. In 1993, the Hokkaido laboratory employed 98 staff and its total budget was $4.9 million (Agency of Industrial Science and Technol\u00ad ogy, 1993a).

In 1993, the Institute employed 207 persons and its budget was $11 million (Agency oflndmtrial Science and Technology. 1993a). GIRl at Shikoku. The institute was cstabli-.hed m 1967, among other objectives, to develop the marme resources of the Shikoku n:gwn. Thus, among the six GIRls (Research Development Corporation of Japan, 1993), GIRl at Shikoku is most heavily involved in marine biotechnology. Its marine biotechnology research program ha.~ three directions. First, it aims to develop manufacturing processes to produce bioac\u00ad rive substance-; recovered from aqueous microOfb'<lnisms. Sec\u00ad ond, it develops production technologies for fibre and biodegradable plastic utilizing polysaccharides from marine organisms, particularly locally available macroalgal species. Third, its researchers cooperate with colleagues at the Na:\u00ad rional Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology in the speCial research project to analyze microecosystems with re\u00ad spect to solidification and clean-up of oil ~pills at sea by mi\u00ad croorganisms.

The aim of the sec\u00ad ond program is to develop supporting technologies, such as a marine natural env1mnment reproduction facility, a mass cultunng facility, and a database containlng information about marine orgam<;ms. The stx AIST research institutes that participate in the basic research phase are the National Institute of Bioscumce and Human Technol\u00ad ogy, Nationallnstitutt' of Materials and Chenucal Research, GIRl at Osaka, GIRl at Shikoku, and GIRl Chugoku.

MHW supports basic and applied research on health-related top1cs, \\\\lith a R..&D budget for 1993 of approxmtately million (Mimster's Secretariat, 1993). In 1992, MHW disbursed $343 million to support biotechnology (Anonymous, 1992c). Re~earch programs supported by the MHW mcluded the Anti\u00ad AIDS Research Promotion Funds, the Research Fund on Circulato\u00ad ry Diseases, the Psychoneurosis Research Fund, Cancer Research Subsidies, the 1 0-year Comprehensive Anti-cancer Strategic Re\u00ad scan:h ProJect.

Potentially any of these programs could sup\u00ad port investigations that may lead to the discovery of new marine natural products having anti-(;ancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral properties. However, m 1992, the MHW had no programs or fund\u00ad tng directed coward marine biotechnology.

In 1992, EA designated $1.2 million for biotedmology (Anonymous, 1992c). The involvement of EA in general and marine biotechnology has been mmor, but 1s likdy to increase in the future. In particular, EA's National Institute for Environmental Stud.les opened the Envi\u00ad ronmental Genetic Engineering Laboratory in November, 1993, the major aim of which is to produce microorganisms and plants that can be applied to preservmg the environment (Anonymous, 1993m). In reference to marine biotechnology, a jomt R&D project between the Fishery Agency and EA is the \"Project to Develop Techniques for the Prediction of Red Tide Occurrence,\" which aims to search for substances that mhibit the growth and reproduction of red tide organisms. In 1993, EA, in cooperation v.rith MITI, mitiated a five\u00ad year marine bioremediation program to develop improved bioreme\u00ad diation techniques suitable for Japanese conditions (Anonymous, 1993o). fu part of that progr.un,EA's National Research Institute for Pollution Preventio11 will develop technologies to unmobilize oil re\u00ad mediating nucroorganisms on mats, the Life Engineering Industrial Research Laboratory will mvestigate various microorganisms for their oil-degrading capabilities and develop those that are most dE\u00ad cient, and GIRl at Shikoku will research biological dispersants and nutnents required by oil-degrading microorgamsms (Anonymous, 1 993g). The program's budget in 1993 was $296,000. EA is charged to address envuorunental safety. In 1993, it draft\u00ad ed guidelines to protect inland sea_s and bays from land-source pollu\u00ad tants. Until then, Japan had no regulation controlling the volume of nitrogen and phosphorous being dumped m the ocean by factories and waste disposal plants. As a result, high concentrations of these chemicals had stimulated red tide blooms and led to large-scale fish kills (Anonymous, 19931). The new guidelines, which took effect October 1, 1993, controls the discharge of effiuences into Tokyo Bay, Scto Inland Sea, and 86 other inland seas and bays. 266 THE GLO&Al CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY EA i~ Japan's regulatory situation m regard~ to biotechnology is unclear, as is discu~sed on pagt '271. Min;stry al Conslrudion (MOC) In 1993, the MOC did nut support biOtechnology R&D di\u00ad rectly. Howtver, m 19H9, the numstry allocated $900,000 to develop a new wastewater treatment system utihzing marine organisms to purify wastewater. The advantage~ of the system, which was func\u00ad tional by 1991, include> a higher degree of effiCiency, compart\"d to existing systems and causes less enVironmental 1mpact (Anonymous, 1989c;Anonymous, 19H9d). lnler-minisfry Programs Of relevance to this report are two large ~calc intennimstenal programs, Key Technology Centers (KTC) and Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP). Key Technology Centers. Thts program, cmpomon:d by MfTI and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunicatiom, promotes establishment of research centers undertaking re\u00ad search in areas such as btotechnology, electronic~. information processing, telecommunications, and new materials. The funding for KTC m 1993 was circa 5236 million. Human Frontier Science Program. The HFSP is an mterna\u00ad rional program, the administration of which is headquartered in Strasbourg, France. The Program aim~ to promote Interna\u00ad tional cooperation in basic research focussed on supenor functions of organisms (Anonymous, 199la). Thus, the Pro\u00ad gram fund'i ba.'iic research earned out by international teams, fellowships tOr scientists wishing to conduct research in tOr\u00ad ei)-,'11 countnes, and meeting; where infornution from HFSP research is discussed and disseminated. In 1992, STA and MITI, together, furnished approxinutely S37.8 million to the A REPORT Q\\1 THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 267 Program (Sc1ence Jlld Technology Agency, 1993b; Anony\u00ad nHms, 19Y4h). In government support for gen~ral and manne biotcchnolq,')' IS e'itimated as follows. The total amount the government spent in 1992 to support science and technology was $21.26 billion, including: approximately $917 million for biotechnol\u00ad ogy (4%). It was more difficult to estimate how much of this funding was used to <iupport marine biotechnology. To determine this sum, we used tht: following four-step approach. First. we calculated fund\u00ad ing for proJects or programs that were undoubtedly marine biotech\u00ad nology, fOr new technologies for marme industry. The amount of this funding was $36.47 million. Second, as described above, there were many programs and pro\u00ad jects that have rnanne biotechnology components, but clearcut, de\u00ad scriptive information is not available with respect to funding alloca\u00ad tion. Example-s are MITI's CO=' fixation and functions, EA's red tide, and MAFF's \"Biomed.ia\" and new fishery technologies projects. With respect to funding for these program~ and projects, we made an assumption about the probable range of funding. Thus, we assumed that, on the low ~ide, 20% of a program or project funding was spent on marine biotech\u00ad nolog, research and, on the high side, 800/o. Accordingly, total fund\u00ad ing for these program~ and projects was estimated to range betv.'een $H.64 million and $34.6 million in 1992. Third, although the MESC funding for general biotechnology is kno\"'TI (.$149 million in 1992), there is no information on distrib\u00ad ution of these funds. However, as is dearly demonstrated in the sec\u00ad tion beginning on page 287, most marine biotechnology basic re\u00ad search has been, and is being, done by universities, with funding largely from MESC. Therefore, the conservative assumption is that 1 O'Yo of MESC biotechnology funding supports marine biotechnol\u00ad ogy research, I.e., $14.9 million. Rema1rung conservative, we a.,-.;ume that other ministnes, e.g., MHW and MOC, did not fund marine 268.

Thus, the grand total of Japanese federal support fOr manne\u00ad biotcchnology research is determined to have been between $59.51 million and $86.47 million m 1992 (see Figure 21). a reasonable range of estimated funding, considering all of the cave an stated above.

A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAIJA, AND NORWAY 271 Regulariom Until t 979,Japan had no regulations speafically addre5Sing Qiot~dmology research, tidd testing, or application. In view of this regulatory vacuum, scientists followed the NIH guidelines of the US, while companies were mai11ly \"self-regulated.\" However, in 1 CJ79, MESC 1ssued a set of guidelines pertaimng to rDNA research in umvermies and, shortly thereafter, STA issued another set of guidehnes for mdustry and national research mstitunom (Tomizuka, \"Recombinant DNA Engmeering ( ;uiddim:s,'' which were denved from those adopted m July 1986 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), of which Japan is a member (Bmtechnology Division, 19lJO). Since that time, MHW and .MAFF Thus, in April1989, MAFF publi~hed \"Guidelines To\u00ad ward the Utilization of Recombinant Products m the Fields of Agri\u00ad culture, Forestry, and Fishery,\" which permitted non-closed system testing (Anonymous, 1989e; Anonymous, 1989[; Ministry of Agri\u00ad culture, l99lb). In general, the MAFF guidelines are based on esti\u00ad mating a level of risk for each organism and performing a case-by\u00ad case rcv1cw of envirorunental and agricultural applications of that or\u00ad ganism. They outline a control standard based on extending experi\u00ad ence with that organism through a step-wlse progresston of experi\u00ad mcnh, from the laboratory, to the greenhouse, to the small-scale field-test, and then to the large-scale field test (United States Con\u00ad gress, 1991). In regard to field resting, in December 1990, EA submltted to the Japanese Diet an encompassing proposal to regulate field applica\u00ad tions of new varieties of living organisms (Anonymous, 1990c). If approved, this proposal will give the EA authority beyond that of other nmmtries over all of field testing. It is our understanding that the EA mitiative has triggered a jurisdictional battle between EA and MAFF that may delay legislative action on regulation of field testing. In addition, EA's action has raised concern among researchers and mdumy involved in biotechnology. Citing their safety record, oppo-272. THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BioTECHNOLOGY nents of EA 's proposal argue that the proposed regulanon will make it difficult for mdustry and academia to respond to technological progre~. that the worldwide trend is towards a relaxation of regula\u00ad tion, so adopting new restrictive regulations will go agawst the worldwide trend. They also argue that the proposal will send a one\u00ad Sided message to the citizenry that biotechnology 1s a dangerous technology. During the pa~t ten years of self-reb'1.Iiatlon by industry, no hazards have been generated and EA is con~idered a newcomer, with virtually no administratiw experience m btu-related areas. EA counters that if problems arise, ambiguity exists on the assignment of responsibility (Anonymous, 1989a; Anonymous, 1990a; Anonymous, 1990c). Japan lags behind Europe and the U.S. in large-~calc fidd test\u00ad ing. In fact, it was not until January, 1991 th.1t MAFF approved the first environmental testing of a genetically engineered orgamsm, a transgenic tomato. In early 1993, developers of four other types of transgenic plants received permission to test their products Ill secure nurseries (Anonymous, 1993-). By June 1993, a total of five tram\u00ad genic plant<; were undergoing field testing and an addttion five were being prepared for imnunent field tests. In comparison, more than 1,000 field tests have been completed or are underway in the U.S., and in excess of 400 in the rest of the world. The Japanese govern\u00ad ment's hesitancy in developing :. unified set of national biosafety guidelines probably stems fiom a combination of factors, including protests that have been vmced by the public in reference to several biotechnology pmjects in the past (ToJ111Zuka, 1 993), which may in\u00ad dicate a negative attitude by the Japanese public towards environ\u00ad mental release of genetically engineered organisms, and the propen\u00ad sity of Japanese re~earchen to focus tht:ir attention on research po\u00ad tentially useful for the pharmaceutical and food industries, rather than for agriculture, where most field testing presently is being don\\\". The debate over field testing continues in the Diet and fi1ture decis1om about regulations that seek to ensure biosafety will affect the future, not only uf marine biotechnology, but of all biotechnolo\u00ad gy 111 Japan. We believe that the many uncertainties assooated with Japanese regulation of biotechnology activities, for the present, repre-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 273 ~ems an unfavorable legal enviromuent fOr industry because it hm\u00ad ders long-term strategic planning pertaining to product te~ting. However, it is unclear how japan's regulatory structure- eventually will ~hape up. Without doubt, national regulations can have a signifi\u00ad cant effect on how raptdly or slowly biotechnology progresses (United States Congress, 1984). If the Japanese Diet adopts onerous or harsh regulations, experimentation and field testing will be hin\u00ad dered. Conver~dy, tf tt passes weak or unclear regulations, industry may be precluded from undertaking long-term, Strategtc planning. In 1992, MHW i~~ued \"Guidelines for Foods and Food Addi\u00ad tives Produced by Recombinant DNA Techniques.\" According to a knowledgeable observer, the ministry \"has unposed a strict regulato\u00ad ry regime specific to food~ and food additives manufactured with re\u00ad combinant DNA tcchruques\" (Miller, 1993). Local Government Activity in Biotechnology japan comprises 47 prefectures, which arc roughly equivalent to states m the U.S., although politically less independent. Most prefec\u00ad tural governments have initiated wide-ranging, well-supported pro\u00ad grams to promote scientific endeavoN within their jurisdictions. The totality of thetr efforts is meaningful; in 1992 prefectural and city governments provided $5.20 billion to fund snence and technology, which is 26.7% of the national science and technology budget (Na\u00ad tional Institute of Science and Technology Policy, 1993). The reamn why prefectures are spending so much money in this way is ex\u00ad plained m a STA-sponsored study (National Institute of Science and Technology Policy, 1993): As well a> contributing to the fonnanon of a multipolar and tiec.:ntrahzed sunety hy acting lS a driving force ulation of n::g~onalKtivities, regmnal S&T should re~pond precisely to various regional requiremems and improve the hves of people living in such regions.

They are often supported by federal agencies through their local of\u00ad fices. In 1992, kosetsushi centers employed approximately 15,000 scientific workers, which is more th.m 1.5 times the number employed by national rcsl\u00b7arch institutions (Anony\u00ad mous, 1993k). effort~ in gen\u00ad eral and manne biotechnology.

These are R&D lnst:itutiom ~et up on the prefectural level, wlth funding from three sources: federal government; prefectural government; and :industry. Their main fimction 1s to perform research that may be applied by the industries that have invested in them (Science and Tech\u00ad nology Agency, 19Y3a). MAFF, M!Tl, MESC, and STA all strongly support science at the pretCcturallevel. Their regional funding programs have assisted various marine biotechnology-related projects, such as one being undertaken by kosetsushi and third-sector centers in Aichi, Fukushi\u00ad ma, and Saga Prefectures to develop new varieties of seaweed suit\u00ad able for the specific region by development of protoplast seedlings. Another project, the development of technology for production of large fishes, is bemg undertaken by research unit~ in the Prefectures of aguchi (Ministry of Agriculture, 1991a). The major approach is to apply sterilizing technology and technology to extend the reproduc\u00ad tive lift: and the production of high value fishes through establish\u00ad ment of sex control technology. In a different area of marine biotechnology, a joint project i~ undel\"\\V<ly between cooperatives and research units in the Prefectures of lwate and Shizuoka, largely fund\u00ad ed by NEDO, to dtscover and develop useful natural products from =ine ammals. In accordance with the provtsions of a law adopted by the Diet ln 1988, a special type of third-sector centers, called \"Ba.~ic Facility for R&l ),\"are to be established in Japan wlth funding from NEDO, local govenm1ent and private firms. A \"Basic Facility\" is defined as \"a large R&D facility for advanced industrial technology to be used by many researchers\" (Anonymous, 1989g). The first was the Center for 276 THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Industrial Use of Marine Organisms, which 1s part of MBI and is discussed below (the other BaSIC Facilities wil! include the Under\u00ad ground Microgravity Em~ronment Expenment Center in Hokkaido and the Ion Engineering Center m Kmki). lnlemalional Cooperative Projects The government of Japan supports several well-funded pro\u00ad grams aimed at the development of mternational collaboration and technology transfer m biotechnology. Two of these have been de\u00ad scribed above------STA's ERATO and MITJ's and STA's HFSP. MITI funds the program \"Promotion of Comprehensive International Research Cooperation\" at the level of $16.36 millwn in 1992 (Anonymous, 1994h). Further, several programs have been set up to promote international exchanges of researchers. These mdude the \"Fellowship Program'' funded by STA, the \"Special Foreign Re\u00ad searcher Program\" funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and the \"Research Exchange Program\" initiated in 198H by MITI'~ AIST. In 1989, these programs funded travel and living ex\u00ad penses of300 foreign researchers in Japan, who represented approxi\u00ad matdy 30 countries (International Cooperation Divt~ion, 1990). With respect to international ties, in 1987, a five-year joint pro\u00ad Ject, named \"STARMER,\" between France and Japan commenced. The objective of the proJect was to study the South Pacific Ocean plate, including hydrothermal vents located in the North Fiji Ocean Basin at a depth of 1.980 meters. Project investigator.; have collected a variety of interesting extremophiles, including sea horse mussels, blind crabs, previously unknown deep sea shrimp, and several types of mtcroorganisms that use hydrogen sulfite and methane as energy sources (Anonymous, 1989g), which are now being investigated in French and Japanese laboratorit.-s.ln 1993, the Japanese Biotechnolo\u00ad gy A<;.socJation OHA) entered mto a collaboration in marine biotech\u00ad nology with the French Association for the Development of 1:3min\u00ad dustry and the French Ministry of Foreign Atfalrs. The French coor\u00ad dinator is Y LeGal (Pardo, 1993). Wide-rangmg cooperation between Russ1a and Japan was dis\u00ad during the second R mso-Japan Snence and Tcchnolo~ Co-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND f\\bRwAY 277 operation Committee meeting held m May 1 Y94. Hy the condusJOn of the meeting, the two governments had agreed to set up coopera\u00ad tive arrangements among then research organizations m 34 research themes. One of these are in marine biotechnology, namely a project that anm to genetically eng~neer microalgae for the production of useful materials (Anonymous 1994k). Preceding the general agreement between the two countries, in 1993, MITI's AIST dispatched a team to Vladivostok, Ru~-.ia, to dis\u00ad cus~ cooperative R&D with che Pacific Ocean Biology and Orgaruc Chemistry Research Institute in that city (Anonymous, 1993t). The Japanese seek to access the Institute's vast collection of marine mi\u00ad croorganisms originating from seas under Rtmian jurisdiction. S:nn\u00ad ples will be analyzed by GIRl at Osaka, to determine if any produce biochermcals having a potential for industrial application (Anony\u00ad mous, 1993{). A cooperative arrangement of this type appears to be worthwhile for both sides. The Russian institute is m dire financial ~traits so if it will be able to procure funding from the Japanese, its surVP:al would be ensured. The Japanese will have access to many orgamsms that they otherwise might not have been able to screen, thus encouraging their quest for natural products having pharma\u00ad ceutical and industrial properties. It is worth noting that Vladivostok and a large marine area surrounding it was dosed to all foreigners until the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. This immense area, which probably contains a treasure chest of mannc biological diversity, is mostly virgin territory in terms of natural product prospecting. Also in 1993, MITI came to an agreement with the govern\u00ad ment of Israel to enter into cooperative research in biotechnology (Anonymous, l993y). It is following m the tracks of Japanese indus\u00ad try and eight companies already have constructed plants in Israel. One of the ;ums of cmJperative research to be undertaken between GIRl at Osaka and the Hebrew University is to develop high-per\u00ad forming microalgae (Anonymous, 1993s). Experimen~. done on microalgal species prov1ded by the Israelis (see below). Another area containing marine biological re_,;ources of vast number and variety is the South Pacific.Japam.-se n--searchers are ac-278 THE GLOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY rive here, also, searching for nurme natural products. For example, the Japanese have been able to negotiate an agreement with the Fed\u00ad erated States of Micronesia (FSM) that allows them to collect bio\u00ad logical specimens from its reefs, which contam about 60% of the world's coral species (in comparison, the Caribbean has about 200/u). Similar activities are being conducted by Japan at Palau. The Japan\u00ad ese ~dentists, who are not required to recompeme FSM, reportedly are looking for products having anti-fouling, bwremediating, and pharmacological properties. THE ROLf OF lHE PRIVATE SECTOR IN SUPPORTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH More than any other industrialized country, the Japanese private sector plays a vital role in snence and technology, a role that 1s likely to continue in marine biotechnology. This section, which seeks to clarify how important that role is, has two parts. First, we discuss the Japanese industry's support of science generally, and marine biotech\u00ad nology specifically. Second, the less important but nevertheless signif\u00ad icant ~le of joint ventures and non-governmental orgamzatiom m marine biotechnology endeavors is clarified. Japanese Industry and Support of Scientific Resean:h A wide-ranging study was performed by the STA in 1992 to assess the state of research in Japan (Agency of lndmtrial Snence and Technology, 1992a). One of its maJor findings was that Japanese in\u00ad dustry is the most important component in Japan's science and tech\u00ad nology infrastructure. To demonstrate,_of all .. re~;!rch done in Japan in 1992, industry perfqrmed 80.6%, universities were responsible for 11.6%, and government institutions 7.8%. _Further, the trend since 1980 1s one of industry conrinunmly increasing its share, while-that of the government decreases. Among the principal industrialized countries the share of mdustry's research expenses provided by gov\u00ad ernment 1s the lowest in Japan, standing at 2.7%, compared to 31.2% in the U.S. Another revealing trend can be seen in the percentage of research expenses received by universities from various sources. In 1983, the government funded 82.2% of all research performed m A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAllA, AND NORWAY 279 univer<;ities, while mdustry supported 17.6%. However. in 1990, the government's bad to 65%, wbilc mdustry's had m\u00ad creast.d to 35%. The type of research that industry supports is over\u00ad whelnung!y applied or developmental research {90%). The study dcmomtratcd a well known fact, namely that Japan's baste research ratio of 12.6'% (compared to 15.1% m the U.S.) is the lowest among principalmdustnal countries. It can be seen that the findings of the study supports the generally accepted notion that Japan tends. tQll_t;_\u00ad glect basic research in favor of goal-onented r~~~arcb, a tendency that i~ likely to continue. Until fairly recently, there was little cooperation between indus\u00ad try and universities. It 1s only since 1983 that this situation began changmg, after new MESC guide-lines defining university-industry relations came into effect (Kmzunn, 1992). Among others, the guidelines allow umversity laboratories to undertake proprietary re\u00ad search that companies may develop mto products. Further, re\u00ad searchers frotn mdustry are allowed to work in uruvcrsity laborato\u00ad ries while still employees of the companie~. Over the last ten years dose collaborations have been devdoped between academic re\u00ad searchers and companies through mecham~ms such as joint appoint\u00ad ments,joint publications, consultancy agreements, and contract re\u00ad search. For example, in 1983 there were just 56 joint university-in\u00ad dmtry research projects, but in 1992 this had mcreased to 1 ,241 pro\u00ad jects v.rith 1,398 researchers participating in them (Ministry of Edu\u00ad cation, 1993). The total funding of university-industry projects was approximately $41 million for 1992 (Normtle, 1993). However, many academic scientists still harbor a bias against mdustries and ap\u00ad plied research (KoizunU, 1992), while industry ''view Japan's univer\u00ad as little more than a filter for s.i fi:ing out the brightest of the next crop of employees\" (Normile, 1993). Most academic research sponsored by Japanese industry, as not\u00ad ed above, 1s applications oriented. However, recendy it wa~ reported that Japanese companies are shifting thetr strategies from low-profit, large-scale products to high value-added products, such as nevi ma\u00ad teriah and bioacrive substances. For this reason, companies were in\u00ad vesting in basic research facilities in order to understand basic phe\u00ad nomena underlying the ckvelopment and production of these prod-280. THE GLOBAL (HALLEH:Jf OF MARINE BKJTECHNO!.CGY ucts (Hirano, 1992). Our observa.nom from havmg monitored biotechnology developments in Japan for over four years support~ this observation. Specifically, many Japanese compames are mvesting m biotechnology, even comparnes that one would not usually associ\u00ad ate with the life sciences (e.g., companies involved with the manu\u00ad facture of automobiles, machinery; mining eqmpmem, etc.). Further, as Japanese companies deplete the possibilities of current knowledge and as more companies move mto biotechnology, many of them are recognizing the importance of basic research. A stgmficant number of these companie~ are funding basic research projects in academic mstitutes, thus, the tendency of indmtry to fund applied research, noted above, may not hold true in biotechnology. In addition to needing to explore new marketing possibilities, incentives offered by the Japanese government to industry have en\u00ad couraged Japanese companies to enter biotechnology. What ts note\u00ad worthy in this regard IS how incentive~ are designed to ensure that investments by industry are for the long-term. The Japanese compa\u00ad nies therefore do not expect to turn a profit m the short term. Rather, japanese mdustry is anticipating reaping profits and other benefits in five, ten, or even fifteen years. Companies of course know that the Japanese biotechnology market is already large, and will grow much larger. To illustrate, the JBA conducted a survey of 134 companies in 1992. lt found ~t the biotechnology market had increased in size from $900 milliofi ~-;; 1987 to $5.45 billion .in 1992, and is estimated to reach $28 billion m 2000 and S90.9 billion in 2010 (Anonymous, 1993d)! The pre\u00ad sent market derives an income of$2.92 billion from medical prod\u00ad ucts, $800 million from chemiCal $636 milhon industry, $364 million from agncultural products, and S273 million from food products (Anonymous, 1993d). The average amount each company spent on biotechnology R&D annually wa~ $6.63 million. As can be seen in the next section,Japanese industry is heavily mvolved in marine biotechnology research. Many of the cori1paflies that are mvcsting m marine biotechnology projects (sec Table 3) also are encouraging their scientists to enter into collaborative research A REPORT ON 1HE U.S., JAPAN AUSTlWJA, AND NoRWAY 281 w1th academtc example, aJomt action chitosan oligomers; two proJec\u00b7ts between urchin resource~; Tohoku UmversJty and the Shizugawa-machi pollution from Shizugawa Uay aquaf3.rms; Uni\u00ad wrsity of Tokyo is working with the Research Institute for Innova\u00ad tive Technology for the Earth to improve the efficiency of photo\u00ad _,ynthesis of algae and bacteria; in another project supported by MAFF, University of Tokyo re<Jearchers are working with colleagues tfom the Al\u00b7ahi Chemical Industry Company to extract pep tides from sklppck (bonito) viscera that evidence anti-hypertensive activi\u00ad University of Agricultun: and Tech\u00ad nology bas several industrial partners, including Tcnsci Fishene~ Ltd.

After having followed the development of marine biotechnolo\u00ad !-.'Y in Japan from 19H9 to the present, it is our Impression that similar to the present ~ltuation in the U.S. and other countnes, marine bwtt\"chno!ogy is an emerging field in science in Jap~l}\u00b7 Although A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 283 many Japanese compames are making financial and manpower m\u00ad vestments in marine biotechnology (see Table 3), these probably are not done according to strategic planning. More likely, the rea\"Son companie\" have made these invesm1ents is to be In good emry posi\u00ad tion should opportunities in the field develop. Further, collaborations between academia and industry in Japan generally are succmful in t<.:nm of both side:; gaming benefits, therefore, it is likely that mdus\u00ad tr;.\u00b7 will continue increasing its support of marine biotechnology re\u00ad search in the acadennc sector for the foreseeable future. From the infOrmation that was compiled for this analysis, it was not possible to estimate directly how much investment Japanese in\u00ad dustry 1s making in manne biotechnology. However, analysis of offi\u00ad cial japanese brovernment .~tatistics from past years confirms lhat.in\u00ad ljustry provides funding for circa 80% of all research Jap_an (A!_;;i-tcy of Industrial Sdence and Tee hnology, 1992a). If this holds true for marmc biotechnology, by using the funding figures denved from federal agencies (see page 187, above), we deduce that industry funding for manne biotechnology research m 1992 was in the r.wge. ofb.e\"tw~e~ $297.55 million and $432.35 million. We also surveyed the literature for information about research activitie<; of Japanese companies. While much less exact information was available on this subject than on academic research (see below), it wa.~ dear that the companies whose major business lie in the food and pharmaceuticals areas arc at the forefront of supporting marine biotechnology research; the types of research they favor tend to be focussed on aquaculture and marme natural products. Joint Ventures and Non-governmental Organizations Active;, Morine 8~ Joint Ventures The MBI ts the principal joint venture in marine biotechnolo\u00ad gy between japan's government and industry (Anjo, 1989). The main objective of MHI is to perform bioengineering research utilizing marine organisms. Ultimately, its function is to transfer and license results from that research to its supporting companies. Accordingly, 284 THE GlOBAL CHAllENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY activities of the MBI are concentrated on bas1c technologies for uti\u00ad lization of mannc organisms, technologies for producmg useful ~ub\u00ad S(a!lces, technologies for utilization of useful biological functions, and support technologies. Specific targets of the company include: tech\u00ad niques bioremediacion; for utiliz\u00ad mg useful biological functions or nmme organisms, such a.'> the abil\u00ad ity of some algae to accumulate and concentrate rare metals. Organ\u00ad isms that MHI scientists investigate include manne nucroorganistn:'l, and other protochorda.ta, sponges, lenterates. MBI has three components: MBI, Center fi.Jr Industrial Use of Marine Organisms (CIUMO), and the research vessel Sohgen Maru (Miyachi, 1993b). The first, MBI, is the parent organiza.tion, which sets policy and disburses funds to support research undertaken at the institute. It was established in December 1988 as a cooperative ven\u00ad ture between MlTI and 24 private companies. Funding for the MBI in 1991 wa~ $19.6 million, of which MITI supplied S1 0.2 million, the 24 companies furnished $7.8 million and RITE provided $1.6 million (Miyachi, 1993b). MBIS funding level increa.~ed slightly in 1992 to million (Miyachi. 1993b), although most of this in\u00ad crease may reflect a lower value of the dollar versus the yen. The MBI is headed by Director General S. Miyachi, who is well known for his research on the physiology of photoS)nthesis. He also has car\u00ad ned out basic research on methods ro minimize the release of car\u00ad bon dioxide into the environment (Gibor, 1990a). Most re~earch bemg carried out at MBI is performed at CIU\u00ad MO, which was established in 1989 and became operational in late 1991. Major funding to establish CIUMO was provided by NEDO and the same 24 companies involved with MHI. CIUMO i~ com\u00ad pnsed of two research centers, located Kanuishi and Shimizu, each of which cost approxlmately $27.27 million to construct and equip. Eat\"h has about 5,000 squ.tre meters of floor space and each is exceedingly well equipped. At present, eJ.ch CIUMO center is staffed by approxtmately 30 doctoral-level researcher~, most of whom are on loan from the 24 mvcsting compames (Mtyachi, 1993b). In general, the Kamaishi center has a more biologtcal out-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAliA, AND NORWAY 285 look, w}nl~ that of the Sh1mizu is more chemically directed, but there are overlaps. The Soh,een Mam lS a 3,205 ton dedicated research ship, which prevlOusly was the University of Tokyo's research wssd. It has a crew of 27 and can acconunodatc up to 58 snentists. A~ presently config\u00ad ured, it has seven laboratones, dark room, and two deep sea winches capable of reaching depths of 14,000 and 6,000 meters. By the end of !992, it had made SlX e).:ped.itions, venturmg as far as Palau, Yap, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef (Miyachi, 19Y3a). The MBI presently is carrying out three research progr.~ms. The first compnses the nine-year (1988-1996) national program \"Fine Chcnucals From Manne Organlsms,\" which was supported by MITI to the extent of$11.9 million in 1992. The program's general objec\u00ad tive IS to develop marme organisms or their products for industrial purposes (Anonymous, 1989b). Research has been carried out along four parallel paths at CIUMO (Miyachi, 1993b). The first p~th is the development of basic technology for utilization of marine organ\u00ad isms, which supports studies to clarifY symbiosis in g1ant clams and corals, investigate picoplankton in oceans, the development of cell culture systems tOr macroalgae, and pr~ervation of marine organ\u00ad isms. The second, called the \"Biofouling\" project, a1ms to dtscover substances produced by marme org.misms that can prevent adhesion of biofouling organisms to marine structures. The third, called \"Dioremediation of Oil Spill,\" seeks to discover new marine bacteria useful for bioremediation of oil spilled into the ocean. The fourth, termed supporting technologies, dcvdops information processing techniques, including a database dedicated to recording charactcris~ tics of collected marine organisms. The second program, \"Fixation of Carbon Dioxide,\" began in 1990 and is being done in cooperation with RITE. Its m..ajor activity ts to screen mJCroalgal species m order to discover strains that fix CO, efficiently. Already this work has remlted m the isolation of a nov~! organism able to grow in 60% CO, (Agency program in 1992 (Miyachi, 1993b). The third programmatic area is a set of proJects supported by MBI's 24 investing companies, which are mainly focus\\ed on screen-286 THE GLOBAL (HAUfNGE OF ~RINE BIOTECHNOlOGY ing of marme organism~ for bioactive substd.nce~ and developing methods fur recovering them. According to MBI's annual report, substances of special interest mclude \"docos.1hexaenoic 1992, MBI received S8.82 milhon to pay for this set of projects. In early 1993, the MHJ's ExccUtJVe Director, 0. ImadJ., listed the institute's four major research accomplishment~ (lmada, 1993). First, MBI rescan:llers a ne\\v group prokaryotic green mi\u00ad croalgac (picoplankton) that 1s widely distnbutcd in the ocean be\u00ad tween Japan and Australia at a depth of 101) meters. This finding, which \\VaS accomplished with the help of a cell sorter aboard the So\u00ad hgm Manl, helps explain certain evolutionary relationships and may aid in explaining why the oceans store more carbon dioxide than expected. Second, ex1rcmcly thermophilic sulfur bactena were re\u00ad covered from deep-sea hydrothermal deposits and these arc being investigated as to their nutritional need~ and the proteolytic enzymes they contain, which function at 105\" C. Third, MBI scientist.~ have discovered and identified a substance, called tribromomethylgramme, secreted by a bryozoan that repels fouling orgamsms. Fourth, !vl.BI scientists are screening the waters in the area between Japan and Australia for microalgae that recover C02 with high efficiency. In the course of this proJCCl, scientists based on the Sohgm Maru discov\u00ad ered a new type of small, green nucroalgae, picoplankton, that live at a depth of circa 100 meter>. MBI scientists theorized that these mi\u00ad croaJgae are responsible for absorbing a large proportion of the CO! that i' believed to stored in some unknown manner in the earth's envuonment. It is clear that outstanding scienti~~ of .MBI are carrylng out ba\u00ad SIC resean'h in marine biology, microbiology, toxicology, and molecu\u00ad lar genetics. A rev1ew of MBI will be carried out m 1996, at which amc the contributions of MBI to manne bJOtechnology will be as\u00ad sessed. At that time, some qud.tions may be raised whether there is an appropnate balance between the basic re-search and applied re\u00ad search that is being performed at MBI. I l A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 287 Non\u00b7govemmenlol Organizations In gcm\u00b7ral biotechnolog)~JHA, which formerly was called the Bioindustr)' Development Center (DIDEC), is a non-profit organi\u00ad zation whose primary purpose is to promote the growth of bioin\u00ad dmtry m Japan. It~ members mdude several hundred companies and over 1 ,(JO(l private mdividuals (Zaborsky et al., 19H9). In regard to marine biotechnology, in September 1987, academic researchers formed the Japan{\"Se Society of Marine Biotechnology (Anjo, 1989). Since its inception, the Society has served as a forum for the ex\u00ad change of ideas and information between acadenucs and mdusttial\u00ad ist<; and has promoted the growth of marine biotechnology in Japan through meetings and conferences. For example, the Society spon\u00ad sored the first lmernational Marine Biotedmology Conference, held m Tokyo m 1989_ In 1992, the Society beg.m publishing the Journal of Marine Biotedmolo,zy in English, which is the first sc:tentific publica~ cion to focm on the applications of marine resources. In the journal's fint editorial, the three editors claim that the journal is filling a new niche created by the rJpid growth in marine biotechnology research (Miyachi et al., 1993). MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN JAPAN The total R&D program m Japan for marine biotel'hnology is l;uger and more diverse than that of the U.S. While ih~ survey that f~llows is less detailed than presented in Chapter 1, sufficient infor\u00ad mation is given to convey che~!:.khnessJ depth, and variety of Japanese activities m marme biotechnology. As is seen b.eiow,Japanese R&D in the stx .areas of marine biotec~ulogy delineated in Chapter 1 is substantial. Adhering to the format of Chapter 1, where some im\u00ad portant contributions by Japanese snentists to marine biotechnology are noted, we describe important marine biotechnology research be~ mg done related to aquaculture, marine animal health, marine natur\u00ad al products, biofilm~ and bioadhesion, bioremcdiation, and marine ecology and biological Of MARINE BIOTKHNOL(X;Y s;...chnology Since lntt\"rt_\":'it m aquaculture IS w\u00b7ry strong in Japan, it IS under\u00ad \u00a7tandabl(' that much attention i~ bemg tkvoted researcher~ to growth and develop\u00ad through !-,'Tt'Jter under.~tanding of phy~iolog:ical rhemkal an emphasis or1 the funwon of growth hormone~.

For ex\u00ad ample, R.

For t'Xample, T. Onozato at tht' National Research Institute of Aquaculture is devel\u00ad oping transgemc fish (Seta, 1990). Through direct mjection of cloned genes into the nuclei of Medaka eggs, E. Tanuya of the Uni\u00ad versity of Tokyo, K. Inoue of the company Nippon Suisan Kaisha, and K. Ozato of Kyoto University have developed a system which serves a..~ a model for gt>netic manipulation of fishes {Gibor, 1990a). Scitnti.~t~ at the N1ppon Smsan Kaisha company are testing a runs\u00ad genic trout with an additional growth hormone gt>nt'. The company claims that the transv;emc trout grows 1.2 times as large as normal trout (Anonymous, 1993u). In addition to fmfish, much research is focussed on rotifera, co,r~l, sea urchins, nen:ids, shellfish, asc1dians, squid, and. octopus (Mat\\usato, 1989). For example, M. Morisawa at the Miuki Marine Station of Tokyo Umversity is studying the fertilization and de:vclop\u00ad ment of invertebrates (Gibor, 1991). A mass cultivation method has bt>en developed for nucro-cellular Rotifera. Cultivation of this zoo\u00ad plankton is important because of it~ role as tht' first biological feed for manne fish larvae (Matsusato, 1989). When fed with rotifers, shellfish larva grow larger and are more disease resistant than if artifi\u00ad cial feed is used. 290 THE GLOSAL (HALLfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Advances in cultivation methods of sea urchim hJ.ve been achieved with funding Projt:ct\" providing funding for investigations aimed at clarifying interactions br-twecn sea urchins and seaweeds at the physical level.

Suzuki of Kanazawa University's Nota Manne Laboratory is on the biochemi\u00ad cal aspect~ of fertilization of sea urchin eggs (Gibor, 1991). Suzuki is studying biologically active pcptides associated with the extracellular matrix around the e~rs, which demonstrate activating effects on sperm cells (Gibor,1991). Algal AqUGCulture and Biotechnology In Japan, ~gnificant ~~D is performed on both nucroal\u00ad gae and macroalgae (Matsusato, 1989; Anonymous, 1989h). Algal culture is one of Japan marine biotechnology program's strengths. For example, GIRl at Osaka is a leading Japanese research institute in genetic manipulation of algae. A GIRl team has inserted a gene coding for beta-carotene into Spimlina. The gene was obtained from scientists in Israel, but GIRl SCientists constructed the vector which successfully transferred the gene mto the host. GIRl da1ms that as a result the beta-carotene production capability of the transfOrmed Spimlina has mcrcased greatly (Anonymous, 1992i). Another GIRl team, headed by H. Kojima, claim., to be the first m the world to have successfully transformed Spiru/inu using clcctro\u00ad poration. The introduction of genes coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was proven when the acetylated chloram\u00ad phenicol products were detected v1a chemical means in the tram\u00ad formed S'pimlina cells. G~ne was confirmed by PCR analy~is (Anonymous, 1992b). The Kojima team is also attempting genetic enginening of the algae Porphyridium, to produce human prostaglandins. This alga naturally produces the chemical arachido\u00ad nate, which i~ a precursor of prostaglandins. Prmtaglandins haw im-A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 291 ponant functions related to control of blood pressure, muscle func\u00ad tion, and blood domng. Scientists fi'om GIRl at Osaka also are attempting to develop Jarg~:-scale culture systems for the green alga, Botryococms, an organ- 1sm that is very diff1cult to culture because of its susceptibility to contamination (Anonymous, l992i). Botryococms produces high qual\u00ad ity hydrocarbons that could be used as an alternate source for fuel. S. Okada and K. Yamaguchi of the University of Tokyo and H. Iwamoto of the MeiJi Univer~ity in Tokyo are employing genetic engineenng in an attempt to mcreasc the capacity of this alga to produce hydrocarbons. At AIST's Fermentation Research Institute (now mcorporatt:d in the National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology), in\u00ad vestigators have used electroporation to imert a the hydrogenase enzyme into a thermophilic cyanobactermm. When the genetically modified bacterium is exposed to illumination, it re\u00ad ~ponds by pmdunng and relea.~ing hydrogen (Anonymous, At the ~me time, Y Fujita at the Okazaki National Research Insti\u00ad tutes is studying development of the photosynthetic membranes of cyanobacteria (Gibor, 1991). Research on large seaweed~ presently is concentrated on pro\u00ad duction of laver and kelp, e.g., N.

For example, at the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which es-292 THE GLOBAL (HALlfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY tablished its biotechnology research laboratory m 1990, scientists claim to have discovered a blue-green algal spenes in the Janata hot spnng on Slukine Island that absorbs and fixes CO\" four times more efficiently than an eqwvalent nu'iS of tropical rain forest. Even so, a cultivation area of 40 square kilometers IS required to absorb and fix tht: amount of C02 emitted by one 600,000 kilowatt li4udied nat\u00ad ural gas thennal power plant (Anonymous, 1994j). Marine Animal Health Japan's large aquaculture industry Js continuously challenged by infectious diseast:s, yet, marine arnmal health \\O far has received rela\u00ad tively little attention by Japant.'\"\"Se scientists. Viral disease!i appear to be especially problematic to the Japanese (K1mura and Yoshinuzu, 1991). Some research aims to detect viral intCctions and vaccines against selected viruses causing fish disea~es are undt:r devdupment. For example, Y. Kame1 of Sapporo Bn:wcrics Company in Tokyo has constructed vaccines to inununize cultured fish against viral in\u00ad fections and also for diagnostic purposes (Gibor, 1990a). Recently, antibodies have been developed for three types of pathogenic v-iruses infecting fish salmonids, the Infectious Hematopmetic Necrosts veloped by H. Murak.anu (Seto, 1990). However, research related to developing ine:!l:pensive but efficient delivery system for vacctnes ts lagging, therefore, Japanese-made vaccines have not yet been applied in the field. MAFF ts attempting to strengthen this area of manne biotech\u00ad nology. In 1993, it set up a new three-year proJect to develop vac\u00ad cines that protect cultured fish from vnal diseases (Anonymous, 19931 ). The research IS being conducted at the National Research Institute of Aquaculture and the Natioml Institute of Health, but scientists from Nagasakj and Hiroshima universities arc collaborators. Reportedly, the first step will be to identifY which virmes should be targeted tOr inve<;tigation.

Scientists workmg for Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. have screened 59 marine macroalgal species and found that extracts from 38 of these species suppress the proliferation ofT cells, while 16 species provide extracts that affect lymphocytes and macrophages (Anonymom, 1993b). These substances are undergoing further in\u00ad ve~tigation with the aim of developing drugs to treat auto11nmune disea.~es. Many Japanese soentists from Kyushu University, Kagoshima University, Kyoto University, Kochi University, and Nansei Regional Fisheries Research Institute are working together to discover bactt'\u00ad ria that kill or inhibit the rnicroalgae that constitute \"red tide.\" Their investigations have shown that anti-microalgal bacteria are widely distributed in the seawatc.T and <an be recovered from algal surfaces. Dr. Fukam..i, Kochi Universlty, has found that at the beginning of the bloom of a part1cular microalga, the bacteria that promote the growth of the alga prolift:rate and, in reverse, anti-algal bacteria in\u00ad crease in number during the declining phase of the bloom. The work of the group has led to the isolation of many anti-algal strains 296 THE GLOBAL (HAUfNGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY of bacteria that inhibit Ch\u00abtt,mtlla, HetfrM~gma, and Clwrt<YCro.>.

At the University of Tokyo, K. Kogun: has clarified the orig:ms ofTTX (Gibor, 1990a).

A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 297 Enzymes The types of enzymes being investig-dted include enzymes as well as enzymes in\u00ad volved in bcmg done by K. Horikmhi of RIKEN, who is searching for novel mi\u00ad croorganism; from the deep ocean (Myers and Anderson, 1992) (see page 178, above), T. Goto of Nagoya Umversity who is studymg bi\u00ad oluminescence and Y Yamada at and Yammoto, 1991). One of Japan's most successful projects, the \"Superbug;\" project, was completed m 1991 (Myers and Anderson, 1992). This five\u00b7 year, $15 million study, which was led by K. Horikostu {now head of the DEEPSTAR project), sought to discover new thermophilic, alka\u00ad lophilic, and psychotropic organisms in the deep oceans (Gibor, 1991 ). A notable discovery was a mix of marin!! hacu~rial-denved enzymes, including cellulases and protcases, that can hydrolyze cellu\u00ad lose in a high pH environment. The enzyme mixture is bemg used in a detergent,\" Attack,\" and now garners 600/o of the Japanese laun\u00ad dry detergent market. Exaggerating somewhat, a Japanese publica\u00ad tion damiS that when this product was marketed, Japan became the first countr)' in the world to use \"genetically engtneered lase, breaks down <;tarch and, in the process, forms as an end product, the cyclic molecule cyclodextrin. This substance can be used to manufacture capsules useful for the slow, controlled release of drugs and fragrances. At AIST's Life Sciences Engineering Research Institute (now the National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology) a group headed by Y. Asada is seeking to transform a species of ther\u00ad moplulic alga, Syneclu)(:oaus elongatus, by (HAUfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY tion the genes from the bacterial species ClMtridium that code for enzymes producing hydrogen gas. The aim of thi.'i re'iearch IS to con\u00ad vert the alga, which uses only sunhghr as an energy source, to the production of practically unlimited amounts of hydrogen as a inex\u00ad pensive, dean source of energy (Anonymom, I 9Y3i). Investigators at the Seawater Re'iearch Institute of japan lbbac\u00ad co, Inc., report discovering a new type of agara~e {Anonymous, 1992e). After haVIng screened over 1,000 samples of japanese coastal water and sea bottom sediment for organisms containing possible useful substances, they found a new Vl\"brio species that produces the agarase in question. The agarasc can be used to decompose agar, which is a polysaccharide, in order to produce degr.tdation products consisting of monosaccharides and oligmaccharide'i. These sub\u00ad stances are useful in helpmg preserve rice cakes, bean paste and other starch-containing food'i. Agarase may also be used by researchers to dissolve the walls of red algae, a development that may enable re\u00ad searchers to perl\"orm protoplast fusion using different species of alga. Duong van Qua, University of Tokyo, has isolated marine bac\u00ad teria that produce halophilic protea~e. The purified protease astounding 18% NaCI concentration to exhibit maxlmum actiVI\u00ad ty. He has applied the enzyme for the production of\"nukmum,\" which is a fermented fish sauce popular in Somh East Asian coun\u00ad tries. The product, named Marinagc, is produced commercially by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company Ltd. (Simidu, 1994). Work m a similar vein is being done by C. lmada, also at the University of Tokyo, who aims to discover marine bacteria that pro\u00ad duce protease inhibiton. After havmg screened approxunatcly 3,0(]0 strains of marine bacteria, he obtained three strains that were m\u00ad hibitor producers. The amino acid sequence of one of the smaller\u00ad molecule inhibitors, named Marinostatin, showed no similarity to inhibitors of terrestrial ongin, mggesting that the phylogemc dewl\u00ad opment of the two occurred independent of one another. Miscellaneous Marine Natural Products Remarkable research is proceeding at the lbkyo Umversity of Agriculture and Technology on genetically engineering freshwater A REFORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AusTRAUA, AND NORWAY 299 and marine cyanobacteria to produce a variety of products, includ\u00ad ing amino acids and plant promoters (Matsunaga, 1992). The trans\u00ad formation of (;yanobacter ~pecies has been achieved using shuttle vectors, eh:ctroporation, \"biolistics\" (transformation by high-speed partides coated with DNA), and conjugation. Since microalgal pro\u00ad duction systems tend to be inefficient because the organisms grow in low density, the Tokyo University researchers are developmg high density culture methods for the cyanobacteria. M1croalgal species are being screened by scientists from the Ebara Research Company to discover strains that produce large amounts of the bioactive compound docosahexaenmc acid, reputed to have health Improving effects. A species has been found that gro~ well at 15\" C and is easy to culture. The company claims that there is a large market for the microalgae-producing docosa\u00ad hexaenoic add as food for fish and <;hellfish raised in aqu;~culture (Anonymous, 1993b). Another fatty acid with reputed health effects, eicosapcntacnoic acid (EPA), which IS discussed in Chapter 1, is the focus of K. Yaza\u00ad wa's work at the Sagami Centra1 Research Institute. He screens ina\u00ad nne bactena that inhabit pelagic marine fish, such as horse mackerel, mackerel, and sardines, for strains that produce EPA. Since previously only eukariottc organisms were known to pmduce EPA, Yazawa's approach is rather unique (Sim.idu, 1994). A group headed by T. Matsunaga at the TOkyo Uruversiry of Agriculture and Technology ts studying magnetite found in the freshwater bacterium, Aquaspiri/lum. Magnetite is thought to have an tmportant role in how rmgratory species, including birds and fish, recognize direction and location. The Japanese researchers have been able to identifY and isolate the genes that code for the production of biogenic magnetite. There is industrialmtercst m this work. Magne\u00ad use magnetite orient themsch-es in mag\u00ad netic fields, are being mvestigated by scientiSts at Meiji Seik.a Kaisha Ltd. tOr usc in targeted drug-delivery systems. Injections of drugs en\u00ad capsulated by magnetite are coordinated with the placement of a magnet on the targeted body part, e.g., a tumor, which results in the drug being concentrated at the site of the tumor. 300 THE GLOBAL CHAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY Investigators at MBI\\ laboratory located at Shunysu have dis\u00ad covered a marine bacterium that produces a UV light absorbing sub\u00ad stance. The microorgamsm, tentatively named AficratwrHS strain AK- 334, was collected !Tom the ocean surface layer off Palau Island in the South Pacific. Previously, it was known that some manne plants protected themselves from the sun by producmg UV light absorbing substances (Rhinehcimer, 1 Y80). H. Larsen (Larsen. 1962) suggested mch a role for the pigment produced by halobactena. Tins more re\u00ad cent follow-up ofLarsm's work with the newly tsolated l'.Jicrocoaus strain 1s interesting. Mimuoaus strain AK-334 has been cultured in the Shimysu laboratory, where researchers were able to extract the active substance, ming chromatography. Whm analyzed by NMR, the substance was identified as imino-myco~porme amino acid shi\u00ad norine, which absorb~ light at the 334 nm wavelength (Anonymous, 1993v). These findings indicate the possible application of this sub\u00ad stance a.~ sunscreen, suggesting a follow-up of Larson's earlier studies with halobacterium i~ merited. Chitin and its chemical denvative chitosan have been the ob\u00ad jects of much R&D throughout the world. The Japanese are leaders in this area. Chitin extracted from crustacean sheDs and minerals pro\u00ad duced by Spirulina forms the basis of a liquid manure called \"Chi\u00ad toleana,\" which is produced by the Dainippon Ink and Chemical Company. This spenalty product is used to grow a high quality turf for golf courses and parks (Anonymous, 1993n). T. Tsugita of Kato\u00ad kichi Company has successfully used the shell constituents, chitin and chitosan, as a rn..aterial in pharmaceutical products. K. Kifune of Unitika Company, Kyoto, has developed an artificial skin made of chitin (Seto, 1990; Anonymous, 1993w). The artificial skin, called \"Be<;ch1tin W:' when used to treat 657 patients suffering from \"nor\u00ad mal\" wounds and thermal burns proved to promote healing and healed surfaces had excellent cosmetic appearance. Chitin is also used m biosensors (vide it!fra). Became of environmental concerns, much attention ts being fo\u00ad cussed in Japan on biodegradable plastics, which includes biodegrad\u00ad able films and foams. These are ~ubstances used in wrapping food and m pack.lging materials that are strong enough to serve a.~ well as A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND NoRwAY 301 conventional plastic~, but decay readily when exposed to the sun or other natur.J physical and biological forces to residual substances that do not harm or burden the environment. The market for biodegrad\u00ad able plastics 111 Japan m 1992 was $3.03 million and thi~ market will grow to an estimated $13.63 million in 1994 (Anonymous, 1993x). While several types of biodegradable plastics are varieties of chemical synthetic pla~tics,Japanese researchers, in both the public and private sectors, have developed biodegradable fihns and foams, using natural substances &om marine or~anisms as the ~tarring mate\u00ad rial. The Aicdlo Chemical Company has developed a biodegradable film, u~ing chitosan derived from crab and shrimp shells. The com\u00ad pany claims that the film is as strong as ordinary plastic film, but will decompose completely into harmless endproducts within two weeks ofbemg buried in the soil (Anonymous, 1989j). Similarly, Mitsubishi Rayon Company ts producing a biodegradable film, called \"Soa:fil;' used for packaging by the food and cosmetics industries. In this case, the basic material is carrageenan from macroalgae (Anonymous, 1993q). Nereids are being physiologically ac~ tive substances, mduding fish attractants and poisons active against higher anima1s, as well as new adhesives for use in undeT\\oVater con\u00ad struction (Matsusato, 1989). Research on the internal o;ystems IS proceeding with funding from MAFF's \"Diomedia ProJect\" (Matsusato, 1989). Y. Naya of the Suntory Institute for Bioorganic Research in Osaka has been studymg the regulation of ecdysteroidogenesis in crustaceans, especially in relation to in viiJtl ex\u00ad hibition of molt-inhibiting effects (Schmitz and Yasumoto, 1991). Japan is the only nation whose research workers cultivate ascidi\u00ad ans. This organism has a capability to bioconcentrate microquantities of ceruin metals, such as vanadium. Research is presently focussed on understanding the mechanisms of such bioconcentration (Mat\u00ad sus.ato, 19R9). Reportedly some good results related to antifouling substances has been achieved in the past by KIna at Shizuoka Univemty (Kita-302 THE GLOBAL 0-iAUENGE OF MARINE BioTECHNOLOGY gawa, 1988). Ina 1s ~tudying\" attractants for shellfish that will allow farmers to control such be-haviors as embedding and breeding (Seta, 1990). Bioremedicrtion One of Japan's most striking proje-cts i~ the \"Tokyo Bay Restoration Project,\" which aims to clean and restore Tokyo Bay by creation of artificial tidelands. Heading the pn~ject are T. Okabe and H. Nakahara of the Research Institute for Ocean Economics (RIOE) (Gibor, 1991). It 1s ba.~ed on the premise that tideland~ serve an essential role in the ecology of bay~. A second project was the MOC's \"Wastewater Treatment Project.\" An importlnt mitiative for developing new methods to bioremediate polluted soils and natural waterways is being supported by a nine-company consortium, led by the Japan Research Institute Ltd. ORI). Participants include Ebara Research Company, Ltd., Kumaga1 Gumi Company, Ltd., Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd., Toray Industries, Inc., Sumitomo Metal Mining Company, Ltd., Dowa Mining Company, Ltd., and Hitachi Zosen Corporation. JRI has also reached an accord with the U.S.\u00ad based Ecova Corporation on the use of Erova's e:..:pertise in soil re\u00ad mediation (Anonymous, 1991d). Notable research in bioremediation is being done by Y. Ishida of Kyoto Umversity who ts tsolating or\u00ad ganisms from oligotrophic lakes, i.e., lakes containing very pure wa\u00ad ter, and inv~tigating them for special properties useful in the purifi\u00ad cation of waste w-aters and bioconcentration of rare element~ (Gibor, 1991). Marine Ecology and Biological Oceanography Research in manne ecology and biological oceanography, much of which has important implications for public health, has high pri\u00ad ority in Japan. Two general types of research in this area may be dis\u00ad tinguished, applications of molecular techniques to marine ecology and the development ofbiosensors. l A REPORT ON TI<E U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAIJA, AND NoRWAY 303 Molecular Techniques in Morine Ecology Much research is focussed on attempting to understand, predict, and prevent red ndes, which through the age<J have been responsible for masstve fish kills and serious damage to laver cultivation. In 1990, MAFF's Fisheries Agmcy and EA launched a five-year project aimed to prevent red tides. fu part of this project, monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies against each red tide plankton will be developed, effective control method~ against red tides will be formulated, mlcro-plankton will be spectated by charactenzing then DNA n .. \"'Striction patterns, and various environmental improvement strateg:~es will be evaluated (Anonymous, 1990b). Other research on red tides attempts to purifY and characterize the various toXIns responsible for massive fish kills. Significant research includes that being done by K. Yamaguchi of the Untversity of Tokyo on the ecological origlns and distribution of TTX (Gibor, 1991), and Y. Osltima of Tohoku University in Send..ai on mixtures of sa.xitoxln derivatives detected in -~traim of Gymnodini\u00ad um catenatum (Schmitz and Yasumoto, 1991). M. Kodama of the Kitasato University School of Fisheries is studying the origms of paralytic shell fish poisons (Gibor, 1991). One of Kodama\\ recent findings was that the degree of toxicity of the di\u00ad notlagdlate ProtogottytJU!ax is related tn the presence of intro~.cdlular bacteria. Another example of remarkable research in public health is being performed at the Suminoe Kikaku Company where re\u00ad searchers have isolated a marine plant extract that i~ reported as be\u00ad ing almost 100% effective m killing vibrios and Salmonella species in sea water. R&D focmsing on Anthozoa (or coral) is mainly related to jewelry products and coral reef construction (Matsusato, 1989). Sup\u00ad plies of high-quality coral for jewelry is steadily decreas-ing, stimulat\u00ad ing mterest in coral propagation. Furthermore, the inverse relation\u00ad ~hip between reef-building coral activity and global carbon dioxide levels has generated further intere~t m coral reef construction. Re\u00ad search in understanding those ecosystem~ surrounding reef-building cora1s is essential for developing replacements for reef areas. Such 304 THE GLOBAL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLcx:;Y work~~ bein~ performed at the Umver~ity ofRyukyus in Okina\\vl by T. Higa who is working to identif): organisms related to, and de\u00ad pendent on, coral redS (Gibor, 1 991; Kitagawa, 19HR). K. Yamazato, a leading expert on the bmlogy and ecology of coral redS, IS studying the physicochemical Some Japanese analysts believe that, of all developments in biotechnology, biosensors arc likely to have the greatest econonuc impact in the shorter term. By the year 1995, the biosemor market is estimated to reach $200 million per year by 2000 and $1 billion per year by 2010 (Anonymous, 199tb; Technology Forecast Study Committee, 1991). Biosensor research in Japan appears to be focussed on improv\u00ad ing sensitivity, mcreasmg the range of applications, .and nucrorrunia\u00ad tunzation. Key breakthroughs m this area have included develop\u00ad ment of more stable and sensitiw devices and chcmiluminescent materials. Biosensors are be-ing developed for many purpose<;, indud\u00ad mg environmental pollution monitonng, health and medical moni\u00ad toring (improvement of diagnostic and treatment methods for di\\\u00ad eases), the highly sensitive measurement of meat and fhh ffeshness, immune-system monitoring, measuring fatigue, and development of bioseusors as components of artificial organs. I. Karube at the Research Center for Advanced SCience and Technology at the University of Tokyo is developing biosensor~ that can be emplaced within the human body to me;u,ure glucose con\u00ad tinually for up to three months. The new biosensor was constructed by using chitin from cuttlefish cartilage in combination with glucose oxidase. The chitin/enzyme mixture, which overlays a thin layer of gold, dissolves over a three-month time period and, in the process, generates an electric signal that is transmitted by the gold to a trans\u00ad ducer. Animal expenmentauon with the device is now underway. Unlike most ~enmr~ that when placed in the blood stream elicit a destructive munune r<\"sponse, this sensor IS inert. This v.rurk is b<\"tng don<\" m cooperation w1th the company Nippon Smsan Kaisha, A REPORT ON T><E U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAllA, AND NoRWAY 305 which ts funding the major part of this research (Anonymous, 1993j). An mtcrestmg approach is bemg taken by sctentists The is collected from Cypridina, which ts a small, plankton-like organism living in the coastal water ofr Chiba Prefecture. When the ammal releases lucifera~e into the water, the subsequent rt\u00b7action produces blue-white light At Toray investiga\u00ad tors have been able to extract the gene coding for the luciferase from Cypridina, clone it m E. coli, and produce large quantities of the en\u00ad zyme. Once they have a pure product, they bind the enzyme to an antibody that has been designed for specific biological substanct--s in\u00ad cluding, fiJr contaimng the enzyme encounters the target substance, it emits light, the quantity of which is proportional to the amount of the target agent. Toray expects to be able to market several different diagnostic kits based on luciferase in one to two yean. EMPHASIS OF JAPANESE RESEARCH IN MARINE 8101KHNOI.OGY In order to ascertain which areas of marme biotechnolOb\")' are being empha,ized in Japan, we searched the Life Sciences Collection database, 1982-1991, and tssues of Mari11e Biotechnology Abstracts, 19fl9-1991, for publicatiom of Japanese origin. Eventually, 350 were found. Each was scrutinized and the work that was reported was classified according to the marine biotechnology area it addressed. We found that 37% of the Japanese publications reported on marine biotechnology research was related to natural products (mosdy ma\u00ad rine-denved toxins), 27% addressed problems or needs in aquacul\u00ad ture {mostly to enhance survival rates and improve reproduction of marine organisms raised m culture), 18% concerned biological oceanography, 6% addressed marine animal health, 4% were related to the development of marme cell culture systems, 3 % reported on biosensors, 2% were dedicated to bioremcdiation, and less than 1% 306 THE Gl08AL (HAUENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY concerned biofilm/biofouling (see Figure 22). There were ~ome overlap~. for example. between b1ologicl on\u00b7anogr.1phy and biost'n\u00ad sors, and bt't\\wen aquaculture and ammal health. Nevertheless, the results presented hae dearly indicatt\u00b7 the areas of marine bmtech\u00ad noloh'Y to which Japanese by publica\u00b7 h\"ons, 1981\u00b71991 CONCWSION Modern biotechnology in Japan appears to be entering a st'c\u00ad ond phase of development. The first phase began in the early 1980s and lart-.\"l.'ly was stimulated by the concern that U.S. researchers and mdustry would take a commanding position in the field by patent\u00ad ing new life fimm and genetically enh>lneered products. During this time, the Japanese government supported programs whose aim was to build a \\trong: ba~e for bJotecbnology mdustry and rict: agricul\u00ad tun.\u00b7. Although some support was gtven for basic research projects m mostly academic laboratories, this aspect of biotechnology largely wa.~ neglected. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTRAUA, AND NoRWAY 307 In the late 1980s, this applied, industry-duected approach wa~ broadened, to include programs that were more envuunmentally di\u00ad rected and basic re-search wa<; strengthened. These events came about because of two forces; the Japanese public was indicating a height\u00ad ened concern about environmental problems and Japanese decision\u00ad makers and scientists recognized, for many reasons, that they needed to <;trengthen baste research and contribute more to mternational science. About this rime, marine biotechnology became well funded (about 1lJR8), as dtd several national environmental research pro\u00ad grams (in 1989 and 1990). and most ministries designed and Imple\u00ad mented wide-rangmg international programs m which foreign re\u00ad search groups were encouraged to partake. However, the real change occurred in 1993, and this nuy signal the 1mtiation of the second phase. On the one hand, for the first time in twenty or more years Japan was facing econorruc hardship, which constrained the ability of ministries to act. On the other hand, the Japanese public strongly indlcated that the way politics and economics had functioned in the past was no longer adequate or, in\u00ad deed, appropriate. The response of the ministries to public pressure was dramatic, as mdicated by MITI's reorganization of its national programs described above. What h~~ happened in biotechnology is a reflection of the wider change, namely, then;:_~~ -~wre emphasis on s~!t;~ce as it pertains to hmnaJ1. wdlb<:\"_ing and the health of the envi\u00ad ronment. Further, despite economic hardship, the Japanese govern\u00ad ment unequivocally ha~ indicated that it will concinue to support science strongly by increasing funding for abnost all areas of scientific research. Thi'i, then, is the setting for the second phase of biotech~ no logy in Japan. The second phase has four major characteristics. First, biotech\u00ad nology research for industry continues to be well supported al\u00ad though, relatively spcaking,J~ss so _when __ comp~red fiom Marine Or= ganisms\" continues and is supplemented by other programs. Since manv or most of the \"fine cherrucals\" that will result from this pro\u00ad gram are likely to be used for pharmaceutical purposes, the program 1s directly related to human wellbeing and can be ~trongly defended on that b~~is. 308 THE GLOBAL BIOTECHNOLOCY S~:cond, biotechnolof_ry re~earch tOr mdustry at the local levd and wdl be locally directed. This trend results from the need tu decentralize economic activity in Japan, combined with the realintion of prefectural govl'rnments that biotechnology is a strong force for local econonuc developme-nt. The initiatwe~ of prefectural gowrnmems and the strung federal mpport for chest: initiatives, d~:~cribed and discmsed and grow. with 1mpbcatmns f<x biotechnology because so many economic activ:iril\u00b7s are al)ucous, marinc-ba~ed, or similarly oriented. Therefore, it is our sense that prefecture~ mcreasmgly will be important for the promotion and maintenance of marine biotechnology i.n Japan by, for imtance, prefectural govemmmts tak\u00ad ing the mitiative tO set up nrw kosetsuslzis and third sector centers whose aim will be to develop a special area of manne biotechnology 111 which they perceive to have a compt\u00b7t:iuve advantage. Third, there will be enormous growth m environmcnta!ly-di\u00ad rectt.:d biotechnology research. Having recognized the global scope of sul\u00b7h research, the Japanese are likely to invtte an ever gruwmg number offor~:ign researchers to take part in environmentally-di\u00ad rected re~earch. In the first instance, snenri>ts from developing coun\u00ad tries of the Asia~Pacific region will be invited to Japan, to receive trainmg m specialized techniques and to take part m collaborative research projects of regional sigmficance. Much of this research will, perforce, be related to biologiCal oceanography, biort'mediation, and marine organisms. We can expect that, as a result of these activities, within ten years marine biotechnology will flourish in the Asia-Pa\u00ad cific reg:mn generally. Tht: on biotechnology. Al\u00ad reJdy largt\u00b7 projects are aimed at discownng and developing marine nucroalgJ.e, plankton, and bacteria to fix C02, cleanly produce hy\u00ad drogen as an energy murce, and utilize bionuss of marine ongm. Gwmg the context of japan as a island country with limited natural terrt<;trial resources, these types of programs arc likely to continue and grow. A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTl!AUA, AND NoRWAY 309 Fourth, basK research m biotechnology will be given more em\u00ad pha~is and, at the same time, more international cooperal:lon will be encouraged m basic re~earch proycts. There are dear signs of this development. Japan was the initiator of the Human Science Frontier Program and remains its major funder.Just thi<; year, 1994, two pro\u00ad jects in the U.S. were approved for funding by ERATO (NormJle, 1994). While neither project involves biotechnology, they do indi\u00ad cate the outward direction of Japanese science. It is rea.~onable to be\u00ad lieve that Japanese agencies soon will whoUy or partially fund ma\u00ad rine biotechnology basic research projects involving U.S. sc1entists. On the applied side of marine biotechnology, Japanese compa\u00ad nies st'em to be concentrating on making and improvmg baste re\u00ad search discoveries, an area which underscores Japan's strength in product development and its doggedly penevcring researchers, both of which arc essential for utilization of marine biotechnology now and in the future. In particular, Japanese industry and government age-noes are focussing a great deal of attention on marine natural products. It appears as if Japan's pharmaceutical companies have rec\u00ad ognized that this area of marine science has immense economic po\u00ad tential. This interest stems from Japan's voraaous appetite for health and medical product~, i.e., the Japanese pharmaceutical marke~ wa.~ the second largest in the world,\" with $25 billion in sales io. 1967 (Yuan and llsu, 1990). Japan's traditional strengths m bioproce~mg technology, e.g., its prowess in the fermentation and bioprocessing industry, strong ap\u00ad plied research base, and mhmt direct and indirect government sup\u00ad port, more than balance out any weaknesses that might be cited by critics; i.e., the empha'\\is on applied research over b.as1c r~earch,lack of venture capital,lack of cooperation between ministries, and an under-developed regulatory structure. Recognizmg where their strengths lie, large companies are likely to support research in areas where they can advance rapidly; i.e., in area~ where they traditionally have been strong and where weak or uncertain regulations are not likely to stop progress. Thus, we are likely to see the Japanese make tremendous progress in marine natural products development and development of productiw cell culture ~ystcms. 310.

Conversely, manne biotechnology developments that could generate public concerns, such as the application of transgenic fin\u00ad fish, shellfish, and microalgac to aquaculture or transgemc bacteria to bioremediation, are likely to be hindered, a.~ m other countries dis\u00ad cussed in this report. Partially, th1s 1s due to the Japanese public's dis\u00ad trust of biotechnology and partially because of d1e uncertain federal regulatory situation in Japan. Similarly, overly strict regulations are likely to form barriers to the development of cell culture systems based on transgenic marine org.mmns to produce specialty chenucals for human or animal conswnption.

Marine Biotechnology in Japan (An Assessment for the National Science Foundation and the N~tLon.al OceJnic and Atmmphenc Admilllstntion). OZCOM !HE fUlURE OF MARINE 8101ECHNOLOGY The-\\Vorld's oceans cover more than 70% of the earth, but knowledge of this stgnificant component of the environment i~ rela\u00ad tively incomplete, compared to that available for the terrestrial sphere. Water, vital for life on the planet, drives many important processes, both geological and biological. The oceans, for example, moderate climate, and store COr The oceans also are important sources of food, mmerals, and natural products. Unfortunately, it is often assumed that the oceans have an unlimited capacity to absorb the wa~te<i of civilization, an assumption proving faulty as data are gathered on the extent and effects of pollution, especially on the world fisheries. In view of the need for information on the marine environment, it is not surpnsing that the age of biotechnology, which began in the early 1970s a.nd, now, twenty years later, has reached revolutionary proportions, stems from experiments done with terrestrial microorganisms, plants and ammals, leaving the ma\u00ad rine aspects ofbiotcclmology unexplored and the diversity of science, marine microbiologists ap\u00ad plied some molecular genetics to the research in the early 1970s, but marine biologists in the early 1980s began to apply the methods of molecular biology more extensiVely. By the late 1980s, interest in biotechnology applied to marine organisms reached a critical level, measured by the number of publications in scientific journals on natural products alone. Simultaneously, a number of investigators lo- 319 320 THE GLOBAL CHALLENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY cited primarily in the U.S. and Japan bebran to descrilx- their work as ''marine biotechnology;\" following the semmal publications of Col\u00ad well (1983, 1984a,b). In retrospect, the mtcrcst of scientists in marine biotechnology w-J5 sparked primarily by the following charactcnstics of this new field: the unique phys1ology and metabolism of many manne or\u00ad gamsms, notably extremophiles, from hypothermal vents on the ocean floor, the fascinating and potentially conmletcially valuable com\u00ad pounds produced by marine organi~ms, some of which ex\u00ad hibit highly unusual chemical stmcrure and intriguing bioac\u00ad tive properties, the ease v.rith which eggs of fish and shcll.6sh can be trumipu~ lated and the results of marupulation observed, especially for commercially important species, the IX'tcnrial for exploiting the world oceans, notably diverse biological habitat~. such as the coral reefS, without detrimental environmental effect, i.e., by utilizing molecular genetic methods to tap the genetic diveNity through gene cloning, tissue culture, and cell manipulation methods. Thus, manne biotechnology is experiencing significant growth in many countries of the world, especially those that traditionally have-depended on the sea for food and tOod product~. Besides work in the U.S., exciting marine biotechnology research and develop\u00ad ment is taking place in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy; Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, the United King\u00ad dom, and other countnes. However, both rime and funding restraints allowed detailed coverage of developments only for a few foreign countries and, of these. the most important is Japan. Japan, with its limited land mass and terrestrial resources, very naturally has directed its Impressive sCJentific assets to the mvestiga~ A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAlJA, AND No<\\wAY 321 tion of the seas that surround the country, to seek out new resources that may be profitably exploited under envuonmentally sound con\u00ad ditions, and to remediate the effects of land-source pollution. The effort that the Japanese are investing m marine biotechnology is ad\u00ad mirable and the results they have achi(.>Ved to date are impressive. Both the Japanese government and the industrial sector of Japan realized the importance of the marine environment for economic progress and under<;tood very quickly its value, which goes beyond 51mply promoting aquaculture and fisheries. The data indicate that Japan spent circa $357 million to $519 million in 1992 on marine biotechnology research and development; a sum that ha~ mcreased every year since then. About 800/o of this funding is supplied by in\u00ad dustry, in contrast to the current U.S. invt.-sonent pattern where gov\u00ad ermnent funding predonnnates. However, the Japanese government provides significant indirect support of industry in the form of spe\u00ad dal tax advantages, loan programs, well-funded schemes for indus\u00ad cry-university cooperation in R&D, and regwnal pmmotional activi\u00ad ties. The major areas of emphasis selected by the Japanese for re\u00ad search and development are aquaculture, marine natural products, and biosensor<~, although investments in envimnmental applications are increasing rapidJy. As a con~equence of the significant scientific research and de\u00ad velopment that the Japanese have accomplished to date, with a sharp focus on discovenng new marine natural products, significant dis\u00ad coveries have already been made. We predict that 10-15 years from now, results from these discoveries will include a cascade of new drugs derived from marine organisms and developed by Japanese sci\u00ad entists. These will appear in Western pharmacies and will be used to treat a wide range of infectious and non-infectious diseases, includ\u00ad ing cardio-vascular diseases, cancers, immunological disorders, and bacterial, fungal and viral diseases. In addition, it is highly probable that Japan vvill be the world's major source ofbiosensoN for medi\u00ad cine and environmental monitoring. A smaller commercial market, in comparison to pharmaceuticals, but, neverthdess, of importance to the U.S. in terms of balance of trade, Japanese aquaculture will benefit significantly from marine biotechnology applications, espe-322 THE GLOBAl CHALLENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLCX>Y cially those related to preventing\" and treating diseases of finfish and shellfish and marketing generically improved finfish and shellfish species. In addition to fishenes biotechnology, Japanese snentlst~ are focussing on a& ... ances biological oceanography, e<ipecially the role of plankton and picoplankton m the world oceans and their etTect on global climate. This work IS significant and will offer benefit'> by the 21st century, particularly to international efforts aimed at im\u00ad proving the environment. Based on our study of mannc biotechnology m Japan, we be\u00ad lieve that nation will continue promoting its marine potential. Fur\u00ad thermore, mvestment of capital from private industry will be a major factor in its successful development of new producb.. The Japanese effort is to be applauded because it will generate valuable scientific mformation and new knowledge, which will ass1st the Japanese m combatting their own marine pollution problems, and also elucidate oceanographic and atmmpheric phenomena related to global prob\u00ad lems, such as the greenhouse effect and global climate. It is possible that, as a result of the resources that Japanese busmess and govern\u00ad ment sectors are inve!>ting in marine biotechnology, by 2010 Japan\u00ad e~e scientists will be among the world leaders in manne biological and physical scientific research and development. In addition to basic research advances, the return on the invest\u00ad ment in marine biotechnology will yield products of genuine value for Japanese aquaculture and their pharmaceutical and chenucal in\u00ad dustries. These successes can be predicted to occur in the mid-term, i.e., within five or ten years, and they will enhance Japan's industrial output, im.-reasing the power of that country's already impressive and highly competitive commercial prowess. To sum up the status of marine biotechnology in Japan, during tht: past decade Japan has ardently encouraged marine biotechnology at both the national and local levels. The approaches ofJapan and the U.S. towards promoting marine b10technology arc dissimilar. Whereas the United States' approach has been to support basK re\u00ad search in areas of manne biotechnology, Japan uses a more focussed, developmental approach. Since one of the primary tenants of marine biotechnology is potential utiliu.tion, and not just exploration and research for knowledge, Japanese industry will possess the world's A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSTlWJA, AND NooWAY o 323 most advanced capab1lities in many manne b10technology applica\u00ad tions, particularly marine natural products development, marine biotechnology to enhance aquaculture, biological oceanography, and biosemors. As has been observed: \"The Japanese are now repeating their successful accomplishments in the field of electromcs in the novel field of marine btotechnology\" (Gibor, 1991). Marine biotechnology in Australia and Norway can be predict\u00ad ed to provide advances that are likely to have significant national economic effect and will mcrementally increase sctentific knowl\u00ad edge, in general. For example, Australian investigaton are probing their spectacular coastal zone, including the coral reelS, and can be expected to discover a range of manne ~edes capAble of producmg chemically unique, biologtcally active substances. It can be predicted that some of these compounds will be useful as medicinal agents, generating profits for their developel\"i. However, the conunercia] cli\u00ad mate m Australia, which tends to be risk avm1vc, does not appear to be conductve to the type of imaginative, long-term programs re\u00ad qmred w bring the results from marine biotechnology research to the market. Therefore, most such products are likely to be exploited with the aid of affiuent foreign companies. Based on their achievements to date, Norwegian scientists will join the front ranks of research and development in targeted areas, e.g., transforming wastes from aquaculture and fisheries into useful products, such as animal feed, industrial enzymes, and specialty chemicals. The aquaculture industry in Norway, already the world's largest, will be positioned to utilize marine biotechnology-derived diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to improve its fisheries output, thereby becoming even more efficient and competitive in seafood markets worldwide. However, in v1ew of predictable market condi\u00ad tions from increasing supply, as well as increasing competition from the growmg aquaculture industry m developing coWitries, improve\u00ad ments to Norway's aquaculture will have to become more cost ef\u00ad fective and technologically efficient to remain at the forefront of seafood production. An ancillary effect of the growth and development of Norwe\u00ad gian aquaculture is growth of other types of companies, i.e., those that offer services and product:s useful to aquaculcure. These will be 324. THE GLOSAL CHALlENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOlOGY in a powerful position to compete m sectors of the mtcrnational market comprismg marine animal feed, diagnostics and therapeutics. These sectors are relatively small, but arc potentully lucrative and serve as entry-pomts for smaller biotechnology-based compames, which are likely to be a base of major econormc development 111 the 21st century. This study was not tnitiated with the intent of pmviding com\u00ad plete details of international progress in rnarine biotechnology, a di\u00a3:. ficult task, in view of the many research units throughout the world that now arc active in this field (see Appendix 4). Instead, selected important component.~ of the international marine biotechnology community have been highlighted. But we would be remiss if we did not mention two development!> in international science promot\u00ad ing marine biotechnology by informing a wider audience of scien\u00ad tists about exciting research taking place within the field and clarify\u00ad ing to the public and its representatives its benefits. First, a series of major international marine biotechnology conferences have been convened, the first in Tokyo, in 1989, and the second in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1991. The third international marine biotechnology conference was held in Bergen, Norway in 1994. Second, as a sequel to a World Bank report on marine biotechnology and the develop\u00ad ing countries (Zilinskas and Lundin, 1993}, the World Bank, United Nations Development Program and United Nations Industrial De\u00ad velopment Organization sponsored the first of what v.rill be a series of regional conferences, which was held during November 1993 in Bangkok, Thailand. Its focus was on the possibilities offered by ma\u00ad rine biotechnology for the Asian-Pacific nations. The greatest im\u00ad pact is expected in the short to medium-term to be on aquaculture and natural pmducts development. Emergence of manne biotechnology in the U.S. has occurred m two phases, with a third on the horizon. Initiating the first phase, a small number of U.S. scientists, working largely in isolation and sup\u00ad ported by only a few funding agem...ies, recognized the importance of marine biotechnology m the late 1970s and early 1980s. A signifi\u00ad cant contribution, which led to exciting scientific achievements, was to adopt the then recently developed molecular biology techniques A REPORT ON THE u.s., JAPAN AUSTRAliA, AND NOI!WAY 325 to manne biology. Soon a larger number of bioscientists. recognized the many research possibilities the manne environment presented and proceeded to take advantage of these opportunities, which led to an initial spmt of growth in manne biotechnology R&D. During the fint phase. a small marine biotechnology center wa.'\\ founded in North Carolina, but focussed on data storage and dtssemination. Two rese:an;h centers dedicated to marine biotechnology subsequently were established, the first in Maryland and, shortly afterward\", a sec\u00ad ond m California. Both of these centers flourished inm1ediately, with rapid growth ensuing. In the late 1980s, a transition from the first phase mto the sec\u00ad ond occurred. The term \"marine biotechnology\" began to appear, not only in scientific publications, but also in policy-related docu\u00ad ments and government publications. The number of publications in the field of marine biotechnology increased significandy, in some ar\u00ad eas eight to ten-fold from the early 1980s to the early 1990s. Man\u00b7ne Biotechnology Abstracts wa~ first published in 1989 and has doubted in s1ze of the publication. Two additional journals dedicated to marine biotechnology were launched, one in the U.S. and the other m Japan. Several other JOurnals covermg closely related fields, e.g., ma\u00ad rine biodiversity and biological oceanography. and biotechnology applications have been founded m the last five years. Diverse books with marine or aquatic biotechnology included in their content or wholly or partially devoted to manne biotechnology have been published recently. Despite these developments, as evidenced by MARBIO data, funding for marine biotechnology in general remained essentially level during 1991 and several of the preceding yem. Furthermore, most of the academic and industry scientists mterviewed dunng the time MARDIO was in development expressed a belief that the funding situation would not improve in the nnrned.iate future. In\u00ad dustry interest and, more importantly, invesnnent in marine biotec-h\u00ad nology in the United States was meager, compared to US. invest\u00ad ment m biotechnology over-alL As indicated by MARBIO data, to\u00ad tal funding for marine biotechnology research by the federaJ govern\u00ad ment, state governments, and industry was circa $40 million m 1992. 326 THE GlOBAL OiAu.ENGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY For purposes of comparison, this total equaled c1rca 7% to 11 ').1, of what the japanese spent on research in this fidd. Shortage of fi.md~ m the U.S. hindered marme bioteclmology from achievmg sive grov.\"th as occurred m other area.~ ofbiotedmology. During the second phase of development in marine biotech\u00ad nology, some observers of science voiced concerns about the safety of marine biotechnology. However, after careful analysis and taking into account controvernes associated with release of genetically en\u00ad gineered orgamsms to the environment, we conclude that i~~ues re\u00ad lated to biosafety have not been a barrier to the advancement of ma\u00ad rine biotechnology. In fact, to the contrary, procedures already devel\u00ad oped to ensure safety in other biotechnology research can be applied directly to marine biotechnolob')'\u00b7 As mdicated by concerns ex\u00ad pressed by envuonmental groups m 1990, prior to testing of trans\u00ad genic carp in dosed facilities in Alabama, the prospect of open field testing of transgenic marine organisms is expected to result in public debate. As occurred in other areas of biotechnology, .~orne industries will defer from making investment<> in marine biotechnology, espe\u00ad cially in development of transgenic marine organisms (see below), pending resolution of safety issues. Several states began making major mvcstments in marine biotechnology during the second phase. The two first significant marine biotechnology research centers, m Maryland and California, have grown significantly in size and importance. The North Caroli\u00ad na center, which langmshed for some years, finally developed into a full-fledged, state-wide marine biotechnology program. A fourth major center, concentrating on marine natural product<> develop\u00ad ment, was established in 1993 at the University of California at San Diego, and is active in promoting marine biotechnology in that state. Long established marme research centers, such as Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Florida and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, have expanded their programs to in\u00ad dude marine biotechnology and related areas. Other coa.-.tal states are augmenting the1r mvestment<; in the marine biological sciences, either by promoting the growth of department<> in universities that already are active in the marine field, expanding the scope of existing A REPORT ON THE U.S., JAPAN AUSl>AUA, #ID NoRWAY 327 traditional ocean sciences centers. or establishmg new marme biotechnology centers. Despite s1gnificant advances in marine biotechnology research, some of which has produced results leading to significant applica\u00ad tions, U.S. industry has not played a major role in marine biotech\u00ad nology m the second phase. In fact, the survey of U.S. companies conducted as part of our analysis revealed that, by 1992, abou{ 80 companies were dedicated to marine biotechnology or sponsored marine biotechnology R&D, either m-house or extramurally. The analys1s of data stored in MARBIO showed that most of the effort by mdustry wa~ devoted to natural products development. Neverthe\u00ad lf'SS, it is a notable achievement that three pharmacological agents derived from marine biotechnology are in clirucal trial, in one case, showmg activity against tumors, in another, an ability to inhibit v:iru~es and, in third, efficacy in the treaonent of psoriasis. Approxi\u00ad mately five additional compounds have shown good promise and are in pre-clinical trial. In contrast to natural products development, the aquaculture industry in the U.S. is essentially nascent, with a need for s1gnificant technological advanc<.-ment to develop to its fullest capac\u00ad ity. It can be postulated that at least tluee reasons explain the appar\u00ad ent indifference of U.S. industry towards marine biotechnology. First, marine biotechnology 1s unknown, or nearly so, to many finru. Consequences of this lack of knowledge are that these companies are not in a position to consider entering this new field and, for most companies, marine biotechnology, at best, is relatively unknown. with the perception of the working environment of marine biotech\u00ad nology as being fraught with dlfficulties, since ocean resources have htstorically been viewed as being difficult to discover and, even when located, reqmring strenuous efforts to exploit on a dependable and sustainable basis. Further, companies may be aware only of the relative low technological level of 111dfine biology that existed previ\u00ad ously, before the advanced techniques made possible by molecular biology and genetics were applied to marine-related biological re\u00ad search. Therefore, as explamed in the body of this report, only a comparatively few companies appear to be comfortable in marine-328 THE GlOBAL (HAUENGE Of MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY related research and development. Even these companies often J.Te unaware of the truly rich commercial potential of marine biotech\u00ad nology, especially in new product development. Second, most applications within the six areas of marine biotechnology identified tn this report will come to fruition only in the mid-term, at best, and, more likely, in the longer term. US. com\u00ad panies, especially the smaller bioindustrics, tend to do their planning in three to five year cydes, thereby excluding many research direc\u00ad tions, e<>pecially in the long range, high risk category. Third, while we noted that the biosafety issue has not affected the advance of marme biotechnology research significantly, uncer\u00ad tainties remain with respect to development and production, e~pe\u00ad cially for future field testing related to transgemc marme fish, plants and microorganisms and the safety of such product~ m human nutn\u00ad tion. Until these uncertainties are eliminated, most companies will hesitate to make a long-term commitment to bring findings from marine biotechnology to the market. However, at the same time, it would be unwise and unproductive to revisit all the issues addressed by the National Research Council report (United States National Resean:h Council, 1989) and OECD (Directorate for Science, 1992) (Cancloy, 1994). Manne biotechnology in the U.S. appears pnmed to enter a third phase, likely to be characterized by significant and rapid grov.1h. This conclusion is based, in part, on the expectation that the U.S. Senate is likely to join the U.S. House of Representative~ and adopt the Marine Biotechnology Investment Act of 1993, described m Chapter 3, thus making available significant new funding ($20 million per year for the first two years) to scientists m both private and public research institutes and laboratories. This will, without doubt, correct in part the problem of under-funding of this field as reported by FCCSET and revealed by MARBIO data. We can expect new mitiatives in marine biotechnolq,oy R&D, much of which will be of value to industry. However, the intent of the Marme Biotechnology Investment Act would be greatly enhanced if a national effort de\u00ad signed to produce marine biotechnology products and processes were launched. Such an effort will produce a far greater return to A REPORT et-1 THE U.S., JAPAN AuSTRAUA, AND NORWAY 329 <;ociety than the uncoordinated process currently operating. Fundmg by Congress of the 1980 National Aquaculture Act would promote such a national effort. From the study of marine biotechnology-related industry de\u00ad scribed in this report, four major developments can be predicted in tht\u00b7 third phase. First, aquaculture will become mcreasingly impor\u00ad tant m the U.S. as technological advancement, particularly applica\u00ad tion of molecular techniques, allows this industry to expand signifi\u00ad cantly. Hoth basic research and industrial development of marine biotechnology, will be needed if innovations, such as closed system production for domestic aquaculture, is to be economically feasible, which it certainly can be, as demonstrated by profitable systerm op\u00ad erating in Israd,Ja.pan, and Norway. Second, the most significant impact, in the short term, may prove to be marine b10remediation. Chemical and physical methods presently are methods of choice, but only for the short term. Biore\u00ad rnediation companies will rely on naturally nccurnng nticroorgan\u00ad LSillS, some nf which will be developed for greater efficiency using classical methods for breeding and selection, in the mitial phase of development of this industry. Availability of genetically engmeered marine microorganisms designed specifically for bioremediation of estuaries. ncar shore, open coast and deep \\Vater areas of the world oceam will open new vistas for pollution remediation of the marine environment, not only oil spills, but also other toXIc pollutants reach\u00ad ing the open ocean. A~ noted in Chapter 5, risk assessments schemes applicable to the marine environment and field tests of transgenic marine microorganisms are required before applications useful to the remediation industry can become reality. Third, with development of tmproved screening methods for detecting a wider variety of potentially useful properties of marine orgamsms, more companies will be attracted to invest in R&D de\u00ad rived from ba.~ic research m marine biology and molecular marine biology, a.~ well as natural products chenustry. It is envisioned that co\u00ad operative projects that partner indu~try and unive~ities will increas\u00ad ingly be undertaken. Comparues other than those interested solely in human drug development will enter mto new endeavors, for exam-330 THE GLOBAL (HAUfNGE OF MARINE BIOTECHNOL<X>Y pie, chemical companies useful a_~ pes\u00ad ticides, food prescrv.1tion foregoing three pract1caJ development:> will be ac\u00ad companied by an equally important, if a less tangiblt\" advance, name\u00ad ly, the present knowledge of marine ecosystems, and their complexi\u00ad ty and biodiversity, will expand greatly as the techmques of mann(' biotechnology are applied to the study of marine ecology and bio\u00ad logical oceanography As a result, we will gam a better understanding of how the oceans influence the weather, of the sy<;temic effects of pollutants on the env1ronment, of the life cycles and movements of pelagic fi~h. of the complex communities of manne populatmns such as those existing on and about coral reef~ and e~tuarie'>, and of other important marme phenomena. There IS no question hut that marine biotechnology has great potential. Perhaps the full flowering of that potential will be realized when its techniques arc seamk-ssly integrated in the bast of activities that constitute coastal zone development and marine resource uti\u00ad lization. A pictorial representation of such an integration is reflected in Figure 23, where employment of biosmson to complement re\u00ad mote sensing instrumentation installed on buoys and satellites, the use of bioremcdiation to restore waters in and around sensitive coastal environs and valuable man-made structures; application of di\u00ad agnostics and therapeutic~ made possible by molecular biology to promote largely non-polluting aquaculture; aquaculturing of a larger variety marine animals and plants than IS now possible or practicable, at times integrated with the operation of ocean thermal energy con\u00ad versJOn (OTEC) systems, to make available for markets a wider vari\u00ad ety of ta.~ty and nutritious food-.; and growth of pharmaceutical and specialty chemical mdustries based on compounds and chemicals of marine origin. Fortunately, this potential inherent to marine biotechnology 1s now beginning to be realized-with soc1ety the benefactor and the recipient of the wealth of the ocean's resources.
