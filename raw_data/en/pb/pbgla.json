As of January 1, 2014, HCBS services including EW services will have three distinct provider service options (previously called tiers) as indicated in Appendix 5.

For MHCP Enrollment Required ( Tier 1 ) services, the MCO shall utilize MHCP enrolled EW Providers, which may include enrolled counties and any of the MHCP contracted enrolled providers that provide vendor Fiscal/Employer Agent Financial Management Services ( FMS ) . The MCO will be notified of the MHCP enrolled Providers through the monthly PECD file . If the MCO identifies a provider who is not MCHP enrolled, the MCO may assi st the non- enrolled P rovider in becoming an MCHP enrolled Provider. (a) Contracted model: MCO may develop contracts and negotiate rates with MHCP Enrollment Required Services ( Tier 1 ) MHCP enrolled providers. The MCO must provide notice in writing to the c ontracted P rovider who will be utilized in the MCO's network, and provide written information needed for the Provider to deliver and bill for EW services at the State established rate or at a negotiated rate. (b) Open a ccess model: MCO may use the entire netwo rk of MHCP enrolled providers and pay these providers on a non- Network basis. If paying on a non- Network basis, the MCO must pay at least the FFS rates published by the State. If using an open access model for FMS services, t he MCO must use all FMS vendor s who are enrolled in MHCP . (c) Mixed model: MCO may use a contracted network for some Provider types and open access for other provider types. In such a model, MCO must clearly indicate to Enrollees how to gain access to providers through a provider direct ory consistent with section 3.6.6(C) ; for provider types available through open access, MCO must indicate that there are no restrictions other than MHCP enrollment.

However, if the MCO opts to use a non- enrolled Direct -Delive ry Services (Tier 2 ) or Purchased Items Services (Tier 3) service provider, the MCO must assure that the provider is qualified according to STATE standards to deliver services. The MCO may not impose additional service stan dards on non- enrolled providers . The MCO must maintain a record of non- enrolled Direct -Delivery Services (Tier 2) and Purchased Items Services ( Tier 3 ) providers that it has determined to be qualified to deliver services. The STATE will provide guidance on Direct -Delivery [ MCO NAME ] 2017 MSHO/MSC+ Contract Page 219 Services ( Tier 2) and Purchased Items Services ( Tier 3 ) non- enrolled provider review and required documentation. Counties and tribal human service agencies may deliver any Direct -Delivery Services ( Tier 2 ) or Purchased Items Services ( Tier 3 ) service. Authorizatio n may be required for Direct -Delivery Services ( Tier 2 ) and Purchased Items Services ( Tier 3 ) services that are provided by the county/tribal agency or provided by a non -enrolled provider in a \"pass -through\" capacity. The MCO may develop a contract with a willing county or counties to submit claims to the MCO for Enrollees using Direct - Delivery Services ( Tier 2 ) and Purchased Items Services ( Tier 3 ) providers for whom the county has agreed to act as this pass -through entity. Waiver Obligations.

Risk Adjustment Methodology. To account for variation in risk for the costs of EW services among Enrollees, the STATE will calculate an MCO -specific risk score for the E W add -on rate, on an annual basis. Development of Factors. The STATE developed initial 2017 risk factors using individual data on costs and characteristics of EW recipients from MCO -submitted 2014 and 2015 EW service costs and demographic information available in the STATE's MMIS system. Blended 2017 risk factors were developed by blending the risk factors based on 2014 data (using 50% weight) and risk factors based on 2015 data (using 50% weight ). The ble nded 2017 risk factors are normalized for budget neutrality based on the calendar year 5 distribution of members by Area, Age Group and ADL Group. The final contract year risk factors are: Age Group Area ADL Group Final Risk Factor 65 to 74 Metro Low; 0 to 3 ADLs 0.7210 75 to 84 Metro Low; 0 to 3 ADLs 0.7799 85 and above Metro Low; 0 to 3 ADLs 0.8388 65 to 74 Metro Medium; 4 to 6 ADLs 0.8762 75 to 84 Metro Medium; 4 to 6 ADLs 1.0534 85 and above Metro Medium; 4 to 6 ADLs 1.3854 65 to 74 Metro High; 7 to 8 ADLs 1.0216 75 to 84 Metro High; 7 to 8 ADLs 1.1298 85 and above Metro High; 7 to 8 ADLs 1.5523 65 to 74 Non-Metro Low; 0 to 3 ADLs 0.4933 75 to 84 Non-Metro Low; 0 to 3 ADLs 0.5587 85 and above Non-Metro Low; 0 to 3 ADLs 0.7090 65 to 74 Non-Metro Medium; 4 to 6 ADLs 1.3704 75 to 84 Non-Metro Medium; 4 to 6 ADLs 1.5938 85 and above Non-Metro Medium; 4 to 6 ADLs 1.8313 65 to 74 Non-Metro High; 7 to 8 ADLs 1.9775 75 to 84 Non-Metro High; 7 to 8 ADLs 2.3613 85 7 to 8 ADLs 2.7462 2017 MSHO/MSC+ Contract Calculation of Annual MCO Elderly Waiver Risk Scores The MCO's risk score for the Contract Y ear are based on a Enrollee roster derived from paid managed care capitation claims , consistent with section 4.2.13(A)(2)(a) . The Area, Age Group, and ADL Group factors for each EW recipient will be derived from the MMIS Data Warehouse claims and LTCC Screening document tables consistent with section 4.2.13(A)(2)(a).
