Meaning it is just for 1 person at a time. The option for a couple or two friends is also available. Ayurveda & Yoga are holistic forms of wellness. During our week together you will feel educated, empowered, and LIBERATED by this deep dive toward healing. Styles Skill Level Food FREE Gifts (if you book with BookRetreats.com) Ayurveda brings us back to nature, it reminds us of the natural elements; earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These elements live inside of us as well as within everything around us. Discovering how to keep these elements in balance is the key to feeling our best every day, being strong in our health, and being clear within our mental state. - Come back to the spiritual and emotional wellbeing you want to live with - Rediscover yourself after too long of feeling disconnected - The ideal location to unplug and enjoy the beauty of nature - A place where you can care for yourself without distractions Ayurveda is a feminine form of medicine. Masculine medicine looks at \"whats wrong? Lets fix it\". Feminine medicine looks at everything that is going on in our lives, what was happening when imbalance began, who are we, what is our lifestyle? During your stay, you will undergo an ayurvedic cleanse known as Virechana. Each day you will recieve a detox massage with medicinal oils after morning yoga and before lunch. After lunch, you will have free time to enjoy the beach, relax or go on additional excursions. Your energy levels will not be compromised during this cleanse and you will have full energy to enjoy the area. Some days we will share extra practices based on your needs and desires. These could take place at the beach, a waterfall or at your accommodation. It is highly recommended to undergo a kitchari cleanse during your time here to increase the bodies ability to cleanse. Kitchari is the mixing of 2 grains (mung beans and basmati rice) made with vegetables and Ayurvedic spices. This is optional and you also have the option to Kitchari cleanse for anywhere from 1-5 days. [Kayla Johnson](/teacher/kayla-johnson-1) An Ayurveda Practitioner, Therapist, and Yoga teacher.

It was complete bliss! I can't wait to see how our connection evolves and how our paths next cross... KatiePosted a year ago on BookRetreats The retreat was perfect.
