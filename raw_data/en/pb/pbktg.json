Description Because phase II liver detoxification requires specific nutrients to continue operating, access to these nutrients can become depleted and ultimately reduce your detox efficiency. Additional toxins from your environment can also place a high demand on phase II detoxification. P2 Detox Balance is formulated to help prepare the liver for phase II detoxification. It does not contain botanicals, minerals, or B vitamins that would also upregulate phase I detoxification, which may result in intermediate metabolites that could cause sensitivity reactions. Providing nutritional support for phase II detoxification helps conjugate toxins and prepare them for safe elimination from the body.** Vegan. ** These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
