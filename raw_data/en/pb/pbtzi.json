When we talk about \"preventative\" care, we don't just mean the importance of getting regular adjustments. What we put into our bodies is just as important as the way we care for them physically, and that includes vitamins and nutrients. Here at Grovetown Chiropractic, there's almost no supplement we're more likely to recommend that vitamin C, and not just for standard immune-boosting benefits you might be used to. Here are a few of the lesser known benefits of vitamin C, how much you should really consider taking, and the easiest ways to make sure you're getting enough. Vitamin C Beyond The Immunity Boost Vitamin C is one of the most readily available and well-known supplements on the market. Most people are at least mildly aware of products like \"Emergenc-C\" or similar dissolvable products that can help speed up recovery when they're sick. But that's not all it's good for! Also referred to as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is an antioxidant powerful enough to impact everything from our bones and skin to blood vessels and other connective tissues. Because vitamin C helps the body absorb iron better, its impact goes far beyond getting over the common cold. These are just a few of the research-backed benefits of vitamin C: - Healthier immune functions by encouraging the production of white blood cells. - Enhanced connective tissue strength creating stronger, healthier bones. - Lowers \"bad\" cholesterol. - Reduce the risk of chronic conditions including heart disease. - Helps brighten and cleanse our skin. - Helps prevent iron deficiency. - Improved metabolic function. - Guards against dementia and [memory loss](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6842805/)as we age. - Helping cuts or wounds [heal faster](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297506). Getting Your Daily Dose Vitamin C is generally considered one of the safest and most effective supplements available, so there's almost no reason not to make sure it's a part of your regular wellness care! While some experts suggest 75 to 120 milligrams per day as a recommended or effective daily allowance, the upper end of that spectrum can go as high as 2,000 milligrams. There are some side effects associated with \"megadoses\" of vitamin C, but they're uncommon and typically mild. So how do you make sure you're getting enough? Consider actively adding raw fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C into your diet. Grapefruits, oranges, mangos, broccoli, and peppers are a good place to start. Fermented veggies like sauerkraut and kimchi can also help provide the boost you're looking for if you enjoy the taste. And if you're feeling like you might not be getting as much as you need from breakfast, lunch, or dinner, supplements are a quick and easy way to effectively increase your vitamins C intake. While many are readily available, we're big fans of the [Power Pak](https://www.vitacost.com/trace-minerals-research-electrolyte-stamina-power-pak-lemon-lime) by Trace Minerals. This option has less sugar per-serving compared to some other solutions, and also includes powerful B vitamins and electrolytes for better energy and hydration. Natural and Effective The same way chiropractic adjustments are a natural and effective way to manage pain, what we put into our bodies has the same potential to be a natural and effective component of our overall wellness. If you've been thinking about adding vitamins or supplements to your diet, vitamin C is one of our favorite places to start. After all, staying healthy is always going to be easier than getting healthy. Still have questions? Let Dr. Seals answer them at your next appointment!
