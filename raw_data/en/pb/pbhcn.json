There's been some changes recently, they're asking for input on testing recommendations for Hepatitis C. I attached the HCV Guidelines which was just updated to recommend testing for pregnant women but I recommend infectious disease testing annually for all people but for children and adults receiving healthcare for a chronic condition to help identify an infectious disease at an earlier stage to mitigate problems.

Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection iii Pacific Northwest EPC Abstract Background : Prior reviews on hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection screening and treatment used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to inform its 2013 recommendation found interferon -containing antiviral therapies assoc iated with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates of 68 percent to 78 percent and an association between SVR after antiviral therapy and improved clinical outcomes. Interferon -containing regimens were associated with a high rate of harms. Since the prior reviews, interferon -containing antiviral therapies have been replaced by all -oral direct acting antiviral (DAA) regimens. Purpose: To systematically review the evidenc e on screening for HCV infection in asymptomatic adults and adolescents, including effects of DAA regimens and interventions to prevent mother -to-child transmission. Data Sources: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Ovid MEDL INE and ClinicalTrials.gov through February 2019 and manually reviewed reference lists . Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non -randomized trials, and cohort studies of HCV screening, antiviral therapy, and interventions to prevent mother -to-child transmission of HCV infection on SVR and clinical out comes; and cohort studies on the association between an SVR after antiviral therapy versus no SVR and clinical outcomes. Treatment studies focused on populations without cirrhosis who are more likely to be asymptomatic and identified by screening. Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data , and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality using methods developed by the USPSTF . Data Synthesis (Results): No study evaluated the benefits of HCV screening ve rsus no screening, or the yield of repeat versus one -time screening. Previously reviewed studies found that HCV screening mi ght be associated with negative psychological and social consequences, but had important methodological limitations; n o new studies were identified. One new study found similar diagnostic yield of risk -based and birth cohort screening, but it was retrospec tive and assumed perfect implementation of risk -based screening. Ten trials reported improvements in some quality of life and functional outcomes following DAA treatment c ompared with prior to treatment, but differences were small, studies were open -label, and there was no non -DAA comparison group. Forty -nine trials found DAA regimens associated with pooled SVR rates that ranged from 95.5 percent to 98.9 percent across genotypes; rates of serious adverse events (1.9%) and withdrawal due to adverse events ( 0.4%) were low . Seven trials reported SVR rates in adolescents with DAA therapy similar to those observed in adults . An SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased risk o f all-cause mortality (1 3 studies, pooled hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval [ CI] 0.28 to 0.5 6), liver mortality (4 studies, pooled HR 0.11, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27), cirrhosis (4 cohorts in 3 studies, pooled HR 0.36, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.40), and h epatocellular carcinoma ( 20 studies, pooled HR 0. 29, 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.3 8) versus no SVR, after adjustment for potential confounders. New evidence on interventions to reduce the Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection iv Pacific Northwest EPC risk of mother -to-infant transmission was limited and did not change the concl usion from the prior review that no intervention has been clearly demonstrated to reduce risk. Limitations: Most DAA trials were not randomized and did not have a non -DAA comparison group, almost all DAA trials relied on SVR as the main efficacy outcome, observational studies varied in how well they adjusted for confounders, and few studies evaluated the effectiveness of DAA regimens in adolescents. Conclusions: The USPSTF previously determined that HCV screening is highly accurate. Currently recommended all -oral DAA regimens are associated with very high SVR rates ( 95.5% to 98.9% across genotypes) and few harms relative to older antiviral therapies. An SVR after antiviral therapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with no SVR , after adjusting for potential confounders. Direct evidence on the benefits of HCV scr eening remains unavailable, and direct evidence on the effects of antiviral ther apy on clinical outcomes remains limited but indicates improved long -term outcomes .

Introduction and Background Purpose The purpose of this report is to systematically review the evidence on screening for hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection in asymptomatic adults and adolescents without known liver enzyme abnormalities. This report updates prior (2013) U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) reviews on screening for HCV infection1,2 and prenatal screening,2,3 and a comparative effectiveness review on antiviral treatments.4,5 Although prior reports focused on benefits and harms of screening and treatment in adults, this report expands the population to include adolescents. For treatments, this report focus es on currently recommended direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies and i nterventions to potentially reduce risk of mother -to-child transmission. It will be used by the USPSTF to update its 2013 recommendation on s creening for HCV infection in adults and potentially inform a new recommendation on HCV screening in adolescents. In 2013, the USPSTF reco mmended screening for HCV infection in adults at high risk for infection and recommended offering one -time screening for HCV infection in adults born between 1945 and 1965 (\"birth cohort\" screening) ( B Recommendation) .6 This recommendation represented a change from the prior (2004) USPSTF recommendation, which found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against HCV screening in adults at high risk for infection (I recommendation ); the 2004 USPSTF recommendation did not address birth cohort screening and recommended against HCV screening in persons not at increased risk ( D recommendation ).7 The USPSTF did not issue a recommendation specifically on prenatal HCV screen ing, but noted that antiviral therapies were contraindicated during pregnancy and found inadequate evidence that labor management and breastfeeding strategies in HCV -infected persons are effective at reducing risk for mother -to-child transmission. The basis for the change in the 2013 USPSTF recommendation was evidence that newer antiviral therapies are more effective than prior therapies in achieving the intermediate outcome of sustained virologic response (SVR) and evidence showing that SVR after antiv iral therapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes (all -cause and liver -related mortality and hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC] ), with few serious treatment -related harms that generally resolve after treatment discontinuation.6 The USPSTF also considered the prevalence of HCV infection in high -risk persons ( e.g., 50% in persons who inject drugs [PWID]) and in persons born betwee n 1945 and 1965 (3% to 4%), and modeling studies that indicated cost -effectiveness of the birth cohort screening strategy .8,9 The USPSTF found few serious adverse events with liver biopsy performed for the diagnostic evaluation of persons with HCV infection and noted that fewer biopsies were being performed due to the availability of accurate noninvasive tests for evaluating liver fibrosis. The USPSTF had previously found that screening tests are highly accurate for diagnosing HCV infection (overall sensitivity 94% and specificity 97%) .7 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 2 Pacific Northwest EPC Condition Background Condition Definition HCV is a sin gle-stranded, positive -sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus of the family Flaviviridae. HCV infection can range from mild and self -limited to a serious, lifelong illness that can result in cirrhosis, liver failu re, and HCC .10 In most cases (78% to 85%), acute HCV leads to chronic HCV.10 HCV is primarily acquired by exposures to infected blood, with injection drug use the strongest risk factor. In the U nited States, approximately 70 to 77 percent of HCV infections are caused by genotype 1 (subtypes 1a or 1b), 1 3 to 16 percent by genotype 2, 12 percent by genotype 3 , and less than 5 percent by genotypes 4, 5, or 6 combined .11,12 Prevalence and Burden of Disease /Illness HCV is the most common chronic bloodborne pathogen in the United States. The numb er of U.S. residents with past or current HCV infection (positive for anti -HCV antibody) is estimated at 4. 1 million (range 3.4 million to 4.9 million); of these, an estimated 2.4 million (range 2. 0 million to 2.8 million) are currently infected , defined as having HCV detectable in the blood (viremia ).10,13,14 Approximately three -quarters (78% to 85%) of those who test positive for anti - HCV antibody have chronic infection;10,15 those with anti -HCV antibody but no vir emia are considered to have cleared the infection. The estimated prevalence of chronic HCV infection during the years 201 3 to 2 016 was approximately 1.0 percen t (95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.8 to 1.1%).16 Persons born between 1945 and 1965 comprise approximately 27 percent of the U.S. population but account for approximately three -quarters of all HCV infection,16 and are at 6.0 - to 9.5-fold increased risk of having HCV infection compared with younger adults .17,18 Males are at increased risk for HCV infection compared with females (odds ratio [ OR] 1.6, 95% CI , 1.1 to 2.4), and non -Hispanic black persons are at increased risk compared with 62 other races/ethnicities (OR 1.6, 95% CI , 1.1 to 2.3) , excluding American Indian/Alaska Natives .18 American Ind ian/Alaska Natives, who are often not included in na tional seroprevalence surveys, have higher HCV -related mortality than non -Hispanic black persons.19 Reported cases of acute HCV infection increased approximately 3.5 -fold from 2010 through 201 6.20 After adjusting for under -ascertainment and under -reporting, an estimated to 140,600 new HCV s occurred in the U nited States in 2016.20 The in crease in acute HCV incidence has most impacted young, white PWID living in non -urban areas.21-23 Data also indicate an increase in the number of reproductive aged women (15 to 44 years of age) with HCV infection.24,25 An estimated 29,000 females with HCV infection give birth annually in the U nited States, resulting in 1,700 cases of infected infants.25 Trends in HCV epidemiology, prevalence, and incidence are discussed in more detail in Contextual Question 1 . Etiology and Natural History HCV infection is a leading cause of complications from chronic liver disease. The number of deaths due to HCV infection ranged from 18,650 to 19,629 from 2012 to 2015 (4.9 to 5.0 deaths/100,000) and decreased to 18,153 in 2016 (4.5 deaths/100,000) .20 Despite likely Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 3 Pacific Northwest EPC underestimation, HCV -related mortality exceeds mortality associated with 60 other national ly notifiable infectious con ditions combined .26 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , of every 100 persons infected with HCV, approximately 60 -70 will d evelop chronic liver disease, 5 to 20 will develo p cirrhosis over a period of 20 to 30 years, and 1 to 5 will die from the consequences of liver cancer or cirrhosis.27 HCV without cirrhosis is associated with worse quality of life and symptoms ( e.g., fatigue) comp ared with not having HCV infection .28-32 Other extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection include mixed cryogl oblinemias, non - Hodgkin lymphoma, type II diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease.33 The natural course of chronic HCV infection varies. Some patients with chronic HCV infection have only mild liver disease after decades of infection or never develop histologic evidence of liver disease .34 In other patients, inflammation and fibrosis of the liver may progress to cirrhosis, which can lead to end -stage liver disease or HCC . In persons with cirrhosis due to HCV infection, the annual incidence of HCC is 1 to 4 percent.35 Once cirrhosi s develops, patients have a much higher risk of death, and some may benefit from liver transplantation. Until recently, chronic HCV was the leading indication for liver transplantation in the U nited States.36,37 The number of HCV -related li ver transplants in the U nited States declined from a peak of 1 ,905 in 2014 to 1 ,535 in 2016.36 Well -established predictors of advanced fibrosis in those with chronic HCV infection include older age at infection, longer duration of infection, male sex, concomitant HIV or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and greater alcohol use .34,38,39 Other fact ors that may be associated with increased risk of fibrosis include insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, higher viral load, and the presence of certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA ) class II polymorphisms. Once a person develops advanced (METAVIR stage 3) fibrosis, the risk of progression to cirrhosis is around 10 percent per year.40 Estimating the proportion of patients in the general population with HCV infection who progress to cirrhosis is difficult because the time of acquisition is often unclear and important endpoints often do not occur until after decades of infection; in addition, reasons for the variability in progression are not completely understood.41 Six retrospective cohort studies of HCV -infected adults with known time of infection (based on an identified exposure, often to contaminated blood products during young adulthood) reported cirrhosis in 0 to 10 percent of patients after at least 10 years of followup.29,42 -48 Studies of community cohor ts estimate cirrhosis in an average of 7 percent of persons after 20 years of HCV infection, with rates about twice as high in clinical and referral cohorts .38,49 One study of females infected by contaminated batches of anti -D immunoglobulin in 1980 found that approximately 14 percent of those who remained viremic had cirrhosis after 35 years.50 Other studies suggest that progression to cirrhosis may accelerate after 20 years of chronic infection.47,51 Mother -to-child (vertical) transmission is believed to be the main route of HCV infection acquisition in chil dren. In a meta -analysis of the risk of vertical HCV infection, the pooled transmission rate was 5.8 percent among females with HCV monoinfection and 10.8 percent among those with HCV/HIV coinfection.52 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 4 Pacific Northwest EPC Risk Factors HCV is primarily acquired via percutaneous exposures to infected blood. The strongest risk factor for HCV infection is injection drug use. The prevalence of HCV infection in PWID varies widely depending on age, duration of injection drug use, and other fac tors (such as availability and use of needle exchange programs).53 Recent surveys of active PWID indicate th at approxima tely one third of those aged 18 to 30 year s are HCV -infected. Older PWID typically have a highe r prevalence (approximately 70% to 90%) of HCV infection.27 Although large population -based studies54-56 report independent associations between HCV infection and some high-risk sexual behaviors (multiple sexual partners, unprotected sex, and/or sex with a person infected with HCV infection or using injection drugs), the efficiency of transmission via sexual contact appears to be low; high-risk sexual behaviors may be a marker for unacknowledged drug use or other risk factors. Transfusions prior to 1992 are a risk factor for HCV infection but are no longer an important source of infection due to the implement ation of effective screening programs for donated blood.57,58 Rationale for Screening/Screening Strategies Screening for HCV infection in asymptomatic adults who have no history of liver disease or known liver enzyme abnormalities may ide ntify infected patients at earlier stages of disease, before they develop serious or irreversible liver damage. Studies estimate that around 50 percent (range 43 to 72 %) of persons in the United States with chronic HCV infection are unaware of their status .18,57 -60 Antiviral treatment , has become increasingly effective at achieving sustained aviremia (clearance of HCV infection) . Screening for HCV infection might also help prevent transmi ssion by decreasing high -risk injection drug use and ot her risky behav iors in those who test positive or through successful treatment of HCV,61 and could identify those who might benefit from hepatitis A or HBV vaccinations, alcohol cessation counseling, identification and management of extrahepatic manifestations, or other interventions. Screening is an important component of the National Academ ies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on eliminating HCV as a public health problem by the year 2030.62 Shorter -term goals of t he National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan are to increase the proportion of persons aware of their positive HCV infection status to 66 percent and to decrease the number of HCV -related deaths by 25 percent by the year 2020.63 Although prenata l HCV infection could identify infected females , a challenge is the lack of antiviral therapies proven to be effective for reducing risk of perinatal transmission and approved for use in pregnancy.1 Older antiviral therapies were contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic risks. D ue to the lack of d ata on saf ety of newer DAA regimens during pregnancy and breastfeeding , clinical practice guidelines do not recommend antiviral therapy during pregnancy .64,65 However, even in the absence of antiviral therapy proven to be safe and effective during pregnancy , identification of HCV infection during pregnancy could facilitate decision making around the management and use of interventions during labor and delivery or in the perinatal period that might reduce risk of perinatal transmission, and identify females who could benefit from antiviral treatment later and infants who should be tested for HCV infection. A potential alternative strategy for preventing mother -to-child transmission is identification and treatment of HCV infection prior to pregnancy.24 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 5 Pacific Northwest EPC Interventions/Treatment The goal of antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection is to prevent the long -term health complications associated with HCV infection, such as cirrhosis, hepatic decompe nsation, and liver cancer. However, i t is extremely difficult to design and carry out clinical trials long and large enough to provide direct evidence related to these outcomes. Th e SVR rate, typically defined as the proportion of patients who experi ence a decline in HCV RNA to undetectable levels 12 or 24 weeks following completion of antiviral tre atment, is the standard marker of successful treatment in clinical trials . Most studies now focus on SVR at 12 weeks. Long -term recurrence of hepatitis C viremia occurs in less than one percent of patients with an SVR at 12 or 24 weeks of therapy ; therefor e, an SVR is considered equivalent to a cured infection .66-68 Studies have consistently found an association between achieving an SVR after antiviral therapy and reductions in mortality, liver failure, and cancer, though such analyses are susceptible to residual confounding.69-72 A major advance in antiviral treatment for HCV infection has been the development and adoption of all-oral DAA regimens without interferon. Such regimens are associated with substantially higher SVR rates than previous antiviral regimens, shorter du ration of treatment (8 to 12 weeks instead of 24 to 48 weeks) , and improved tolerability.73 SVR rates with older antiviral regimens are shown in Table 1 . DAA regimens are highly effective for HCV genotype 1 infection, th e mo st common genotype in the United States and historically ass ociated with lower SVR rates when treated with interferon -only regimens. Given the rapid pace of development for HCV antiviral therapies, guidance for antiviral therapy for HCV is rapidly evolving (Tables 2 and 3).74 Several newer DAA regimens are pangenotypic,75 meaning that they are effective across all common genotypes , and most currently recommended regimens do not require use of rib avirin . Whereas antiviral therapy was previously reserved for patients with more advanced fibrosis, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) now recommend treatment for all patien ts with chronic HCV, except those with short life expectancies that cannot be remediated by treating HCV, by transplantation, or by other directed therapy.65 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently approved t hree HCV regimens for children 12 to 17 years of age (Table 4 ).76,77 Although HCV antiviral therapy has traditionally most frequently been administered in specialty settings, studies have demonstrated similar SVR rates without any negative impacts on safety in community -based and primary ca re settings.78,79 Recommendations regarding the d iagnostic workup and pretreatment assessment for HCV are also evolving. Whereas liver biopsy was previously recommended in all patients with HCV infection in order to determine the severity of fibrosis, the AASLD -IDSA guideline currently also recommends blood tests or transient elastography as noninvasive options for fibrosis assessment .65,74,80,81 Given the availability of noninvasive tests to stage HCV infection, rates of biopsy h ave declined substantially, though precise data on current biopsy r ates are lacking . Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 6 Pacific Northwest EPC Current Clinical Practice /Recommendations of Other Groups U.S.-based screening guidelines are summarized in Table 5 . All are consistent in recommending HCV screening in persons born between 1945 and 1965 and in persons with risk factors for HCV infection. Data on rates of birth cohort screening are limited, though a study of U.S. veterans found an increased rate of testing in this age group compared with other age groups.82 Guidelines from the European Association for the Study of the Liver ( EASL )83 and the World Health Organization ( WHO )84 are generally consistent with the above screening guidance . In 2017, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended against screening for HCV in adults not at elevated risk (including persons born between 1945 and 1965 or other birth cohorts ).85 The Canadian recommendation was based on the reasoning that most persons with HCV infection have risk factors that can be identified using risk -based guidelines. However, the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver recommends screening of high-risk persons and persons born between 1945 and 1975.86 The CDC87 and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists88 recommend offering HCV screening to pregna nt people with risk factors. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 7 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 2. Methods Key Questions and Analytic Framework This systematic review followed a standard protocol in accordance with USPSTF procedures.89 The scope and Key Q uestions (KQs) for this report were determined by the USPSTF and informed by evidence gaps identified from the prior reviews.1-3,5,90 Three additional contextual questions on recent epidemiologic trends in HCV infection, modeling analyses, and behavioral effects of current antiviral therapies were requested by the USPSTF . The KQs and Contextual Questions are shown below. Investigators created an analytic framework incorporating the KQs and outlining the patient populations, interventions, outcomes, and potential adverse effects , as well as the direct and indirect pathways from screening to health out comes (Figure 1). Key difference s between this report and the prior reviews are inclusion of ad olescents in addition to adults; evaluation of new all -oral, DAA regimens . We also removed previously reviewed questions on harms of l iver biopsy, given its reduced role in evaluation of patients with HCV infection , and on effects of counseling or immunizations in persons with HCV infection, given limited evidence and likely small magnitude of effects relative to antiviral treatments . This report focuses on ef fects of treatments in populations more likely to be identified by screening (i.e., asymptomatic and without advanced liver disease) , and excludes poor quality studies (e.g., cohort studies that did not perform statistical adjustment) that were included in prior USPSTF reviews. We di d not re -review the diagnostic accuracy of HCV screening, which the prior review found to be highly accurate.91 Key Questions 1a. Does s creening for HCV infection in pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents and adults without known abnormal liver enzyme levels reduce HCV -related mortality and morbidity or affect quality of life? 1b. Does prenatal screening for HCV infection reduce risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection? 2. What is the effectiveness of different risk - or prevalence -based methods for screening for HCV infection on clinical outcomes? 3. What is the yield (number of new diagnoses per tests performed) of one -time versus repeat screening or alternative screening strategies for HCV infection, and how does the screening yield vary in different risk groups? 4. What are the harms of screening for HCV infection (e.g., anxiety and labeling)? 5. What are the effects of interventions during labor and delivery or the perinatal period on risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection? 6. What is the effectivenes s of currently recommended antiviral treatments in improving health outcomes in patients with HCV infection?* 7. What is the effectiveness of currently recommended antiviral treatments in achievin g a SVR in patients with HCV infection?* 8. What are the harms of currently recommended antiviral treatments?* Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 8 Pacific Northwest EPC 9. What is the association between experiencing SVR following antiviral treatment and reduction in risk of HCV -related adverse health outcomes? * Subpopulati ons of interest for KQs 6, 7, and 8 include those defined by age, race/ethnicity, sex, drug use, receipt of medicatio ns for treatment of opioid use disorder , stage of disease, HCV genotype, and pregnancy status (including nonpregnant women of childbearing age). Contextual Questi ons Three Contextual Question s were also requested by the USPSTF to help inform the r eport. Contextual Questions are addressed by narratively summarizing key evidence; they are not reviewed using systematic review methodology. Based on population level estimates, what are recent trends in the epidemiology, prevalence, and incidence of HCV infection in the U nited States , including in primary care settings, over the past 5 to 10 years? What are the effects of different risk - or pr evalence -based methods for screening for HCV infection in modeling studies? What is the effect of antiviral treatments on behavioral outcomes? Search Strategies We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systema tic Reviews (through February 8, 2019 ), and Ovid MEDLINE ( 1946 through February 8, 2019 ) for relevant s tudies. Search strategies are available in Appendix A1. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing studies, and reviewed the reference lists of rele vant review articles and studies meeting inclusion criteria. We also carried forward studies in the prior USPSTF report that met inclusion criteria for this update.2,90 Study Selection Two reviewers independ ently evaluated each study to determine its inclusion eligibility based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria developed for each KQ (Appendix A2). The target population for sc reening was asymptomatic, pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years) and adults without prior HCV infection. For treatment, the target population was persons with HCV infection likely to be identified by screening. However, no trial enrolled screen -detected patients , and trials did not report presence of s ymptoms. To evaluate patients more likely to be asymptomatic and identified by screening, we restricted inclusion of antiviral treatment studies to those in which up to 20 percent of participants had cirrhosis at baseline . For antiviral regimens with few s tudies me eting this threshold and for studies on the association between SVR after antiviral therapy and clinical outcomes , we Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 9 Pacific Northwest EPC permitted a threshold up to 25 percent . We included studies of patients previously treated with interferon -based therapy (interferon or pegylated interferon with or without ribavirin) or boceprevir or telaprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin , because data indicate similar SVR rates in these treatment -experienced compared with treatment -naive patients .73 Included interven tions were HCV screening and alternative screening strategies ; mode of delivery, labor management strategies, and breastfeeding practices ; currently recommended (including alternative) DAA regimens for evaluation of clinical outcomes, SVR rates and harms ; and DAA regimen s or inte rferon -based treatment for evaluation of mortality and long -term clinical outcomes .74 For analysis of SVR rates, w e included studies in which ribavirin or dasabuvir was not used as recommended (e.g., ombita svir / paritaprevir / or used ribavirin for genotype 1b infection, or did not include dasabuvir f or genotype 1 inf ection ) (Tables 2 and 3), because SVR rates were similar to recommended regimens with these variations, but performed sensitivity analyses without them . For analysis of adverse events, we restricted inclusion to trials in which ribavirin was administered as recommended. DAA regimens were restricted to recommended doses and duration s. We excluded trials that focused on persons coinfected with HIV or HBV inf ection, transplant patients, or with advanced renal disease. For KQ s on screening and treatment, we included randomized trials. For questions on screening, perinatal (labor and delivery or breastfeeding) interventions, effects of DAA regimens on clinical outcomes, and the association between SVR after antiviral therapy and clinical outcomes, we also included cohort studies that report ed risk estimates adjusted for potential confounders. We included trials of current DAA regimens versus placebo, an older a ntiviral regimen, or another DAA regimen (including regimens not currently recommended). We also included trials of DAA regimens without one of these comparisons , because ther e were few comparative trials. C linical trials were defined as studies in which p atients were prospectively allocated to treatment by the study investigator using pre -defined inclusion criteria and followup methods. Included outcomes were mortality, morbidity (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver transplant, extrahepatic mani festations of HCV infection), quality of life, HCV transmission, harms (e.g., labeling, anxiety, drug -related and treatment -related harms), screening yield (number of new diagnoses per tests performed), and perinatal transmission. We restricted inclusion t o English -language articles , and we excluded studies published only as abstracts. Studies of non-human subjects were excluded , and studies had to report original data. The selection of literature is summarized in the literature flow diagram ( Appendix A3 ), and Appendix A4 provides a list of included studies. Appendix A5 lists excluded studies with reasons for exclusion. Data Abstraction and Quality Rating We constructed evidence tables summarizing the data from each study. One investigator abstracted details about the study design, patient population, setting, interventions, analysis, follow up, and results. A second inves tigator reviewed abstracted data for accuracy. Two investigators independently applied criteria developed by the USPSTF89 to rate the quality of each study as good, fair, or poor ( Appendix A6). Discrepancies were resolved through a consensus process . In accordance with the USPSTF Procedure Manual, we excluded studies rated poor quality due to important methodological shortcomings that severely undermine their Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 10 Pacific Northwest EPC reliability ;89 this applied to s tudies utilized in the prior USPSTF review that were rated poor quality and were excluded in the current report . Data Synthesis We performed a random effects meta -analysis to summarize the proportion of patients experiencing SVR and adverse events with current DAA regimens. We used a generalized l inear mixed effects model with a logit link, allowing the inclusion of studies in which the proportion of patients with the e vent were 0 percent or 100 percent . We combined arms of comparable interventions within the same study so each study was represente d once in a meta -analysis , in order to avoid overweighting . For SVR, we performed separate analyses for each genotype (1 through 6); for adverse events, results were pooled across genotypes. For SVR and adverse events, analyses were stratified according to DAA regimen. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed on geograp hic settings (U nited States or Europe, multinational, or other), fibrosis stage (cirrhosis excluded or some [up to 20% of patients] with cirrhosis), prior treatment status (na\u00efve or e xperienced to interferon -based therapies, boceprevir or telaprevir) , and qualit y. For SVR, w e performed sensitivity analysis by excluding studie s in which ribavirin or dasabuvir was not used as recommended . For analyse s of adverse events, we excluded trials of ribavirin - containing regimens except for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / is recommended for genotype 1b infection . We also performed a random effects meta -analysis of adjusted hazard ratios ( HRs) of SVR after antiviral therapy versus no SVR on clinical outcomes (mortality, liver -related mortality, cirrhosis, and HCC ) using a linear mixed effects model. In some cases the adjusted HR for SVR versus no SVR had to be calculated from other estimates (e.g., from adjus ted HRs for SVR and no SVR v s. no treatment). In these situations we calculated the adjusted HR for SVR versus no SVR based on the HRs for SVR versus no treatment and no SVR versus no treatment and th eir reported CI s, assuming a correlatio n of 0 be tween the two HRs. Because HRs are typically positively correlated, this assumption results in more conservative (i.e., wider ) CIs for the calculated HR. Subgroup analysis were p erformed on duration of study (5 years or less vs. more than 5 years) , geographic setting ( United States /Europe vs . Asia) and whether the study had full adjustment of confounding variables (age, sex, fibrosis stage and genotype) or did not adjust for one or more of these populations. We also performed sensitivity analysis b y excluding studies with po tential overlapping populations in order to ensure that results were not sensitive to double counting of patients. For all meta -analyses, statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the variance parameter of the random effects, the Cochran Q -test and I2 statistic .92 For pooled proportions of SVR and adverse events, the Cochran Q -test and I2 statistic were based on the Freeman -Tukey double arcsine transformed proportions.93 All meta -analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.) and forest plots were created using Stata/SE 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). We also conducted random effects meta -analysis on adverse events with DAA regimens versus placebo DAA regimens / 5.3.5 (the Nordic C ochrane Centre, Copenhagen). Analyses were stratified by DAA regimen. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 11 Pacific Northwest EPC There were too few trials evaluating these comparisons to conduct additional sensitivity or subgroup analyses . We assessed the aggregate internal validity (quality) of the body of evide nce for each KQ (\"good\", \"fair\", \"poor\") using methods developed by the USPSTF, based on the number, quality and size of studies, consistency of results between studies, and directness of evidence in the Summary of Evidence .89 We determined aggregate internal validity using the totality of evidence (new studies identified for the update plus studies carried forward from the prior USPSTF report). External Review The draft research plan was posted for public comment and modified prior to finalization. The draft report will be reviewed by content experts, USPSTF members, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Medical Officers, and collaborative partners , and will be posted for public comment . Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 12 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 3. Results A total of 7,170 new references from electronic database searches and manual searches of recently published studies were reviewed , and 700 full-text paper s were evaluated for inclusion. We included a total of 97 studies (reported in 94 publications). Eighty -four studies were newly identified as part of this update , and 13 were carried forward from the previous review. I ncluded studies and quality ratings are described in Appendix B . Key Question 1 a. Does Screening for HCV Infection in Pregnant and Nonpregnant Adolescents and Adults Without Known Abnormal Liver Enzyme Levels Reduce HCV -Related Mortality and Morbidity or Affect Quality of Life ? As in the prior USPSTF review, no study directly assessed effects of HCV screening versus no screening on clinical outcomes such as HCV -related mortality and morbidity or quality of life. Key Question 1 b. Does Prenatal Screening for HCV Infection Reduce Risk of Vertical Transmission of HCV Infection ? As in the prior USPSTF review, no study assesse d effects of prenatal HCV screening versus no screening on risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection. Key Question 2 . What Is the Effectiveness of Different Risk - or Prevalence -Based Methods for Screening for HCV Infection on Clinical Outcomes ? As in the prior USPSTF review, no study directly assessed the effectiveness of different risk - or prevalence -based methods for HCV screening on clinical outcomes. Key Question 3 . What Is the Yield (Number of New Diagnoses per Tests Performed) of One -Time Versus Repeat Screening or Alternative Screening Strategies for HCV Infection, and How Does the Screening Yield Vary in Different Risk Groups? Summary The prior USPSTF review included five studies that found screening strategies that targeted multiple risk facto rs associated with sensitivities of more than 90 percent and numbe rs needed to screen to identify one case of HCV infection of less than 20. More Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 13 Pacific Northwest EPC narrowly targeted screening strategies were associated wi th numbers needed to screen of less than two , but mis sed up to two -thirds of infected patients. One new study found that applying risk -based guidelines perfectly would result in 24.7 percent of the population tested and 82 percent of HCV cases identified (number needed to screen 14.6) , compared with 45 percent of the population tested and 76 percent of HCV cases identified with birth cohort screening (number needed to screen 28.7), but assumed perfect implementation of risk -based testing. Evidence The prior USPSTF review included five poor quality studies94-98 that found screening strategies that targeted multiple risk factors associated with sensitivit ies of more than 90 percent and number s needed to screen to identify one case of HCV infection of less than 20.2 More narrowly targeted screening strategies were asso ciated wit h numbers needed to screen of less than two , but missed up to two -thirds of infected patients. One new study that retrospectively applied screening criteria to patients in the 2003 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANE S) database compared the yield of risk-based HCV screening (based on then -current AA SLD guide lines) versus birth cohort screening.99 It found that applying risk -based guidelines perfectly would result in 24.7 percent of the general population tested and identify 82 percent of the HCV exposed po pulation, with a number needed to screen to identify one case of HCV infection of 14.6. Applying the birth cohort strategy would result in 45 percent of the general population tested and identify 76 percent of the HCV exposed population, with a number need ed to screen to identify one case of 28.7. Although this analysis suggests that the two strategies would identify a similar proportion of HCV infected persons , it would require perfect implementation of risk -based testing, which has not occurred in actual practice. No study evaluated the yield of o ne-time versus repeat screening, the yield of alternative screening strategies in different risk groups, or the yield of currently recommended screening (i.e., 1945 to 1965 birth cohort plus risk -based screening) versus expanded screening strategies. Studies that modeled effects of alternative screening strategies are addressed in Contextual Question 2. Key Question 4. What Are the Harms of Screening for HCV Infection (e.g., Anxiety and Labeling )? The prior USPSTF review included five studies31,100 -103 of perso ns with HCV infection that suggested potential negative psychological and social effects of screening, but the quality of evidence was assessed as poor due to small sample sizes and methodological shortcomings, included no unscreened comparison group, reli ance on retrospective recall, and poorly defined outcomes.2 All of the studies were conducted in the context of treatment with older interferon - containing regimens. No new study meeting inclusion criteria evaluated harms associated with HCV screening. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 14 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 5. What Are the Effects of Interventions During Labor and Delivery or the Perinatal Period on Risk of Vertical Transmission of HCV Infection ? Summary Five observational studies (four included in the prior USPSTF review) found no clear association between the mode of delivery and risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV infection , after adjustment for potential confounders. One observational study included in the prior USPSTF review found prolonged (longer than 6 hours) rupture of membranes associated with increased risk for H CV transmission versus less prolonged ( 6 hours or less ) rupture after adjusting for maternal demographic characteristics, HCV RNA level, intravenous drug use, and smoking status during pregnancy (adjusted OR 9.3, 95% CI, 1.5 to 180).104 No new study evaluated this association. One observational study included in the prior USPSTF review found internal fetal monitoring associated with increased risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV infection ver sus external monitoring, after adjustment for maternal demographic characteristics, HCV viral load, intravenous drug use history, and smoking status in pregnancy (adjusted OR 6.7, 95% CI, 1.1 to 35.9).104 No new study evaluated this association. Three observational studies (two included in the prior USPSTF review) found no clear association between breastfeeding and risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV infection after adjustment for potential confounders; in the two good quality studies adjusted OR estimates were close to 1.105-107 Evidence Mode of Delivery The prior USPSTF review2 included 14 observational studies in 16 publications (sample sizes of 56 to 1 ,034 mother -infant pairs) that found no clear association between the mode of delivery (vaginal vs . cesarean delivery) and risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV.104-106,108 -120 Twelve studies found no statistically significant association b etween the mode of delivery and risk of HCV transmission;104-106,109 -112,114 -120 most estimate s were imprecise , and findings were inconsistent, with point estimates that favored vaginal delivery in some studies and cesarean delivery in others. Most of the studies included in the prior review did not meet inclusion criteria for the current review: e ight were rated poor quality109,111 -113,116 -120 and ten did not conduct multivariate analyses.109-120 No study reported baseline characteristics according to mode of delivery or matched women on key potential confounders. Restricting inclusion to the four studies (total 1 ,717 mother -infant pai rs) in the prior review that met current inclusion criteria (fair or good quality and multivariate analysis performed) resulted in a similar conclusion of no clear association between the mode of delivery and risk of HCV transmission ( Table 6; Appendix B Table 1 ).104-106,108 One of the stud ies was conducted in the Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 15 Pacific Northwest EPC United States104 and the other three in Europe. Although one fair quality study (424 mother - infant pairs) found elective cesarean associated with decreased risk of HCV transmission versus vaginal delivery or emergent (after onset of labor) cesarean after adjusting for HIV sta tus and breastfeeding (adjusted OR 0 .0, 95% CI, 0.0 to 0.87),105 the other three studies, including two good quality studies,104,106 found no association between the mode of delivery a nd HCV transmission risk. One good quality study (1 ,034 mother -infant pairs) found no statistically significant association between the mode of delivery and risk of HCV transmission, though there was a trend towards higher risk with elective cesarean versu s vaginal or emergent (after onset of labor) cesarean, after adjusting for infant sex, prematurity, and breastfeeding status (adjusted OR 1.59, 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.86) ,106 and another good quality study (181 mother -infant pairs) found no association between the mode of delivery (el ective cesarean, emergent cesarean or vaginal) and risk of mother -to-infant transmi ssion in univariate analysis; mode of delivery was excluded from the multivariate model.104 The fourth, fair quality study (78 mother -infant pairs) found no association between cesarean (not specified as elective or emergent) versus vaginal delivery and risk of transmission (data not reported ).108 One additional Italian study (1 ,301 mother -infant pairs) not included in the prior USPSTF review also found no statistically significant association between the mode of delivery (cesarean vs . vaginal delivery) and risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV infection (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.08). Cesarean deliveries were not specified as elective or emergent107 (Table 6; Appendix B Tables 1 -3). The study was rated good quality ( Table 6 ; Appendix B Table 4 ). Rupture of Membranes Evidence on the association between duration of rupture of membranes during labor and risk of HCV transmission is limited. The prior USPSTF review included one good quality United States cohort study (18 9 mother -infant pairs) that found prolonged rupture (longer than 6 hours) of membranes associated with increased risk for HCV transmission versus less prolonged rupture ( 6 hours or less ) after adjusting for maternal demographic characteristics, HCV RNA level, intravenous drug use, and smoking status during pregnancy (adjusted OR 9.3, 95% CI, 1.5 to 180)104 (Table 7; Appendix B Tables 1 -3). However, there were only 7 cases of perinatal HCV infection , and the estimate was very imprecise. A smaller (63 mother -infant pairs) Australi an study116 included in the prior USPSTF review found that mean duration of membrane rupture was longer in mothers in whom HCV transmis sion occurred compared with those in whom transmission did not occur, but did not meet current inclusion criteria because it did not attempt to adjust for potential confounders and was rated poor quality. We identified no new studies on the association bet ween the duration of rupture of membranes and risk of HCV transmission that met inclusion criteria. Fetal Monitoring Evidence on the association between use of fetal monitoring methods during labor and risk of HCV transmission is limited. The prior USPST F review included one good quality U .S.-based study (18 8 mother -infant pairs) that found internal fetal monitoring associated with increased risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV infection versus external monitoring, after adjustment for maternal de mographic characteristics, HCV viral load, intravenous drug use history, and smoking status in pregnancy (adjusted OR 6.7, 95% CI, 1.1 to 35.9)104 (Table 8; Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 16 Pacific Northwest EPC Appendix B Tables 1 -3). However, there were only 7 cases of perinatal HCV infection and the estimate was imprecise. Although the prior USPSTF review included two other studies on the association between fetal monitoring and risk of HCV tra nsmission, neither met current inclusion criteria because they did not report adjusted risk estimates.112,114 One of the studies112 did not compare internal fetal monitoring to no internal monitoring and the other study114 found no association between internal fetal mo nitoring and transmission risk ( relative risk [ RR] 1.24, 95% CI, 0.70 to 2.2). We identified no new studies on the association between the use of fetal monitoring methods and risk of HCV transmission that met inclusion criteria. Breastfeeding The prior US PSTF review2 included 14 observat ional studies104-106,109,111,115 -124 (total of 2 ,971 mother -infant pairs) that found no association between breastfeeding by women infected with HCV and risk of transmission to infants. No study reported a statistically significant association, though some estimates were very imprecise due to few cases of HCV transmission. Most of the studies included in the prior review d id not meet inclusion criteria for the current review: ten were rated poor quality ,108-114,116 -120 and twelve did not conduct multivariate analyses.104,108 -120 Restricting the analysis to the two studies105,106 in the prior rev iew that meet current inclusion criteria (fair or good quality and multivariate analysis performed) resulted in a similar conclusion of no association between breastfeeding and risk of HCV transmission ( Table 9; Appendix B Tables 1 -3).104-106,108 One large (1 ,034 mother -infant pairs) European study found no association between breastfeeding by HCV -infected women without HIV infection and risk of HCV transmissio n to infants (followed until at least 18 months of age ), after adjusting for infant sex, prematurity, and mode of delivery (adjusted OR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.70). A fair quality European study (414 mother -infant pairs) also found no association between b reastfeeding and risk of HCV transmission to infants ( duration of followup 24 months), after adjusting for HIV status (5% of mothers were HIV -infected) and mode of delivery (adjuste d OR 1.52, 95% CI, 0.35 to 5.12). Although the point estimate was consisten t with increased risk associated with breastfeeding , the estimate was imprecise. One additional good quality Italian cohort study107 (1,281 mother -infant pairs) not included in the prior systematic review also found no association between breastfeeding and risk of HCV transmission to infants, after adjusting for maternal HCV viral load, HIV status (14% of mothers were HIV-infected), injection drug use, and mode of delivery (adjusted OR 0.95 , 95% CI, 0.58 Tables 1 -4). Duration of followup was 24 months. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 17 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 6. What Is the Effectiveness of Currently Recommended Antiviral Treatments i n Improving Health Outcomes in Patients With HCV Infection ? Summary Adults The prior review i ncluded no randomized trials or observational studies on the effects of then-current antiviral regimens on long -term (e.g., more than 2 years) clinical outcomes; no new randomized trial evaluated effects of current DAA regimens on long -term clinical outcomes. Ten new trials reported quality of life and functional outcomes before and after treatment with a current DAA regimen. o A pooled analysis of four trials found sofosbuvir / velpatasvir associated with an average improvement of 5.5 to 6.1 points (0 to 100 scale) on 26 measures related to quality of life or function at 24 weeks (12 weeks post -treatment) in persons without cirrhosis. o A pooled analysis of three trials found sofosbuvir / ledipasvir associated with small but statistically significant improvements from baseline to 24 weeks (12 weeks post -treatment) on multiple quality of life and functional domains in persons with no to mild fibrosis at baseline. o Three trials of DAA regimens not included in the pooled analyses (two trials of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir and one trial of elbasvir / grazoprevir ) found DAA use associated with small changes from baseline to 12 weeks post -treatment on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) physical (improvement 0.5 to 1.4 points) or mental component (improvement 2.5 to 3.0 points) summary scales (0 to 100 scale) . Thirty -one trials reported mortality 12 to 36 weeks following completion of therapy with a DAA regimen . Twenty -one trials reported no deaths; in the other ten trials, there were 17 deaths (0.4% [17/3,848] overall ). Three large (n=34,206; 17,836; and 6,850) cohort studies evaluated the association between use of DAA regimens, interferon -based treatment, and no antiviral therapy and risk of cardiovascular events and HCC . o One retrospective study (n=34,206) found DAA therapy and interferon -based therapy each associated with similarly decreased risk of cardiovascular events relative to no thera py (incidence per 1,000 person -years 16.3 for DAA therapy, 23.5 for interferon -based therapy, and 30.4 for no therapy; p<0.001 for DAA therapy or interferon -based therapy vs . no therapy) . o One study (n=17,836) found no difference between interferon -based treatment versus DAA therapy in risk of HCC (incidence rate per 1,000 person -years of followu p 7.48 vs . 7.92; p=0.72); both regimens were associated with lower incidence of HCC than no therapy . o One study ( n=6,85 0) found no difference between DAA therapy versus no antiviral therapy and risk of HCC (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI, 0.40 to 2.61) Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 18 Pacific Northwest EPC among persons without known cirrhosis at baseline after 33 months followup; effects on all -cause mortality favored DAA therapy , but the difference was not statistically sign ificant (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.28). Adolescents Three trials of DAA therapy in adolescents found quality of life improved from baseline based on Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory scores . Three sh ort-term trials of DAA regimens in adolescents reported no deaths. Evidence Adults The prior review identified no randomized trials or observational studies on the effects of then - current antiviral regimens (triple therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin or dual therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin) for chron ic HCV infection on long-term (more than 2 year) clinical outcomes.5,90 Two trials in the prior review reported short - term mortality with triple therapy versus dual therapy, but events were few and estimates were imprecise, with no clear differences.125,126 There were a total of 9 deaths in over 1 ,700 persons across the two trials. No new randomized trial evaluated effects of current DAA regimens on long -term clinical outcomes. Randomized trials of older (non -DAA) antiviral therapy versus no antiviral therapy that evaluated l ong-term clinica l outcomes did not meet inclusion criteria because they enrolled persons with cirrhosis at baseline,127-132 utilized non -standard therapy (indefinite treatment with interferon),133 or were rated poor quality (not clearly randomized).134 Ten trials reported quality of life and functional outcomes before and after receipt of current DAA regimens; seven trials were included in two pooled analyses135,136 and three additional trials (reported in 2 publication s) not in the pooled analyses also reported these outcomes (Appendix B Tables 5, 10 , and 11).137,138 One trial of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir that reported quality of life and functional outcomes was included in a pooled analysis and is not reported separately here.139,140 The trials were all open -label and none reported comparisons of DAA therapy versus placebo or non -DAA therapy. Thirty -one trials (in 28 publications)139,141 -167 reported short -term mortality with current DAA regimens (Appendix B Tables 10 and 11). A multicenter prospective cohort study conducted in France168 and t wo retrospective cohort studies169,170 based on a national Veterans Affairs (VA) database , Elect ronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES) , evaluated the association between treatment with a DAA regimen versus no treatment and other clinical outcomes (cardiovascular outcomes and HCC ) after adjusting for potential confounders (Appendix B Table 5 ). Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 19 Pacific Northwest EPC Quality of Life and Function Ten trials reported quality of life and functional outcomes before and after treatment with a current DAA regimen (Appendix B Tables 5, 10 , and 11). Seven trials were included in two post-hoc pooled anal yses: one analysis135 included three trials (n=1,005) of so fosbuvir / ledipasvir and one analysis136 included four trials (n=1,701) of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir. The trials varied with regard to whether antiviral therapy was administered with or without ribavirin. Two additional trials (reported in 1 publication , n=309 and 14 8) of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir (with or without ribavirin)137 and one additional trial of elbasvir / grazoprevir (n=129) also reported quality of li fe or function .138 All studies used an open -label design , and the quality of life and functional measures assessed in the trials differed . In addition, the trials included in the pooled analyses lacked a non -DAA regimen comparison group. A pooled analysis of four trials found sofosbuvir / velpatasvir associated with an average improvement of 5.5 to 6.1 points on 26 measures related to quality of life or function at 24 weeks (12 weeks post -treatment) in persons without cirrhosis.136 Changes from baseline were not statistically significant. Findings were similar when the regimen was administered with or without ribavirin. The average improvement was based on 26 outcomes derived from the SF -36, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT -F), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire -HCV version (CLDQ -HCV), and the Work Productivity Activity Index: Specific Health Problem (WPAI -SHP) measures, standard ized to a 0 to 100 scale. A pooled analysis of three trials found sofosbuvir / ledipasvir associated with statistically significant improvements from baseline to 24 weeks (12 weeks post -treatment) on multiple quality of life and functional domains in persons with no to mild fibrosis at baseline.135 Estimates were similar when sofosbuvir / ledipasvir was administered with or without ri bavirin. Mean differences were less than 3 points on the 0 to 100 SF -36 physical and mental component summary scales, 10 to 11 points on the 0 to 160 FACIT -F scale, 0.5 to 0.6 points o n the CLDQ - HCV, less than 0.1 point on the 0 to 1 WPAI -SHP scales, and 0.04 to 0.05 points on the six- dimensional health state short -form ( SF-6D) health utility scale; the latter measure was derived from the SF -36 instrument. Three trials not included in pooled analyses also reported small improvements in some measures of quality of life or function.137,138 Two trials found ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir associated with small changes from ba seline to 12 weeks post -treatment on the SF -36 physical (improvement 0.5 to 1.4 points) or mental component (improvement 2.5 to 3.0 points) summary scales.137 Estimates were similar when the regimen was administered with or without ribavirin and among treatment -na\u00efve and -experienced patients. In both trials, there were no statistically significant differences between the DAA regimen versus telaprevir / pegylated interferon / ribavirin on the SF -36 (differences 1.1 to 1.5 poin ts on the mental component and 1.3 to +0.9 points on the physical component summary scales). Changes from baseline following treatment with ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir on the WPAI-SHP scale were also very small. Another trial found elbasvir / grazoprevir use associated w ith small but statistically significant improvements from baseline in SF -36 mental and physical component scores (mean change of 2 points each).138 There was no effect of elbasvir / grazoprevir on p atient fatigue, based on FACIT -F scale score. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 20 Pacific Northwest EPC Mortality Thirty -one trials (in 28 publications; n=21 to 558; total N= 3,848 ) reported mortality 12 to 36 weeks following completion of therapy with a DAA regimen (Appendix B Tables 10 and 11).139,141 -167 The trials were not designed or powered to assess mortality , and 21 studies reported no deaths. There were 17 deaths in the remaining ten studies (0.4% overall) . The regimens evaluated in these trials were sofosbuvir / velpatasvir ( 8 deaths in 884 paritaprevir / ritonavir / 187 patients; 2%),149,162 grazoprevir / elbasvir ( 2 patients; 0. 3%),164,166 / pibrentasvir (2 dea patients; 0.2%) ,167 and sofosbuvir / daclatasvir (one death in 115 patients; 0.9%).167 Ten of the 17 deaths were reported in three trials that enrolled persons reporting recent injection drug use (26% to 66% at baseline ) or use of opioid substitution therapy (3% to 85% at baseline ).149,150,167 Other Clinical Outcomes Three large, fair -quality cohort studies evaluated the association between antiviral treatment versus no treatment and clinical outcomes (cardiovascular events, HCC , or all -cause mortality).168-170 Two studies169,170 were conducted using the VA ERCHIVES data base, and one study168 was conducted in France. Two large (n=17,836 and 34,206), retrospective analyses of VA patients evaluated the association between use of DAA regimens, interferon -based treatment, and no antiviral therapy and risk of cardiovascular events and HCC (Appendix B Tables 5 and 6).169,170 The studies include d primarily male (3 to 4% female), HCV -infected veterans. Mean age ranged from 54 to 62 years; approximately 20 percent of the population had cirrhosis at baseline. One study found DAA therapy and interferon -based therapy each associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular events, including acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and stroke (incidence rate per 1,000 person -years of followup : 16.3 for DAA therapy, 23.5 for interferon -based therapy, and 30.4 for no therapy; p<0.001 for DAA therapy vs . no therapy and for interferon -based therapy vs . no therapy).169 The proportion of patients with at least 5 years followup was 82% for interferon -based therapy, 3.7% for DAA therapy, and 43% for no therapy (mean followup not reported). The other study found no difference between interferon -based treatment versus DAA therapy in risk of HCC (incidence rate per 1,000 person -years of followup 7.48 vs . 7.92; p=0.72) .170 Both types of antiviral therapy regimens were associated with lower incidence of HCC than no therapy (incidence ra te per 1,000 person years 10.90 ). The mean duration of followup was 7.4 years for persons treated with interferon -based therapy and 1.1 years for persons treated with DAA the rapy (mean not reported for untreated patients) . A third, smaller (n=6,850) study conducted in France found no difference between DAA therapy versus no antiviral therapy in risk of HCC (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI, 0.40 to 2.61) in persons not known to have cirrhosis at baseline after a median of 33 months followup .168 Effects on all - cause mortality favored DAA therapy , but the difference was not statistically significant (adjusted HR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.28) . There were to o few events to estimate effec ts on liver - related mortality or decompensated cirrhosis. Some differences between this analysis and the VA studies described above include availability of results for the subgroup of persons without cirrhosis at baseline, a much higher proportion of female patients ( approximately 50%), Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 21 Pacific Northwest EPC restriction to DAA therapy, prospective design, and similar duration of followup in treated and untre ated patients. No study evaluated effects of treatment with DAA regimens on risk of HCV tran smission. Adolescents Data on health outcomes associated with DAA regimens in adolescents is available from one fair quality, open -label trial171 and post-hoc, before -after analyses of two other fair quality trials (Appendix B Tables 7 and 8).172,173 The studies included a total of 200 patients, m ean age was 14 to 15 years, the propor tion of female s ranged from 40 to 63 percent , and patients did not have known cirrhosis. The studies utilized ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in adolescents with genotype 1 infection ,172 sofosbuvir and ribaviri n in adolescents with genotype 2 or 3 infection,173 and glecaprevir / pibrentasvir in patients with genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection.171 Quality of life was assessed based on change from baseline on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.174 The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory comprises four domains: Physical, Emotional, Social and School Functioning, and the total score is determined by averaging the scores from each of the four domains. In adolescents with genotype 1 infectio n treated with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, caregiver -reported total quality of life scores were significantly improved from baseline at 24 weeks post -treatment ( 0-100 scale; mean change 5.2 points; p=0.009). However, was no significant change in patie nts' self -reported total scores (mean change 1.9 points; p=0.12). Only the Emotional Functioning domain was rated as significantly improved from baseline by both caregivers (mean change 9.32 points, p<0.001) and patients (mean change 3.66, p=0.04) .172 In adolescents with genotype 2 or 3 infection treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin , scores improved on the self -report ed Social Functioning score by 4.8 points (p=0.02) and on the parent -proxy - report ed Scho ol Functioning score by 13.0 points (p=0.0065). Adolescents treated with glecaprevir / pibrentasvir also experienced a small improvement in total quality of life score (mean change 2.3 points) though the statistical significance (p -value not reported) and timing of the assessment in this study is unclear. Three studies of DAA regimens (sample sizes 30 to 100; total N=182) reported no deaths, but were not designed to assess long -term clinical outcomes (duration of followup 48 weeks ; Appendix B Tables 7 and 8). Two of the studies evaluated DAA regimens FDA -approved for use in adolescents (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir175 and sofosbuvir and ribavirin173) and one study evaluated a DAA regimen currently recommended for use in adults but not FDA -approved for use in adolescents (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir176). Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 22 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 7. What Is the Effectiveness of Currently Recommended Antiviral Treatments in Achieving a n SVR in Patients With HCV Infection ? Summary Adults The prior review found triple therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir associated with higher likelihood of SVR than dual therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in persons with genotype 1 infection. SVR rates were 68 percent to 72 percent with triple therapy and 38 percent to 46 percent with dual therapy. One new randomized trial found sofosbuvir / velpatasvir associated wit h very high likelihood of SVR versus placebo in persons with mixed genotype (1, 2, 4, 5, or 6) infection (99% vs. 0%, RR 231.6, 95% CI, 14.6 to 3 the SVR rate with sofosbuvir / velpatasv ir ranged from 97 percent to 100 percent . Two new randomized trials found ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir (with or without ribavirin) associated with increased likelihood of SVR versus telaprevir / pegylated interferon / ribavirin in pers ons with genotype 1 infection who were treatment - na\u00efve (98% vs. 80%, RR 1.22, 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.37) or who had previously received interferon therapy (99% vs. 66%, RR 1.50, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.85).137 Forty -nine new trials found c urrent DAA regimens associated with pooled SVR rates that ranged from 9 5.5 percent to 98.9 percent : o Genotype 1 infection ( 32 were consistent in analyses stratified by DAA regimen, study quality, inclusion of persons with cirrhosis at baseline, and geographic setting; and when analyses were restricted to trials that utilized ribavirin as recommended o r to treatment -na\u00efve patients. SVR estimates were similar in trials that stratified patients according to age (17 trials, primarily using a 55- or 65 -year threshold), sex ( 17 trials), race or ethnicity ( 11 trials), or treatment -experience ( five trials). Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 23 Pacific Northwest EPC Adolescents Seven new trials (total N= 348) reported SVR rates of 97 percent to 100 percent with DAA regimens in adolescents with HCV infection. o Four trials evaluated DAA regimens currently recommended and FDA -approved for use in adolescents (ledipasvir / sofosbuvi r, sofosbuvir / ribavirin or ) and three trials evaluated DAA regimens currently recommended for adults but not FDA -approved for use in adolescents. o Results were consistent across genoty pes and in treatment -na\u00efve and -experienced patients. Evidence Adults The prior review found higher SVR rates in persons with HCV genotype 1 infection treated with triple therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin than with dual therapy with pegylated int erferon and ribavirin.5,90 Findings were consistent for a 48 -week boceprevir regimen (2 trials, SVR rates 70% vs. 38%, RR 1.8, 95% CI, 2.1),126,177 a 24- week , fixed telaprevir regimen SVR rates 68% vs. 46%, RR 1.5, 95% CI, 1.3 to 1.8),178-180 and a 24 - or 48 -week , response -guided telaprevir regimen (1 trial, SVR rate vs. 44%, RR 1.6, 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9).125 The prior review also included 5 trials of dual therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for genotype 2 or 3 infection that reported pooled SVR rates of 78 percent ( 95% CI, 67% to 88%) for 24 weeks of treatment and 68 percent (56% to 78%) f or 12 to 16 weeks of therapy.181-184 None of the studies in the prior review evaluated current DAA regimens. Forty -nine new trials (in 44 publications) reported effects of current DAA treatment regimens on SVR in patients with HCV infection Table 10; Appendix B Tables 10 and 11).137,139,141 -167,185 - 199 Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 706 (total N=9,917), mean age ranged from 45 to 68 years, and the proportion of female participants ranged from 18 to 64 percent. Twenty -four trials (in 20 publications) were mu ltinational (primarily United States, Australia and/or Europe),137,139,143,144,149,150,155,158,160,164,166,16 7,185 -189,191,196,198 11 (in 10 publications) were conducted in the United States and/or Canada,146,147,153,154,157,161,190,192 -194 eight in Asia,145,151,152,156,163,165,197,199 two in France,141,142 two in Egypt,162,195 and one each in Brazil,159 and Ne w Zealand.148 The eight trials conducted in Asia did not report race. In the other studies, among those that reported race, the majority of participants were white (ra nge 60 to 100%)139,141,142,146,147,153 -155,157,158,160 -162,166,185 -188,190 -194 with the exception of one study conducted in New Zealand in which 16 percent of participants were white148 and one study conducted primarily in Asian countries in which 28% of participants were white.164 Twenty -one trials (in 19 publications) enrolled patients with genotype 1 -156,159 -161,163,167,185 three genotype trial each for genotype s 5142,143 and 6,143,148 and nine trials mixed genotypes (three trials genotypes 1 through 6;146,150,165 one trial genotypes 1, 2, 4 and 6;139 two trials genotypes 2 through 6;144,196 two trials genotypes 1, 4 and 6;166,198 and one trial genotypes 1 and 4164). Thirty -one trials (in 28 publications) excluded patients with cirrhosis137,144,146,147,154,155,159 - 162,167,186,188 -194,196,197,199 or reported results in the subgroup of patients without Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 24 Pacific Northwest EPC cirrhosis.139,147,149,150,164,165,185,198 For trials that enrolled patients with cirrhosis, inclusion was restricted to trials in which the proportion of patients with cirrhosis was less than 20 percent, with the exception of one trial of grazoprevir / elbasvir that had a slightly higher proportion (22%).166 All trials excluded patients with HBV infection. Five trials (in 4 publications) enrolled patients with a history of receiving methadone or buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.149,150,167,192 The other trials excluded patients with recent or current substance use or did not describe substance use. Thirteen trials (in 11 publications) evaluated ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir, with or without ribavirin,137,149,151,155,162,186 -189,191,192 ten trials ledipasvir / sofosbuvir,141,142,145,148,156,163,185,190,193,195 eight trials (in 6 publications) glecaprevir / pibrentasvir,143,167,194,196,197,199 seven trials (in 6 publications) sofosbuvir / velpatasvir,139,146,147,150,158,165 six trials elbasvir / grazoprevir,144,152,160,164,166,198 four trials daclatasvir / sofosbuvir.157,159,161,167 and three trials simeprevir / sofosbuvir.153,154,159 One trial compared a current DAA regimen versus placebo,139 two trials (reported in one publication) compared a current DAA regimen versus a regimen with telaprevir,137 and two trials (reported in one publication) compared a current DAA regimen versus an older, not currently recommended, DAA regimen.147 Five other trials randomized patients to a DAA regimen versus placebo wit h delayed DAA therapy, but only reported SVR rates following active treatment.151,152,164,166,187 The other trials did not compare a current DAA regimen to placebo or an older antiviral regimen. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks in all trials except for seven trials (in 5 publications)143,167,196,197,199 which evaluated 8 or 12 weeks of glecaprevir / pibrentasvir and two trials which evaluated 8 or 12 weeks of ledipasvir / sofosbuvir.191,193 Fourteen trials (in 12 publications) evaluated the same DAA regimen with and without ribavirin;137,144,154,158,160,161,185,186,188,191,193,194 of these, six trials (in 4 publications137,186,188,191) evaluated ombitasvir / paritaprevir / daclatasvir / sofosbuvir.161 Twenty - one trials did not vary duration of treatment or use of ribavirin.141,142,145,146,148 -150,153,155 -157,159,162 - 165,189,190,192,195,198 Thirty -two trials (in 30 publications) enrolled treatment -na\u00efve populations or reported results stratified according to prior tre atment status,137,141,142,144 -146,149,151 -153,155 -157,159 enrolled treatment -experienced patients,137,154,158,186,194 and 11 trials (in 10 publications) enrolled a mix of treatment -na\u00efve and -experienced patients but did not stratify results according to treatment status.139,143,147,148,150,187,192,196,197,199 In trials of mixed populations, the proportion of treatment -na\u00efve patients ranged from 52 to 95 percent. SVR was measured 12 week s after the end of treatment in all trials except for one trial that assessed SVR at 14 weeks post -treatment166 and four trials (in 3 publications) that reported 12 - and 24 -week post-treatment SVR rates.167,191,192 In the latter trials, 12 - and 24 -week SVR rates were identical or very similar. Twenty -seven trials (in 24 publications137,139,144,146,147,151 -154,158 -161,166,167,185 -191,193,194) had multiple DAA treatment 21 publications141-143,145,148 -165,167,192,195 -199) were single -arm studies ( Appendix B Tables 10 and 11). Among the trials with multiple treatment arms, 20 (in 18 publications137,144,146,147,153,154,1 58-161,167,185,186,189 -191,193,194) used an open - label design. In the open -label trials, treatment allocation was random in 11 trials (in 9 publications137,147,153,159,167,185,186,190,194); in the other trials patients were allocated to treatment Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 25 Pacific Northwest EPC based on genotype (4 trials144,146,160,161), prior treatment status (1 trial191), or clinical charac teristics (e.g., fibrosis stage ).154,158,189,193 Thirteen trials were rated good quality,137,139,141,146,152,159,162,164,16 6,187 -189,191 and the remainder were rated fair quality. Frequent methodological limitations included unclear randomization or enrollment methods (e.g., unclear if the trial enrolled consecutive patients meeting inclusion criteria, or a random sample). Loss to followup was low across all trials (range 0 to 3%). All of the trials were industry -funded. SVR Rates in Comparative Trials DAA regimen versus placebo . One randomized trial (n=706) compared sofosbuvir / velpatasvir versus placebo in persons with HCV infecti on (ge notypes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6; Table 1 1).139 Genotype 1 infection was present in 53 percent of patients , 32 percent of patients had previously received interferon therapy, and 19 percent had cirrhosis at baseline. Sofosbuvir / velpatasvir was associated with an SVR rate of 99 percent (618/624), compared with no cases of SVR among 116 patients randomized to placebo (R R 231.6, 95% CI, 14.6 to 3680). Across genotypes, the SVR rate with sofosbuvir / velpatasvir ranged from 97 percent to 100 percent . DAA regimen versus telaprevir -containing regimen . Two randomized trials (reported in one publication) compared om bitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir (with or without ribavirin) for 12 weeks versus telaprevir (12 weeks) / pegylated interferon / ribavirin (24 or 48 weeks) for genotype 1 infection (Table 1 1).137 One trial (n=311) enrolled treatment -na\u00efve patients , and the other (n=148) enrolled patients previously treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In treatment - na\u00efve patients, ombitasvir / paritaprev ir / ritonavir / dasabuvir was associated with increased likelihood of SVR versus telaprevir / pegylated interferon / ribavirin (98% vs. RR 1.22, 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.37) . SVR rates were similar in genotype 1a patients who received ombitasvir / paritapre dasabuvir with ribavirin (97%) and genotype 1b patients who received the same regimen with or without ribavirin (98 to 99%) . In the other trial, ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin was associated with increased likelihood of SVR versus telaprevir / pegylated interferon / ribavirin in treatment -experienced patients (99% vs. 66%, RR 1.50, 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.85). SVR rates were similar for genotype 1a (100%) DAA regimen . Two randomized trials (reported in one publication) compared sofosbuvir / velpatasvir for 12 weeks versus sofosbuvir / ribavirin for 24 weeks.147 One trial (n=269) enrolled patients with genotype 2 infection (14 to 15% prior interferon therapy, 14% cirrhosis) and one trial (n=280) enrolled patients with genotype 3 infection (26% prior interferon therapy and 29 to 30% cirrhosis; results reported for non - cirrhosis subgroup). Sofosbuvir / velpatasvir was associated with increased likelihood of SVR for genotype 2 infectio n (99% vs. 94%, RR 1.06, 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.11) and for genotype 3 infection (non -cirrhosis subgroup, 97% vs. 87%, RR 1.11, 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.18). Pooled SVR Rates by Genotype Genotype 1 . Thirty -two trials (total N=6,055) reported SVR rates associated wit h seven different DAA percent ( 95% CI, 96.6% to 98.4%; I2=82%; Figure 2). Although statistical heterogeneity was present, the SVR rate was 91 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 26 Pacific Northwest EPC percent or higher in all of the trials. The most frequently evaluated regimen was ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir or ribavirin (11 trials).137,139,149,151,155,186,188,191,192 The pooled SVR rate with this regimen 93.7 89.0% 99.1%; I2=68%) infection (2 trials). Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir was evaluated in six trials ,145,156,163,185,190,193 with a pooled SVR rate of 99.4 percent I2=89%), lbasvir grazoprevir was evaluated in five trials152,160,164,166,198 with pooled SVR r ate of 96.7 percent ( CI, 95.0% to 97.8%; I2=55%). Four other antiviral regimens were evaluated in two or three trials each; pooled SVR rates ranged from 95.7 percent to 99.0 percent for these regimens (Table 12). Results were similar for trials rated good quality (pooled SVR 97.2%, 95% CI, 95.2% to 97.9%, 95% CI, 96.7% to 98.7%), for cirrhosis (pooled SVR 97.1%, 95% CI, 95.7% to 98.1%) or included some (less than 20% of sample) patients with cirrhosis (pooled SVR 98.7%, 95% CI, 97.1% to 99.4%), and when the analysis was restricted to trials conducted in the United States and Canada (pooled SVR 96.7%, 95% CI, 93.1% to 98.4%) (Table 1 2). Results were also similar when the analysis was restricted to trials that used ribavirin as recommended or did not omit dasabuvir in combination with ombitasvir / paritaprevir 98.3%, 95% CI, 97.4% to 98.9%) or when the analysis wa s restricted to treatment -na\u00efve patients (pooled SVR 97.4%, 95% CI, trials (total N= 526) reported SVR rates associated with two different DAA regimens in persons with genotype 2 infection CI, 97.5% CI, 99.1%, I2=0%).196,199 Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to quality, geographic setting, or enrollment of some patients with cirrhosis (Table 12). SVR rates were also similar in trials that were restricted to treatment - experienced patients164,196,199 or enrolled a mix of treatment -na\u00efve and treatment -experienced patients ;139,147 one mixed population trial reported an SVR of 100% ( 95% CI, 95.4% to 100%) in the subgroup of treatment -na\u00efve patients .139 Genotype 3. Six trials (total N= 742) reported SVR rates associated with three different DAA regimens in persons with genotype 3 CI, 91.6% 90.2% to 97.8%).167 The SVR rate was higher in five trials that excluded patients with cirrhosis (pooled SVR 96.4%, 95% CI, 94.6% to 97.5%) than cirrhosis CI, 76.5% to 91.7%; p for interaction=0.01). Results were similar when trials were stratified according to study quality or when the analysis was restricted to trials conducted in the United States or Canada (Table 12 ). Results were also similar when the analysis excluded results Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 27 Pacific Northwest EPC from one trial158 of sofosbuvir / velpatasvi r plus ribavirin (ribavirin pooled SVR 95.2%, 95% CI, 91.4% to 97.3%) and when the analysis was restricted to treatment -na\u00efve patients (pooled SVR 96.1%, 95% CI, 94.5% to 12) 4. Ten trials (total N= 485) reported SVR rates associated with f ive different DAA regimens in persons with genotype 4 infection CI, 94.7% to 99. 4%; I2=50%; Estimates were similar for e lbasvir grazoprevir (4 to I2=25%)142,195 (Table 82.1% to 98.6%).196 Results were similar when the analysis was restricted to trials that were rated good quality (pooled SVR 99. 1%, 95% CI, 94.0% to 99.9%), when trials were stratified according to whether they were restricted to patients without cirrhosis ( pooled SVR 98.3%, 95% CI, 94.4% to 99.5 with cirrhosis ( pooled SVR 99.1%, 95% CI, 91.2% to 99. 9%), and when trials were stratified according to geographic setting (Table 12). Results were also similar when the analysis was restricted to treatment -na\u00efve patients (pooled SVR 98. 3%, 95% CI, 94.5% 5%). . Four trials (total N= 75) reported SVR rates associated with three different DAA regimens in patients with genotype 5 CI, 88.3% 95% CI, 82.2% to 99.9%).139 Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to study quality, inclusion of patients with cirrhosis, and geographic sett ing (Table 12 ). Results were also similar when the analysis was restricted to treatment -na\u00efve patients (pooled SVR 95.6%, 95% CI, trials (total N= 229) reported SVR rates associated with three different DAA regimens in persons with genotype 6 infection (pooled 95% CI, 95.4% to 99. 3%, were similar to 99.9%).148 Results were similar wh en analyses were stratified according to quality, enrollment of some patients with cirrhosis, and geographi c setting ( Table 12). Results were also similar when the analysis was restricted to treatment -na\u00efve patients (pooled SVR 98.4%, 95% CI, 89.6% to 99.8 Mixed genotypes . Two trials (total N=108) reported SVR rates associated with sofosbuvir / velpatasvir in persons with mixed genotype 1 to 6 infections (pooled SVR 95.4 %, 95% CI, 89.4% to 98 .1%; I2=0% ; Figure 8 ).146,150 Both trials were restricted to pat ients without cirrhosis. In one trial146 patients were treatment -na\u00efve , and in the other trial prior treatment status was not Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 28 Pacific Northwest EPC reported.150 Subgroup analyses . Nineteen trials (in 18 publications) reported analyses stratified according to demographic characteristics.139,145,147,149,150,152,156,157,164 -167,185 -187,190,191,198 SVR rates were similar when patients were stratified according to age in 17 trials, according to sex in 17 trials, and according to race or ethnicity in 11 trials ( Table 1 3). One trial found SVR rates were slightly higher in persons with body mass index ( BMI ) less than 30 kg/m2 versus 30 kg/m2 or more (97% vs. 92%) and in persons with diabetes versus no diabetes (100% vs. 96%).187 Nine trials found SVR rates were similar when analyses were stratified according to whether patients were treatment -experienced or treatment -na\u00efve.151-153,155,159,163,165,167,198 Five trials (in 4 publications )149,150,167,192 of patients with current or recent use of methado ne or buprenorphine for opioid use disorder rep orted SVR rates ranging from 89 to 100 percent . The other trials excluded patients with current or recent opioid use or did not report opioid use status. Adolescents Seven trials evaluated the effects of DAA regimens on SVR in adolescents with HCV infection (Appendix B Tables 7 and 8).171,173,175,176, 201-203 Sample size s ranged from 30 to 100 (total N=348), mean age ranged from 12 to 15 years, and the proportion of female participants ranged from 35 to 63 percent. Four studies171,173,175,203 were multinatio nal (primaril y conducted in the United States , Europe and/or Australia) , and three were conducted in Egypt.176,201,202 In the four multinational studies, the majority ( 75% or more ) of participants were white.171,173,175,203 The three Egyptian studies176,201,202 enrolled genotype 4 patients, one multinational study enrolled patients with genotype 1,175 and three multinational studies enrolled mixed genotypes.171,173,203 Patients with cirrhosis were excluded in two trials and cirrhosis/fibrosis stage inclusion criteria was not reported in a third trial. In the other four trials, enrollment of patients with cirrhosis was permitted, but two of these did not conduct liver biopsy or other testing for cirrhosis at baseline. Fibrosis stage was F0 -F1 in 68 to 96 percent of the populati on in five studies ;171,176,201 -203 fibrosis stage was unknown in over half of participants in the other two studies. The proportion of treatment -na\u00efve patients ranged from 66 to 100 pe rcent. In the six trials that included treatment - experienced patients, prior HCV treatment was interferon with or without ribavirin in three trials171,202,203 and was unclear in th ree trials.173,175,176 Four trials evaluated DAA regimens currently recommended and FDA for use svir trial)173 and glecaprevir / pibrentasvir (1 trial) .171 Three trials evaluated DAA regimens currently recommended for adults but not FDA -approved for use in adolescents: sofosbu vir and daclatasvir paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir and weight -based ribavirin (one trial ).203 One study was rated good quality ,176 and the others fair quality , primarily due to unclear patient enrollment methods (Appendix B Table 9 ). SVR was assessed at 12 -weeks post -treatment . Therapy was administered for 12 weeks in all trials with the exception of sofosbuvir / ribavirin which was administered for 12 (genotype 2) or 24 (genotype 3) weeks in one trial, and glecaprevir / pibrentasvir which was administered for 8 weeks for 94 percent of the study population in one trial .171 Across all studies, the rate of SVR ranged from 97 to 100 percent ( Table 1 4; Appendix B Tables 7 and 8). Results were similar for specific genotypes (genotype to 100%), though the number of adolescents with Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 29 Pacific Northwest EPC genotype 2 or 4 infection was very small. In two studies, SVR rates were 98 percent to 100 percent for both treatment -na\u00efve and treatment -experienced patients.175,203 Key Question 8. What Are the Harms of Currently Recommended Antiviral Treatments ? Summary The prior review found triple therapy with boceprevir or telaprevir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin or dual therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin associated with high rates of adverse e vents: o Serious adverse events: Pooled rates 8.5 to 16 percent o Withdrawal due to adverse event: Pooled rates 12 to 15 percent o Fatigue: Pooled rates 51 to 64 percent o Influenza -like symptoms: Pooled rates 19 to 40 percent o Depression: Pooled rates 19 to 22 percent o Headache: Pooled rates 42 to 52 percent o Myalgia: Pooled rates 18 to 26 percent The prior review found triple therapy with boceprevir associated with increased risk of thrombocytopenia (3.8% vs. 1.4%, RR 3.2, 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.8) and neutropenia (33% vs. 18%, RR 1.8, 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.3) versus dual therapy, and telaprevir associated with increased risk of anemia (52% vs. 39%, RR 1.3, 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3). Triple therapy with telaprevir was also associated with increased risk of rash versus dual therapy (49% vs. 35%, RR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.7) and boceprevir with increased risk of dysgeusia (35% vs. 13%, RR 2.5, 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.2). Four new randomized trials found current DAA regimens associated with slightly increased r isk of any adverse event versus placebo (pooled RR 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.24, I2=46%; adjusted risk difference [ ARD ] 8%, 95% CI, 2% to 15%) and nausea (pooled I2=10%, ARD 4%, 95% CI, to 10%). There were no differences be tween DAA therapy versus placebo in risk of serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, or anemia. Two new randomized trials found ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with or without ribavirin associ ated with decreased risk of any adverse event (RR 0.65, 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.84, I2=87%; ARD 34%, 95% to 16%), I2=0%; ARD 8%, 95% CI, 15% to 1%), withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 0.06, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.29, I2=0%; ARD to I2=32%; ARD 18%, 95% headache 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.95; ARD 0.10, 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.01), nausea (RR 0.31, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.59, I2=65%; ARD 37% to 19%), anemia I2=41%; ARD 37%, 95% CI, 46% to 28%), pegylated interferon / ribavirin. Forty-nine new trials reported the proportion of patients on DAA regimens with adverse events: o Any adverse event percent ( 95% CI, 68.0% to 78.1%, I2=95%) Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 30 Pacific Northwest EPC o Serious adverse events ( 44 trials): 1.9 CI, 1.5% to awal 0.4 percent (95% CI, 0.3% to 0.6%, o percent CI, 0.9% to 6.3%, I2=85%) o percent CI, 15.6% to 21.7%, I2=90%) o percent CI, 15.6% to 22.2%, I2=90%) o percent CI, 6.8% to 10.1%, I2=58%) 9.1% to 13.5%, percent CI, 6.9% to 11.0%, I2=70%) o percent CI, 3.4% to 9.7%, I2=43%) by DAA regimens in adverse events estimates; estimates were generally higher for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with rib avirin than without ribavirin. Adverse event estimates were generally similar when trials were stratified according to baseline cirrhosis status (excluded or included up to 20%) and prior antiviral therapy experience. Evidence Adults The prior Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review found no difference between triple therapy with boceprevir or telaprevir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin versus dual therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in risk of serious adverse events (pooled ev ent rates ranged from 8.5% to 16%) or withdrawal due to adverse events (pooled event rates 12% to 15%).5,90 There were also no differences in rates of fatigue (pooled event rates 51% to 64%), influenza -like symptoms (pooled event rates 19% to 40%), depression (pooled event rates 19% to 22%), headache (pooled event rates 42% to 52%), or myalgia (pooled event rates 18% to 26%) , but these adverse events occurred frequently with all regimens. Triple therapy was associated with increased risk of hematological adverse events versus dual therapy. Boceprevir was associated with increased risk of thrombocytopenia (3.8% vs. 1.4%, RR 3.2, 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.8) and neutropenia (33% vs. 18%, RR 1.8, 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.3), and telaprevir was associated with increased risk of anemia (52% vs. 39%, RR 1.3, 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.3). Triple therapy with telaprevir was also associated with incr eased risk of rash versus dual therapy (49% vs. 35%, RR 1.4, 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.7) and boceprevir with increased risk of dysgeusia versus dual therapy (35% vs. 13%, RR 2.5, 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.2). Forty -nine new trials (in 44 publications) of DAA regimens with out interferon reported the proportion of patients who experienced adverse events ( Table 1 5; Appendix B Tables 10 and -199 One DAA trial158 included in the SVR analysis was excluded from pooled analyses of adverse events because a high proportion of patients had cirrhosis (about 40%) and adverse event rates were not reported separately for persons without cirrhosis. Eleven trials (in 9 publicati ons) of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir included ribavirin , which is recommended for of 1a and 4 infections .137,149,162,186 -189,191,192 Regimens containing ribavirin were otherwise excluded from the adverse event analyses. Eight trials (in 6 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 31 Pacific Northwest EPC publications) reporting adverse events compared a current DAA regimen versus placebo,139,151,16 4,187 triple therapy with telaprevi r,137 or an older DAA regimen.147 Reporting of methods used to assess harms was suboptimal, with few details regarding use of active versus passive assessment or definitions of harms. Trial characteristics a re described in more detail in KQ 7. Adverse Events in Comparative Trials DAA regimen versus placebo . Four randomized trials (total N=2,113) reported adverse events associated with current DAA regimens versus placebo.139,151,164,187 Each trial evaluated (Table 1 5; Appendix B Tables 10 and 11). The trials of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir and elbasvir / grazoprevir enrolled people with mixed genotype (1, 2, 4, 5, and/o r 6) infections, and the other trials enrolled persons with genotype 1 infection. One trial enrolled treatment -na\u00efve patients;164 in the remaining trials, approximately one -third of patients had previously received interferon therapy. In two trials,139,164 approximately 19 percent of patients had cirrhosis at baseline, and the other two tria ls restricted enrollment to persons without cirrhosis. All trials used a double -blind design. DAA therapy was associated with slightly increased risk of any adverse event versus placebo that was of borderline statistical significance (4 trials, RR 1.12, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.24, I2=46%; ARD 8%, 95% CI, to 15%; Figure 9).139,151,164,187 Among patients randomized to DAA therapy, the proportion reporting a ny adverse event ranged from 47 percent to 86 percent . There were no differences between DAA therapy versus placebo in risk of serious adverse events (4 trials, RR 1.90, 95% CI, 0.73 to 4.95, I2=0%; Figure 10) or withdrawal due to adverse events (4 trials, RR 0.47, 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.58, I2=14%; Figure 11), though there were few events and estimates were imprecise.139,151,164,187 Among patients randomized to DAA therapy, the proportion with serious adverse events ranged from 2.0 percent to 3.3 percent , and the proportion who withdre w due to adverse events ranged from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent . DAA therapy was associated with increased risk of nausea versus placebo (3 trials, RR 1.42, 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.03, to 10%; Figure 12).139,151,187 The point estimate was similar for diarrhea, but the di fference was not statistically significant (two trials, RR 1.53, 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.68, I2=29%; Figure 1 3).139,187 There were no differences between DAA therapy versus placebo in risk of fatigue (3 tri als, RR 1.05, 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.40; I2=32%; Figure 14)139,164,187 or headache (four trials, RR 1.12, 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.37, I2=0%; Figure 15).139,151,164,187 One trial139 found no difference between sofosbuvir / velpatasvir versus placebo in risk of anemia (0.3% vs. 0%, RR 2.21, 95% CI, 0.11 to 46); no cases of anemia were reported in the other three trials. DAA regimen versus telaprevir/pegylated interferon/ribavirin . Two randomized trials (reported in one publication) compared ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks versus triple therapy with telaprevir (12 weeks) / pegylated interferon / ribavirin (24 or 48 weeks) in patients with genotype 1 infection.137 One trial (n=311) enrolled treatment -na\u00efve patients , and one trial (n=148) enrolled patients previously treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The DAA regimen was associated with decreased risk of any adverse event (RR 0.65, 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.84 , I2=87%; ARD 34%, 95% CI, 51% to 16%; Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 32 Pacific Northwest EPC Figure 1 6), serious adverse events (RR 0.08, 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.34, I2=0%; ARD 8%, 95% CI, 15% to 1%; Figure 1 7), withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 0.06, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.29, I2=0%; ARD 9%, 95% CI, 14% to 3%; Figure 1 8), fatigue (RR 0.37, 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.63, I2=32%; ARD 18%, 95% CI, 27% to 10%; Figure 1 headache (RR 0.70, 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.95, I2=0%; ARD 0.10, 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.01; Figure 20), nausea (RR 0.31, 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.59, I2=65%; ARD 28%, 95% CI, 37% to 19%; Figure 2 1), anemia (RR 0.09, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.23, I2=41%; ARD 37%, 95% CI, 46% to 28%; Figure 2 2), and rash (RR 0.19, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.58, I2=48%; ARD 17%, 95% to 9%; Figure 2 3) versus the telaprevir regimen. The association between DAA therapy versus telaprevir and risk of any adverse event was less pronounced when ribavirin was included with DAA therapy (2 trials, RR 0.74, 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.84, I2=43%; Figure 1 6) than without ribavirin (1 trial, RR 0.50, 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.62; p for interaction=0.003). There was no interaction between prior antiviral treatment experience and risk estimates for any adverse event. Pooled Adverse Event Rates for DAA Regimens Any adverse event . Forty -four trials (in 41 publications, total N=8,045) reported the proportion of patients reporting any adverse event with eight different DAA regimens.137,139,141 -156,159 -167,185 - 190,192 -199 Across regimens, any adverse was 73.3% ( 95% CI, 68.0% to 78.1%, I2=95%; Figure 2 4). Stratified by antiviral regimen, the rate of any adverse event ranged from 62.3% ( 95% CI, 56.1% to to 94.2%) for sofosbuvir / daclatasvir (2 trials). The rate of any adverse event was higher in trials of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin CI, 86.5%; I2=87%) than , 75.1%, 95% CI, 62.3% to 8 4.6%; I2=92%) (Table 16 ). The proportion of patients with any adverse event was similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (24 trials, pool ed event rate 75.5%, 95% CI, 69.0% to 81.1%) or included some patients with cirrhosis (19 trials, pooled event rate 72.4%, 95% CI, 64.6% to 79. 0%; p for interaction=0.52 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of any adverse event ( p for interaction=0.76). Serious adverse events . Forty -four trials (in 40 publications, total N=8,070 ) reported the proportion of patients reporting serious adverse events with eight different DAA regimens.137,139,141 -144,146 -157,160 -167,185 -194,196 -199 Across regimens, the rate for serious adverse events was 1.9 percent (95% CI , 1.5% to 2.4%, I2=31%; Figure 2 5). Stratified by antiviral regimen, the rate of any adverse event ranged from 0.6 percent (95% CI, 0.1% to 4.1 %, I2=0%) for simeprevir / sofosbuvir (2 trials) to 2.1 percent for elbasvir / grazoprevir trials, 3.0%, I2=26%) ( Table 16 ). The rate of serious adverse events for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir without ribavirin (5 trials, pooled rate 1.9%, 95% C I, 1.2% to 3.2%, I2=31%) was similar to the rate with ribavirin . Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (23 trials, pooled event rate 1.8%, 95% CI, 1.3% to 2.5%) or included some patien with cirrhosis (21 trials, pooled event rate 2.0%, CI, 1.4% to 2.7% ; p for interaction=0.69 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of serious adverse events (p for interaction=0.96). Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 33 Pacific Northwest EPC Withdrawal due to adve rse events . Forty -four trials (in 40 publications, total N=8,060) reported the proportion of patients who withdrew due to adverse events with eight different DAA regimens.137,139,141 -156,160 -167,18 5-194,196 -199 Across regimens, there were a total of 35 withdrawals due to adverse events, with a pooled rate of 0.4 percent ( 95% CI, 0.3% to 0.6%, I2=0%; Figure 26). The proportion of patients who withdrew due to adverse events was less than or equal to 1 percent for all regimens ( Table 16 ). Anemia . Thirteen trials (in 9 publications, total N= 1,555) reported the proportion of patients with anemia with f ive differen t DAA regimens.137,149,154,185,186,190 -192,199 Across regimens, the pooled rate for anemia was 2.4 percent (95% CI, 0.9% to 6.3%, I2=85%; Figure 2 7). The rate of anemia was much higher in trials of ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin (6 rate 8.3%, 95% CI, 5.8% to 11.8%, I2=49%) than the same regimen without ribavirin (3 trials, pooled event rate 0.8%, 95% CI, 0.2% to 3.1%, I2=0%) or with other (pooled event rates <0.5%) (Table 17 ). Fatigue . Thirty -seven trials (in 33 publications, total N= 7,571) reported the proportion of patients with fatigue with different DAA regimens.137,139,141 -150,153,155 -157,159 -162,164,167,185 - 192,194 -196 Across rate for fatigue was 18.4 percent (95% CI, 15.6% to 21.7%, I2=90%; Figu re 28). Stratified by antiviral regimen, rates of fatigue ranged from 10.9 percent ( 95% CI, CI, to I2=88%) ribavirin (11 trials) ( Table 17 ). The rate of fatigue was higher for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin than the same regimen without ribavirin (6 trials, pooled event rate 15.8%, 95% CI, 9.1% to 26.1%, I2=91%). Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (18 trials, pooled event rate 20.2%, 95% CI, 16.0% to 25.3%, I2=92%) or included some patients with cirrhosis (18 trials, pooled event rate 16.7%, 95% CI, 13.1% to 21.2% ; p for interaction=0.27 ) and there was no interaction between prior treatment status and rates of fatigue (p for interaction=0.54). Headache . Forty -two trials (in 38 publications, total N=7,790) reported the proportion of patients with head ache with 8 different DAA regimens.137,139,141 -151,153,155 -157,159 -162,164,165,167,185 - 197,199 Across regimens, the rate for headache was 18.7 percent (95% CI, 15.6% to 22.2%, I2=90%; Figure 2 9). Stratifi ed by antiviral regimen, rates of headache ranged from 13.7 percent (95% CI, 8.4% to 21.5% , I2=85% ) ribavirin (11 trials) ( Table 17 ). The rate of headache was higher for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin than the same regimen without ribavirin (7 trials, pooled event rate 20.7%, 95% CI, 15.6% to 26.9%, I2=83%). Estimates were simila r when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (14 trials, pooled event rate 19.6%, 95% CI, 15.5% to 24.3%) or included some patients with cirrhosis ( 19 trials, pooled event rate 19.1%, 95% CI, 14.9% to 24.1% ; p for interaction=0.89 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of headache (p for interaction=0.11) . Insomnia . Eighteen trials (in 17 publications, total N=3,517) reported the proportion of patients with insomnia with eight different DAA regimens.139,146,147,149,150,157,159 -162,185,187,189,190,192,194,195 Across regimens, the pooled rate for insomnia was 8.3 percent (95% CI, 6.8% to 10.1%, I2=58%; Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 34 Pacific Northwest EPC Figure 30). Stratified by antiviral regimen, rates of insomnia ranged from 6.0% (95% CI, 4.5 to 8.0%; I2=58%) for 3 ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin (5 tri als) (Table 1 7). The only trial of glecaprevir / pibrentasvir reported no cases of insomnia.160 Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (10 trials, pooled event rate 9.0%, 95% CI, 7.0% to 11.5%) or incl uded some with cirrhosis (8 trials, pooled event rate 8.4%, 95% CI, 6.4% to 10.9% ; p for interaction=0.70 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of insomnia (p for interaction=0.81) . Gastrointestinal adverse events . Thirty -six trials (in 34 publications, total N=6,145) reported the proportion of patients with nausea on eight different DAA regimens.137,139,142,144 -151,153,157,159 - 162,167,185,186,188 -196,199 Across regimens, the pooled for nausea was 11.1 percent ( 95% CI, 9.1% to 13.5%, I2=82%; Figure 3 1). Stratified by antiviral regimen, rates of nausea ranged from 6.5 percent ( 95% CI, 4.3% to ritonavir (7 ribavirin (11 trials) ( Table 18 ). Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (21 trials, pooled event rate 10.6%, 95% CI, 8.2% to 13.5 %) or included some patients with cirrhosis (14 trials, pooled ev ent rate 12.9%, 95% CI, 9.6% to 17.1% ; p for interaction=0.31 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of nausea (p for interaction=0.63). Eighteen trials (in 17 publications, total N=2,336) of six different DAA r egimens reported the proportion of patients with diarrhea.141,142,146,148,150,155,157,160,161,185 -191,195 Across regimens, the pooled rate of diarrhea was 8.7 percent (95% CI, 6.9% to 11.0%, I2=70%; Figure 3 2). Stratified by antiviral regimen, ra tes of diarrhea ranged from 6.1 percent (95% CI, 3.4% to 10.8%, I2=50%) for sofosbuvir / velpatasvir (2 trials) to 11.6 percent (95% CI, 4.9% to 25. 0%) for elbasvir / grazoprevir (1 trial) ( Table 18 ). The rate of diarrhea was similar for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin (6 trials, pooled e vent 10.9%, 95% CI, 7.8% to 1 4.9%, I2=73% ) and the same regimen without ribavirin (5 trials, pooled event rate 11. 1%, 95% CI , 7.7% to 15.9%, I2=72%). Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with c irrhosis (10 trials, pooled event rate 10.1%, 95% CI, 7.9% to 12.8%) or included some patients with cirrhosis (5 trials, pooled event rate 8.0%, 95% CI, 5.5% to 11.6% ; p for interaction=0.33 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of diarrhea (p for interaction=0.92). Six trials (total N=444) of five different DAA regimens reported the proportion of patients with vomiting.148-150,159,161,192 Across regimens, the pooled rate of vomiting was 5.8 percent (95% CI, 3.4% to 9.7%, I2=43%; Figure 3 3). Stratified by antiviral regimen, rates o f vomiting ranged from 1.9 percent (95% CI, 0.5% to 7.2% , ribavirin . Rash . Seventeen trials (in 15 publications, total N=2,256) reported the proportion of patients with rash on eight different DAA regimens.137,146,153,154,158 -160,185 -188,190,192,193,197 Across regimens, Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 35 Pacific Northwest EPC the p ooled rate for rash was 5.4 percent ( 95% CI, 4.1% to 7.1%, I2=70%; Figure 3 4). Stratified by antiviral regimen, rates of rash ranged from 1.5 percent ( 95% CI, 0.2% to 10.1%) for sofosbuvir / 4.9% 13.7%, I2=45%) (2 trials) ( Table 18 ). The rate of rash was higher for ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin (7 rate 7.6%, 95% CI, 5.5% to 10.3%, I2=57%) than the same regimen without ribavi rin (4 trials, event rate 2.6%, 95% CI, 1.0% to 6.7%, I2=66%). Estimates were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they excluded patients with cirrhosis (13 trials, pooled event rate 5.2%, 95% CI, 3.8% to 7.1%) or included some patients with cirrhosis (4 trials, pooled event rate 6.2%, 95% CI, 3.7% to 10.1% ; p for interaction=0.56 ), and there was no interaction between prior treatment experience status and rates of rash (p for interaction=0.49). HBV infection reactivation . All trials bu t one195 excluded persons coinfected with HBV infection , and no cases of HBV reactivation were reported. Adolescents Seven trials of DAA regimens in adolescents reported harms ( Table 19 ; Appendix B Tables 7 - 9).171,173,175,176,201 -203 Study characteristics were described in detail in KQ 7; four trials evaluated regimens FDA -approved for use adolescents (l edipasvir and ,175,202 sofosbuvir and ribavirin ,173 pibrentasvir171), and three trials evaluated DAA regimens recommended in adults but not approved in children (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir176,201 or ombitasvir / p aritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir203). Methods for reporting and assessing harms were generally not well described. Five trials reported no withdrawals due to adverse events ,171,173,175,176,203, and one of five trials reported a single serious adverse event (a grade 3 joint injury) in adolescents treated with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin.173 The rate of any adverse event was 27 percent in one study of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (not FDA -approved for use in adolescents)176 and 71 to 87 percent in four trials of other regimens.171,173,175,203 Rates of specific adverse events ranged from 3 to 48 percent for headache ( 7 trials ),171,173,175,176,201 -203 5 to 53 percent for fatigue ( 7 trials) ,171,173,175,176,201 -203 and 3 to 28 percent for gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) adverse events (5 trials).173,175,176,201,202 One tr ial of ledipasvir and sof osbuvir reported insomnia in 23 percent (9/40) of participants.202 Stratification by DAA regimen did not appear to explain the observed variability in adverse event estimates, though assessments were limited by the small number of trials and meth odological limitations. Key Question 9. What Is the Association Between Experiencing SVR Following Antiviral Treatment and Reduction in Risk of HCV -Related Adverse Health Outcomes ? Summary The prior review included 1 0 studies of patients in which less than 2 5 percent had Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 36 Pacific Northwest EPC cirrhosis at baseline that found SVR after interferon -based antiviral therapy associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality ( 7 studies, adjusted HR 0.12 to 0.71), liver - related mortality (5 studies, adjusted HR 0.04 to 0.22), an d HCC (4 studies, adjusted HR 0.12 to 0.36) versus no SVR. Including studies published since the prior review, SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality, liver mortality, cirrhosis, and HCC versus no SVR in studi es in which less than 25 percent of the population had cirrhosis at baseline . o All-cause mortality (1 3 studies): Pooled adjusted HR 0. 40 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.5 6, I2=52%).69,168,204 -214 o Liver mortality (4 studies): Pooled adjusted 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27, I2=0%) .204,208,210,213 o reported studies): Pooled adjusted HR 29 (95% CI, 0.23 to 0.3 8; I2=19%).168,204,207,211,214,215,217 -230 Estimates favored SVR in all studies and results were consistent when studies with potenti ally overlapping populations were excluded from analyses, when the analysis was restricted to studies that adjusted at a minimum for age, sex, genotype, and baseline fibrosis, and in stratified analyses based on duration of followup and geographic setting. For all -cause mortality, the effect of SVR was stronger in studies with followup longer than 5 years. All studies except for three evaluated SVR after interferon -based therapy; results were similar from two studies of SVR after DAA therapy , and estimates from a third study of SVR after DAA therapy were very imprecise . Evidence The prior review included 19 cohort studies that consistently found an SVR after interferon - based antiviral therapy associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality ( 10 studies , adjusted HR ranged from 0.07 to 0.39) , liver -related mortality (9 studies, adjusted HR 0.04 to 0.27) , and HCC (11 studies, adjusted hazards ratios 0.12 to 0.71) versus no SVR after 3 to 9 years of followup . Six studies in the prior review evaluated popul ations of patients with cirrhosis at baseline , and in three other studies the proportion of patients with cirrhosis at b aseline ranged from 30 to 70 percent . When results were r estricted to 10 studies in which less than 2 5 percent of persons had cirrhosis at baseline, results also indicated an association between SVR after antiviral therapy and decreased risk of all-cause mortality (7 studies, adjusted HR 0.12 to 0.71), liver-related mortality (5 studies, adjusted HR 0.04 to 0.22), and HCC (4 stud ies, adjusted HR 0.12 to 0.36). The largest study (n=16,864), which also had the fewest methodological shortcoming s, found SVR after antiviral therapy in a predominantly male, VA populati on associated with lower risk of all -cause mortality versus no SVR af ter a median of 3.8 years (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI, 0.60 to and 0.51, 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75, for genotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively ).69 Thirty cohort studies ( 30 publications) reported associations between achievin g SVR following antiviral treatment versus no SVR and clinical outcomes (Appendix B Tables 14 and Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 37 Pacific Northwest EPC 15).69,168,204 -231 Nine of the studies were included in the prior report;69,204,208 -211,213,214,222 nine other studies70,232 -238 from the prio r review were excluded because more than 25 percent of the populations had cirrhosis at baseline , and one study239 from the prior review was excluded because it did not report usable data . Sample sizes ranged from 145 to 50,886 (total N= 116,821 ), mean age ranged from 42 to 69 years, and the proportion of female participants ranged from 1.1 to 60 percent with five studies including samples that were less than 10 percent female.69,205,207,215,221 The proportion of patients with cirr hosis at baseline ranged from 0 percent to 21 percent . Seventeen studies were conducted in Japan,204,208,210,211,213,217 -220,222 -224,226 -230 seven in the U nited -207,212,215,221 two in South Korea,225,231 two in Taiwan,214,216 one in France,168 and one in the United Kingdom.209 All of the U.S. -based studies except for one212 were conducted in VA populations. Several Japanese studies also appeared to evaluate overlapping or partially overlapping populations ( Table 2 0; Appendix B Tables 14 and 15). None of the studies conducted in Asian countries reported race; among studies in the U nited States and the United Kingdom, white patients comprised 38 to 92 percent of the study population, black patients comprised 8 to 43 percent of the population, and Hispanic patients comprised 0.4 to 14 percent of the population . When ge notype was reported, genotype 1 was generally the most common (36% to 99%), with genotype 2 the second most common (8% to 52%). One study reported that 52 percent of patients were gen otype 2,231 and two studies reported large proportions (54% and 55%) of 'non -genotype 1' patients, but did not otherwise specify genotype.209,214 Three studies were prospective,168,218,224 and the others were either retrospective cohort studies or analyzed a prospectively coll ected dataset retrospectively. Twenty -six studies, including all of the studies carried forward from the prior USPSTF review, evaluated the association between SVR and clinical outcomes following treatment exclusively with interferon -based treatments.69,204,206 -214,216 -220,222 -231 Three studies focused on DAAs ,168,205,221 one study evaluated interferon -based treatments and DAAs,221 and one study did not report what type of treatment was administered (likely primarily interferon -based therapies, given study date).215 Average followup ranged from 1.5 to 10 years in all studies except for one study that described followup of at least a year.231 Twenty studies evaluated the outcome HCC ,168,204,207,211,214,215,217 -230 mortality,204,207 -210,213,214 four cohorts (in three publications) cirrhosis,206,215,216 and one study liver transplantation.207 Two studies evaluated composite outcomes related to mortality and liver outcomes,206,231 and one study assessed liver - related hospital episodes.209 All studies were rated fair quality (Appendix B Table 16 ). Altho ugh studies had to perform statistical analyses on potential confounders, 13 studies did not address all four pre -specified factors (age, sex, fibrosis stage, and genotype).206,208,210,213,216,218,220,222,224,226,227 ,230,231 No study matched patients who achieved SVR with patients who did not achieve SVR on potential confounders. Studies did not report baseline characteristics according to SVR status or reported large baseline differences between groups. Other methodological shortcomings include d failure to report missing data or attrition and unclear masking of outcome assessors. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 38 Pacific Northwest EPC All-Cause Mortality SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality versus no SVR (13 studies , pooled HR 0. 40, 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.5 6, I2=52%) (Figure 3 5).69,168, 204-214 Estimates favored SVR in all studies , and HRs ranged f rom 0.11 to 0.66. Findings were similar when three studies206-208 with potentially overlapping popul ations were excluded from the analysis (pooled HR 0.3 7, 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.5 6). The estimate was slightly weaker in ten \"fully adjusted\" studies ( defined as study methods controlled for age, sex, fibrosi s stage, and genotype at a minimum; pooled HR 0.4 2, 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.6 2) than studies with partial adjustment (pooled H R 0.29, 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.55) , but the difference was not st atistically significant ( p for interaction= 0.34) (Table 2 1). Trials with longer duration of followup (more than 5 years ) reported a stronger association between SVR after antiviral therapy and reduced risk of all -cause mortality (pooled HR 0.33, 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.46) than those with shorter followup (pooled HR 0.64, 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.74; p for interaction=0.00 3). In stratified analyses, t here was no association between geographic setting (U nited States or Europe vs . Asia, p for interaction=0. 10) or the proportion of patien ts with cirrhosis at baseline ( more than 10% vs. 0 to 10%, p for interaction=0. 58) and risk of al l-cause mortality following SVR ( Table 2 1). Patients received interferon therapy without a DAA in all studies, with the exception of one205 U.S. study conducted in a VA population and one French study168 in which patients receiv ed DAA therapy. The VA study found an SVR after DAA therapy associated with decreased risk or mortality compared with no SVR (adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.99) , though duration of followup was relatively short (1.5 years) ;205 the estimate from the French study was very imprecise (adjusted HR 1.36, 95% CI, 0.15 to 12.35) .168 Liver Mortality SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decrea sed risk of liver mortality versus no SVR (4 studies, pooled HR 0.11, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27, I2=0%) (Figure 3 6).204,208,210,213 Estimates favored SVR in a ll studies , and HR s ran ged from 0.05 to 0.13. All of the studies were conducted in Asi a in patients who received interferon therapy without a DAA with duration of follow up longer than 5 years . Estimates were very similar when studies were stratified according to whether they were fully or partially adjusted or whether the proportion of pati ents with cirrhos is at baseline was 0 to 10 percent or over 10 percent , with HR estimates ranging from 0.10 to 0.13 (Table 2 1). Cirrhosis SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased risk of cirrhosis versus no SVR (4 cohorts reported in 3 studies, pooled HR 0.36, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.40; I2=0%) (Figure 37).206,215,216 Estimates favored SVR in all studies , and HR s ranged from 0.29 to 0.4 0. Three cohorts were from the U nited States and one216 from Asia . All patients received treat ment with interferon therapy without a DAA, or the antiviral regimen was not reported215 but likely to be interfero n therapy based on the study date . Estimates were very similar when studies were stratified according to whether they were fully or partially adjusted or the proportion of patients with cirrhosis at baseli ne (Table 2 1). Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 39 Pacific Northwest EPC Hepatocellular Carcinoma SVR after antiviral therapy was associated with decreased risk of HCC versus no SVR ( 20 studies, pooled HR 0. 29, 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.3 8; I2=19%) (Figure 3 8).168,204,207,211,214,215,217 -230 Estimates favored SVR in all s tudies , and HRs ranged from 0.06 to 0.41. Findings were similar when four studies with potentially overlapping populations207,215,219,222 were excluded from the analysis ( pooled HR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.35). Poo led estimates were similar for four studies conducted in the United States and Europe (pooled HR 0.32, 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.36)168,207,215,221 and 16 studies conducted in Asia (pooled HR 0.24, 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.3 3; p for int eraction=0. 37). Pooled estimates were also very similar when studies were stratified according to whether they were fully or partially adjusted, the duration of follow up (longer or shorter than 5 years), or the proportion of patients with cirrhosis at base line (greater or less than 10%) (Table 21). Patients received or were likely to have received interferon t herapy without a DA A in all studies except for one VA study221 of DAA -only therapy, DAA plus interferon, or interferon -only therapy and one French study168 of DAA -only therapy . Like the other studies, the VA study found SVR after antiviral therapy associated with decr eased risk of HCC versus no SVR (adjusted HR 0.3 9, 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.43). Estimates were similar when the analysis was stratifie d according to receipt of a DAA -only regimen (adjusted HR 0.29, 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.37), a DAA plus interferon (adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.73), or interferon -only (adjusted HR 0.32, 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.37). The French study was also consistent with an association between SVR after DAA therapy and decreased risk of HCC , though the estimate was imprecise and not statistically si gnificant (adjusted HR 0.22, 95% CI, 0.03 to 1.76).168 Contextual Question 1. Based on Population Level Estimates, What Are Recent Trends in the Epidemiology, Prevalence, and Incidenc e of HCV Infection in the United States , Including in Primary Care Settings, Over the Past 5 to 10 Years? The incidence of HCV infection increased 3.5 -fold from 2010 to 2016, rising each year during that period.20 The annual increase was 20 percent from 2012 to 2013, 2.6 percent in 2014, 11 percent in 2015, and 22 percent in 2016. An estimated 41,200 new HCV infections occurred in 2016. The increase in HCV incidence in the U nited States has primarily been concentrated among young persons and PWID .20 From 2004 to 2010, the proportion of cases of acute HCV infection reporting injection drug use in each year ranged from 59 percent to 72 percent ; since 2011, the proportion has been at least 75 percent in each year (84% in 2014).240 Acute HCV incidence in persons 18 to 29 years of age increased from 0.4 cases per 10 0,000 in 2004 to 2.0 cases per 100,000 in 2014 and in persons 30 to 39 years of age from 0.4 cases per 100,000 to 1.7 cases per 100,000 over the same time period.240 Among persons 40 to 49 years of age , the incide nce of acute HCV infection increa sed slightly from 0.5 to 0.7 cases per 100,000 , and in persons 50 to 59 years of age incidence was unchanged at 0.2 cases per 100,000. The increase in acute HCV incidence in young persons was greater in nonurban counties (13% annually) than in urban counties (5% annually).241 Similar trends in acute HCV incidence have been reported in specif ic Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 40 Pacific Northwest EPC regions in the United States . One study found a 364 percent increase between 2006 and 2012 in HCV infection among persons 12 to 29 years of age living in the Appalachian region of the United States .21,22 Another study found that new cases of HCV infection among persons 15 to 24 years of age in Massachusetts nearly doubled from 2002 to 2009.23 Recent trends towards increase d HCV prevalence among reproductive aged (15 to 44 years) females have also been observed .24,25 Analyses of national laboratory databases (reasons for testing not available) estimate that the number of reproductive aged females with acute and past or present HCV infection doubled from 2006 to 2014,25 with an increase of 22 percent from 2011 to 2014.24 Among pregnant females who under went testing from 2011 to 2014, 0.73 percent had HCV infection.25 Over the same time period there was a 68 percent increase (from 0.19% to 0.32%) in the proportion of inf ants born to HCV -infected females .24 Similar trends have be en observed in several states. For example, in Kentucky, the rate of HCV detection among females of childbearing age incre ased 21 percent from 2011 to 2014 (from 139 to 169 per 100,000) , and the proportion of infants born to HCV -infected females increased from 0.71 percent to 1.59 percent .24 In Wisconsin Medicaid recipients, the prevalence of HCV infection increased from 0.27 percent in 2011 to 0.52 percent in 2015.242 Nationally, 29,000 females with HCV infection are estimated to give birth each year, resulting in 1 ,700 infected inf ants.25 Within th e United States., there are geographic variations in trends regarding incidence and prevalence of HCV infection. From 2004 to 2014, six states (Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Massachusetts ) reported increases in HCV incidence of 1 ,000 percent or higher.240 A positive correlation was observed between increases in acute HCV infection incidence at the state level and increases in the proportion of treatment admissions reporting opioid injection drug use. Nine states (California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee , and North Carolina) account for over half (51.9%) of persons living with HCV infection; five of these states are in the Appalachian region .243 Population level estim ates of HCV prevalence based on the 2013 to 2016 NHANES data of noninst itutionalize d civilians in the U nited States and incorporating estimates from four additional populations not included in NHANES (incarcerated persons , unsheltered homeless persons , active duty military personnel, and nursing home residents ) indicate approxima tely 4.1 (range 3.4 to 4.9) million persons positive for HCV antibody and 2.4 (range 2.0 to 2.8) million persons chronically infected.16 This is lower than an earlier estimate of total HCV prevalence that used 2003 to 2010 NHANES data (4.6 million positive for HCV anti body and 3.5 with chronic infection),13 but there were differences in esti mation methods, making it difficult to assess time trends . Based on NHANES data alone, the prevalence of chronic HCV infection decreased slightly in 2013 to 2016 to 0.84 percent (95% CI, 0.75% to 0.96%) from 1.0 percen t (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.2%) in 2003 to 2010 .18 Factors influencing the observed trends include declines in prevalence due to mortality primarily in the 1945 to 1965 birth cohort and use of more effective antiviral therapies, offset by the higher incidence of acute HCV infection in younger persons primarily related to inj ection drug use. Data to determine how recent trends in the epidemiology of acute HCV infection among young white persons have impacted the epidemiology of chronic HCV infection are not yet available. Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 41 Pacific Northwest EPC Contextual Question 2. What Are the Effects of Different Risk - or Prevalence -Based Methods for Screening for HCV Infection in Modeling Studies ? The USPSTF previously reviewe d two modeling studies that found birth -cohort screening of all persons in the U nited States born between 1945 and 1965 to be cost -effective compared with risk-based screening.8,9 Although one analysis assumed rates of progression to cirrhosis and mortality s ubstantially higher than observed in longitudinal cohorts,8 the other study utilized more conservative estimates consistent with natural history data.9 Several other cost- effectiveness analyses also found birth cohort screening in the general U.S. population to be cost - effective compared with risk based screening alone .244-246 All of these analyses were based on treatment with outdated antiviral regimens (i.e., no all DAA regimens), reducing r elevance to current practice, and did not compare expanded screening strategies versus curren tly recommended screening (risk -based plus birth cohort screening). Five studies published since the prior USPSTF modeled the cost -effectiveness of HCV screening in U.S. settings based on use of DAA regimens (Table 22 ). Two studies evaluated cost - effectiveness of screening in the general adult population,247,248 one focused on screening persons 15 to 30 years of age,249 and tw o evaluated cost -effectiveness of prenatal HCV screening.250,251 The analyses generally found expanded HCV screening strategies associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $50,000/ quality adjusted life year ( QALY ), though there was variability in the screening strategies compared and cost-effectiveness estimates, due in part to difference s in the assumptions used in each model. One analysis by Barocas et al . of HCV screening in the general adult population utilized the Hepatitis C Cost -Effectiveness (HEP -CE) model, an individual -based, stochastic Monte Carlo simulation model with an embedded Markov state transition matrix.247 It compared one time \"standard of care\" birth cohort screening of all U.S. persons born between 1945 and 1965 versus one time screening of all persons at least 18, at least 30, or at least 40 years of age. All screening strategies included targeted screening of high -risk persons. The model assumed that all cases of incident HCV infection were related to injection drug use (12 ca ses per 100 person -years), with background (not related to screening) testing rates of 33 percent in PWID and 2.6 percent to 27 percent in other persons. Treatme nt was based on sofosbuvir / velpatasvir at a cost of $23,026 per month ($0 to $38,000 in sensi tivity analyses), with an SVR rate in persons without cirrhosis of 99 percent (50 to 99% in sensitivity analyses) and in persons with cirrhosis of 93 percent (93 to 96% in sensitivity analyses). The model estimated that compared wi th birth cohort screenin g, the 18 and over strategy would identify 256,000 additional cases of HCV infection and lead to 280,000 additional cures and 4,400 fewer cases of HCC over the cohort lifetime, with an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio of $28,193/QALY. More cures than additional cases of HCV infection occurred in the model because of reinfections. Among p ersons with HCV infection, the 18 and over strategy was associa ted with an average increase in life expectancy of 0.6 8 years (0.63 QALY) compared with standard of care screening. The 18 and over strategy dominated (less costly and more effective or lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) the 30 and over or 40 and over strategies in the base Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 42 Pacific Northwest EPC analysis and remained associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of less than $40,000/QALY in one -way sensitivity analyses that assumed reduced linkage to care, absence of mortality benefit from SVR, higher HCV treatm ent costs ($130,000), lower HCV prevalence, or greater restrictions on HCV treatment (i.e., restricting treatment to persons with more advanced fibrosis), compared with the base case assumptions. The 18 and over strategy was less cost - effective in scenario s in which antiviral treatment was assumed to be half as effective ($53,500/QALY), when fibrosis progression was assumed to be half as rapid ($65,500/QALY), and when testing was assumed to be twice as inefficient (i.e., need to screen twice as many patient s to identify the same number of HCV -infected persons, $44,100/QALY). In some sensitivity analyses (e.g., high treatment costs, less rapid fibrosis progression, lower HCV prevalence , lower rates of linkage to care, greate r treatment restrictions), the 30 and over strategy was more cost -effective than the 18 and over strategy. The 30 and over strategy performed best relative to the 18 and over strategy in the decreased fibrosis ($42,800/QALY vs. $65,500/QALY) and inefficient testing ($33,900/QALY vs. $44,100 /QALY) scenarios. The 40 and over strategy was dominated in all sensitivity analyses . An analysis of screening in the general adult population by Eckman et al. compared one -time screening of all persons 18 years or older with screening of persons born betw een 1945 to 1965 (birth cohort screening) or no screening in a 2 - stage Markov simulation model.248 Unlike the cost -effectiveness analysis by Barocas et al .,247 screening strategies did not include risk -based screening. The Eckman et al. analysis also assumed lower utilities for chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis (0.79, compared with 0.94 in the other analysis), lower costs of DAA therapy ($24,270 vs. $69,078 for a full 12 week course), and higher rates of linkage to care (100% vs. 18% to 29%). It did not model HCV incidence (including reinfection) following successful treatment with antiviral therapy. Despite these differences, the Eckman et al. analysis also found expanded HCV screening to be cost -effective compared with birth cohort screening. In the Eckman et al. analysis, screening all persons 18 years of age and older was associated with an average gain of 0.0022 QALY s compared with birth cohort screening, and 0.0101 QALY s compared with no screening. The incremental cost -effectiveness of the 18 and older strategy versus birth cohort screening was $11,378/QALY , and the 18 and older strategy dominated no screening. In sensitivity analysis, the incremental cost -effectiveness r atio of the 18 and older strategy versus birth cohort screening exceeded $50,000/QALY when the HCV prevalence in the non-birth cohort was less than 0.07 percent (base case 0.29%) or when the monthly cost of antiviral therapy exceeded $28,000. Cost -effectiv eness estimates were also sensitive to the age at time of HCV infection (older age at acquisition associated with lower cost -effectiveness). An analysis based on the HEP -CE model (used in the study by Barocas et al.) estimated effects of nine one -time scr eening strategies in U.S. persons , focusing on the population 15 to 30 years of age.249 The screening strategies differed on three factors: 1) routine (screen all persons ) versus expanded targeted testing (validated HCV screening checklist used to identify high -risk persons ) versus current practice (risk -based testing in persons perceived to be at high risk, without the checklist), 2) rapid finger stick versus venipuncture, and 3) screening ordered b y physician versus by counselor or tester using standing orders. Testing rates were assumed to be lower with physician ordering and receipt of results higher with rapid testing. Current practice screening rates were assumed to be 5 percent in PWID and 3 percent otherwise. The model was based on treatment with sofosbuvir / ledipasvir or sofosbuvir / velpatasvir with the cost of a course of Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 43 Pacific Northwest EPC treatment ranging from $71,950 to $137,820 and SVR rates of 93 percent to 99 percent , depending on cirrhosis status and genotype. The model found that strategies involving rapid testing dominated strategies involving venipuncture testing. Compared with current practice, counselor -initiated, routine rapid testing identified more cases (20% vs. 5%), resulted in a greater number of patients achieving SVR (18% vs. 2%), and resulted in fewer HCV -related deaths (34% to 31%), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $71,000/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with this strategy remained below $100,000/QAL Y unless the preval ence of injection drug use was less than 0.59 percent , the HCV prevalence i n PWID was less than 16 percent , the reinfection rate was more than 26 cases per 100 person -years, or reflex confirmatory testing was performed following all reac tive venipuncture tests. Although physician -ordered, counselor -performed , expanded targeted rapid testing ($40,000/QALY) and counselor -initiated, expanded targeted testing ($44,000/QALY) were more cost -effective than counselor -initiated, routine rapid test ing, average gains in QALY s were lower with these strategies than with the counselor -initiated, routine rapid testing stra tegy (incremental differences 0.0008 to 0.0011 QALY s). Two studies focused on prenatal HCV screening.250,251 An analysis by Tasillo et al. evaluated prenatal screening using the HEP -CE model .251 The analysis compared universal one -time screening during pregnancy versus current practice (14% screened during pregnancy); both strategies lifetime testing that occurred following pregnancy. The model assumed that therapy with a DAA regimen would be offered 6 months postpartum, with a base cost of $39,600 for glecaprevir / pibrentasvir (for persons without cirrhosis) and $68,773 for sofosbuvir / velpatasvir (for persons with cirrhosis). The analysis did not include neonatal outcomes in cost -effectiveness estimates or model the lifetime of neonates born with HCV infection, but estimated the proportion of neonates identified as exposed to HCV infection. HCV prevalen ce in pregnancy was assumed to be 0.38 percent ; assumptions regarding HCV incidence, utilities associated with HCV infection, and rates of linkage to care were similar to the study by Barocas et al. on HCV screening in the general adult population. The Tasillo et al. analysis found prenatal screening associated with earlier diagnosis and time to cure of HCV infection, with 27 percent of cases achieving SVR within 5 years and 36 percent within 10 years (compared with 16% and 37%, respectively, with curren t practice). Prenatal screening was associated with a 16 percent reduction in HCV -attributable mortality over the lifetime of the cohort, and average gains of 0.002 QALY s in the entire cohort and 0.0.5 QALY s in HCV -infected persons compared with current pr actice, with an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio of $41,000/QALY. The incremental cost -effectiveness ratio was $83,000/QALY when prevalence was half (0.18%) of the ba se case assumption (0.18%) and less than or equal to $50,000/QALY when HCV testing rat es were higher (50%) in PWID, when treatment initiation rates were lower (64.5%), and when neonatal testing costs were considered. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $168,000/QALY when the rate of fibrosis progression was reduced by half (average time to cirrhosis, 70 years) and $137,000/QALY when HCV infection before cirrhosis had no associated cost or decrease in quality of life. Prenatal screening increased the identification of neonates exposed to HCV at birth from 44 percent to 92 percent . Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 44 Pacific Northwest EPC An analysis by Chaillon et al. also evaluated prenatal screening versus risk -based screening , using a closed cohort Markov model.250 The analysis assumed antiviral treatment after pregnancy with a DAA regimen (base cost $25,000 for a full treatment course) and a background testing and linkage rate of 5 percent per year; it did not model costs or effects on the neonate. Compared with th e analysis by Tasillo et al., base case assumptions in Chaillon et al. included higher HCV prevalence (0.73% vs. 0.38%), lower antiviral treatment costs ($25,000 vs. $39,600 in persons with cirrhosis and $68,773 in persons without cirrhos is), and lower uti lities for F1 to F3 fibrosis in HCV -infected persons (0.83 -0.86 vs. 0.94). In addition, the model appeared to assume that all persons diagnosed with HCV infection would be linked to care and receive treatment. In the Chaillon et al. analysis, prenatal scr eening was estimated to result in the detection and treatment of 7,000 additional females , with an average gain of 0.019 QALY and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2,826/QALY, compared with risk -based screening. Incremental cost - effectiveness rat ios remained below $5,000/QALY in sensitivity analyses based on alternative treatment eligibility scenarios, lower HCV prevalence rates (0.03% to 0.04%), lower fibrosis progression rates (21% cirrhosis at 35 years), lower SVR (85%), higher baseline rates o f diagnosis and linkage to care (40%), higher loss to followup (50% per year), and higher background testing (20% per year). Screening was est imated to result in detection and treatment of an estimated 300 children born to mothers infected by HCV. Identif ication and treatment of HCV infection prior to pregnancy could result in the additional benefit of reducing the risk of mother -to-child transmission following successful treatment.252 However, we identified no study on the cost -effectiveness of screening strategies aimed at women prior to pregnancy. Contextual Question 3. What Is the Effect of Antiviral Treatments on Behavioral Outcomes? No trial of DAA therapy included in this report reported beha vioral outcomes . Two open -label studies of HCV -infected PWID found receipt of interferon -based therapy associated with reductions in some self -reported drug and substance use behaviors.253,254 A non-randomized study (n=1 24) found interfer on-based therapy associated with reduce d likelihood of injection drug use equipment sharing (adjusted OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99) compared with no treatment at median followup of 1.8 years after adjusting for age, sex, housing status, education level, e mployment status, and social functioning level , but no effect on injection drug use in the last 30 days (adjusted OR 1.06, 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.21 ).254 A before -after analysis of persons with current or past injection drug use ( n=93 ) found decreased likelih ood of injection drug use (unadjusted OR 0.89, 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.95) and alcohol use (unadjusted OR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.77) 24 weeks after completing interferon -based therapy compared with prior to therapy , but no difference in likelihood of injection drug use equipment sharing (unadjusted OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.07).253 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 45 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 4. Discussion Summary of Review Findings This report updates prior reviews on HCV screening and treatments in adults, and interventions to prevent mother -to-child transmission .2,3,90 It expands upon the prior reviews by adding evide nce on adolescents and addressing the benefits and harms of currently recommended all - oral, direct ac DAA regimen s. As in the prior USPSTF review ,2 we found no direct evidence on the clinical benefits of screening for HCV versus no t screening or on the yield of repeat screening. We also found no new evidence to better eva luate harms of screening; the prior review included studies suggesting potential negative psychological and social effects of screening, but the quality of the evidence was poor. Other evidence reviewed for this update is summarized in Table 23. Since the prior USPSTF recommendation, there has been a major shift in antiviral therapy to use of all-oral DAA regimens without interferon .74 At the time of the prior review, standard antiviral therapy for HCV infection for genotype 1 infection was transitioning to boceprevir or telaprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (SVR rates 2 interferon plus ribavirin (SVR rates 68% to 78%).90 New evidence indicates that SVR rates with currently recommended all -oral DAA regimens are substantially higher than with prior therapies . Pooled SVR r ates ranged from 95.5 percent to 98.9 percent across genotypes; for the three most commo n genotypes in the U nited States (1, 2, and 3), pooled SVR rates ranged from 95.5 percent to 98.9 percent . Evidence was most robust for genotype 1 infection (32 trials) , the most frequent genotype in the U nited States (approximately 75%), followed by genotype 4 infection (10 trials) ; data were limited for other genotypes (4 to 6 trials each) . SVR estimates generally exceeded 95 percent when analyse s were stratified according to DAA regimen, study quality, inclusion of patients with cirrhosis at baseline (with the exception of genotype 3 infection, which was associated with a lower SVR rate in one trial that included patients with cirrhosis),165 geographic setting, prior experience with o lder antiviral regimens, and use of ribavirin. Few trials directly compared a current DAA regimen versus placebo or an older antiviral regimen, but those available supported high DAA regimen effectiveness . In one trial of patients with mixed genotype infec tion, the SVR rate was 99 percent with sofosbuvir / velpatasvir and 0 percent with placebo,139 and in two trials of patients with mixed genotype infection the SVR rate was 98 percent to 99 percent with ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir (with or without ribavirin) and 66 percent to 80 percent with telaprevir / pegyla ted interferon / ribavirin.137 Evidence on DAA regimens in adolescents is limited but indicates SVR rates similar to those obs erved in adults (97% to 100%).171,173,175,176,201 -203 Some trials of DAA regimens in adolescents evaluated regimens that are not FDA -approved for use in adolescents but that are recommended in adults. Evidence also indicates that current DAA regimens are associa ted wi th fewer harms than older interferon -containing therapies ; the duration of treatment is also shorter at 12 weeks (8 weeks for glecaprevir / pibrentasvir or ledipasvir / sofosbuvir in persons with genotype 1 infection who are non-black, HIV -uninfect ed, and whose HCV RNA level is under 6 million IU/mL )74 compared with prior interferon -containing regimens (24 to 48 weeks) . The prior review found therapies Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 46 Pacific Northwest EPC with interferon associated with rates of serious advers e events of 8.5 percent to 16 percent and withdrawal due to adverse events of 12 percent to 15 percent .90 Interferon -based therapies were also associated with high rates of fatigue (51% to 64%), depression (19% to 22%), influenza -like adverse events . Boceprevir and telaprevir containing regimens were associated with increased risk of hematologi cal adverse events compared with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Four new randomized trials found DAA regimens associated with slightly increased risk of any adverse event (ARD 8%, for a number needed to harm [NNH] of approximately 13) and nausea (ARD 4%, for a N NH of approximately 25) versus placebo , with no difference in risk of serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or specific adverse events ( e.g., diarrhea, fatigue, headache, or anemia).139,151,164,187 Two trials found DAA regimens associated with decreased risk of any adverse event versus triple therapy with telaprevir (ARD 34%, for a number needed to avoid harm [NNAH ] of approximately 3), serious adverse events (ARD 8%, NNAH approximately 12), withdrawal due to adverse events (ARD 9%, NNAH approximately 11), and specific adverse events (NNAH for fatigue, nausea, anemia, and rash ranged from approximately 3 to 6).137 Across DAA trials, the pooled rate of any adverse e vent was relatively high at 73.3 percent , but rates of serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events were low ( 1.9% and 0. 4%, respectively) relative to older interferon -containing regimens . Pooled rates of specific adverse events ranged from 2.4 percent for anemia to 18.4 percent for headache , also lower than observed with interferon -containing therapies . Ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir / dasabuvir with ribavirin was generally associated with increased rates of adverse events compared wi th the same regimen without ribavirin , with a marked increase in risk of anemia (pooled rates 8.3% vs. 0.8%) . All DAA trials in this report excluded patients with HBV co infection , and no cases of HBV reactivation were reported. One cohort study of VA patie nts with HCV infection treated with a DAA regimen (n=34,632) that did not meet inclusion criteria reported an HBV reactivation rate of 30.0 per 1 ,000 person -years.255 Eleven percent of patients in this cohort were surface antigen of HBV -positive at baseline. The HBV reactivation rate with DAA therapy was similar to the reactivation rate with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (25.4 per 1 ,000 person -years, p=0.8). Direct evidence on the effects of antiviral therapy on clinical outcomes is limited. Although several randomized trials found interferon therapy associated with decreased risk of HCC compared with no antiviral therapy, they did not meet inclusion criteria for this report because they focused on patients with cirrhosis at baseline or used a non -standard (i.e. indefinite duration of treatment) regimen.127-134 Trials of DAA therapies were not designed to assess effects on mortality or other long -term clinical outcomes. Ten DAA trials report ed improvements in some quality of life and functional outcomes follow ing treatment compared with prior to treatment , but differences were small , studies were open -label, and there was no non -DAA comparison group, making it difficult to interpret more subjective outcomes like these .135-137 Large cohort studies conducted on a large national VA database in which approximately 20 percent of patients had cirrhosis at baseline found DAA therapy associated with reduced r isk of cardiovascular events, HCC , and mortality versus no therapy after adjusting for potential confounders, with effects similar to or stronger than interferon -based therapy.169,170 A French study found no association between DAA therapy versus no antiviral therapy in risk of all -cause mortality or HCC in the subgroup of patients without cirrhos is at baseline, but there were few events , and estimates were imprecise.168 In this study, when patients with cirrhosis ( approximately 33% of the population) were included in the analysis, DAA therapy was associated with decreased risk of all -cause Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 47 Pacific Northwest EPC mortality (adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.70), liver -related mortality 0.39, 95% 0.21 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.93). No study evaluated effects of DAA therapies on behaviors associated with HCV acquisition . There was limited evidence t hat interferon -based therapies are not associated with increased injection drug use behaviors, and may be associated with reductions in some behaviors.253,254 No study evaluated effects of DAA therapy on HCV transmission.256 Such studies w ould be difficult to design and carry out , but assessments of potential transmission effects could be informed by modeling studies .257,258 One study that modeled effects on transmission risk estimated that among PWID, decreasing HCV prevalence in half within 15 years would requi re increasing the proportion of patients treated 2 - to 15 -fold, depending on t he baseline HCV prevalence.259 In lieu of limited direct evidence on the effects of antiviral therapy on clinical outcomes , cohort studies of SVR after antiviral therapy versus no SVR may help to understand potential clini cal effects . Our findings of a consistent association between SVR after antiviral therapy and improved clinical out comes were consistent with the prior review .90 Moreover, our findings may be more applicable to screening because we excluded previously utilized studies in which a high proportion of patients had cirrhosis at baseline. SVR after antiviral therapy (primarily interferon - based therapy) was associated with decreased risk of all -cause mortality (pooled adjusted HR 0.40, 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.5 6), liver mortality (pooled adjusted HR 0.11, 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27), cirrhosis (pooled 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.40), and HCC (pooled adjusted HR 0. 29, 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.3 8). Evidence was most robust for all -cause -mortality and HCC (reported in 13 and 20 studies, respectively), and less robust for liver mortality and cirrhosis (reported in 4 studies each). Findings were consistent when studies were stratified according to how well they adjusted for potential confounders, duration of followup , and geographic setting (United States or Europe vs . Asia) , though effects on mortality were stronger in studies with lo nger followup . Although most studies on the association between SVR after antiviral therapy and clinical outcomes evaluated interferon -based therapy, r esults were similar in two studies of SVR after DAA therapy ,205,221 with one study showing similar effects of DAA and interferon regimens on HCC risk. Estimates from a third study of SVR after DAA therapy were very imprecise. This is consistent with a recent systematic review that found no evidence for differential hepatocellular occurrence or recurrence risk following SVR from DAA or interferon -based therapy, though most studies in th at review evaluated patient s with cirrhosis or a history of HCC .260 Our finding s regarding the benefits and h arms of current DAA regimens were consistent with a recent systematic review that also reported high SVR rates (greater than 95%) in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without c irrhosis, high SVR rates but limited evidence for other HCV genotypes, low rates of serious adverse eve nts and treatment discontinuation rates , and higher adverse event rates with ribavirin .73 Our results are also consisten t with a systematic review that found insufficient evidence from clinical trials to determine effects of DAA regimens on HCV - related mortality and morbidity ;261 unlike th at review, we also evaluat ed the indirect chain of evidence linking DAA therapy with clinical outcomes. Our review is consistent with prior reviews that found a consistent association between an SVR after antiviral therapy and reduced risk of mortality and HCC .72,260,262 -264 Our review differs from prior reviews in focusing on populations more likely to be identified by screening, by excluding studies in which a high Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 48 Pacific Northwest EPC proportion of patients had cirrhosis, and by restricting inclusion to curre ntly recommended DAA regimens. One review on effec ts of antiviral therapy on extra hepatic manifestations of HCV infection found SVR after antiviral therapy associated with increased likelihood of cryoglobulinemia vasculitis remission and malignant B -cell l ymphoproliferative disease response, outcomes not considered in our review because they relate to symptomatic and uncommon conditions.262 It also found attaining SVR associated with reduced risk of insuli n resistance and a protective e ffect on diabetes incidence; we restricted analysis of the association between SVR versus no SVR to mortality and long -term hepatic outcomes and did not i dentify any studies on the effects of DAA therapy versus no therapy on diabetes . New evidence on interventions to reduce the risk of mother -to-infant transmission of HCV was limited and did not change the conclusion from the prior review that no intervention has been clearly demonstrated to reduce risk.3 All studies were observational; in addition, we excluded most of the studies in the prior review because they were poor quality and did not conduct multivariate analyse s. Studies on the effects of cesarean versus vaginal delivery (5 studies, 1 new)107 and breastfeeding versus no breastfeeding (3 studies, 1 new)107 continued to show inconsistent effects on risk of mother -to-child transmission. Although use of internal fetal monitoring and prolonge d rupture of membranes were both associated with markedly increased risk of mother -to-child transmission, each was evaluated in only 1 study.104 Evidence to determine the yield of alternative screening strategies remains limited. Although one new study found that risk-based sc reening would identify slightly more HCV cases and require testing of fewer patients than birth cohort screening, this was based on a retrospective analysis and the assumption of perfect implementation of risk -based testing, wh ich has not been attained in cli nical practice.99 Modeling studies suggest that expanded screening strategies may be cost - effective in the general population as well as in pregnant females . Two studies found expanded screening of all persons 18 years and older associated with increment al cost -effectivenes s ratios under $30,000/QALY compared with birth cohort screening, despite differen t assumptions regarding utilities associated with chronic HCV virus infection states, costs of DAA therapy, and rates of linkage to care. I n most sensitivity analyses, i ncrem ental cost -effectiveness ratios remained less than $50,000/QA LY.247,248 Another study found routine HCV screening of persons 15 to 30 years of age associated with incremental cost -effectiveness ratios less than $50,000/QALY under certain scenarios.249 Two m odeling studies found routine prenatal screening associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $50,000/QALY versus current practice, though there was more variability in estimates ($2,826/QALY and $41,000/QAL Y).250,251 Both studies assumed that antiviral treatment was withheld until after childbirth and did not attempt to model effects on neonatal costs or outcomes. A factor complicating interpretation of the cost -effectiveness analyses are marked differences in base-case assumptions regarding costs of DAA therapy (range approximately $25,000 [similar to the current cost of a full course of therapy with a generic DAA regimen]265 to over $100,000), though expanded HCV screening appeared cost -effective even in analyses that assumed high DAA thera py costs. C osts of DAA therapy a re expected to decline further ,266-268 which would further enhance the cost -effectiveness of expanded screening s trategies . Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 49 Pacific Northwest EPC Limitations Our report has potential limitations. Because there were few trials of current DAA regimens versus placebo or older antiviral therapies, we utiliz ed non-randomized trials of DAA therapies , including trials without a non -DAA therapy comparison group. Pooled SVR rates derived from such t rials were considered highly informative because SVR rates are very objective , and SVR rates without treatmen t are close to zero. However, more subjective outcomes such as quality of life, function, and adverse events are more difficult to interpret in the absence of randomization or a comparison group . SVR is a well -established marker for sustained vir al clearance (HCV infection cure) but is an intermediate (non-clinical) outcome. There was little evidence directly evaluating effects of antiviral therapies versus no antiviral therapy on clinical outcomes, due in part to the long duration required to evaluate effects on mortal ity and other long -term sequelae of HCV infection and ethical consideration s related to withholding recommended treatment in randomized trials . Therefore, we included cohort studies on the association between SVR versus antiviral therapy versus no SVR and effects on clinical outcomes . Because s uch studies are susceptible to resid ual confounding if other factors associated with achieving an SVR also predict better outcomes, we restricted inclusion to studies that reported multivariate risk estimates and performed stratified analyses based on the degree to which studies adjusted for potential confounders.269 No trial of DAA therapy was conducted in screen -detected patients , and few trials reported presence or severity of baseline symptoms. In order to evaluate effectiveness of DAA therapies in populations likely to be identified by screening, we focused on studies in which patients with cirrhosis, who are more likely to be symptomatic, were excluded, or in which the proportion with cirrhosis was small. Although we inclu ded trials of patients previously treated with interferon -based therapies o r boceprevir or telaprevir with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, who would not be identified by screening, such patients may be asymptomatic or mildly asymptomatic , and SVR rates were similar in treatment -na\u00efve and -experien ced patients. Trials of DAA t herapy could overestimate SVR rates compared with typical clinical practice. However, observational studies, including a study of difficult to treat persons in a safety net health system, report SVR rates of 90 percent , or only modestly lower than observed in the trials.270,271 We did not assess effects of counseling or immunizations on clinical outcomes in persons diagnosed with HCV infection, though prior reviews found no evidence to estimate effects,91 and no study evaluated effects of DAA treatments on HCV transmissi on. We excluded studies of patients co infected with HBV or HIV and with advanced renal disease since manage ment of these conditions was determined to be outside the scope of screening. We excluded non -English language articles, which could result in language bias, though we identified no non -English language studies that woul d have met inclusion criteria. We di d not search for studies published only as abstracts. We did not formally a ssess for publication bias using graphical or statistical methods to detect small sample effects due to the small number of randomized trials meeting inclusion criteria; the usefuln ess of such methods when assessing event rates (rather than risk estimates) is uncertain. Emerging Issues/Next Steps All DAA regimens currently recommended were approved by the FDA since the prior review. DAA regimens continue to evolve and treatment guid elines are regularly updated.74 Several Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 50 Pacific Northwest EPC newer DAA regimens are pangenotypic, meaning that they are effective across all genotyp es,75 and most currently recommended DAA regimens do not use of velpatasvir / voxilaprevir) have been approved by the FDA, one regimen (sofosbuvir / velpat asvir / voxilaprevir) was developed for use in previously treated persons with resistant virus .272 Advantages of pangenot ypic regimens include elimination of the need for genotyping and simplified selection of therapy . Costs of current DAA regimens has been a barrier to treatment but competition and negotiated pricing have reduced prices.266,267 Another issue is the shift towards management of HCV infection in primary care settings rather than in specialty settings, potentially facilitating access to treatment. Initial studies indicate that treatment in primary care settings is associated with similar outcomes as treatment in specialty settings, though more data are needed .78,79 Relevance for Priority Populations , Particularly Racial/Ethnic Minorities and Older Adults In the 2003 to 2010 NHANES survey, persons 40 to 49 years of age (OR 6.0, 95 % CI, 3.2 to 11.1) and those 50 to 59 years of age (OR 9.5, 95% CI, 5.3 to 16.8) were more likely to have HCV infection than persons 20 to 39 years of age.18 Subgroup analyses from trials of cur rently recommended DAA therapies indicate similar effectiveness in old er (over 55 or over 65 years of age) versus younger adul ts (Table 1 3). Older pa tients who acquired HCV infection as a young adult are more likely to have more advanced disease due to longer duration of infection , and the HCV -related mortality rate is highest in persons 55 to 74 years of age. T herefore, antiviral therapy may have grea ter impact on clinical outcomes in older patients .273 Subgroup analyses from trials of current DAA therapies also indicate similar effectiveness among different racial and ethnic groups. An analysis of the national VA ERCHIVES database (n=21,095) that did not meet inclusion criteria found that SVR rates with DAA regimens were similar in black patients (90%), Hispanic patients (86%), white patients (90%), and Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaska Nat ive patients (91%).271 However, black patients and Hispanic patients were less likely to achieve SVR than white patients after adjusting for baseline characteristics (OR 0.77, p<0.001 and OR 0 .76, p<0.007, respectively). Most trials of DAA therapies have excl uded persons with current drug use or those receiving treatment for opioid use disorder. However, five trials included in this report of persons with current or recent use of methadone or buprenorphine for opioid use disorder reported SVR rates that ranged from 90 to 100 percent.149,150,167,192 This is consistent with a systematic review that included observational studies , which found a pooled SVR rate of DAA treatment of almost 90 percent among patients with current or recent injection drug use.274 A syste matic review of 57 studies found a 5 -year HCV reinfection rate of 10.67 percent in PWID following SVR, compared with 0.95 percent in non -PWID, indicating the need for followup after treatment in this population.275 Current guidelines do not consider ongoing injection drug use a contraindication to DAA therapy.74 Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 51 Pacific Northwest EPC Although DAA therapy appears similarly effective in adolescents and adults, only t hree antiviral therapies (ledip FDA - appro ved for use in adolescents . Though DAA t reatment options in this population are currently limited, a number of trials of DAA regimens in a dolescents are ongoing.276 Antiviral therapy is currently not recommended in pregnancy. However, prenatal screening could identify HCV -infected women who could benefit from treatment following pregnancy , facilitate testing of infants , and potentially prevent HCV transmission during subsequent pregnancies . Identification of HCV -infected women prior to pregnancy in order to initiate antiviral therapy could be a strategy to reduce risk of mother -to-child transmission, but has not yet been studied. Future Research Research is needed to better understand the association between use of current DAA therapy and clinic al outcome s. Long -term randomized trials of treatment versus no treatment would be ethically challenging and difficult to carry out. Rather , large cohort studies that measure important confounders could be highly informative for addressing this question. Trials and cohort studies that measure effects on quality of life, function, and extrahepatic effects of HCV infection (e.g., renal function , cardiovascular effects, or diabetes) would also be helpful for understanding effects of DAA regimens on shorter -term clinical outcomes. Studies on the association between SVR after DAA therapy and clinical outcomes would help to verify the link between SVR and clinical outcomes with current therapies . Additional studies would be helpful for confirming the effectiveness of DAA regimens in adolescen ts and to identify additional regimens that could be used in this population .276 Studies are also neede d to understand risks of HCV reinfe ction following DAA ther apy and optimal treatmen t strategies. Research is also needed to identify labor management practices (e.g., prolonged rupture of membranes or use of internal fetal m onitori ng) and other strategies (e.g., identification and treatment of HCV infection prior to pregnancy) on risk of mother -to-child transmission. Well -designed prospective studies are needed to understand the effects of different HCV screening strategies, includi ng repeat screening, on diagnostic yield. Conclusions The USPSTF previously determined that HCV screening is highly accurate. Currently recommended all-oral DAA r egimens are associated with very high SVR rates (9 5.5% to 9 8.9% across genotypes ) and few harms relative to older antiviral therapies . An SVR after antiviral therapy is associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with no SVR after adj usting for potential confounders. Direct evidence on the benefits of HCV screening remains unavailable ; direct evidence on the effects of antiviral therapy on clinical outcomes remains limited but indicates improved long -term outcomes .

Analytic Framework and Key Questions Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 73 Pacific Northwest EPC 1a. Does screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents and adults without known abnormal liver enzyme levels reduce HCV -related mortality and morbidity or affect quality of life? 1b. Does prenatal screening for HCV infection reduce risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection? 2. What is the effectiveness of different risk - or prevalence -based methods for screening for HCV infection on clinic al outcomes? 3. What is the yield (number of new diagnoses per tests performed) of one -time versus repeat screening or alternative screening strategies for HCV infection, and how does the screening yield vary in different risk groups? 4. What are the harms of screening for HCV infection (e.g., anxiety and labeling)? 5. What are the effects of interventions during labor and delivery or the perinatal period on risk of vertical transmission of HCV infection? 6. What is the effectiveness of currently recommen ded antiviral treatments in improving health outcomes in patient s with HCV infection? 7. What is the effectiveness of currently recommended antiviral treatments in achieving a sustained virologic response in patients with HCV infection? 8. What are the harms of currently recommended antiviral treatments? 9. What is the association between experiencing sustained virologic response following antiviral treatment and reduction in risk of HCV -related adverse health outcomes? Note: The numbers in the figure c orrespond to the numbers of the Key Questions. * Includes persons without abnormal laboratory values. Adolescents are defined as those ages 12 to 17 years. Excludes persons living with HIV, transplant recipients, and patients with renal failure. Defined as HCV antibody testing with confirmatory HCV RNA testing as indicated. Includes interventions that may affect vertical transmission of HCV, such as cesarean delivery, amniocentesis, fetal monitori ng, management of ruptured membranes, breastfeeding, treatment.

Screening strategies and yield Prior review: k=5 studies (n=8,044) New evidence: k=1 study (n=5,917) The prior review included 5 studies that found risk -based screening associated with sensitivities of >90% and numbers needed to screen to identify 1 case of HCV infection of <20. One new study found that perfect application of risk-based guidelines would identify 82% of HCV cases with a number needed to screen to identify one case of HCV infection of 14.6, while applying a birth cohort strategy would result in 76% of cases identified a number neede d to screen of 28.7. Reasonable consistent and precise. Fair Studies were retrospective and in some studies significant proportions of pati ents were not tested. No studies of the yield of one-time versus repeat screening, alternative screening strategies in different risk groups, or the yield of currently recommended screening versus expanded screening strategies. Low Most studies conducted in high - prevalence settings. One study assumed perfect application of risk -based screening, which has not been attainable. KQ 4. Harms of screening Prior review: k=5 studies (n=288) New evidence: No new studies Poor -quality evidence from the prior review suggested potential negative psychological and social effects of screening .

Effect of treatment on health outcomes - Adults Prior review: NA (outdated regimens) New evidence: k=37 (34 trials [n=4,434], 2 pooled analyses [n=2,706], and 3 observational studies [n=58,892]) Two pooled analyses of 3 and 4 trials each and data from 3 other trials not included in pooled analyses found small, short -term improvements in quality of life scale scores after compared with before DAA therapy. In 31 DAA trials reporting short -term (<1 year) mortality, there were no deaths in 21 trials; mortality was low in the remaining 10 trials (0.4% [17/3,848] overall.) Two large observational studies found use of both DAA associated with lower rates of cardiovascular events and hepatocellular cancer. These associations were not found in a third, smaller observatio nal study with shorter duration of followup. Consistent, imprecise Fair Trials reporting quality of life and function were not randomized, used an open -label design, and did not have a non -DAA comparison group. Trials provided short - term followup, and we re not designed to assess health outcomes. Event rates for mortality were low across studies, and other health outcomes were not widely reported. Evidence on long -term clinical outcomes was limited to 3 observational studies. Low Trials did not enroll a high proportion of patients with cirrhosis at baseline and evaluated current DAA regimens. Evidence on effects on hepatocellular cancer and cardiovascul ar events was primarily derived from a VA database that included few female subjects (3 - 4%). KQ 6. Effect of treatment on health outcomes - Adolescents k=5 (3 trials [n=230] and 2 post-hoc observational studies [n=152]) There were no deaths in 3 trials of DAA regimens reporting short -term mortality. Sofosbuvir with ledipasvir or ribavirin and glecaprevir with pibrentasvir were associated with small improvements in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory scores compared to baseline. Cannot determine (for quality of life); imprecise Fair Trials were not designed to assess long -term health outcomes. The only evidence on quality of life outcomes is based on a post -hoc analysis of trial data. Low One trial evaluated a DAA regimen not FDA-approved for use in adolescents. Table 23.

Estimates were consistent in subgroup analyses based on study quality, geographic setting, fibrosis status, prior treatment experience, and other factors . Results were also similar in trials that stratified patients according to age , sex, race or ethnicity, or treatment -experience . Consistent; precise Good All studies were industry -funded. Most DAA trials did not include a non -DAA comparison group. Evidence was most robust for genotype 1 and more limited for genotypes 2 through 6. High SVR rates based on currently recommended DAA regimens. Trials did not enroll a high proportion of pati ents with cirrhosis at baseline. Most trials enrolled predominantly white participants.

Criteria for Assessing Internal Validity of In dividual Studies Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 205 Pacific Northwest EPC Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) and Cohort Studies Criteria: Initial assembly of comparable groups: For RCTs: Adequate randomization, including first concealment and whether potential confounders were distributed equally among groups For cohort studies: Consideration of potential confounders, with either restriction or measurement for adjustment in the analysis; consideration of inception cohorts Maintenance of comparable groups (includes attrition, cross -overs, adherence, contamination) Important differe ntial loss to followup or overall high loss to followup Measurements: equal, reliable, and valid (includes masking of outcome assessment) Clear definition of interventions All important outcomes considered Analysis: adjustment for potential confounders for cohort studies or intention -to treat analysis for RCTs Definition of ratings based on above criteria: Good: Meets all criteria: Comparable groups are assembled initially and maintained throughout the study (followup 80%); reliable and valid measurement instruments are used and applied equally to all groups; interventions are spelled out clearly; all important outcomes are considered; and appropriate attention to confounders in analysis. In addition, intention -to-treat analysis is used for RCTs. Fair: Studies are graded \"fair\" if any or all of the following problems occur, without the fatal flaws noted in the \"poor\" category below: Generally comparable groups are assembled initially, but some question remains whether some (although not major) differences occurred with followup; measurement instruments are acceptable (although not the best) and generally applied equally; some but not all important outcomes are considered; and some but not all potential confounders are accounted for. Intention -to-treat analysis is used for RCTs. Poor: Studies are graded \"poor\" if any of the following fatal flaws exists: Groups assembled initially are not close to being comparable or maintained throughout the study; unreliable or invalid measurement instruments are used or not applied equally among groups (including not masking outcome assessment); and key confounders are given little or no attention. Intention -to-treat analysis is lacking for RCTs. Systematic Reviews Criteria: Comprehensiveness of sources considered/search strategy used Standard appraisal of included studies Validity of conclusions Recency and relevance (especially important for systematic reviews) Definition of ratings based on above criteria: Good: Recent, relevant review with comprehensive sources and search strategies; explicit and relevant selection criteria; standard appraisal of included studies; and valid conclusions . Fair: Recent, relevant review that is not clearly biased but lacks comprehensive sources and search strategies . Poor: Outdated, irrelevant, or biased review without systematic search for studies, explicit selection criteria, or standard appraisal of studies . Appendix A6. Criteria for Assessing Internal Validity of In dividual Studies Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection 206 Pacific Northwest EPC Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Criteria: Screening test relevant, available for primary care, and adequately described Credible reference standard, performed regardless of test results Reference standard interpreted independently of screening test Indeterminate results handled in a reasonable manner Spectrum of patients included in study Sample size Reliable screening test Definition of ratings based on above criteria: Good: Evaluates relevant available screening test; uses a credible reference standard; interprets reference standard independently of screening test; assesses reliability of test; has f ew or handles indeterminate results in a reasonable manner; includes large number (greater than 100) of broad - spectrum patients with and without disease. Fair: Evaluates relevant available screening test; uses reasonable although not best standard; interprets reference standard independent of screening test; has moderate sample size (50 to 100 subjects) and a \"medium\" spectrum of patients. Poor: Has a fatal flaw , such as: uses inappropriate reference standard; improperly administers screening test; biased ascertainment of reference standard; has very small sample size or very narrow selected spectrum of patients.

Lanier, MD, MPH*; Peter Holck, PhD, MPH; Gretchen Ehrsam Day, MPH*; and Charles Key, MD, PhD\u00a7 ABSTRACT. Objective. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence of cancer in Alaska Native (AN) children (under age 20). Although severalstudies have compared differences in cancer incidencebetween white and black children, few have examinedcancer among Alaska Natives/American Indians. Weknow of no published article describing cancer incidencein AN children. We compared our findings with those ofAmerican Indian children of New Mexico and of Alaskawhite children. Data on mortality, survival, and preva-lence are also included. Alaska Native is the term usedcollectively for the inhabitants whose ancestors occupiedthe area before European contact of what is now the stateof Alaska. Alaska Natives include Eskimo, Indian, andAleut groups. Although the 3 major groups differ inculture, language, and probably genetics, there are simi-larities in numerous social and economic indicators. TheNorthern Eskimo of Alaska (Inupiat) are related to Ca-nadian and Greenland Inuit. Indians in Alaska includeAthabaskan (in the interior of the state), who share com-monalities with Canadian Athabaskan as well as withNavajo and Apache in the southwestern United States.Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian groups reside primarily inthe southeast panhandle of the state. The panhandleIndian groups are similar to those of British Columbia. Methods. Data on cancer incidence are from the Alaska Native Tumor Registry, 1969-1996. We studiedchildren under age 20 to make our results comparable tonational data as presented in the National Cancer Insti-tute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results(SEER) Pediatric Monograph. Population data for AN arebased on census data and Indian Health Service interc-ensal estimates. Data for US whites and New MexicoIndians are from the National Cancer Institute's SEERprogram. Calculations were made using SEERStat soft-ware. Data for Alaska whites are for the years 1996-2000.(The Alaska Cancer Registry has collected data for allAlaskans only since 1996). Odds ratios (ORs) of rateswith 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results. The rate among all AN children (both sexes) for all cancers combined is similar to that of US whites(OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.8-1.1). Examination of childhood can-cer rates by ethnicity, however, reveal that rates are sig-nificantly lower for Indian (OR: 0.6; children.For most International Classification of Childhood Can-cers groups, incidence rates for AN children are alsosimilar to those of US whites. However, AN children are at significantly higher risk for hepatic ethnic group, rates for hepatocellularcarcinoma are significantly high only for Eskimo. Ratesfor all AN children are of 5 years of data, rates for Alaska whitechildren do not seem to differ from those of US whitechildren. Because of our findings of differences betweenAN and US whites, we reviewed data of other relevantpopulations, specifically American Indian data from theNew Mexico SEER registry. Using SEER data and SEERsoftware, we calculated rates for New Mexican AmericanIndians (NMAI) and compared them with US white rates. Rates for all cancers combined among NMAI are signif-icantly lower than for US white (OR: 0.8). However,similar to AN children, the rate among NMAI for retino-blastoma is higher compared with US whites (OR: 2.5;95% CI:1.4-4.5). Similar to AN, NMAI also for mortality rate among ANchildren is lower but not significantly lower than that ofUS white children (28.6 vs 37.3 per million). Conclusions. Comparison of AN rates for all cancers combined are similar to those of US and Alaska whitechildren but seem higher than those of NMAI. Differ-ences between AN and US whites exist for select Inter-national Classification of Childhood Cancers groups.The most striking rate differences are found in hepatictumors, largely because of elevated rates of hepatitisB-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. All children inour study with hepatocellular carcinoma were hepatitis Bantigen positive. A statewide hepatitis B virus immuni-zation program was begun in late 1982. Although 16children who were born before 1983 developed hepato-cellular carcinoma, no children who were born in the 20years since hepatitis B immunization was institutedamong infants have received a diagnosis of hepatocellu-lar carcinoma, a significant difference. Comparing ANand US white childhood cancer rates after removing hep-atocellular carcinoma cases from both populations re-sults in an OR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-1.0). Thus, if no increasein other childhood cancers occurs in the coming genera-tions, then rates for childhood cancer may soon be sig-nificantly lower than those in US white children. Ratesare low for all lymphomas, largely because of very lowrates of Hodgkin's disease. Rates are also low for neuro-blastoma. It is reassuring that rates for AN children arenot in excess and do not seem to be increasing.

Compared with cancers that occur in adults, childhood cancers are rare, comprising only 1.0% of all cancers in the United States. How- ever, cancer is the number 1 cause of disease-relateddeaths in children. 1,2Childhood cancer comprises a variety of malignancies with incidence varyingworldwide by age, sex, ethnicity, and geography. 3 These variations in the incidence of cancer, particu-larly those among racial/ethnic groups and/or ge-ography, have provided important insights intocancer etiology. Although several studies have com-pared differences in cancer incidence between whiteand black children, few have examined canceramong Alaska Natives/American Indians. 1,4We know of no published article describing cancer inci-dence in Alaskan Native (AN) children. Alaska Native is the term used collectively for the inhabitants whose ancestors occupied the area beforeEuropean contact of what is now the state of Alaska.AN include Eskimo, Indian, and Aleut groups. Al-though the 3 major groups differ in culture, lan- guage, and probably genetics, there are similarities innumerous social and economic indicators. The Es-kimo of Alaska are composed of 2 main groups, theInupiat and the Yup 'ik. The Inupiat are related to Canadian and Greenland Inuit. Indians in Alaskainclude Athabaskan (in the interior of the state), andTlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian groups, who resideprimarily in the southeast of the state.Alaskan Athabaskan have commonalities with Cana-dian Athabaskan as well as with Navajo and Apachein the southwestern United States. The southeastpanhandle Indians are similar to the Indians of Brit-ish Columbia. 5 Cancer incidence among AN of all ages was first reported in 19766and has been reported subse - quently in numerous publications.7-11Cancer, once thought to be a rare disease among AN, has in-creased, and rates for all cancers combined now ex-ceed those of US whites. In addition, there are manydifferences in site-specific cancer incidence ratesamong AN compared with US whites. 10 This study examined cancer in AN children (under age 20), comparing incidence rates in AN childrenwith those of US whites by sex, age group (0 -4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19), and ethnicity (Indian, Aleut, and Eskimo). We also compared our data with that ofNew Mexican American Indians (NMAI) and withAlaska whites. Data on AN cancer survival, preva- lence, and mortality are also included. METHODS Incidence data in this report are for AN patients under age 20 in the Alaska Native Tumor Registry. This registry includes all AN patients statewide who received a diagnosis of invasive cancerwhile a resident of Alaska. Data for the years 1969 -1996 were examined for this study. However, to confirm a finding of thestudy, the registry was searched at a later date to identify livercancers diagnosed through 2002. Data collection methods havebeen previously described. 6-11Data were collected in accordance with the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiologyand End Results (SEER) program. 12To make our results most easily comparable to national data, our analysis was designed tomirror that used in the National Cancer Institute's SEER PediatricMonograph. 1Classification of ethnicity (Indian, Aleut, and Es - kimo) is based on self-classification by the parents of the patient atthe time of registration to the hospital/clinic. Classification oftumors followed the International Classification of ChildhoodCancers (ICCC). 13The ICCC divides cancers into 12 major groups each with up to 6 subgroups. Data for US whites and NMAI aged0 to 19 years from the SEER program for 1973-1996 were used forcomparison. We also analyzed data for Alaska white childrenprovided by the State of Alaska for the years 1996 -2000 (the only years available). All incidence rates were adjusted to the 1970 USstandard population under age 20. AN rates for all cancers and foreach group and subgroup of cancer (classified by the ICCC) werecalculated using 1969 -1996 data. Death data for AN were obtained from the State of Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics and were available for 1979 to 1996.Deaths among US whites for the same time period were obtainedfrom the National Center for Health Statistics. Population estimates for AN were based on census data and Indian Health Service population estimates for 1970 -1996. The ethnic composition of AN children in the 1990 census was 11%Aleut, 34% Indian, and 54% Eskimo and was similar for 1970 and1980 censuses. Age distribution among the population of ANunder 20 years of age has fluctuated somewhat during this period.Interpolations of population estimates for intercensal years wereestimated using cubic splines. 14Odds ratios (ORs; and associated 95% confidence intervals[CIs]) for comparisons were calculatedusing exact methods. Poisson regression was used to model trendsover time. Kaplan Meier curves and log-rank tests were used forexamination and comparison of relative survival data. All analy-ses were performed using S-Plus 2000, StatExact 4.0.1, and Epi Info2000 software. RESULTS From 1969 to 1996, a total of 131 cases of cancer were diagnosed among AN under age 20. One pa- tient had 2 different cancers (central nervous system[CNS], germ cell) diagnosed 6 years apart. Of the 131,more were male (78) than female (53). Cancer in ANchildren was most frequently diagnosed within thefirst year of life. Children of ages 0 to 4 and 15 to 19accounted for more cases than those ages 5 to 9 and10 to 14. The distribution by ethnicity was 26 Indians,24 Aleut, and 81 Eskimo. Distribution of Cancers Table 1 compares rank order of cancers by ICCC classification of AN to US whites. The 5 most fre-quently diagnosed cancers, in rank order among ANchildren, are leukemia, hepatic tumors, CNS tumors,lymphoma, and germ cell tumors. Together, thesecancers compose /H1102270% of all AN childhood cancers. Four of these cancer groups \u2014leukemia, CNS, lym- phoma, and germ cell tumors \u2014are among the 5 most frequent in US white children. Rank order is similar,except in the US whites, carcinoma ranks fourth after http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/112/5/ e396 e397 by guest on August 29, 2019 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from lymphoma. Among AN, hepatic tumors rank second and compose 15% of childhood cancers, whereasamong US whites, hepatic tumors rank 11th andaccount for only 1%. Although lymphoma rankedamong the top 5 cancers in both AN and US whitechildren, it ranked fourth in AN, composing 8%, andthird in US white children (17%). The category car-cinoma accounts for 10% of cancers among US whitechildren (and ranks fourth) but accounts for only 5%of cancers among AN children (and ranks 10th).Neuroblastomas ranked lower (11th) among ANthan US whites (eighth). Distribution of cancer by sexwas remarkable for the higher ranking of hepatictumors in both AN boys (second) and girls (fifth) andhigher ranking of retinoblastoma and renal tumors inAN girls. Rank order of AN childhood cancers was exam- ined by ethnic group: Indian, Aleut, and Eskimo(data not shown). Leukemia ranked first in all ethnicgroups. Distribution was similar between ethnicgroups, with the exception of hepatic tumors. He-patic tumors were the second most common canceramong Eskimo children but ranked fifth and seventhamong Indians and Aleuts, respectively.Within nearly all major ICCC groups, the distribu- tions of cancers by subgroup seem to be similar forAN and US whites. An exception again is hepatictumors. Among AN children, 16 (84%) of 19 cases ofhepatic tumors were hepatocellular carcinoma, andonly 3 were hepatoblastoma. Among US whites,hepatoblastoma occurs much more frequently inchildren than hepatocellular carcinoma. Only 56(28%) of 199 cases of hepatic tumors among USwhites were hepatocellular carcinoma. There may also be differences in distribution in the ICCC group \"carcinoma.\" Among US white children, the majority of the carcinomas were thyroid carcinomas\" (25%). Of the 7 AN children who had a diagnosis of carcinoma, only 1 cancer wasthyroid carcinoma and none was melanoma. Theremaining 6 were \"other and unspecified carcino- mas\" (colon, rectum, cervix, stomach, brain, and 1 unknown site). The distribution of cancers by 5-year age group was reviewed. The age distributions of AN and USwhite children with cancer by ICCC group are sim-ilar, again with the exception of hepatic tumors.TABLE 1.

In the US, childhood cancer occurs most frequently in the first year of life. AN children are similar.Thirteen AN infants received a diagnosis of cancer,the largest number with cancer in any year of age inour study. These 13 include leukemia (5); retinoblas-toma (3); and 1 infant each with neuroblastoma, lym-phoma, soft tissue, renal, and CNS tumors. Rankorder among infants with cancer in the US is gener-ally neuroblastoma, CNS tumors, leukemia, retino-blastoma, and renal tumors. 14 In US whites, cancers occur more often in male than female children. Among AN children in thisstudy, there were also more cancers in boys (78) thanin girls (53). The ratio of boys to girls seems to behigher in AN but is not significantly different. Incidence Rates Table 2 shows average annual age-adjusted inci- dence rates of childhood cancer and ORs for ANcompared with US whites. Rates among AN childrenfor all cancers combined are similar to those of USwhites (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.8 -1.1). Rates by age andsex were also calculated (data not shown). ORs ofAN to US whites for all cancers combined were 1.1and 0.9 for boys and girls and did not differ signifi-cantly. Age-specific rates of all cancers combinedamong AN children display a pattern by age similarto that observed among US whites. Specifically, ratesare high among young AN children (160 per millionamong age 0 -4), decline somewhat in age groups 5 to 9 and 10 to 14 (116 and 119 per million, respec-tively), and then increase again in older children (188per million in age group 15-19). For most ICCC cancer groups, incidence rates for AN children are similar to those of US whites. How-ever, AN children are at significantly higher risk forall hepatic tumors (OR: 13.1; AN risk of hepatocellular carci- noma is also significantly increased for each sex sep-arately. The rate for hepatoblastoma for both sexescombined was not significantly high; however, onthe basis of the 3 cases (all male), AN boys seem to beat higher risk for hepatoblastoma compared with USwhite boys (OR: 4.80; 95% CI: 1.20 All children in our study with hepatocellular car- cinoma were hepatitis B antigen positive.

Although 16 children who were born be-fore 1983 developed hepatocellular carcinoma, nochildren who were born in the 20 years since HBVimmunization was instituted among infants have re-ceived a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Thedifference in hepatocellular carcinoma rates betweenthese 2 birth cohorts, 1950 -1982 and 1983-2002, is significant at P/H11021.05. The only other category for which AN rates are increased is retinoblastoma (OR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.3 -5.3). Eight children received a diagnosis of retinoblastomain this population, 6 female and 2 male. All but 1 wasdiagnosed under age 2, and 3 patients had synchro-nous bilateral disease. Review of medical records didnot indicate that any of the children were related,although detailed family pedigrees have not beendone. Tumor registry information does not includeinformation on genetic testing, and many of the pa-tients' cancers were diagnosed before genetic testing became available. Lower rates were found for AN children com- pared with US whites for lymphoma and for neuro-blastoma. The rate for the lymphoma category issignificantly low for both sexes combined (OR: 0.5;95% CI: 0.3- 0.9) and for girls separately. The low rate for this cancer is largely attributable to low rates forHodgkin's disease (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.0 -0.5). Only 2 patients with Hodgkin 's disease, both male, were identified in the 18-year period. The rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) also seems low but not significantly different from the US white rate. Only 1 AN patient received a diagnosis of cancer in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) category,specifically neuroblastoma. On the basis of this 1case, the rate for neuroblastoma in AN seems to besignificantly lower than in US whites (OR: 0.1; 95%CI: 0.1- 0.6). The rate of leukemia was similar in AN and US white children (OR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.7 -1.4), and also seemed to be similar. Ofthe 35 cases of leukemia diagnosed among AN chil-dren, 24 (66%) were acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL), 6 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and 2(6%) were unspecified. Data for AN leukemia werealso similar to US whites in that boys have higherincidence and leukemia occurs most frequently inthe 0- to 4-year age group. Ethnic Comparisons We calculated overall age-adjusted childhood can- cer rates for each of the 3 major ethnic groups amongAN (data not shown). Compared with US whites,rates were significantly lower for Indians (OR: 0.6;95% CI: 0.4 -2.1). Comparisons of AN rates with US whites by ethnic group for separate ICCC groups aredifficult because of limited numbers of cases. Ourdata indicate that rates for hepatic cancer are signif-icantly higher only among Eskimo (OR: 23.9; 95% CI:13.9-38.8). Retinoblastoma may be higher in all 3 ethnic groups, but none was significantly higher.Rates for AN for all lymphomas are significantly low relative to US whites. Numbers of cases (11)were too small for analysis by ethnic group. Patientsfrom all 4 ethnic groups were among the 11 patientswho had a diagnosis of lymphoma. Mortality Cancer-specific mortality rates were calculated us- ing death data for AN and all US whites, 1979 -1996. Twenty-three AN children died from cancer duringthe period studied. The average annual age-adjustedcancer mortality rate among AN children was lowerbut not significantly lower than that of US whitechildren (28.6 vs 37.3 per million). US white cancermortality decreased in children during this period,but no similar trend was evident among AN cancermortality rates. Survival and Prevalence For all childhood cancers, relative 5-year survival for AN is lower than for US whites (60% vs 70%; P/H11021 .05). The numbers of cases were too small to calculatesurvival by ICCC group or subgroup. Of all ANchildren who received a diagnosis of cancer from1969 through 1996, 58 had died by January 1, 1997, 43(74%) from cancer, 7 from other causes, and 8 fromunknown causes. The 72 survivors originally had adiagnosis of leukemia (14); germ cell (10) and hepatictumors (10); retinoblastoma (8); renal (7) and CNS (6)tumors; lymphoma (6), soft tissue (5), bone (3), andSNS (1) tumors; and carcinoma (2). All children whohad a diagnosis of retinoblastoma, germ cell tumors,and neuroblastoma and all but 1 of 8 who had adiagnosis of renal tumor were known to be alive onJanuary 1, 1997. Because of our findings of differences between AN and US whites, we reviewed data of other relevantpopulations, specifically, American Indian data fromthe New Mexico SEER registry. Using SEER data andSEER software, we calculated rates for NMAI andcompared them with US whites (Table 3). Rates forall cancers combined among NMAI were signifi-cantly lower than for US white (OR: 0.8). Rates aresimilar between NMAI and US white children formost ICCC groups, with a few exceptions. Similar toAN children, the rate among NMAI for retinoblas-toma was higher compared with US whites (OR: 2.5;95% CI: 1.4 -4.5). The rate for be higher (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0 -3.4), although the rate for bone tumors as a group was notsignificantly higher. Similar to AN, NMAI also seemto be risk for CI: 0.0 -0.4). In addition, rates low for CNS tumors (OR: 0.5; 95% CI:0.3-0.7). We also examined statewide incidence data for Alaska whites. Data for this population have beencollected only since 1996. However, the Alaska whitepopulation is nearly 5 times that of Natives inAlaska. During the period 1996 -2000 (data not shown), 92 resident white children of Alaska underage 20 at diagnosis were identified. We found no e400 CHILDHOOD CANCER AMONG ALASKA NATIVES by guest on August 29, 2019 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from evidence that Alaska whites were at increased risk for hepatic tumors or retinoblastoma or that partic-ularly low rates occur for the lymphomas, Hodgkin 's disease in particular, or neuroblastoma amongAlaska whites. Alaska white childhood cancer ratesseem to be similar to those of US whites. DISCUSSION Cancer incidence patterns for AN of all ages have been well described.7-11These reports indicate that the rate of all cancers combined among AN of allages and both sexes currently exceed the rates for USwhites. Compared with US whites, rates are similarfor AN men but 18% higher among AN women. 11In addition, many site-specific rates differ. For manysites, rates in AN exceed those of US whites, whereasother cancer sites occur less frequently. This is the first study to focus on cancer in AN children (under age 20). The incidence rate for allcancers and both sexes of AN under age 20 is similarto that of US whites. Mortality rates from all cancers for all ages were much higher (30%) in AN compared with US whitesduring the 1990s. 15Data on cancer deaths for chil - dren for 1979 -1996 result in a cancer mortality rate for AN children that is lower (28.6 per million), al-though not significantly lower, than the rate for USwhite children (37.3 per million). Comparison of rates of AN childhood cancers by ICCC groups and subgroups with US whites showsmore similarities than differences, with some markedexceptions. In comparison with US whites, AN chil-dren have excess hepatic tumors (OR: 13.1) and ret-inoblastoma (OR: 2.8). Conversely, AN have signifi-cantly lower rates of SNS tumors (OR: 0.1) andlymphoma (OR: 0.5). The most striking differences between AN and US white childhood cancers are found in the hepatictumor category, specifically hepatocellular carci-noma (OR: 43.8). Most childhood inthe hepatoblastoma, but among AN children,the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is muchhigher than that of hepatoblastoma. Although thenumber of male children with hepatocellular carci-noma was nearly 3 times greater than for female, therate of hepatocellular carcinoma is significantly in-creased over US whites for both AN boys and girls. Chronic infection with HBV has been implicated as the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in thispopulation. 16All children in our study with hepato - cellular carcinoma were hepatitis B antigen positive.A hepatitis B program was instituted in Alaska in theearly 1980s, including universal immunization of ANinfants at birth and immunization of all serosuscep-tible AN. More than 90% of the AN population wastested for HBV in the mid-1980s and immunized asneeded. 17The region of Alaska with the highest in - fection rate of HBV experienced an immediate de-crease in annual incidence of acute asymptomaticHBV infection from 215 to 14 per 100 000 after theimmunization campaign. A screening program forhepatocellular carcinoma using /H9251-fetoprotein has re- sulted in improvement in survival rates for patientswith hepatocellular carcinoma. 18 For this study, we evaluated the impact of the program on the occurrence of hepatic tumors amongTABLE 3.

The statewide HBV immunization pro- gram began in late 1982. Although 16 children whowere born before 1983 developed hepatocellular car-cinoma, no children who were born in the 20 yearssince HBV immunization was instituted among in-fants have received a diagnosis hepatocellular carci-noma. In contrast, hepatoblastoma has occurredsince 1983. There is no known association betweenhepatoblastoma and hepatitis B, so a protective effectwould not be expected. Because hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in such excess among AN children and is the second leadingcancer, we calculated a rate for all cancers in ANchildren excluding hepatocellular carcinoma. Com-paring AN and US white childhood cancer rates afterremoving hepatocellular carcinoma cases from bothpopulations resulted in an OR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7 - 1.0). Thus, if no increase in other childhood cancersoccurs in the coming generations, then rates forchildhood cancer may soon be significantly lowerthan those in US white children. The only other cancer for which AN children seemed to be at increased risk was for retinoblas-toma. Retinoblastoma has not been found to haveany race or sex predilection. 19A retinoblastoma gene was identified and reported in 1986 and is transmit-ted in a dominant manner. The gene Rb1 functions asa tumor suppressor. Hereditary cases are thought tocompose 40% of cases in the United States. Heredi-tary cases tend to occur in younger (mean age: 1)than sporadic cases (mean age: 2) and are more oftenbilateral. Although a review of records did not indi-cate that any of the children in this study were re-lated, the occurrence of bilateral disease and diagno-sis at young age suggests that heredity may play arole in some of these patients. Lymphoma occurs in AN children at half the rate of that in US white children (OR: 0.5). Among bothAN and US white children, the incidence is loweramong girls than boys. The lymphoma category iscomposed of Hodgkin 's disease and NHL. The low overall OR of lymphoma among AN children is pri-marily attributable to the very low occurrence ofHodgkin's disease (OR: 0.2). Only 2 cases (both male) of Hodgkin's disease occurred among AN children,classified as nodular sclerosis and lymphocyte deple-tion. Although Hodgkin's disease was described /H11022200 years ago, the cause of the disease and the origin ofthe malignant cell remain unknown. The epidemiol-ogy and pathology of the disease have strongly im-plicated an infectious cause, especially viral. A vari-ety of infectious agents have been suggested to playa role in Hodgkin 's disease; the case for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seems to be strongest. 20Risk varies worldwide, and occurrence of disease is greateramong people with higher socioeconomic status. Therole of infectious agent(s) may be associated with thefinding of higher rates among those of higher socio-economic status. Genetic predisposition is implicatedbecause positive family history of Hodgkin 's disease increases risk. Seroprevalence surveys of AN in the1980s found that AN children were all EBV antibodypositive by age 4 (AP Lanier, unpublished observa-tions). If EBV is confirmed to play a role in thedevelopment of Hodgkin 's disease or other lympho- mas, then the fact that AN children are known to beinfected early in life (and infectious mononucleosisoccurs rarely) may be relevant. NHL generally comprises approximately 60% of lymphoma in children and adolescents. 21In our study, NHL was diagnosed in 9 of 11 lymphomapatients. Rates of NHL are higher in whites than inblacks in the United States. The frequency and rela-tive proportion of NHL subtypes differ worldwide.In parts of Africa, Burkitt 's lymphoma accounts for a large percentage of lymphomas in childhood. In ourstudy, only 1 patient was classified as having Bur-kitt's lymphoma. The relatively low rates of lym-phoma in AN children parallels our findings in pre-vious studies of AN of all ages. 7-11,22Compared with US whites, rates for AN of all ages are low for alllymphomas combined, especially for Hodgkin 's dis- ease (OR: 0.58 and 0.16, respectively). Comparison ofage-specific rates for AN with US whites for theperiod 1973-1996 shows lower rates for all AN agegroups for lymphoma and Hodgkin 's disease. The findings of our study were also remarkable in the relative absence of SNS tumors in AN children(OR: 0.1). In US whites, these tumors are the mostcommon malignancies in infants and compose tumors are predomi-nantly neuroblastomas. 23Only 1 AN child had a diagnosis of SNS tumor, specifically, neuroblastoma.In the United States, this tumor occurs at similarrates in whites and blacks. The cause is unknown.However, it has been noted that microscopic neuro-blastoma nodules are observed in most fetuses andin infants under age 3 who die of causes other thancancer. 23It has been hypothesized that these lesions may be neuroblastoma precursors and may sponta-neously regress. If this hypothesis is valid, then thefinding of infrequent occurrence of this neoplasm inthis population would suggest an absence of a fac-tor(s) that promotes neuroblastoma or the presenceof a factor(s) that enhances regression. Because AN are heterogeneous, including multiple ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups, we reviewedthe occurrence of childhood cancer by the 3 majorethnic groups: Eskimo, Indian, and Aleut. The ratefor Alaska Indian children was lower than US whiterates for cancer overall and for most of the commonchildhood tumors. The low rate among Alaska Indi-ans agrees with the only previous report on child-hood cancer in American Indian/AN. Among NMAIchildren under age 15 for the years 1970 -1982, NMAI rates per million were significantly lower(75.5 for boys and 78.0 for girls) than non-Hispanicwhites in the state. 4On the basis of SEER data 1990 - 1995, NMAI had the lowest childhood cancer rate(79.6 per million) of 4 ethnic groups analyzed; blackshad 124.6, Asian Pacific Islanders had 136.8, andwhites had 161.7 per million. 1 We compared NMAI childhood cancer incidence data with that of US whites for 1973 -1996. As would be expected from the studies cited above, we foundthe rate for all cancers combined among NMAI to besignificantly lower than the US white rate (OR: 0.7). e402 CHILDHOOD CANCER AMONG ALASKA NATIVES by guest on August 29, 2019 www.aappublications.org/news Downloaded from Leukemia, especially ALL, was the leading cancer in children of all groups \u2014AN, NMAI, and US whites \u2014 and rates were similar. NMAI do not experience anexcess of hepatic tumors. In fact, NMAI childrenreceived a diagnosis of carcinoma; allwere hepatoblastoma. Of interest is that eliminationof hepatic tumors from calculations of rates for ANchildren results in rates similar to NMAI. Similar toAN children, the rate among NMAI for retinoblas-toma was also higher than US white rates. The ratefor osteosarcoma among NMAI seems to be higherthan US whites, although the rate for bone tumors asa group was not significantly higher. Among all 3populations, osteosarcomas are the most frequentlydiagnosed bone tumors. Because the overall rates forchildhood cancer in NMAI are low, it is not surpris-ing that rates are low for various ICCC groups. Sim-ilar to AN, NMAI also seem to be at low risk forneuroblastoma, lymphoma as a group, andHodgkin's disease. In addition, rates are low among NMAI children for CNS tumors. Our report indicates that rates of all childhood cancers combined among AN are similar to USwhites, although rates differ for select ICCC groups.Age-adjusted rates for AN for all ages have increased38% during the past 30 years and now exceed thoseof US whites. It is reassuring that rates for AN chil-dren are not in excess and do not seem to be increas-ing. There is concern among the population regard-ing environmental exposure, including ionizingradiation. Our data do not show excess childhoodleukemia or thyroid cancers, malignancies for whichradiation is known to increase risk. Our data suggestthat the HBV immunization program has alreadyresulted in a decrease in hepatic cancers in children.Hepatic tumors rank second and compose 15% ofAN childhood cancers in our study. In the future,elimination of most hepatic tumors should result ineven lower rates of childhood cancer than we reportin this study. The reasons for very low rates ofHodgkin's disease and neuroblastoma are not known.

Th e misuse of these vials has caused harm to individual patients through occurrences and outbreaks of bloodborne pathogens and associated infections, including hepatitis B and C virus,1,2 meningitis, and epidura l abscesses.3 Adverse events caused by this misuse have occurred in both inpatient and outpatient settings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The misuse of vials primarily involves the reuse of single -dose vials,3 which ar e intended to be used once for a single patient. Single -dose vials typically lack preservatives; therefore, using these vials more than once carries substantial risks for bacterial contamination, growth and infection. Since 2001, at least 49 outbreaks have occurred due to the mishandling of injectable medical products, according to the CDC. Twenty -one of these outbreaks involved transmission of hepatitis B or C; the other 28 were outbreaks of bacterial infections, primarily invasive bloodstream infectio ns. While many of these outbreaks occurred in inpatient settings, a high percentage occurred in pain management clinics, where injections often are administered into the spine and other sterile spaces using preservative -free medications, and in cancer clin ics, which typically provide chemotherapy or other infusion services to patients who may be immuno - compromised. In addition, more than 150,000 patients required notification during this time frame to undergo bloodborne pathogen testing after their potentia l exposure to unsafe injections.4 The CDC is aware of at least 19 bloodborne or bacterial infection outbreaks since 2007 associated with the misuse of single -dose/single -use vials. Seven involved bloodborne pathogen infections , and 12 were bacterial infe ctions. All of these outbreaks occurred in the outpatient setting, with eight occurring in pain remediation clinics.3 According to CDC officials, these examples likely underestimate the harm resulting from the misuse of single -dose/single -use vials. Due to the difficulty of tracing the misuse of vials to infections, the adverse impact of misusing a vial is typically not seen immediately.5 Adverse events related to unsafe injection practices and lapses in infection control practices are underreported , and it remains a challenge to measure the true frequency of such occurrences. Sentinel Event Alert , Issue 52 Page 2 www.jointcommission.org While the misuse of disposable parenteral syringes and pen injectors also contribute to adverse events and outbreaks, this Alert will focus on the safe use of vials. Causes and d ocumentation of misuse A significant contributing factor to the misuse of vials is the lack of adherence to safe infection control practices and to aseptic techniques within health care organizations. For example, a survey of 5,446 health care practitioner s found lapses in basic infection control practices relating to vial use. The results included: For single -dose/single -use vials, 6 percent admitted to sometimes or always using vials for multiple patients. For multiple -dose vials, 15 percent reported u sing the same syringe to re -enter a vial numerous times for the same patient; of that 15 percent, 6.5 percent reported saving vials for use on another patient. Of the 51 professionals who reported reusing a syringe to obtain an additional dose from a multiple-dose vial and then leaving it for use on another patient, about half (52.0%) were from the hospital setting.6 A study by the CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAM A) found that two -thirds of inspected CMS -certified ambulatory surgical centers had lapses in basic infection control practices. Twenty -eight percent of these facilities used medications in single -dose vials for multiple patients.7 In addition, some prov iders compromise safe infection control practices in attempts to prevent waste.5,6,8 The compulsion to prevent waste is sometimes exacerbated by medication shortages or costs.3,5,9 However, any cost savings achieved by preventing waste can quickly be offse t by one or more adverse clinical outcomes. The medical literature contains many examples of individuals who acquired preventable bloodborne and bacterial infections.10-20 Some patients died from these infections, and many others required prolonged, someti mes life -long, treatment and follow -up care as a result. In other instances, underlying health conditions may have been exacerbated. In addition, there can be tremendous financial costs associated with treating infected patients or containing an outbreak, and providers causing harm face significant legal ramifications or disciplinary action.3 Recommendations and potential strategies for improvement While organizations are required by Joint Commission standards to safely dispense and administer medications (see next section for all related Joint Commission requirements), the accomplishment of th ese goals depends on preventative action taken by clinical staff who administer injections. Staff should always follow safe injection and infection control practices - including correct aseptic technique, hand hygiene and the one -time-only use of needles and syringes - along with the specific recommendations for single -dose/single -use vials and multiple -dose vials in this alert. Safe infection control practices always apply when transporting, storing, preparing and administering medications, solutions and related supplies. See the CDC's comprehensive injection safety resource: http://www.cdc.gov/injectionsafety . The fol lowing recommendations and potential strategies can be used to help prevent the misuse of vials, there by preventing the spread of infection. Sentinel Event Alert , Issue 52 Page 3 www.jointcommission.org Effective processes and procedures 1. Develop and implement effective evidence -based organization -wide stand ardized policy and procedures for the prevention of the misuse of vials. The policy should apply to all staff who administer injections to patients, and should address the following: Single -dose/single -use vials Multiple -dose vials Use a single -dose/sin gle-use vial for a single patient during the course of a single procedure. Discard the vial after this single use; used vials should never be returned to stock on clinical units, drug carts, anesthesia carts, etc. The One & Only Campaign from the CDC and Safe Injection Practices Coalition emphasizes ONE needle, ONE syringe, ONLY ONE time. Medications in single -dose/single -use vials lack antimicrobial preservatives and are therefore at greater risk to become c ontaminated and serve as a source of infection when used inappropriately. See campaign resources , including video . If a single -dose/single -use vial must be entered more than once durin g a single procedure for a single patient to achieve safe and accurate titration of dosage, use a new needle and new syringe for each entry.21 Note: USP 797 states that single -dose/single -use vials opened in less than ISO Class 5 air quality be used within one hour, with any remaining contents discarded. Single -dose/single -use vials opened in ISO Class 5 air quality can be used up to six hours.22 Do not combine or pool leftover contents of single -dose/single -use vials. Do not store used single -dose/single -use vials for later use, no matter what the size of the vial.3 Unopened single -dose/single -use vials may be repackaged into multiple single -dose/single -use containers (e.g. syringes), which should be properly labeled, including the expiration date and a beyond -use date (which is different from the manufacturer assigned expiration date). This repackaging should be performed only by qualified personnel in ISO Class 5 air conditions in accordance with standards in the United States Pharmacopeia General Chapt er 797, Pharmaceutical Compounding - Sterile Preparations. Also , follow the manufacturer's recommendations pertaining to safe storage of that medication outside of its original container.3,22 Only vials clearly labeled by the manufacturer for multiple dose use can be used more than once. Limit the use of a multiple -dose vial to only a single patient, whenever possible, to reduce the risk of contamination.23,24,25 When multiple -dose vials are used more than once, use a new needle and new syringe for each entry.23 Do not leave needles or other objects in vial entry diaphragms between uses, as this may contaminate the vial's contents.23 Disinfect the vial's rubber septum before piercing by wiping (and using friction) with a sterile 70 percent isopropyl alcoh ol,22 ethyl/ethanol alcohol, iodophor,26 or other approved antiseptic swab. Allow the septum to dry before inserting a needle or other device into the vial.24 Once a multiple -dose vial is punctured, it should be assigned a \"beyond -use\" date. The beyond - use date for an opened or entered (e.g., needle - punctured) multiple -dose container with antimicrobial preservatives is 28 days, unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer. Store multiple -dose vials outside the immediate patient treatment area; observe the manufacturer's storage recommendations.24 All vials (single -dose/single -use and multiple -dose) Discard any vial if its sterility has been compromised or is questionable, including those having been placed on a used procedure tray or used during an emergency procedure - even if the vial is unopened/unused.24 Select the smallest vial necessary when making purchasing and treatment decisions to reduce waste.3 Urge manufacturers to produce vials in appropriate sizes to reduce waste.27 2. Conduct reg ular quality checks on clinical units to look for open vials. Sentinel Event Alert , Issue 52 Page 4 www.jointcommission.org Training and education 3. Provide annual education on injection safety and on preventing the misuse of vials for all staff who administer injections, including new or temporary staff. Education should include how to recognize and report known breaches of safe injection and infection control practices with vials, such as the use of a single -dose/single -use vial on more than one patient either accidentally (human error) or due to a mistaken belief that the breach was not significant or was justified (at -risk behavior). Staff education should aim to reduce gaps in knowledge regarding safe injection and infection control practices, and to reduce staff tolerance of behavioral choices that may place pa tients or others at risk of harm, such as using a single -dose vial of medication for multiple patients. 4. Before discharge, provide injection safety education to patients and caregivers who will use injectable medical products as part of a home health re gimen. Use teach -back methods to assure understanding. Safety culture 5. Emphasize that all staff are responsible for reporting risks, errors (including near misses), and adverse events. Create a culture within which the reporting of unsafe injection and infection control practices or near misses is viewed as a necessary step to improve safety. 6. Report clusters of infections or other adverse events to the appropriate local and state public health authorities. While reporting of adverse events is usually voluntary, outbreak reporting is typically required by state public health departments. Failure to report illness clusters to public health authorities can result in delays in recognition of disease outbreaks and in implementation of control measures. Inc idents of adverse events associated with the misuse of vials can be reported to: The Joint Commission, in accordance with its Sentinel Event policy FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Appropriate state agencies (reporting may be mandatory in some states). See reportable conditions by state State health departments, if multiple patients are involved. Appropriate patient safety organizations (PSOs), such as ECRI Institute's or the Institute for Safe Medication Practices' (ISMP) National Medication Errors Reporting Program 7. When unsafe injection and infection control practices are identified, assess potential harm to patients and, if warranted, notify patients and test for bloodborne pathogens. Actions for notifying patients should be discussed with local and state public health authorities. Related Joint Commission requirements Reference the Standards FAQ for MM.03.01.01, Element of Performance (EP) 7 , which requires organizations to re -label multi ple-dose vials with a revised expiration date (that is, a beyond -use date) once staff opens or punctures a multi ple-dose vial. Ther efore, The Joint Commission requires a 28-day expiration date for multi ple-dose vials from the date of opening or puncture, unless the manufacturer specifies otherwise (shorter or longer). In any case, the original expiration date printed on the vial canno t be extended. If the manufacturer's original expiration date is earlier than the revised expiration date, the earlier date must be used. Note: Storage time limits for single -dose/single -use vials are defined by USP 797 (depending on the environment in whi ch they are punctured) or the manufacturer - whichever is shorter.22 Sentinel Event Alert , Issue 52 Page 5 www.jointcommission.org See other relevan t Joint Commission requirements : HR.01.05.03 (staff education and training), IC.01.04.01 (setting goals to minimize infection), IC.01.05.01 (infection prevention and control plan), IC.02.01.01 (infection prevention and control plan implementation), LD.04.04.05 (organizational patient safety program), MM.03.01.01 , EP 10 (providing med ications in -to-administer form)*, MM.05.01.11 (safe medication dispensing)*, MM.06.01.01 (safe medication administration), and MM.08.01.01 (medication management system evaluation). * These requirements do not apply to some accreditation pr ograms. MM.03.01.01 EP 10 does not apply to the Ambulatory Care or Nursing Care Center programs. However, MM.05.01.15 EP 1 does apply to the Nursing Care Center program , and it covers providing medications in the most ready -to-administer form. In addition, while MM.05.01.11 does not apply to most centers accredited under the Nursing Care Center program, it does apply to Veterans Affairs Community Living Centers (CLC), which are accredited under the Nursing Care Center program.

Thank you, Lacy Wilcox photo Lacy Wilcox Legislative Liaison , THC Alaska 907-302-3535 ext 105 | & 10271 Re: Remediation Symbol and AMCO overreach Date: September 11, 2019 This is a written comment for a non-agenda item for the Sept ember 11- 13, 2019 Marijuana Control Board Meeting, this is to support our verbal testimony given at sai d meeting. Synopsis: THC Alaska LLC strongly objects to AMCO authorizing METRC to add a Remediation Symbol to all subsequent and retested product packages associated with remediated trim, therefore AMCO using METRC to effectively change operations and busines s practices without going through the public process . Detail: Regulation reads - 3 AAC 306.660(b) Failed materials; retests (b) If a sample of marijuana fails a required test, any marijuana plant trim, leaf, and other usable material from the same plants automatically fail the required test. The board or director may approve a written request, on a form prescribed by the board, to allow a batch of marijuana that fails a required test to be used to make a carbon dioxide- or solvent -based extract. After processing, the carbon dioxide- or solvent -based extract must pass all required tests. What we thought this meant: When we, a concentrate manufacturer , purchases failed vegetable matter to process into concentrates, the cult ivator must first obtain approval from the director to transfer this material , which is understandable, however slow a process. Once approved they can transfer \"failed trim\" and we can manufact ure a concentrate. As long as the new product is tested and passes, it can then be sold as any concentrate product would be. This is good and has been happening with some degree of success. What changed: At some point recently, we believe in early August, METRC began adding a symbol next to each package of concentrate that contained approved remediated trim. That symbol stays with the package all the way through to sale at the retail. When you hover over the symbol a pop up says, \"Package contains remediated product\". This seems to have been done without public board discussion where the industry could weigh in on the effects of such a thing. We will nickname this symbol the \"scarlet letter\". Re: Remediation Symbol and AMCO overreach Date: September 11, 2019 Page 2 Why we are concerned: First, it should have been discussed with industry and with the board, so that we don't have to resort to this sort of public outcry. It is well past time for foolery, as we should at this point be able to work toget her. Second, we will at best hesitate to purchase remediated trim because a retailer may not understand that the process used to create the concentrate eliminated the failure issue. This is proven by a new test. A retailer may then reject the product, ask for discounts, or falsely assume that it is substandard quality . We agree that perhaps a discussion with a retailer can be had, but again this was not vetted through the public process where industry could weigh in. Important for the board to understand and for the bottom line: So if we (and presumably other manufacturers ) no longer purchase trim that requires remediation a cult ivator will have fewer options except to destroy the trim, decreasing the state's tax collection potential , creating more waste and unfortunately opportunity for diversi on to the unregulated market. Trying to track down justification: When we inquired with AMCO about the Scarlet Letter we were asked to put the concern in writing. Before doing that, we reached out to METRC to see what could be learned. Below is a capture of METRC's response, citing that the change was \"approved by the State\" and \"will be used in an ongoing basis from now on\". See below. From: Alaska Metrc <support 28, PM Fwd: Packages showing they were remediated Hi Lacy , Regarding your question about the Remediation symbol, the remediation symbol is global functionality that was approved by the State to identify product that needs or has been remediated. It will be used in an ongoing basis from now on. If you have any further questions, please contact support Thanks, Metrc Testing Team Re: Remediation Symbol and AMCO overreach Date: September 11, 2019 Page 3 We then offered our concerns to AMCO in writing and have yet to receive a response. See below. From: Lacy Wilcox <lacy@thcalaska.com> Sent: Wednesday, August 28, 2019 4:09 (CED sponsored) Packages showing they were remediated Hi AMCO, I am curious what reasoning or discussion was had regarding adding the remediation symbol to all child packages from source packages with new lab results when the product was made with remediated trim. If this is going to be a practice going forward our company and I imagine other manufacturers who purchase remediated trim, will cease to do so. As the perception at the point of wholesale is that it is substandard, even though our extraction method and subsequent new lab test prove that it is safe. Customers will ask for a reduced price, or reject it all together. There would then be more waste and less tax dollars. Maybe this was discussed at a board meeting and I missed it, but this is certainly goi ng to change the way we do business and I would hope that when AMCO makes changes that effect a business, it would be run through the board process. Please let me know if this is something that was discussed in detail and if my specific concerns are understood or if I need to prepare something more substantive to present to the board. Thank you, Lacy Wilcox Manager Top Hat Concentrates Juneau, Alaska Re: Remediation Symbol and AMCO overreach Date: September 11, 2019 Page 4 Wrap up: Understanding that AMCO is busy and that it is hard to get back to folks, we are curious why an overburdened office seems to have time to make these changes along with other impactful tweaks, but no time to explain their rational to the board or the industry which they regulate . We respectfully request that the director and staff no longer be allowed to change regulatory practice uni laterally and instead by required to strictly follow the Administrative Procedure Act. Thank you for your service and consideration.

I understand that this is too late to make it in the packet for the September meeting, but am sending for future board consideration. Thank you, Lacy Wilcox photo Lacy Wilcox Legislative Liaison , THC Alaska 907-302-3535 ext 105 | & Re: AMCO Using Metrc Bulletins as Regulation Changes Date: 11, 2019 Alaska Marijuana Control Office ( AMCO ) has directed Metrc staff to change the \"required fields\" for users (licensees). The addition of required fields in Metrc compels licensees to change their operating plan without Marijuana Control Board (MCB) approval. Thus, AMCO is making changes that are effectively changes t o the regulations. AMCO does not have the authority to make regulation changes. Changes to Metrc that require changes to operating plans should go through the MCB process and the Administrative Procedure Act (public comment, MCB discussion/evaluation, etc.) to ensure the changes are following state regulations and, in the public and industries best interest . Two recent changes to Metrc (as directed by AMCO) require operation changes for licensees but were not approved by the MCB: 1) Requiring Gross Weight for product transfers (Bulletin #020) 2) Requiring that an entire harvest batch alw ays remain in the same location (\"Change Rooms in Harvest\", Bulletin #021) 3) A third change was made regarding a remediation symbol on child pac kages, though it cam e with no notice or bulletin . We have addressed that issue in a separate cover. Background: Bulletin #020 (distributed 5.17.19) described a change to Metrc that effectively altered operating procedures for licensees by requiring the addition of gross weight f or transfers. Bulletin #021 (distributed on 8.23.19) described a change to Metrc that effectively altered operating procedures for licensees by requiring that \"the entire harvest batch should be in the same location\". The Big Picture: Metrc is being used as a back door to change regulation that requires licensees to change their operating plans without involving the Marijuana Control Board or public comment. If these Metrc changes are effectively regulation changes, then changes via Metrc are in violation of AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act). Furthermore, the Board is not the party which is authorizing these changes, and under AS 17.38 it does not appear that any other agency has the authority to change regulation. For reference below is the states definition for duties of the Director: Re: AMCO Using Metrc Bulletins as Regulation Changes Date: September 11, 2019 Page 2 \"Sec. 17.38.150. Duties of director. The director shall enforce this chapter and regulations adopted by the board. The director shall issue, renew, transfer, suspend, or revoke all licenses and permi ts and issue product approvals at the direction of the board.

The board may delegate to the director any duty imposed by this chapter except its power to propose and adopt regulations.\" Metrc is regulation. Licensees are mandated to use a nd satisfy the parameters of the inventory tracking system. If this type of backdoor regulation change is not addressed, the state could authorize Metrc to make any kind of changes without following AS 44.62. This backdoor access to regulation change is dangerous and is not in the spirit of the Regulation of Marijuana that the State authorized. The Specifics: The \"Gross Weight\" and \"Change Rooms in Harvest\" changes made by AMCO were made without MCB approval. Thus, these changes implemented by AMCO did not receive the benefits of the process of the MCB (i.e., public comment, MCB discussion and input, etc.) which is designed to improve and refine proposed changes. Because of this, these changes are ineffective in achieving their goal (and may in fact increase risks), and causes undue burden on the industry. Why adding the \"Gr oss Weight\" field (#020 Bulletin) does not increase public safety or help prevent diversion: A single concentrate container can vary by as much as 4g per container. These are used for packaging 0.5g of Marijuana product. With this variance of packaging al l that the gross weight addition to Metrc has done was to put an additional burden on licensees. This did not reduce the chance of diversion. Why \"Change Rooms in Harvest\" Metrc feature is poorly designed. 1. More cannabis will be moved and handled more f requently than necessary. This creates more opportunity for diversion as well as health and safety issues. Harvest Batches in Metrc often consist of the entirety of one variety that was grown under the same treatment regimes and with the same planting and harvest date as per 3 AAC 306.990 (B)(3). This is strategic in order to minimize the cost of testing. According to bulletin #021, the entirety of the Harvest Batch must be kept in the same location. Therefore, if trimmers need to move product from the dry ing rooms or secured storage in order to trim the product, than the entirety of the Harvest Batch must be moved out to the trim rooms. This could mean moving 40 lbs or more of cannabis so Re: AMCO Using Metrc Bulletins as Regulation Changes Date: September 11, 2019 Page 3 that two pounds could be processed. This is an undue burden on the industry that does not increase public safety, public health, or prevention of diversion. Secondly, it is causing product to be relocated when it is not necessary, which opens more opportunity for diversion. Best business practices would involve moving as little cannabis as possible with the least frequency in order to insure better tracking, security, and sanitation. It is more difficult to catch diversion as more cannabis is moved during a day. More frequent movement also increases the chances of human error during these movements (e.g., a portion product from one harvest batch getting mixed up with another harvest batch) which could lead to misrepresentation of testing results or incorrect inventory records. 2. There is no requirement for tracking packages by room within a licensed facility Currently, regulations do not require Metrc packages to be tracked by room within a facility. Certainly, requiring an entire harvest batch to be in the same room is an attempt to help investigators when they conduct a facility walkthrough, and expect to see a harvest batch in one location. However, harvest batches do not have weights and can be expected to be in multiple locations during the harvest/trimming/drying/curing process. Upon request, the licensee should be able to easily show an investigator the entirety of a harvest batch, even if the batch is split among multiple locations. 3. Finished product being stored in a less secure area This operational change required to accommodate the \"Change Rooms in Harvest\" feature would create a liability. A harvest batch must be dried, cured and trimmed before it is ready to be packaged and tested. This results in a harvest batch that could easily be 40lbs. The wisest thing to do once the product is finished being handled is to place it in the most secure area of the building, therefore limiting access to the finished product. This new mandate requires that the harvest batch stay together. This means finished product must remain in a less secure location until the entire harvest batch is finished being processed and can be moved to a more secure location. The Bottom line: These backdoor changes to regulations via Metrc should be considered overreach as they are not following state statute. These changes should be going through the proper processes via the MCB to ensure changes are receiving public comment and MCB consideration. This process is important for allowing industry members to provide valuable feedback that can make new Metrc changes more effective in pr eventing diversion, while increasing public health, and safety. Good industry members are interested in preventing diversion and increasing public health and safety as much as Re: AMCO Using Metrc Bulletins as Regulation Changes Date: September 11, 2019 Page 4 anyone and their perspective should be considered an invaluable tool in strengt hening regulations.

I think that should be rewritten to state that ventilation plans must be designed , signed, and approved by a licensed mechanical engineer. Here's why... and this has happened to me multiple times since I moved to Ketchikan... people think that they can have a system designed and installed by a mechanical contractor, and then all they have to do is find a mechanical engineer to stamp the drawings. They think that getting a mechanical engineer to stamp something is like getting a notary public to stamp something - a couple of bucks for the stamp, and they're good. It comes as an unwelcome surprise to find out that it's pretty expensive to have me analyze someone else's design to ensure that it is safe and meets all the code requirements, etc., before I will stamp someone else's design. (In fact, I tell them at the outset that I won't stamp anyone else's design. They hate that.) Nobody tells them to budget for mechanical design, so it comes as an unwelcome surprise, just when they think that all they are doing is checking a box on a form: get mechanical engineer to stamp drawings. Check. So I think that it would be more fair to the applicants to let them know that one way or the other they will have to pay for ventilation design, and if the Marijuana Control Board regulations state that ventilation must be designed by a mechanical engineer, it will make things easier for everyone. Just a thought.

Forwarding as a general comment. From: David Shimek To: Marijuana, CED ABC (CED sponsored) Subject: ethnic/economic disparity in AMCO licensing Date: Thursday, October 17, 2019 3:59:26 PM Though I am unaware of any definitive survey, it appears to this observer that there is a large discrepancy between Alaska's ethnic makeup and the ethnic makeup of AMCO licensees. Other marijuana-legal states have encountered similar disparities, and several have explored and even acted to ameliorate such disparities. Just this last week California adopted a law allocating $10 million to assisting \"minorities and the economically disadvantaged\" to participate in the industry. As the Board is aware, license applicants in this state face a daunting challenge --- the creation of a licensed establishment requires a very substantial investment of personal savings, since bank loans are unavailable and neither Federal or state loan programs provide assistance to the industry. While this situation may change someday, it doesn't appear imminent --- and by the time it does occur the cannabis markets may be fully populated. While the amount of personal savings needed varies by type of license, location, and size, all of them require vastly more ready cash than is held by the average American. (In 2017 the Federal Reserve Board released a report from its \"Survey of Household Economics\" which indicated that 47% of American households would be unable to meet a $400 \"emergency\" without borrowing the money!) Given the political and economic situation of this state right now, it seems highly unlikely that a law similar to the California law mentioned above is even a remote possibility. I would urge the Board to consider changes to the existing licensing regulations which would be feasible and would to some extent open the field to Alaskans other than those fortunate few with several hundred thousand dollars at the ready. First, eliminate the requirement that no application will be accepted without proof that the applicant has existing legal possession of a proposed site. This requirement alone makes application prohibitive, as it essentially requires the payment of rents or purchase payments on empty premises for as long as it takes to secure all licensing and permitting by AMCO or municipal entities. No, this won't solve the problem of \"wasted money\" entirely -- but it may in some cases. There are no doubt landlords who will commit to the applicant's occupancy at a date certain in the future ---there are very few who will agree to provide occupancy rights ---but no rent --- until licensing has been secured. Secondly, stop bringing licensees before the Board to \"hound\" them to get open. Licensees have plenty of desire to get open --- but they may very well have run short of funds . It may take a long time to save up or scrounge up the money to finish their project --- but that imposes no burden or loss on the state or AMCO (nor on other persons who wish to be in the industry, as there is no limit on licenses). Many an Alaskan has built a home or business in stages, usually because that was the only way it could be accomplished. Yes, it may take the \"working man\" 3 years to accomplish what the \"man of wealth\" can do in 6 months ---but offering up the opportunity is surely the better and fairer choice. These changes, and others of similar intent, will not solve the problem of disproportionate licensing among ethnic or economic groups. They may help some people, though, and their consideration would indicate that the issue is one the Board is willing to think about.

Regulations specify that the distance must be measured by the shortest pedestrian route from the public entrance of the marijuana establishment building to the outer boundaries of the school ground. Further, Alaska State statute clearly defines the school ground as land contained within the real property boundary line (lot line). Alaska Statutes 2018 | Article 4. Definitions. | Sec. 11.71.900. Definitions. AS 11.71.900 (30) \"school grounds\" means a building, structure, athletic playingfield, playground, parking area, or land contained within the real property boundary line of a public or private preschool, elementary, or secondary school; There is no ambiguity on these points. The limited marijuana cultivating facility operated by Mr. Happy Farms, LLC (MHF), owned by Matthew Shelter and Thomas Dicus, is constructed on property that shares a common lot line with Shaw Elementary school. The shortest pedestrian route from the public entrance to the limited marijuana cultivating facility around the corner of the facility and to the lot line of Shaw Elementary School is estimated to be approximately 90 feet. The size of the MHF property is such that there is no physical way for the marijuana cultivating facility to be moved or re-constructed on MHF property and be 500 feet or greater distance from the school grounds and in compliance with regulations. AMCO should not allow continued operation of MHF on this property. The purpose of this letter is to: Show that the owners of MHF knew the business was not in compliance with the 500-ft separation requirement, had discussed separation requirements with the Mat-Su Borough, and had been referred to AMCO for state requirements. They incorrectly certified on their application that they met the 500-ft separation requirement. Point out that the AMCO staff did not catch this inaccurate representation in their review of the initial application. Demonstrate that when this discrepancy was first brought to the attention of the AMCO Board at its July meeting questions arose on the definition of the shortest pedestrian route. The Board was to meet and establish clarity before deciding on compliance. Show that in the absence of clarity, at its September meeting the AMCO Board decided to allow continued operation of MHF. Request that AMCO find that MHF is not in compliance and revoke the license allowing continued operation of MHF at its current location, abutting the Shaw Elementary School property. The following timeline will provide helpful context: Spring 2018 - In February, March, and April 2018 MHF met with Mat-Su Borough Planner, Mark Whisenhunt. They discussed the fact that the building plans showed the facility to be within close proximity of school property. Mr. Whisenhunt explained that the Borough did not have requirements for Limited Marijuana Cultivating facilities and referred MHF to the AMCO for State of Alaska requirements. MHF misrepresented this discussion to their attorney, indicating that the Borough \"didn't see it as an issue due to the distance from theactual school and the thickness of the forest\", reference June 11, 2019 email from MHF attorney (Attachment 1). This is a very misleading statement and is directly countered by Mr. Whisenhunt's email (Attachment 2) in which he recalls the discussion with MHF representatives and clearly states that their office would not make opinions on State of Alaska standards and they always refer customers to AMCO. Summer 2018 - Mr. Happy Farms completed construction of the building, prior to application to AMCO. Refer to statement from Thomas Dicus (Attachment 3). December 2018 - Matthew Shelter and Thomas Dicus certify on their application that their building is \"not within 500 feet of a school ground\", knowing full well that they had already constructed in close proximity to the school boundary. The drawing included as part of the application identified a 60-foot distance to the property lot line, but did not identify that property is owned by the Mat-Su Borough school district. There does not appear to be any evidence that MHF followed the recommendation of the Mat-Su Borough planner and had a discussion with AMCO staff about the proximity to school grounds. One could reasonably assume they didn't want to have this discussion because they knew the outcome would prevent their business operation. AMCO did not catch the misrepresentation during their new application review because AMCO does not apparently have a process in place to verify this requirement - unlike other qualifying statements, such as being a felon. Had AMCO staff known the business facility was in such close proximity to the school grounds, the license would surely not have been presented to the board for approval. May 2019 - The fact that the MHF facility is in very close proximity to Shaw Elementary school grounds was brought to AMCO's attention. July 29, 2019 - In the AMCO Board meeting, there was a discussion about the distance of the facility from school grounds. There were differing opinions offered as to how to interpret regulatory requirements, particularly as relates to the \"shortest pedestrian route\" between the marijuana facility and the school grounds. The Board decided to allow MHF to continue operating until the Board could meet again and gain a clearer understanding of the regulation. The July Board minutes are not yet available, however a review of the audio recording will confirm. AMCO staff did not share in the July Meeting (not found in the July meeting audio recording) that the Board could revoke this license for misrepresentation of information as provided by Article 8. Enforcement; Civil Penalties 3 AAC 306.810. Suspension or revocation of license (1) misrepresented a material fact on an application for a marijuana establishment license, or an affidavit, report, or signed statement under AS 17.38 or this chapter. July 30, 2019 through September 10, 2019 - AMCO staff, through their Regulations ProjectCommittee (headed by Loren Jones, Nick Miller, and Erika McConnell) had this time frame to complete a review and prepare for discussion with the AMCO Board. During this time, AMCO staff received several objections to this license renewal - specifically requesting they uphold the 500 foot separation requirement. September 11, 2019 - In the AMCO Board meeting MHF was listed on agenda under License Renewal. The Board did not receive the clarity from the AMCO staff and the Regulations Project Committee because they were \"still working on the project\". Some Board members expressed confusion and frustration with the situation and some seemed to forget they had sought clarity before making a decision. Despite this lack of clarity, the Board approved the license renewal as being in compliance on a vote of 3 to 2. This decision was not fully informed and the Board created their own definition of regulations describing a measurement from the marijuana business to a fence on school property near the playground as an appropriate standard. This is apparent from the following excerpt from the unapproved September Board meeting minutes. Motion made by Bruce Schulte to approve with delegation: Bruce Schulte states \"that there has been lots of testimony in this matter but that he is looking at the current regulation that defines the measurement as the \"shortest pedestrian route\". He feels that this property meets the requirement. He addresses risk to youth and states that the playground appears to be fenced off and he believes that he does not see a rational basis for denying this renewal based on an overly restrictive interpretation of the rules. For full context, refer to (Attachment 4) for a copy of the unapproved September Board meeting minutes. The AMCO staff should have recommended that the Board postpone a decision pending completion of their analysis and review by the Regulations Project Committee. The Board routinely postpones decisions and should have done so in this instance. To further illustrate the importance of adhering to regulatory definitions, the Board appears to have not considered objections that had been submitted in writing when deciding to use the playground fence as the criteria to establish \"school grounds\". Information had been providing indicating that Shaw Elementary, the largest elementary school in the MSB, often sends their children into the woods on established trails (beyond the playground fence) during their daily PE classes throughout the school year. They also place Geocaches in the woods for their youth to find- provided in writing to AMCO and included in the meeting tab for September Board meeting. On November 19th a resolution will be introduced to the Mat-Su Borough Assembly (by Assemblyman Sumner) asking AMCO to reconsider their interpretation of their regulation decision on Mr. Happy Farms and to not allow the permitting of marijuana licenses in such close proximity of schools grounds, thereby protecting Mat-Su Borough schools. The Mat-Su Borough requires 1,000 foot separation from schools for all other marijuana licenses in the Valley. They leave the enforcement of the 500 foot separation for Limited Marijuana Cultivation facilities to be upheld by the AMCO Board. Ultimately, the AMCO Board decision on the license for Mr. Happy Farms sets precedence for future licenses and can affect other schools in Alaska. I am requesting that this issue be placed again on the AMCO Board agenda for November with a recommendation to rescind the license for Mr. Happy Farms, LLC. I also request that AMCO consider strengthening your internal assurance process to verify future applicants are accurately representing regulatory compliance with school ground separation regulations. One way to strengthen this assurance would be to require applicants to identify adjacent property owners on their applications. Respectfully, Sam A.

I attached an exhibit showing the school and licensed premises to jog your memory I also attached Mr. Hanson 's object too so you have the whole picture and context of this issue. Thanks Mark! Jana From: Mark Whisenhunt < 17692 Mr. Happy Farms LLC Good Morning, I remember this location and speaking to a gentleman about it, though I do not remember his name. While I do not remember all of the specifics of our conversation, I do remember telling him this location would not be suitable for a Standard Marijuana Cultivation Facility (greater than 500sf under cultivation), because it would not meet the Borough 's 1,000' setback from \"School Grounds \" requirement. If I recall, it may not have met the 100' lot line setback requirement as well. However, since he was proposing one Limited Marijuana Cultivation Facility (less than 500sf under cultivation), it was exempt from the Bor- ough permitting standards. Here is our definition: \"School grounds \" means a lot or parcel with facilities primarily used for the aca- demic education of children or young people, usually under 18 years of age. For the purpose of set- back requirements under this chapter, universities, vocational trade schools, and residential struc- tures where children receive homeschooling are not considered schools. The Borough considers the whole parcel (in this case, about 80 acres) to be \"School Grounds. \" We inform all of our customers that we do not know what exactly the State considers \"School Grounds \" (i.e. just the devel- oped area vs. the whole parcel) or exactly how the state measures their setback requirements (i.e. pedestri- an route). Lastly, I'd like to note that I would not have told this gentleman \"I don 't see an issue \" with this location . We do not make opinions on State of Alaska standards. Our office always refer customers to AMCO when there is a question regarding State standards. While wrapping up this email, I received a call from Mr. Dicus. I informed him of this email and its contents. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

I will include the section of the minutes pertaining to this application below, but let me know if you 'd like the whole draft copy. The Marijuana Control Board did move to renew this license, which passed 3 -2. 1. License #17692 Mr. Happy Farms LLC TAB 1 Licensee: Mr. Happy Farms LLC License Type: Limited Marijuana Cultivation Facility Premises Address: 3900 99654 Local Government: Matanuska -Susitna Borough For Consideration: Notice of violation regarding odor complaints - response received. North Lakes Community Council objects to license renewal due to the establishment 's proximity to an elementary school. Objections and comments received. Erika McConnell states that the comments and objections are in the file. Jana Weltzin, counsel, states that the letter of response wasn 't done in time to make it to the packet but she pro- vides copies to the board. Mark Springer asks if this was considered recently (it was at the July meeting). Bruce Schulte and Erika McConnell discuss the confirmation that the lots abut each other. Technically the sep- aration is only 60 feet from the lot line. However, it all comes down to how the shortest pedestrian route is con- sidered. This created a regulations project headed by Loren Jones, Nick Miller and Erika McConnell, they are still working on the project. Jana Weltzin explains the NOV for odor. Matthew Shelton is present via phone and answers board questions regarding when the odor complaint oc- curred and what he has done to resolve the NOV. Sam Hansen board member of North Lakes Community Council is present via phone. She discusses her objec- tions, provides information from the Borough, and references that it 's the distance to the school lot line that should be considered. Bruce Schulte asks if one or both of these properties are in the Matanuska -Susitna Borough (both) and asks about the distance between the physical structures. Jana Weltzin summarizes the argument that the property between the two is not a practical pedestrian route due to brush and trees present. Bruce Schulte discusses the aerial photo and the distance between the establishment and cul -de-sac. Loren Jones discusses how the boundaries and distances are calculated. He points out that currently it is to the boundary of the school property not the front door. Bruce Schulte states that the regulation states that it 's the pedestrian route and the woods are not a 'pedestrian ' route. He finds the applicant not to have been dishonest in his application. Mark Springer discusses for the record that a couple of the objections/comments are anonymous and reads some of them. Jana Weltzin points out that there have been no police calls regarding the matters discussed. Matthew Shelton discusses that the stolen car was random and had just slid into the driveway. He states that it was not related to the facility. An additional commenter states that the car was driven to the lot and then the perpetrator ran into the woods. She asserts that the theft ring is related to the area and references an aggressive Facebook page that the li- censee is part of. She discusses that neighbors are afraid of this licensee. Board and counsel discuss that the theft ring has been caught. Christopher Jaime states that he voted no for this licensee, the regulations speak for themselves and it should be a no. Jana Weltzin discusses the \"pedestrian route \" issue with the board. Melody McCullah testifies via phone and states that she supports the business. The school route is only by road, and most parents drive their children because they are out of the zone. She has never experienced odor and she thinks the license should be allowed. The objectors are 'busy bodies '. She states that there is a big fence around the playground. Bruce Schulte asks about the fence and asks if it 's possible to walk to the school grounds through the woods. Melody McCullah states that it is not possible. The only entrance is from Wasilla -Fishook road. Christopher Jaime states that fences mean nothing. Caleb Sanders, provides comment in person. He states that the rules being made are \"as a crow flies \" and \"pedestrian route \". He discusses the meaning of a \"pedestrian route \". Mark Springer states that this licensee was discussed in July and he asks for motion. Bruce Schulte leaves the room. Break is called at 11:00 am. Meeting resumes 11:10 am. Bruce Schulte moves to approve with delegation. Nick Miller seconds the motion. Bruce Schulte states that there has been lots of testimony in this matter but that he is looking at the current regulation that defines the measurement as the \"shortest pedestrian route \". He feels that this property meets the requirement. He addresses risk to youth and states that the playground appears to be fenced off and he believes that he does not see a rational basis for denying this renewal based on an overly restrictive interpre- tation of the rules. Mark Springer states that when the license was first approved in December 2018 the license passed unani- mously. Erika McConnell clarifies that no one was aware of the location situation in December. Mark Springer states that \"School Ground \" and Pedestrian Route matters are under discussion. He finds breaking a trail impedes this access being a pedestrian route. He gives very little weight to anonymous com- ments. Erika McConnell clarifies that the anonymous letters are considered \"comments \" not official objections. Nick Miller states that lots was done in July and the fact that the past measurements having been done show the distance is over 500 feet and he will support renewal Nick Miller, Bruce Schulte, and Mark Springer vote yes, Loren Jones and Christopher Jaime vote no. Motion carries 3 -2.

AS 11.71.900 (30) \"school grounds \" means a building, structure, athletic playing field, playground, parking area, or land contained within the real property boundary line of a public or private preschool, elementary, or secondary school; There is no ambiguity on these points. The limited marijuana cultivating facility operated by Mr. Happy Farms, LLC (MHF) , owned by Matthew Shelter and Thomas Dicus, is constructed on property that shares a common lot line with Shaw Elementary school . The shortest pedestrian route from the public entrance to the limited marijuana cultivating facility around the corner of the facility and to the lot line of Shaw Element ary School is estimated to be approximately 90 feet. The size of the MHF property is such that there is no physical way for the marijuana cultivating facility to be moved or re - construc ted on MHF property and be 500 feet or greater distance from the school grounds and in compliance with regulations . AMCO should not all ow continued operation of MHF on this property. The purpose of this letter is to : Show that t he owners of MHF knew the business was not in compliance with the 500 -ft separation requirement, had discussed separation requirements with the Mat -Su Borough, and had been referred to AMCO for state requirements. They incorrectly certified on their application that they met the 500 -ft separation requirement. Point out that th e AMCO staff did not catch this inaccurate representation in their review of the initial application. Demonstrate that w hen this discrepancy was first brought to the attention of the AMCO Board at its Jul y meeting questions arose on the definition of the shortest pedestrian route . The Board was to meet and establish clarity before deciding on compliance. Show that in the absence of clarity , at its September meeting the AMCO Board decided to allow contin ued operation of MHF . Request that AMCO find that MHF is not in compliance and revoke the license allowing contin ued operation of MHF at its current location, abutting the Shaw Elementary School property. The following timeline will provide helpful context: Spring 2018 - In February, March, and April 2018 MHF met with Mat-Su Borough Planner, Mark Whisenhunt . They discussed the fact that the building plans showed the facility to be within close proximity of school property . Mr. Whisenhunt explained that the Borough did not have requirements for Limited Marijuana Cultivating facilities and referred MHF to the AMCO for State of Alaska requirement s. MHF misrepresented this discussion to their attorney, indicating that the Bo rough \"didn't see it as an issue due to the distance from the actual school and the thickness of the forest\", reference June 11, 2019 email from MHF attorney ( Attachment 1 ). This is a very misleading statement and is directly countered by Mr. Whisenhunt's email (Attachment 2 ) in which he recalls the discussion with MHF representatives and clearly states that their office would not make opinions on State of Alaska standards and they always refer customers to AMCO. Summer 2018 - Mr. Happy Farms completed construction of the building, prior to application to AMCO. Refer to statement from Thomas Dicus ( Attachment 3 ). December 2018 - Matthew Shelter and Thomas Dicus certif y on their application that their building is \"not within 500 feet of a sc hool ground\" , knowing full well that they had already constructed in close proximity to the school boundary. The drawing included as part of the application identified a 60 -foot distance to the property lot line, but did not identify that property is owne d by the Mat -Su Borough school district. There does not appear to be any evidence that MHF followed the recommendation of the Mat -Su Borough planner and had a discussion with AMCO staff about the proximity to school grounds . One could reasonably assume t hey didn't want to have this discussion because they knew the outcome would prevent their business operation. AMCO did not catch th e misrepresentation during their new application review because AMCO does not apparently have a process in place to verify this requirement - unlike other qualifying statements , such as being a felon. Had AMCO staff known the business facility was in such close proximity to the school grounds , the license would surely not have been presented to the board for approval. May 2019 - The fact that the MHF facility is in very close proximity to S haw Elementary school grounds was brought to AMCO's attention. July 29, 2019 - In the AMCO Board meeting, there was a discussion about the distance of the facility from school grounds. There were differing opinions offered as to how to interpret regulatory requirements, particularly as relates to the \"shortest pedestrian route\" be tween the marijuana facility and the school grounds. The Board decided to allow MHF to continue operating until the Board could meet again and gain a clear er understanding of the regulation . The July Board minutes are not yet available, however a review of the audio recording will confirm. AMCO staff did not share in the July Meeting (not found in the July meeting audio recording) that the Board could revoke this license for misrepresentation of information as provided by Article 8. Enforcement; Civil Penalties 3 AAC 306.810. Suspension or revocation of license (1) misrepresented a material fact on an application for a marijuana establishment license, or an affidavit, report, or signed statement under AS 17.38 or this chapter . July 30, 2019 throug h September 10, 2019 - AMCO staff, through their Regulations Project Committee (headed by Loren Jones, Nick Miller, and Erika McConnell) had this time frame to complete a review and prepare for discussion with the AMCO Board. During this time, AMCO staff received several objections to this license renewal - specifically requesting they uphold the 500 foot separation requi rement. September 11, 2019 - In the AMCO Board meeting MHF was listed on agenda under License Renewal. The Board did not receive the clarity from the AMCO staff and the Regulations Project Committee because they were \" still working on the project\". Some Board members expressed confusion and frustration with the situation and some seemed to forget they had sought clarity be fore making a decision. Despite this lack of clarity, the Board approved the license renewal as being in compliance on a vote of 3 to 2. This decision was not fully informed and the Board created their own definition of regulations describing a measureme nt from the marijuana business to a fence on school property near the playground as an appropriate standard. This is apparent from the following excerpt from the unapproved September Board meeting minutes . Motion made by Bruce Schulte to approve with del egation: Bruce Schulte states \"that there has been lots of testimony in this matter but that he is looking at the current regulation that defines the measurement as the \"shortest pedestrian route\". He feels that this property meets the requirement. He addresses risk to youth and states that the playground appears to be fenced off and he believes that he does not see a rational basis fo r denying this renewal based on an overly restrictive interpretation of the rules. For full context, refer to ( Attachment 4 ) for a copy of the unapproved September Board meeting minutes. The AMCO staff should have recommended that the Board postpone a decision pending completion of their analysis and review by the Regulations Project Committee. The Board routinely postpones decisions and should have done so in this instance. To further illustrate the importance of adhering to regulatory definitions, the Board appears to have not considered objections that had been submitted in writing when deciding to use the playground fence as the criteria to establish \"school grounds\". Information ha d been providing indicating that Shaw Elementary , the largest elementary school in the MSB , often sends their children into the woods on established trails (beyond the playground fence) during their da ily PE classes throughout the school year. Th ey also p lace Geocaches in the woods for their youth to find - provided in writing to AMCO and included in the meeting tab for September Board meeting . On November 19th a resolution will be introduced to the Mat-Su Borough Assem bly (by Assemblyman Sumner) asking AMCO to reconsider their interpretation of their regulation decision on Mr. Happy Farms and to not allow the permitting of marijuana licenses in such close proximity of schools grounds , thereby protecting Mat-Su Borough s chools. The Mat-Su Borough requires 1,000 foot separation from schools for all other marijuana licenses in the Valley. They leave the enforcement of the 500 foot separation for Limited Marijuana Cultivation facilities to be upheld by the AMCO Board . Ultimately, the AMCO Board decision on the license for Mr. Happy Farms sets precedence for future licenses and can affect other schools in Alaska. I am requesting that this issue be placed again on the AMCO Board agenda for November with a recommendation to rescind the license for Mr. Happy Farms, LLC. I also request that AMCO consider strengthening your internal assurance process to verify future applicants are accurately representing regulatory compliance with school ground separation regulations. One way to strengthen this assurance would be to require applicants to identify adjacent property owners on their applications. Respectfully, Sam A.

Please feel free to contact me at this email address with any questions or concerns. Thank you most kindly, Lacy Wilcox, President Alaska Marijuana Industry Association October 25, 2019 Via email Erika McConnell, Director Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office Dear AMCO Director and Staff: Alaska cannabis business owners are deeply invested in their operations and hoping for the best as product prices and enforcement of the unregulated market continue to decline. We feel time is of the essence and that many of the issues listed in this letter require a response or remediation by the Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office or the Marijuana Control Board. When representatives of the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association met with you on October 10, we were asked to bring our concerns directly to your office first before making public statements. We would agree to do so in the future, but it has taken the association time to compile feedback from industry members. Therefore, the MCB is copied herein. Below is an extensive \u2014 but by no means complete \u2014 account of concerns from our membership and others in the industry. Responses to these items will be shared with our membership. Please keep in mind that we aim to present a broad perspective on these issues. We've not suggested specific policy or regulatory solutions, as we feel many issues can be resolved through collaboration with licensees, consistent staff interpretations, or changes to agency priorities and operations. www.alaskamarijuanaindustry.org 1 Lack of communication AMCO's most common form of communication with licensees is through Notice of Violations (NOV), which the agency now seeks to monetize with an egregious fine schedule. Licensees are not being adequately informed of changes to regulations or new interpretations of existing regulations. Business owners have been told by the agency that it is solely their responsibility to be up-to-date on regulations and agency expectations, however AMCO is not forthcoming with this information. Audio of MCB meetings has been requested several times by our members but they've been told the audio isn't available. We found out at the October 3 Alcohol Beverage Control Board meeting that those recordings actually are available. So why is this audio not being posted to the website, with the meeting documents, so the public can access it? As we've all learned, it's not enough to know the regulations; licensees must also understand how those regulations will be interpreted and the intent behind them. That's impossible without timely access to all relevant documents and meeting recordings. This issue is further complicated when interpretations aren't consistent. To illustrate our point, below is a list of the subject lines of all emails we believe were sent to all licensees so far in 2019: Marijuana Waste Advisory and new waste disposal notice form (1/10/19) Temporary ID's (1/14/19) Advisory - Manifest and Virtual Transfers (1/24/19) Information regarding handler permit status (4/4/19) Onsite Consumption Endorsement (4/11/19) Adding an onsite consumption endorsement to an existing license (4/16/19) 2019/2020 Marijuana Establishment License Renewal Application Notice (5/1/19) Advisory-Warnings/License Number & Inspection and Investigation (5/8/19) Handler Card Updates (5/31/19) Advisory for Retail regarding clones and Transport advisory (6/12/19) In-state Metrc Training in October (9/2/19) Hashade Batch 8/12/19 (9/30/19) None of these emails are intended to communicate changes made to regulations at scheduled MCB meetings; some only clarify interpretation of existing regulations. The advisory notices (which are hidden in the meeting documents section on the AMCO www.alaskamarijuanaindustry.org 2 website, and not easily accessible in a central location) communicated only the following: Licensees can be issued a violation for mistakes such as: Reporting the incorrect day and time on a manifest, even though METRC will allow a manifest to be created with an arrival date/time that is earlier than the departure date/time. Reporting weights in ounces instead of grams, even though METRC allows this and the requirement isn't explicit in the regulations. Accepting moldy or seeded marijuana, even though no business owner would knowingly accept such a product only to report it to AMCO later. Often such problems only become apparent as the flower is being handled for packaging or processing. AMCO should work with licensees on the matter of defective cannabis products to ensure safety and quality, while limiting unsellable inventory held onsite and preventing diversion. Employees must admit entry to an AMCO investigator when presented with state-issued credentials and badges. Examples of valid credentials not provided with the advisory notice. Retailers may only water clones and must destroy them once they reach 8\". Further maintenance of the plants is considered a violation as it constitutes \"cultivation.\" The TSA requests marijuana transporters arrive at the airport 2.5 hours ahead of scheduled departure; marijuana may not be transported as checked baggage. Licensees must comply with advertising regulations. If AMCO's short list of communication with licensees is an indication of anything, it's that the agency has no apparent priorities or guiding vision of how to regulate cannabis so that consumers are safe and licensees are compliant with regulations and competitive against the unregulated market. It also shows that AMCO enforcement and its director expects licensees to act perfectly at all times, despite ample opportunity for simple and often harmless mistakes to be made. Heavy-handed or non-responsive enforcement Many licensees have told the AMIA that they are afraid of self-reporting mistakes since doing so will almost certainly result in a violation. Similarly, licensees are often hesitant to ask questions or seek clarification from the agency for fear it might result in an unexpected violation or questioning by enforcement. www.alaskamarijuanaindustry.org 3 Those who decide to inquire further about a particular issue often wait days or weeks for a response; some report receiving incomplete responses or no response at all. We've heard reports of licensees receiving a phone call from AMCO staff with a response to an inquiry but then refusing to formalize that response by communicating it via email. Some degree of leniency for a licensee that self-reports a low-level violation should be standard practice; perhaps a documented warning would suffice in many cases. AMCO should review the most common and least harmful types of violations and find ways to ensure future compliance through education. A violation is a severe way to deal with most first-time compliance issues. We've also heard from licensees that feel a few AMCO employees treat cannabis businesses as inherently criminal in nature. If licensees are going to be treated like criminals and be subject to interrogation, then they should also be read their rights and allowed counsel. All of these issues create a dynamic that is counterproductive to the goal of a transparent and regulated cannabis industry. Regulatory inconsistency Interpretation of regulation is a critical issue for the AMIA. There have been numerous cases of questionable interpretations of regulations by the director and enforcement that do not allow for public comment or the board vetting process. If something is not specifically allowed in the regulations, some AMCO employees believe that means it's prohibited. We disagree with such interpretations as they only serve to enhance the unregulated market. AMCO has requested adjustments to METRC which the industry believes amounts to de facto regulation changes. We understand the AMCO director believes differently. The state's tracking system for cannabis may be administered by a private entity, but that entity is under contract with the state of Alaska. AMCO should be actively managing the outcomes of that contract, to include efforts to change or adapt the system to meet state regulations. www.alaskamarijuanaindustry.org 4 In the future we expect METRC trainings be informed by Alaska regulations, statutes, and common sense. There was a tremendous amount of concern after recent training events in which attendees felt they'd wasted their time and were disrespected. Many mid-sized and larger cannabis businesses have to employ someone full-time just to deal with METRC. Does AMCO have any one employee dedicated to ensuring Alaska's version of METRC is effective and accurately reflects regulatory requirements? Licensees should be able to expect that the fields of entry METRC requires are based on approved Alaska regulations. Anything less increases the chance of a preventable violation; anything more amounts to unvetted regulation. Inefficient, bureaucratic system AMCO staff have told licensees that the wait for review on change forms is 2-3 weeks when the agency is fully staffed; approval can take longer. These forms are required for a business to change its name, floor plan or operating plan, and to introduce new manufactured products or change ownership. All of these forms are reviewed and approved in the order in which they are received. Not all of these changes require the same level of review. An application to make complex changes to operating or floor plans could be forwarded to the licensee's primary investigator; applications for simpler changes could be detected shortly after submission and approved by staff. These changes often are needed to improve business operations and their quick approval is a key part of increasing trust, efficiency, and compliance in the cannabis industry. The AMIA urges AMCO to create and maintain a comprehensive public database of all approved and unapproved manufactured products. Listings should include details from the original product application, amendments suggested by staff or requested by the MCB, and a final status of the product. Such a database would be extremely helpful for licensees; some are concerned about consistency in approvals of similarly manufactured products. A database would also enhance consumer trust and help inform public health and medical professionals about legal cannabis products. www.alaskamarijuanaindustry.org 5 Future progress We would like AMCO to utilize the wealth of knowledge available to them through collaborative relationships with licensees. Going forward, all regulations projects should develop with an eye toward core issues of public health and safety and business efficiency. We would prefer to bring you these concerns with more time to work on them, and could do so if workgroups were organized and maintained. Regulations and NOVs are not the most effective tools when it comes to ensuring Alaskans have access to high-quality cannabis products.
