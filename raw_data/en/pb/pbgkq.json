Respect. Excellence.ANNUAL REPORT | 2017-20181 original goal of $200 million to raise more than $285 million. In early 2018, CAMH was entrusted with an unprecedented $100-million philanthropic gift toward research and innovation\u2014the largest donation to mental health in Canadian history. Throughout 2017-2018, we celebrated the launch of three new donor-funded centres of innovation\u2014the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, the Azrieli Centre for Neuro-Radiochemistry and the Azrieli Centre for Adult Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and Mental Health\u2014that will further accelerate our efforts to unravel the mysteries of the brain. These accomplishments are a testament to the generosity of our donors and to more people standing up and speaking out for better mental health care for all. Throughout this report, you will find many stories of our shared success and the impact of your support. All of this hard-won progress brings us to the year in which CAMH celebrates its 20th anniversary of service to Canadians. We are in a once-in-a-lifetime position to build on the momentum that we've created with our new awareness campaign: Mental Health Is Health. It's time to show\u2014more than ever before\u2014that mental health matters to all Canadians. Together, we're leading a movement for change. Thank you for standing with us. It was a year of tremendous achievement and well-deserved celebration at CAMH. We continue to work hard to realize our vision of creating equity and justice for people with mental illness. We are thrilled to take this time to look back fondly on what we've accomplished together, while also looking ahead with great excitement at what's next. This past summer, CAMH achieved the highest international standing for its electronic medical record, becoming only the second hospital in Canada t o receive this prestigious designation. It acknowledges that our world-leading clinical enterprise is built on first-class health information technology. In the fall, Prince Harry visited CAMH's Queen and Ossington campus, listening and learning with leading researchers and clinicians. He also enjoyed some private time meeting with young people struggling with mental illness, including addictions. His historic visit represents an important partnership in ending the stigma of mental illness. CAMH also broke ground on two new buildings to kick off the biggest and boldest phase of our Queen Street Redevelopment yet. Slated to open in 2020, the McCain Complex Care and Recovery Centre and the Crisis and Critical Care Building will revolutionize recovery-oriented care for patients and families for generations to come. CAMH Foundation recorded a banner year, which saw the Breakthrough Campaign soar past its CAMH continues to build momentum for mental health Dr. Catherine Zahn President & CEO, CAMH David Wilson Chair, Board of Trustees CAMH Deborah Gillis President & CEO, CAMH Foundation Thomas V. Milroy Chair, Board of Directors CAMH Foundation 2 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION CAMH scientists are shedding new light on why current treatments may not work for everyone, while also indicating directions to new methods to improve care. Major depressive disorder, for instance, isn't one condition that can be treated with one approach. At least 30 per cent of patients don't respond adequately\u2014or at all\u2014to current depression treatments. For researchers, the question is why and what can be done about it? One answer is likely because of genetic differences in depression between women and men. This year, a study by Dr. Etienne Sibille of the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute showed the same genes are activated the opposite way in women and men with depression. Dr. Sibille's research takes what we already know\u2014that there are obvious differences in how the sexes experience depression\u2014to the next level, paving the way for more investigation. \"These findings confirm the absolute necessity of doing parallel studies in men and women and of reassessing what we've taken for granted. Depression is not just depression,\" says Dr. Sibille. Another CAMH discovery highlights how depression changes the brain over time. Through brain imaging, Dr. Jeff Meyer found that people with periods of untreated depression lasting more than a decade had significantly more brain inflammation compared to those with less than 10 years of untreated depression. However, no matter how long people have had depression, they are all typically treated using the same approach, says Dr. Meyer. This one-size-fits-all mentality doesn't work. We need to change how we think about and provide care for depression as it progresses. Research by Dr. Lena Quilty is shaping our understanding of depression from another angle: personality. A recent study showed that scores for specific personality traits are associated with depression severity. She's also investigating how personality traits predict response to treatment. The long-term goal is to identify whether personality traits can serve as evidence-based markers that inform a person's diagnosis and treatment options. The Campbell Institute is enhancing our understanding of the underlying biological systems of mental illnesses. Through collaboration across CAMH research, the goal is to develop more personalized and precise care. Ongoing discoveries show that we can't achieve this goal without looking at the \"big picture\" factors that contribute to mental illness. \"A key priority with our research plan is to advance a new way of thinking of mental illness that links the brain, the rest of the body, social context and environment, and lifespan,\" says Dr. Bruce Pollock, Vice-President of Research and Director of the Campbell Institute. As a world-leading hospital with a diverse population and scientific expertise in brain science, clinical care and policy research, CAMH can draw on all its strengths to translate new research discoveries into meaningful change for patients. Taking a \"big picture\" view of mental illness Dr. Etienne Sibille, Campbell Family Chair in Clinical Neuroscience and Deputy Director of the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute at CAMH, has shown there are genetic differences in depression between men and women.ANNUAL REPORT | 2017-20183 CAMH is set to make a once-in-a-lifetime leap forward for mental health, thanks to an unprecedented $100-million gift from an anonymous donor . The largest donation to mental health in Canadian history will create the Discovery Fund, turbo-charging CAMH's efforts to transform the lives of people with mental illness. \"Quite simply, the Discovery Fund is an injection of wild, wild hope into the CAMH promise to bring justice to people with mental illness,\" says Dr. Catherine Zahn, CAMH President and CEO. \"These experts and experts-in-waiting will do the best work of their lives while they're here. They'll put their imagination to the test in an inclusive academic home where daring and passionate scientists drive research across all pillars of knowledge.\" The Fund will fuel research and innovation focused on understanding disease mechanisms, effective diagnosis and testing, and new ways to predict, prevent and recover from mental illness. It will enable CAMH to attract and activate the next generation of leading early- and mid-career scientists at a time when many struggle to secure funding, and provide support for high-risk, high-reward ideas that will bring new treatments to more people sooner. That's good news for people like Shelley Hofer, who has struggled with crippling depression most of her life. Over the past 20 years, she has tried every treatment imaginable, without much relief. Only recently, at the age of 43, has Shelley been able to live a healthier life, thanks to clinical research at CAMH. \"I would have died if I didn't get this help,\" explains Shelley. \"This treatment\u2014and the research that goes into it\u2014has changed my life in so many ways.\"\" An injection of wild, wild hope\" The Discovery Fund will support early- and mid-career researchers like Dr. Araba Chintoh. Through the Fund's discovery platform, people like Shelley will be engaged as partners in new knowledge creation, participating actively in research to advance care. \"We have a lot of work ahead of us,\" says Dr. Vicky Stergiopoulos, CAMH's Physician-in-Chief. \"Working closely with clinicians, scientists, and people with lived experience, we'll develop new treatments and service models to improve care and outcomes for people of all ages experiencing mental illness, now and in the future. Canadians are counting on us to create a new beginning through discovery and innovation. Through the Discovery Fund, we will deliver.\" Canadians are counting on us to create a new beginning through discovery and innovation. Through the Discovery Fund, we will deliver. DR. VICKY STERGIOPOULOS, PHYSICIAN-IN-CHIEF, CAMH4 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION Two new game-changing centres of innovation at CAMH are poised to transform the way we understand the brain and mental illness. Created through a $15-million gift from the Krembil Foundation, the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics is harnessing the power of high-performance computing to make sense of the massive amounts of complex data generated from brain research. \"Through this Centre, we'll be able to identify the warning signs and predict the right time to intervene so we can prevent mental illness from even developing,\" says Dr. Sean Hill, world-leading computational scientist and inaugural Director of the Krembil Centre. Formerly co-chair of Blue Brain, a Swiss brain initiative, and director of the Laboratory for the Neural Basis of Brain States at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Dr. Hill brings considerable expertise in building and simulating large-scale models of brain circuitry. He will lead a team of specialists in using analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to map the structure and function of the brain. By creating a virtual atlas of mental health and the brain, the Krembil Centre will greatly improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention. \"I've spent many years digging into the intricacies of brain circuitry and building very large computer models,\" Dr. Hill explains. \"We have opportunities here to use that modeling and new information technology to really have an impact.\" Dr. Neil Vasdev has also come to CAMH eager to change the way we see the brain. Dr. Vasdev leads the Azrieli Centre for Neuro-Radiochemistry, established through an $11-million gift from the Azrieli Foundation. Building on CAMH's global leadership in brain imaging, the Azrieli Centre is focused on pioneering new ways to view what is happening inside the living brain and fostering collaboration among international imaging centres.\"It's going to have a massive impact for people with mental illness,\" says Dr. Vasdev, who was recruited to CAMH from Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. He is also the endowed Azrieli Chaired Professor in Brain and Behaviour in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Radiochemistry and Nuclear Medicine. Dr. Vasdev is an expert in developing new chemical probes, called radiotracers, for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Radiotracers give researchers real-time visualizations of the brain. Many of the radiotracers currently used in PET neuroimaging around the world have been developed by CAMH's radiochemistry team. \"There is really nowhere I've seen that can more efficiently make a radiotracer, and actually see it translated for the first time in human PET imaging studies at the rate and scientific rigour that we have at CAMH,\" explains Dr. Vasdev. \"This Centre accelerates our efforts to explore unprecedented molecules in the brain, which will ultimately assist in early and accurate diagnosis and treatment planning for people with mental illness.\" Left to right, Dr. Sean Hill, Director of the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, and Dr. Neil Vasdev, Director of the Azrieli Centre for Neuro-Radiochemistry. Driving a better understanding of the brainANNUAL REPORT | 2017-20185Giving hope to Canada's aging population Dr. Tarek Rajji works with PACt-MD participant Ron Singer. Older Canadians need real solutions to a wide range of health conditions. Our work is bringing us closer to delivering those solutions that will benefit people in Canada and around the world. DR. TAREK RAJJI, CHIEF OF THE CAMH GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY DIVISION For Ron Singer, losing his memory meant losing his livelihood. \"That was the end of my acting career,\" says Singer, 79, of his age-related moderate cognitive impairment. \"I said to my wife, 'I simply can't memorize my lines. It's impossible and I'm terrified.' \" That fear has since been replaced by renewed optimism, thanks to a CAMH study that pairs brain stimulation with memory and problem-solving exercises. As the largest ever Canadian clinical trial on dementia prevention, PACt-MD draws on the expertise of CAMH's geriatrics team, Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention, and Research Imaging Centre. CAMH is leading the study\u2014which is funded by Brain Canada and the Chagnon family\u2014with four other major Toronto academic hospitals participating. \"There have been times when I was frightened that I would not be able to remember certain things I had to remember,\" Singer says. \"This program has made me feel less frightened in that way, more confident. I'm excited about the present and hopeful about the future.\" PACt-MD is just one of the many ways CAMH, home to Canada's largest geriatric psychiatry program, is improving mental health care for Canada's aging population. CAMH is leading the multi-site, NIMH-funded OPTIMUM trial in hopes of identifying the best treatments for older adults with treatment-resistant depression. The first of its kind, the study will examine 1,500 patients from a number of regions across North America. Philanthropy is also fueling important advancements in geriatric mental health. A generous gift from Shelagh and Peter Godsoe recently established a research chair in late-life mental health. The Chair will explore how we can better treat and support vulnerable seniors today and prevent mental illness from arising in late life. These initiatives\u2014just a small sample of CAMH's innovative projects\u2014have Dr. Tarek Rajji, Chief of CAMH's Geriatric Psychiatry Division, excited about the opportunity to make breakthroughs in the next few years. \"We are moving in the right direction to transform care for older adults with brain disorders,\" explains Dr. Rajji. \"Older Canadians need real solutions to a wide range of health conditions. Our work is bringing us closer to delivering those solutions that will benefit people in Canada and around the world.\" 6 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION CAMH is advancing a number of research projects aimed at helping patients today, with an eye toward improving the treatments of tomorrow. YouthCan IMPACT is a multi-site study led by CAMH that compares hospital-based outpatient mental health care to a community-based one-stop-shop model. \"Co-created with youth, YouthCan IMPACT is offering young people innovative services that are easily accessible and rigorously evaluated,\" says Dr. Joanna Henderson, Director of the Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth & Family Mental Health. \"This work is helping build better service models for youth across Ontario's communities for the future.\" Building on this work, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and the Ministry of Child and Youth Services, with support from the Graham Boeckh Foundation, are launching up to 15 integrated service hubs to address gaps in youth mental health care. Dr. Henderson is the project lead for Youth Wellness Hubs Ontario. Additionally, the Slaight Family Centre for Youth in Transition is integrating research into care to ensure young people experiencing psychosis and complex mental illness have access to leading-edge treatment, including non-invasive brain stimulation, virtual reality treatments and Cognitive Adaptation Training. Since the Centre's launch in 2015, its centralized recruitment model has helped boost young people's participation in research, providing approximately 300 young people treatment for depression, schizophrenia and autism through various projects, with another 600 youth participating in other studies. CAMH is also collaborating with Indigenous communities to identify effective ways to promote YouthCan IMPACT is providing young people with mental health services in their communities. Research today improves recovery tomorrowANNUAL REPORT | 2017-20187Technology driving mental health care into the future Dr. John Strauss and Dr. Marco Battaglia of CAMH's Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression are leading one of the world's first studies to monitor youth depression using mobile and wearable technology. Sleep patterns, physical activity and social interaction will be tracked to pinpoint changes that could indicate depression risks. CAMH researchers are studying whether an online mindfulness-based therapy, offered via smartphones and combined with personal health coaching phone calls, may be effective in treating youth with depression. An international team is analyzing speech patterns to better understand and prevent psychosis. In collaboration with IBM Watson in the U.S., the researchers are looking for differences that may be markers of psychosis risk. mental wellness among Indigenous peoples. Some of these initiatives, led by CAMH's Institute for Mental Health Policy Research scientists Dr. Samantha Wells and Dr. Julie George, as well as Dr. Renee Linklater, include the development of a boys' and men's mental health program; a collaboration with five First Nations on the development of wellness strategies informed by local data; a trauma-informed substance use assessment tool for First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples across Ontario; and two studies aimed at better understanding how community strengths, resilience and traditional practices influence wellness. \"We're working together in a model of intervention research, where we conduct research while also building supports in the community, which is very helpful for Indigenous communities,\" says Dr. Linklater, Director of Aboriginal Engagement and Outreach in CAMH's Provincial System Support Program. There's a general shift in mental health to recognize that youth have expertise that should be valued. EMMA MCCANN, YOUTH ENGAGEMENT FACILITATOR 8 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION Building a bridge to emergency care With more than 1,000 patients a month\u2014and steadily increasing\u2014the Gerald Sheff & Shanitha Kachan Emergency Department is the largest of its kind in Canada. In November, CAMH launched the Drop-in Bridging Clinic to ensure that every visitor to the emergency department gets the care they need. Initial results have been very promising, suggesting the service is already easing congestion and supporting follow-up care. People who arrive at the emergency department with non-urgent needs can be sent to the Bridging Clinic just down the hall to receive quality care without necessarily being admitted. In most cases, they are seen within 30 minutes\u2014dramatically shorter than the typical emergency department wait time\u2014freeing significant resources for more urgent patients. Inpatients preparing for discharge can visit the Bridging Clinic for follow-up care when they need it\u2014without an appointment\u2014anytime during its weekday operating hours. In its first three months, the Clinic had over 600 visits. One of the goals of the service is to reduce the need for patients to be readmitted to CAMH. The impact was immediate: In the first full month that the clinic was operational, the readmission rate was reduced by more than half. \"It helps people avoid falling through the cracks,\" says Natalie Quick, Manager of Access CAMH and Ambulatory Services in the Acute Care Program. That includes people like Charlie Cummings, who came to the emergency department with life- threatening depression. \"I kept my illness hidden and I got sicker and sicker until it was almost too late,\" says Cummings. \"Everything changed when I went to CAMH's emergency department and my illness was diagnosed for the first time. I started treatment immediately and today I have my life back.\" CAMH opened a new 23-bed acute care inpatient unit in March 2018 to further ease emergency department congestion and help more people like Charlie. When the latest phase of CAMH's redevelopment on the Queen Street campus is completed in 2020, one of the two new buildings will be home to the new site of CAMH's unique 24/7 mental health emergency department. Dr. Brittany Poynter, CAMH Emergency Department Clinic Head, and Charlie Cummings. ANNUAL REPORT | 2017-20189 I kept my illness hidden and I got sicker and sicker until it was almost too late. Everything changed when I went to CAMH's emergency department and my illness was diagnosed for the first time. I started treatment immediately and today I have my life back. CHARLIE CUMMINGS, CAMH AMBASSADOR10 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION opioid crisis CAMH pharmacists like Tianna Costa are on the front lines of the opioid crisis, providing face-to-face education in how Naloxone works. Canada is experiencing an opioid crisis. Today, opioid overdoses account for more deaths than automobile accidents. CAMH is responding to this public health emergency by bolstering its Opioid Overdose Prevention Strategy to include: Supplemental training for over 120 staf f in our addiction outpatient services; New educational material cr eated for patients and staff on overdose prevention; Medication r eviews for complex patients by a dedicated Opioid Overdose Prevention Initiative Pharmacist; and Incr eased pharmacist support for outpatients, including easier access to Naloxone kits. \"We want to make Naloxone available to anyone who wants it,\" says Advanced Practice Pharmacist Maria Zhang. \"There are so many people who would benefit from having a Naloxone kit who don't have one.\" The goal is to make Naloxone as stigma-free as an EpiPen, and a standard part of every opioid user's first aid kit, including those taking opioids by prescription as directed by their doctor. Zhang believes making pharmacists a core part of the overdose treatment team will improve outcomes. \"Traditionally I don't think people perceived pharmacists as harm reduction experts, but if you think of the most accessible health care provider in the community, it's probably the pharmacist.\" Another aspect of the team concept in overdose prevention is the non-judgmental support of family and friends. \"As much as we are focused on our patients, we very much want to reach out to family members and loved ones. They are the ones who are going to be giving them the Naloxone,\" says Advanced Practice Clinic Leader (Nursing) Alison Watson. \"Tell someone that you are using. Tell someone where you are going to be. Don't use alone. This is a relationship-building intervention between our patients, our therapists and the other people in their lives.\"ANNUAL REPORT | 2017-201811 Denise Robinson and her son Taydon. Left to right, Dr. Yona Lunsky and Naomi Azrieli celebrate the announcement of the Azrieli Centre for Adult Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and Mental Health. To start to change the way we deliver care, we have to train the mental health providers of tomorrow\u2014nurses, doctors and a range of health students. DR. YONA LUNSKY, DIRECTOR OF THE AZRIELI CENTRE FOR ADULT NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND MENTAL HEALTH Closing the gaps in care Denise Robinson wants what any parent wants: to see her son happy, healthy and thriving. Getting to that point has been a 27-year struggle through red tape, long wait lists and a mental health care system that often fails people with the sort of complex neurodevelopmental disabilities that affect her son Taydon. \"For those who cannot speak for themselves, our system is so broken,\" Denise says. Her struggle is typical for parents of adult children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, autism or an intellectual disability. In fact, nearly half of adults with neurodevelopmental disabilities also have a mental illness\u2014more than 30,000 people under age 65 in Ontario alone. Parents like Denise have reason to be hopeful, thanks to the newly created Azrieli Centre for Adult Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and Mental Health at CAMH, the first research and education centre of its kind.Established through a $10.4-million gift from the Azrieli Foundation, the Centre is developing a greater understanding of how best to care for a population that falls through the cracks far too often. \"The Centre is the spark,\" says Dr. Yona Lunsky, the new Centre's Director and an expert in the field. \"We're really going to make something that's never been done before\u2014and we're going to do it here at CAMH.\" The Azrieli Centre will fuel new breakthroughs, provide better care and share groundbreaking knowledge. The ripple effect of this work will reach across Canada and around the world\u2014empowering more people to reach their true potential. \"This funding allows us to pay attention to mental health and addictions in adults with very complex illnesses\u2014both mental and physical. There are no other programs of this kind in Canada,\" explains Dr. Lunsky. \"And we can be very excited about that.\" The Centre will also play a vital role in training the next generation of experts. \"To start to change the way we deliver care, we have to train the mental health providers of tomorrow\u2014nurses, doctors and a range of health students,\" says Dr. Lunsky. \"Through this Centre, we'll actually see people trained with new skills in the next 10 years and working across the country.\" 12 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION CAMH online course reducing stigma around the world Collaborating to connect more people to careWe know that people with mental illness and addiction often face stigma in society, but many people would be surprised to learn that they face it in health care environments as well. This year, CAMH and the Mental Health Commission of Canada launched a free online course called Understanding Stigma, designed to help health care professionals develop strategies to change attitudes and behaviours, leading to improved patient-provider interactions and better care for people with mental illness, including addiction. The online course is hosted on CAMH's website, making it easily accessible to health care providers and frontline clinicians across Canada. In just the first month, over 1,000 participants signed up from at least 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. \"CAMH is committed to improving the quality of care and driving mental health advocacy through education. We are delighted to partner with the Mental Health Commission of Canada to reduce the stigma of mental illness,\" says Dr. Ivan Silver, CAMH's Vice-President of Education. \"As health care providers, we must continue to challenge our own attitudes and co-create strategies with our patients to address stigma.\" CAMH's efforts to improve mental health care in remote and rural areas have received a tremendous boost; six new ECHOs are being funded by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Through weekly teleconferences, ECHOs connect academic health science centres with the frontline of community care to share knowledge, expand clinical skills and capacity, and improve care for people with mental illness. ECHO Ontario Mental Health at CAMH and the University of Toronto is launching ECHOs focused on First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis Wellness; Trans and Gender Diverse Healthcare; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (with Sunnybrook Hospital); Addiction Medicine and Psychosocial Interventions (with St. Michael's Hospital); Structured Psychotherapy; and Advanced Practice Mental Health. Working with University Health Network, U of T and Queen's University, CAMH has formed the ECHO Ontario Superhub to teach other centres how to operate their own ECHOs. \"This training offers an excellent opportunity to teach new ECHOs about implementation in the Canadian context and provide better mental health care to people living in remote areas,\" explains Eva Serhal, Director of the ECHO Ontario Superhub and Outreach, Telemental Health and ECHO at CAMH. Left to right, Dr. Allison Crawford and Dr. Renee Linklater co-lead the ECHO Ontario First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Wellness. As health care providers, we must con tinue t o challenge our own attitudes and co-create strategies with our patients to address stigma. DR. IVAN SILVER, VICE-PRESIDENT OF EDUCATIONANNUAL REPORT | 2017-201813 Expanding and adapting cognitive behavioural therapy Then-Ontario Health Minister Dr. Eric Hoskins came to CAMH in October to celebrate the groundbreaking for the next phase of CAMH's Queen Street Redevelop ment Project, but it wasn't the only reason. He used the occasion to announce over $72 million in new money to expand structured psychotherapy services at a network of Ontario hospitals, including CAMH. The government's investment will help more than 100,000 people with mental illness. \"Structured psychotherapy is an evidence-based, life-saving treatment for illnesses such as anxiety and depression,\" said Dr. Hoskins. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is applied in a variety of ways at CAMH, with a special emphasis in recent years on Culturally Adapted CBT. CAMH recently recruited Dr. Farooq Naeem, an international expert in Culturally Adapted CBT who has trained more than 3,000 clinicians from around the world. As the long-time Executive Director of Women's Health in Women's Hands (WHWH) Community Health Centre, Notisha Massaquoi has devoted her career to providing frontline mental health care to black and other racialized women, the majority of them new Canadians. \"Culturally Adapted CBT takes a Western practice and adapts it to address the issues that many racialized communities are experiencing in terms of mental health,\" she says. \"One of the things we tend not to understand clearly in the Canadian context is that different cultures have different concepts of being well, especially when it comes to mental health and mental illness.\" In partnership with CAMH, WHWH has expanded its use of culturally adapted CBT with impressive results. In the last two years, the percentage of women treated at WHWH who were admitted to emergency departments has dropped dramatically, from 30 per cent to less than three per cent. That's thanks in large part, she says, to the partnership with CAMH. \"I can't speak highly enough about this model,\" she says. It has been so successful that Massaquoi is now working with Drs. Branka Agic and Kwame McKenzie on a research project to explore in greater depth how this model might be replicated in other health care settings. \"This is exactly the kind of successful partnership CAMH hopes to build upon with our renewed Health Equity strategy to further collaborate with community- based service providers who have deep expertise working with multiple diverse, racialized and other marginalized groups,\" says Janet Mawhinney, Director of Community Engagement at CAMH. CAMH is working with Women's Health in Women's Hands Community Health Centre, led by Notisha Massaquoi, to bring mental health services to racialized women.14 CAMH & CAMH FOUNDATION PROVIDING NATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON CANNABIS USE AND REGULATION In January, MP Bill Blair (pictured using CAMH's driving simulator) announced $1.4 million in funding through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research for research to support the development of policies and programs related to the legalization and regulation of cannabis. CAMH's Dr. Benedikt Fischer spearheaded the development of Canada's Lower Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines. CAMH-LED MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Dr. Sandy Simpson, Chief of Forensic Psychiatry at CAMH, discusses a $1.6-million grant in June 2017 from the federal government to the International Collaboration for Excellence and Innovation in Mental Health Corrections (I-CEIsMIC). As Scientific Director of I-CEIsMIC, Dr. Simpson will lead an international team of experts working with correctional facilities around the world to address gaps in mental health services for inmates. TEMERTY CENTRE FEATURED ON 60 MINUTES The work of Dr. Jeff Daskalakis and Dr. Daniel Blumberger at CAMH's Temerty Centre for Therapeutic Brain Intervention was the subject of a special report by Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes in May 2018. It looked at the efficacy of Magnetic Seizure Therapy (MST) for hard-to-treat depression. The Temerty Centre is one of only five centres worldwide conducting MST research. BREAKING GROUND ON THE NEXT PHASE IN CAMH'S REDEVELOPMENT CAMH and community leaders break ground on the latest\u2014and boldest\u2014phase of the Queen Street Redevelopment Project in October. When complete, the McCain Complex Care and Recovery Centre and the Crisis and Critical Care Building will house over 600,000 square feet of clinical space, transforming how care is delivered. Marking MilestonesANNUAL REPORT | 2017-2018CAMH DIFFERENCE MAKERS: 150 LEADING CANADIANS FOR MENTAL HEALTH In 2017, CAMH recognized 150 Leading Canadians for Mental Health, an initiative to shine a spotlight on those in the forefront of mental health in their communities. Throughout the fall, CAMH celebrated Difference Makers at events across Canada and shared their stories on social media. We met people like Suzanne Blackwell from Alberta, who developed a one-of-a-kind clinic to support parents living with mental illness; Elsie Morden from Nova Scotia, who is teaching students about the harms of bullying through her music; and Kirt Ejesiak from Nunavut, a leading voice for socioeconomic change in Canada's North. The conversation has started. Inspiring stories are being told. Stigma is being destroyed. Momentum is building. ONE BRAVE NIGHT FOR MENTAL HEALTH In its first three years, One Brave Night has done more than raise millions for mental health. It's given thousands of people from across Canada a platform to share their stories of hope and inspiration. Meet Toronto singer-songwriter, Ms Paige. She believes we can all do our part to lift others up during their most difficult times. \"You don't need to understand to be understanding. That's why it's important that we raise awareness to relieve current stigma and raise funds to make facilities and programs available to those who need it most,\" she says. \"It's important to let people know they aren't alone in their fight and give them hope to persevere and love themselves.\" GIFTS OF LIGHT BRINGS SMILES AND SONG Gifts of Light was launched in 2008 as a holiday program to bring joy to CAMH patients and show them they are not alone in their recovery. Since then, the program has expanded, thanks to the leadership of Donna Slaight, to include many powerful initiatives and partnerships that support even more people year-round. Last year, performers from Smile Theatre visited a number of CAMH units, hosting fun and interactive sing-alongs with patients. \"We noticed an immediate shift in the environment as people came out of their rooms, sang along and even danced with our performers and one another,\" says Quinn Kirby, Gifts of Light Program Manager. \"It was truly one of the highlights I have had working in this program.\" Sandi and Jim Treliving, Co-Chairs of the National Committee, with Elsie Morden (centre), a CAMH Difference Maker from Halifax.
