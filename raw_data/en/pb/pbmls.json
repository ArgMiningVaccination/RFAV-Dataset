It expresses activity. It reflects the identity of anthro-posophy, of the Anthroposophical Society, of any anthroposophically inspired work, in fact. Activity, cognizing activity, activ - ity that leads to knowing the I as the true being of a spiritual movement, of a soci- ety and of manifold initiatives all over the world? A self-knowledge, which is not easy to grasp, as the unifying task of people who research, teach and take on responsibility, who are connected throughout the world in their active spiritual practice; as the mo-tif, that is, of the School of Spiritual Science? But this is not all. Does this enigmatic phrase not describe what makes us hu-man, does it not designate humanity as such? Understanding oneself and being able to act in the world out of under - standing; being understood and finding meaning in one's own and other people's actions - that is a desire that increasingly rises to consciousness in us today - with ever greater urgency.Again, this motto will be at the centre of the Anthroposophical Society and its life - in this year (2014/2015) as the foun - dation stone of a world affirmation, just as, in the past year, it was the affirmation of the foundation stone laying. A hundred years ago, Rudolf Steiner laid the foun - dation stone for the Goetheanum - the home of the wrestling for the knowledge of the human being, for becoming active in the world out of knowledge. World af - firmation in an ever more complex world of questions, insecurities and man-made disasters needs strong spiritual and in - terpersonal roots. As the meditative prac- tice of self- and world-knowledge, these liberating roots are the living heart of all anthroposophical work. They connect people across professions, interests and orientations, they bridge continents and contrasts. The annual report gives insight into this commitment and speaks of the trust in the ongoing development of this endeavour. | Bodo von Plato, Executive Council at the Goetheanum 28 March 2014 No 4 Annual Report 2013/2014 1 The I knows itself 2 Motifs from 2013/2014 3 Goetheanum Leadership: Looking back over 2013/2014 4 Visual Art Section: New section leader Marianne Schubert 6 Goetheanum Stage: From the Mys- tery Plays to Faust 7 Finance Report Anthroposophical Society 11 Addendum to the Annual General Meeting: Concern and motion received too late 15 Membership Anthroposophy Worldwide 11 Russia: 120th anniversary of the Philo\u00acsophy of Freedom and the conference Freedom as a way of keeping the human identity 13 Australia: Little Yarra Steiner School School of Spiritual Science 11 Medical Section: The History of Curative Education and Social Therapy Forum 14 On Rudolf Steiner's identity - reply 14 Thoughts on the Critical Steiner Edition Feature 16 Argentina: Fire at the House of the Anthroposophical Society Annual Report 2013/14 Liberating Roots \"The I Knows Itself\" - seal to Rudolf Steiner's First Mystery Drama \"The Soul's Awakening\"2 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 Dear reader, In mid-March more than 800 members in Spain, Argentina and other Latin-Amer - ican countries received the first Spanish issue of Anthroposophy Worldwide. This project of the Anthroposophical Society in Spain makes it possible for the General Anthroposophical Society and the Latin-American world to communicate more directly. The willingness to communicate is like the opening of a market where peo-ple come together, meet each other and share their experiences. Mutual percep - tion and participation can be enhanced. And this is what happened. Thanks to the contact established through the editor Michael Kranawetvogl we already received contributions from Argentina (page 16). And Paul Mackay had hardly announced that the members should be included in the considerations regarding changes to the exterior stairs in the west of the Goetheanum, when the first con - tribution on that topic arrived. Once the plans have been presented at the AGM, this \"conversation\" will take place at vari- ous levels: in the media, in an exhibition at the Goetheanum and at membership days: the members will be included, at every step on the way, in the forming of judgements.| Sebastian J\u00fcngel Editorial Anthroposophy Worldwide appears ten times a year, is distributed by the national Anthroposophical Societies, and appears as a supplement to the weekly Das Goethea- num Publisher: General Anthroposophical Society, represented by Justus Wittich Ed-itors: Sebastian J\u00fcngel (responsible for this edition), Michael Kranawetvogl (responsible for the Spanish edition), Margot M.

These teachers had come from China, South America, India and various European countries. They sat in a circle, a geometri-cal form that aptly expressed the way the conversation unfolded. Peter R\u00f6h of the Pedagogical Section described it as \"a circle of cultures in which we, together, asked questions regarding the future of education and found answers.\" With Ben Cherry, coordinator of Waldorf schools in China, R\u00f6h moderated this small but global cultural circle. Global topics Until around ten years ago, anthropos- ophy was exported from Europe into the world: people in Chengdu or the Brazilian city of Botucatu were keen to hear how this or that could be done anthroposophi- cally. Today, the picture has changed. The formerly Eurocentric explanations have turned into conversations on anthropos- ophy. Anthroposophy does not only indi- vidualize itself in people; it also manifests in specific ways with specific answers in the various cultures. A global field of conversation, a mutual learning process, emerges and Rudolf Steiner's statement that we can only be individualities to the extent that we carry humanity within us, becomes living experience. With the first completed eurythmy training course in Chile, the first anthroposophic hospital in India and the Asian Pedagogical Con - ference attended by 400 teachers in the summer of 2013, new topics come to the surface and new agents join in the con - versation. We could look at last year's conflicts, which culminated in Sergei Prokofieff's withdrawal from the Executive Council, as the shadow cast by this expansive gesture within anthroposophy. But we could also see these conflicts, which con - cern basic questions of anthroposophy and the relationship with Rudolf Steiner, as a necessary process of self-assurance within the Anthroposophical Society. As shown in a number of opinions expressed in Anthroposophy Worldwide - for in - stance by Paul Mackay and Marc Desaules in issue 6/2013 - this process needs a cul- ture of individual and communal forming of judgements. In November a Members' Day was newly introduced as a forum without the need to take positions. Jus- tus Wittich introduced the gathering by speaking out the wonderful wish that \"it may be possible for all to turn their stand- points into points of view\". But as pleas-ant as the atmosphere was at that Mem - bers' Day, which was attended by around 300 people: it showed again that it is not easy, in the Anthroposophical Society, to keep to factual discourse or 'constructive dispute'. Either the views put forward harden and become positions or deter - minations of truth or they lose their clear outlines in the attempt to bring about harmony. The tension between balance and contour Rudolf Steiner's sculpture depicts these two opposite sides of the soul - in last year's conflicts with their hardening and dissolving tendencies they appeared as a time phenomenon. As in Rudolf Steiner's wooden sculpture, both forces seem to be necessary. Standing up for what is seen as the truth gives the Anthroposophical Society spiritual form while taking away warmth and even its life. Making an effort to achieve balance and tolerance brings diversity and vibrancy, but at the cost of clear spiritual contours. The monthly meetings of General Sec- retaries and the Executive Council, the new concept of the Annual Conference and the specialist meetings that aim at exchange are stages on the journey. The success of these and other steps will determine whether truth and life - two sides of the same coin - are the hallmarks of the Anthroposophical Society. They form the counterweight in the process of expansion of anthroposophy.| Wolfgang HeldMotifs from 2013/2014 The expansive gesture and its counterweight Rudolf Steiner's statement that we can only be individualities to the extent that we carry humanity within us becomes living experience Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 | 3 In the newsletter of the Johannesbauverein (Johannes-Building association) of October 1911 we already find the statement that the future building was to be a place devoted to the Mystery Plays as well as to an esoteric school and the permeation of all areas of science with anthroposophy in an indepen - dent academic institution. Looking at the specialist sections and fields of life in gen - eral we realize today that the deepening and further development of the anthroposophi- cal substance is our main challenge in the years and decades to come. We also observe in many places that a living relationship be- tween the Anthroposophical Society and the fields of practice must first be established or, where such a relationship exists, it needs to be deepened. It often happens that those who are active in the fields of practice have little strength or motivation left to attend lo- cal branch meetings or Class events. Some branches also seem to constitute a cosmos of anthroposophical life of their own and people involved in the fields of practice find them restricting or uninspiring. What forms of working together must be developed to meet the needs of these people? Practical relevance Work within the School of Spiritual Sci- ence also often seems like a world of its own where the class lessons are cultivated, closed off from the Anthroposophical Society and the fields where anthroposophy is applied in practice. It often seems to lack practical relevance. Heinz Zimmermann thought that this was due to \"the view that the contents and cultivation of the First Class, which prob - ably consisted in the listening to the reading of written down class lessons, were what characterized the School of Spiritual Science. What people forget is that the course of First Class lessons [...] was given primarily for in - dividual meditation, to develop the faculties without which anthroposophy cannot be individually represented.[...] The narrowing down of the School of Spiritual Science to the cultivation of class lessons is something that first needs to be overcome.\" The work in the School of Spiritual Science consequently only comes into its own if it can provide the sources of inspiration necessary to meet the needs of our time. With this stocktaking we do not intend to criticize the way things are at present. It is meant as a reflection that makes us aware of the wider tasks we need to take on in future. The living harmony of the Anthroposophical Society, the fields of life and the School of Spiritual Science - through mutual inspira- tion and penetration in spiritual practice, ac- tive participation in the Class work and the realization of practical life tasks - is the chal- lenge posed by the Christmas Conference. It remains an important task for us. The real-ity in the fields of life is so complex and de- manding today that we need the spiritual inspiration of the School of Spiritual Science. It is the place where we develop the inner faculties and gain the forces that we need to face the diverse threshold experiences. The Anthroposophical Society should have a central role in this, promoting the School of Spiritual Science on the one hand and supporting and protecting the work in the fields of practice on the other. That Ru- dolf Steiner struggled to establish this way of harmonious working together even be- fore the Christmas Conference is apparent from the events of the fateful year 1923. As we approach the centenary of the Christmas Conference in 2023/2024, we consider the active continuation of this striving for unity as a central task. Themes to work on Starting with the foundation stone lay - ing for the First Goetheanum, we have de- voted ourselves since September to the uni- fication of science, art and religion. We have looked at the individual areas in more detail and we continue to work on the question of scientific qualities. We have started to study GA 25 (Philosophie, Kosmologie und Reli- gion) as well as the eponymous lecture cycle (GA 215). These studies we will continue. The three areas are here most closely con - nected with the anthroposophical knowl-edge of the human being and the path of inner development. September to December were dedicated to Goethe's Faust to give us a foundation for our decision-making with regard to a new production. The idea is that the production ought to be intimately connected with the questions of the Sections and of the School of Spiritual Science. A further area we worked on were the formalities connected with the First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. So far, we have looked at the admission interview and what it means to be a representative. Three meetings with Class members around the Goetheanum in March, April and May will offer the opportunity for conversation on these questions. Areas of responsibility at the Goetheanum At the beginning of 2013 we first reflect - ed and worked on areas of responsibility at the Goetheanum, asking ourselves whether any changes were possible or necessary before confirming those in charge of the various areas and departments. Members of the Goetheanum Leadership Group are - either individually or in pairs - respon - sible for the areas and departments at the Goetheanum. This means that, for the first time, the principle of individual responsibil- ity was consistently introduced to each area (see Anthroposophy Worldwide 5/2013 for more details). This responsibility is granted for three years and can be withdrawn by the Goetheanum Leadership. All bigger projects are presented to and discussed by the Goetheanum Leadership Group, which does, however, not take any decisions since they are the remit of the person(s) in charge of the relevant area or department. As a second, and equally important, pro- cess that took place in the first half of 2013, the section leaders presented their indi- vidual fields. Due to our full agendas, the weekly meetings of the Goetheanum Lead- ership Group do not usually allow for such an in-depth exchange. The presentations of the individual sections included a historical overview as well as a look as their current tasks, conferences, people or groups with particular responsibilities within a section and the worldwide section work. Against the background of current events we consid-ered individual problems and plans for the future. In addition to these more exoteric aspects and developments we also looked at the esoteric work within the sections.| Paul Mackay/Christiane Haid, Goetheanum Leadership spokespersons Annual Report 2013/14 Goetheanum Leadership: Looking back on the working year 2013/2014 Living harmony as an organizational task of the Anthroposophical Society, the School of Spiritual Science and the practice fields. Since September 2013, the Goetheanum Leadership has worked intensely with the foun - dation stone laying of 1913, preparing a new step that can serve as a foundation for the 2014 Annual Conference and Annual General Meeting.4 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 Annual Report 2013/14 Marianne Schubert grew up in Hesse (DE), a part of Germany with many areas of natural beauty and places as fa-miliar as Mother Holle's pond in the folk - tales of the Brothers Grimm. Her father being an architect and painter, she got to visit building sites as well as exhibitions from an early age. The documenta, a ma- jor exhibition of contemporary art in Kas- sel (DE), which opened for the first time in her birth year 1955, is where she encoun - tered modern art from childhood. Here, she met Joseph Beuys, with his 'Honey - pump' and 'Direct Democracy', the drastic performance artist Hermann Nitsch and photorealism, all of which left a deep im - pression on her young soul, as she says. At the age of 18 she began to study architecture in Darmstadt (DE), graduat - ing with a thesis on 'Interaction between built-up environments and their inhabit - ants'. She studied how people feel in dif - ferent surroundings. She then went on to study landscape design in Kassel and a year of ecology in Vienna. In that period, between the age of 18 and 28, clear mo- tifs emerged and stayed with her through her life: architecture and the kind of so-cial life it inspires, as well as garden art and the question of how one deals with wild plants. Her first professional experi-ence she gained in a landscape planning office in Frankfurt. Shaping the environment At the age of 28 she met anthroposo- phy and shortly after she discovered the Goetheanum. She attended the Waldorf teacher training in Mannheim to deepen her knowledge of anthroposophy. \"Inter - estingly, I had my admission interview with the Goethean scientist and biologist Andreas Suchantke\", Marianne Schubert explains. From him she learnt on field trips how to identify birds and plants. She continued these studies when she attended the Science Year at the Goethe- anum under the direction of Jochen Bock - em\u00fchl. Marianne refers to the years that fol- lowed, from the age of 32 to 43, as her \"an - throposophical apprenticeship\". With the sculptor Hansj\u00f6rg Palm she planned the landscaping at and around the Goethea- num in the 1990s. With Christian Hitsch, who took over the Visual Art Section, she organized building camps. Giving courses at conferences and guided tours and or - ganizing a major art exhibition in support of the refurbishment of the Main Audito- rium were important steps in those years. With Jochen Bockem\u00fchl, she worked on his concept of 'directed plant com -munities'. His thoughts on metamor - phosis resounded deeply with Marianne Schubert, presenting her with an interest - ing contrast to the static scientific views she had met at university. The landscap - ing project at the Goetheanum was ac- companied by anthroposophical experts from whom she could learn much: Rex Raab, Michael Bockem\u00fchl, Abi Asmussen and Arne Klinkborg. The building team in J\u00e4rna (SE) remains a model for her own work. From them she learned to understand that modesty and the power of ar - tistic expression are not mu- tually exclusive. The smallest chicken coop can be 'beau-tiful', she says, in that it is a metamorphosis of the basic building idea behind all the buildings in J\u00e4rna. Entrepreneurial responsibil- ity Other activities followed. For 16 years she was a mem - ber of the Board of Directors of the Gemeinschaftsbank in Dornach (CH) and worked with the Goetheanum's building fund group, gaining insight into entrepreneur - ial and financial matters. By founding the International Forum Man and Architecture (ifma) she established con - tact with architects all over the world. Major architecture conferences resulted from this impulse: in J\u00e4rna in 1994 and at the Goetheanum in 1996. Her encounters with oth - er arts, such as eurythmy and painting, and her studies of the growth gestures in plants widened her concept of the life forces. The idea of the living organism and Rudolf Steiner's building forms be- came new companions in her life, as she began to explore the question, \"where does the language of architecture flow into the landscape and meet landscape forms that, in turn, evolve into architec- tural forms.\" Marianne Schubert refers to the peri- od between the ages of 44 and 57 as her \"anthroposophical journeyman years\": in Visual Art Section: New section leader Marianne Schubert A wide and welcoming gesture Since March Marianne Schubert has been the new leader of the Visual Art Section. As an architect she is not only interested in building but also in the social life arising from the way one builds. Her wishes are for a culture of togetherness, where people devel- op their communal awareness for new methods of working and evaluating. The contribution of the arts to the general anthroposophical concerns: Marianne Schubert Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 | 5 Annual Report 2013/14 1998 she founded her own architecture firm, where she planned and realized buildings and the grounds of schools, communities and commercial enterpris-es, such as the anthroposophical bank GLS, the organic supermarket chain alna- tura, the drugstore chain DM or Sekem. In 2002 Marianne Schubert opened an art gallery south of Munich to offer a plat - form for freelance artists to meet and share their experiences. Understanding the needs of others How can one, when one pursues long- term projects, read the needs of others from what they bring to expression? This question led her to attend further train - ing in mediation, biography work, Vik - tor Frankl's logotherapy and non-violent communication. Building has a social aspect for Mari- anne Schubert: \"Working in construction at Frankfurt Airport showed me the hor - rible, slave-like working conditions on large-scale building sites: at the end of a long row of sub-contractors stands the builder who slaves away for 3.50 Euros an hour, not knowing where, what or whom he is working for. I wanted to create build-ing processes where the workers can con - nect with their task, where planners and craftsmen meet at eye-level, as it used to be in the old cathedral workshops.\" For a spiritually extended building culture this means - as Marianne Schubert points out - \"that one takes into account all the be- ings which contribute to the building, in - cluding the elementals. She summarizes her ethos as \"building in order to heal, in order to create vitality.\" Rudolf Steiner's place of life During a meeting of section members Marianne Schubert describes how she experiences her task as section leader. \"I sense two streams that want to come to-gether in this new task: they are, on the one hand, my - family and professional - roots in the material life and, on the other, my childhood experiences that there is a spiritual world that led me to anthropos- ophy at the age of 30.\" She never felt that the Second Goethe- anum radiated a purely contemplative, temple-like mood that is only meant for the inner life. \"For me, Rudolf Steiner's Gesamtkunstwerk continues to breathe; it has a wide and welcoming gesture. All the artistic elements, individual as they may be, are connected; strict, yet full of loving details, especially where the transitions are. It is as if Rudolf Steiner wanted to build a bridge for us between the material and spiritual worlds.\" She quotes from one of Rudolf Steiner's note-books from 1888, \"The artist transforms the individual, lending him universality. He turns the merely accidental into some-thing necessary; what is of the earth he makes divine.\" Outlining the artist's task she says, \"We know too much and therefore forget about what we sense. It is not the task of artists to give a sensory form to the idea, but to allow reality to appear in the light of the ideal.\" Her own task she describes as \"taking seriously my own concern with togetherness, with the perception of the special place that is the Goetheanum, with looking at the biography of this task.\" For this, she first wants to experi- ence what exists, what has grown, and she therefore asks, \"Who has brought about what and when?\" Because she thinks that the concept of art needs to be newly identified again and again, Marianne Schubert wishes for peo- ple to develop their perception together, so that new ways of working and evaluat - ing can be found. \"In order to be sensory observers we need nothing but healthy senses; genius is not necessary.\" Mari-anne Schubert cites this statement from Rudolf Steiner's 'Goethe as the Father of a New Aesthetics' in order to underline her wish to develop a culture of togetherness where people meet over the questions - not the answers - of life. She remembers the discussions about the refurbishment of the Main Auditorium in 1998, \"My ex - perience from the meetings of that time was that people used the voice of Rudolf Steiner to prove to each other with the same quotation that their own opinion was the right one.\" The present and future of the past \"How do we move on with the Goethe- anum building, with all the works of art from the past, how do we integrate them? How are guests being received who would like to understand something of Rudolf Steiner's artistic impulse? What working conditions can we offer them, how can they meet artists?\" These, in summary, are her main questions. She also asks about the organs which can make the Section visible and about the work on the anthroposophical founda- tions of art creation. Marianne Schubert looks at the Goetheanum: \"There is no place in the whole world where one can learn so much, day in day out, from Rudolf Steiner's artis-tic impulse.\" Her question is what we can 'learn' in the Visual Art Section. One needs to have an interest in anthroposophical and non-anthroposophical artists in the world and discover who is close to the anthroposophical ideas. Asked how she sees her collaboration with the Executive Council and the other section leaders, she emphasizes that it is also a matter of ac-knowledging the general anthroposophi- cal concerns of the School of Spiritual Sci- ence and contributing to them what the arts have to offer. What she implied again and again indirectly, she speaks out at the end of her contribution: \"I would like to be a host.\" | Wolfgang Held Das Goetheanum The German-Language Weekly Now in Color I would like to subscribe to Das Goetheanum. One 65 www.dasgoetheanum.ch 6 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 Annual Report 2013/14 Sebastian J\u00fcngel: How will the transition be from Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Plays to Faust? Christian Peter: The Mystery Plays are still being performed; there is strong demand, especially from Germany. Margrethe Solstad: We will then as- semble a new ensemble for the Faust for which auditions took place in March. J\u00fcngel: Are there enough young actors, seeing that the situation is so difficult for speech artists? Peter: I was surprised that all the young people came from training courses that of - fer not only the classic speech training but also acting - while the older applicants tend to have the more classic speech train - ing. Among the young people we also had more women applicants than men. Solstad: In eurythmy we also had many young people from many different countries. Building on the ensemble's potential J\u00fcngel: What is special about this produc-tion? Solstad: It's too early to say. We have cho- sen a way of working where everyone contributes their point of view and then we see where that leads us. That means that there will be changes. We have cho-sen a path of mutual inspiration. J\u00fcngel: On the Goetheanum stage, there have often been added impulses that went beyond the performance of the play, such as 'moving light'. Peter: That is not what I am after. I am interested in the subject matter and the play. I don't need anything else. J\u00fcngel: What do you mean by \"the play\"? Does not everyone see \"his\" or \"her\" play?Peter: That's right. And I therefore seek the dialogue with the play and with the people with whom we are working on this. This is why we did not have casting sessions to look out for people who cor - respond to a ready-made director's idea. Instead we held auditions that helped us to get to know people and to put together a team that we think will achieve a good performance of Faust.Solstad: This is why we are looking for a stage set that leaves plenty of freedom for what wants to unfold between the actors and eurythmists. Peter: Light is an important element in this. Light only becomes visible when it 'meets' something. How much material- ity does it need to make spaces appear? We have experimented with objects and painted areas: where is either of them most suitable? In a performance that lasts 16 hours the eye simply needs changes. ... Relationships in space Solstad: In the Mystery Plays we brought together acting and eurythmy. This we want to continue to cultivate and deep - en with the Faust. There is much scope for development, for instance, when it comes to the relationships in space be- tween the various actors in the play and the speaking through eurythmy gestures. The eurythmy aims to further explore the dramatic tension. In order to allow act - ing and eurythmy to come more closely together, we meet regularly to become aware of our mutual intentions, so that we can later work homogeneously, even if we hold different views on this or that question. J\u00fcngel: For the Mystery Plays, Christian Peter introduced quite an open way of rehearsing, without instructions. Instead there is a possibility to find a new way each time. How is this in eurythmy? Solstad: Eurythmy is a different world in this respect. We have big group forms, for instance, which cannot be improvised. Since there are no forms given by Rudolf Steiner for most Faust scenes, we have to find them first - based on the laws of eurythmy. By the way, many young eurythmists expressed the hope that they would be able to deepen eu-rythmy on the basis of Rudolf Steiner's indi- cations with regard to Faust. Experiences in the ensemble J\u00fcngel: Eurythmy needs a permanent en - semble, acting does not. Peter: Not having a permanent ensemble in itself creates a logistical problem, be-cause the actors will need other ways of earning their livelihood, in addition to their work on Faust. This means that time sched-ules need to be adapted, which can lead to difficulties with rehearsal times. We need to find ways of achieving quality without a permanent ensemble and of generating a skin or membrane nonetheless. Solstad: In Norway I used to have an en - semble whose members met twice a week. That was possible. But for a major project such as Faust one needs an estab - lished ensemble. One needs to know each other well to move well together. Acting, on the other hand, relies more on the in - dividual... Peter: ... which is to say: no eurythmy in Faust without a permanent ensemble...Solstad: I mean something else: if a mem - ber of the ensemble is prevented from be-ing there through illness, for instance, the gap can be more easily closed if one has a permanent ensemble. Apart from that, such an ensemble offers young euryth - mists the possibility of gaining experienc- es that they will need if they later want to build up an ensemble. And last but not least, it will have been special for them to have once worked at the Goetheanum. Goetheanum Stage From the Mystery Plays to Faust Following the Mystery Plays by Rudolf Steiner the Goetheanum is planning to present a new production of Goethe's Faust. The first part of the tragedy will be performed in the summer of 2015, followed by Faust Parts I and II from Easter 2016. Artistic directors Margrethe Solstad and Christian Peter give first insights into the preparations Being aware of each other's intentions: Margrethe Solstad (right) Margrethe Solstad (eu- rythmy), Christian Peter (acting, artistic director), Roy Spahn (stage set), Ilja van der Linden (lighting), Martina Maria Sam (dra-maturgy), Rob Barendsma (costumes), Nils Frischknecht (administration). Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 | 7 Annual Report 2013/14 The annual financial statement and balance sheet reflect - in financial terms - the many individual initiatives, activities and events of the last year, as of 31 December 2013, condensed from a great number of movements into just a few figures. Apart from eco- nomic considerations, the statement is also an expression of the intentions of the people in charge and of how they approach their jobs and tasks at the Goetheanum. The consultations of the Goetheanum Leadership Group, which was formed in 2012, the meetings of the small group of treasurers and the inquiries of people wishing to support the School of Spiri- tual Science in particular have resulted in greater clarity regarding the tasks of the Anthroposophical Society and the School of Spiritual Science. This clarity should become visible even in the figures of the 2013 financial statement (in agreement with the auditors).

But for this, neither the building nor the nu- merous services offered by the individual departments at the Goetheanum would be necessary, since the activities of the Anthroposophical Society, which is repre- sented on all continents, unfold mainly in the various countries. The Goetheanum - and that includes the building, the grounds and the whole infrastructure - serves primarily the School of Spiritual Science. The School of Spiritual Science is the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society and the raison d'\u00eatre of the scientific and artistic activi- ties of the sections and the Goetheanum Stage (drama, eurythmy, music), which is connected with most other events, the conferences and the hundreds of meet - ings. All the services and departments, such as Building Administration, garden, reception, event management, IT, human resources and finance departments work towards this central task. The weekly journal Das Goetheanum and its monthly supplement \" Anthroposophy Worldwide\" are also striving to be organs of the School of Spiritual Science. Members of the General Anthropo- sophical Society join this global society in the first instance, before they become members of local or thematic groups.

Its income has gone down as a result. 3 While the expenses for staff members ha- ve remained below the 2013 budget, they have risen by five per cent compared to 2012, among other things because the Exe- cutive Council gained a new member and because operational costs had to be slight - ly raised in various places. 4 The support for retired staff members of the Goetheanum consists in contributions for elderly people whose services to the Goetheanum are not yet covered by a regu- lar pension scheme or other social security benefits. Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 | 9 Annual Report 2013/14 Annual General Meeting in 1990, each member is expected to pay a membership fee of CHF 125 per year to the Goethea-num. The amount has never changed. At present the members pay on average CHF 84. In addition, we have a regular income from the property we own in and around Dornach, which is mostly used as staff ac- commodation. On the expenses side, we have the costs of the membership office and - as we assume at present - half of the costs of the Executive Council and its secretaries' offices (the other half serves the School of Spiritual Science). The account shows that, in 2013, the worldwide membership provided CHF 3.93 million in fees and CHF 2.12 mil- lion in legacies to support the School of Spiritual Science. The total of around CHF 6 million provides the basic funding for the School of Spiritual Science which, over and above that, generates its own income and receives free and designated gifts as well as third-party funding for research. Divided according to areas, the annual statement of the School of Spiritual Sci-ence shows clearly that the 2013 budget was exceeded by CHF 4 million, luckily on the income as well as expenditure sides (expenses for the building: CHF 2.8 mil- lion). As a result of third-party funding, individual sections have also been able to take on additional tasks during the year. Profit and loss account 2013 In the usual profit and loss account the expenses for the General Anthroposophi- cal Society and the School of Spiritual Science are split into different categories and differentiated into ordinary (statu- tory activity) and extraordinary budgets (property management for staff hous-ing, reserves, legacies and donations for the building and renovation project). The notes refer to the corresponding explana-tions in the text. The ordinary budget closes with a def - icit that is clearly higher than last year. This is not due to the expenses, which were kept strictly to budget by the people responsible for the various cost centres, but to the fact that the income had been estimated too optimistically. If one con - siders the generous amounts we received in donations for the building and renova- tion project (more than CHF 2 million), it is understandable that the envisaged amount of CHF 2 million in non-designat - ed donations could not be achieved. The membership contributions and income from events (only one summer cycle of Mystery Plays and fewer big conferences than in the previous year) also fell short of last year's result. Without the legacies from Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Great Brit - ain, which we haven't budgeted in recent years and which, at CHF 2.13 million in 2013, exceeded those of the previous year, the budget would not have been bal- anced. As it is, only modest amounts from these revenues could be allocated to the new production of Goethe's Faust (CHF 150,000), the restructuring of the terrain outside the West entrance (CHF 160,000) and Rudolf Steiner's cultural heritage (CHF 60,000) as reserves for actual forth - coming tasks. Balance 2013 Here, the most noticeable feature is the amount of cash and money in the bank which has almost doubled to CHF 8.5 million (see note 1). These are the funds accumulated for the major build- ing and renovation project, even though CHF 2 million have already been spent. In 2014, a further CHF 6 million will be spent on the stage upgrading, which will need to be completed by the end of Sep - tember 2014 and paid for soon after. The roof work, and possibly the repairs to the concrete, in the South and West, should be completed by the end of 2014. The question is whether we will manage to collect the CHF 2.5 million in donations and Goetheanum Construction Notes that we will need for the repairs at the northern side of the building and the ter - race scheduled for 2015 (CHF 11 million General Anthroposophical Society Balance as of 31 December 2013 compared with 2012 31.12.13 31.12.12 ASSETS all amounts in CHF Footnote Current assets 1 4'456'637 1'514'761 1'076'564 Financial assets 5'437'848 loans Main Auditoriumcash, banks debtors and clearing accounts Loans, securities and investments Goetheanum buildings, grounds, inventory Main Auditoriumstarted renovation work Goetheanum staff housing, real estate T OTAL ASSETS creditors and other debts Gifts with right of withdrawal Loans to the Goetheanum Free Equity 31.12.2013 / 31.12.2012 TOTAL LIABILITIESConstruction Notes + loans Goetheanum renovation Loans staff housing Diverse reserves sections and departments Reserves Goetheanum renovation Free equity 1.1.2013 / 1.1.2012 Result 2013/201210 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 Annual Report 2013/14 were raised by February 2014!). An interest-paying loan to Weleda of CHF 1 million was paid back as agreed in 2013 (note 2). The balance also shows the remaining CHF 1.8 million for the refur - bishment of the Main Auditorium that was funded with older Goetheanum Con - struction Notes (from the late 1990s). The capitalization of those building costs will be reduced in accordance with the level of the Construction Notes (note 3). The work that has been started (note 4) and the re-serves put aside for the present building and renovation project (note 5) reflect the present building activities. Funding of building work This issue of Anthroposophy World- wide comes with a supplement (BauZei- tung No 3), which contains reports about the progress of the stage renovation and about the beginning of repairs to the roof and concrete in the south and west of the building. At present the work is going to schedule and we can therefore hope that the stage will open as planned on 26 Sep - tember 2014. Regarding the funding of the build- ing work, which is expected to cost CHF 13.5 million - this amount has been bud-geted - CHF 11 million have been either received or pledged for 2014. At this point in time (March 2014) just over two million Swiss Francs are still outstanding: Donations received CHF 7.1 million Restructuring of assets CHF 1.3 million Monuments Office CHF 0.4 million Interest-free loans CHF 1.1 million Construction Notes CHF 0.3 million Subtotal CHF 10.2 million Promised donations and grants for 2014 CHF 1.1 million Funded so far CHF 11.3 million Outstanding 2014/2015 CHF 2.2 million We are pleased that two major Swiss cultural foundations are interested in the refurbishment of the Goetheanum's ex - terior. With a joint effort of many mem - bers and the one or other Construction Note or interest-free loan it should be possible to muster the remaining funds for this large-scale project. Looking back at the decision taken in the summer of 2012 and the enormous uncertainty as to how the sum of CHF 13.5 million could ever be raised, what we have achieved so far seems like a miracle. The use of assets for renovation Last year, the Anthroposophical Society in Germany decided to support the major renovation project at the Goetheanum with a total of one million Euro (circa CHF 1.23 million) from their own assets (from legacies). This came with the request, however, that the Goetheanum should also use means from its own real estate for this extraordinary maintenance in - vestment. In principle, the Goetheanum does not sell land it owns in and around Dornach and respects, wherever possible, the will of the decedents. But this real es-tate was ultimately given to the Goethea- num for its maintenance and it is almost exclusively used as staff housing. Seeing that the Goetheanum pays compara- tively low salaries, it makes sense that it charges rents that are affordable for staff members. In this respect, the conveyance of House Julian to the Edith-Maryon-Foun - dation constituted a special opportunity for the Goetheanum. This Basel Founda- tion, which has plenty of experience with properties and supports forms of social housing, holds the land on which House Julian was built under a lease. The house, which was originally built with donations and own capital for the youth and used over the years as student accommoda-tion, could therefore be passed on with the same proviso and transformed into equity for the renovation of the Goethea-num (the Youth Section has gained a room on the ground floor of the Goetheanum). The house price, which was estimated by a surveyor, adds more than CHF 0.7 million to the balance in reserves for the building project as well as a further CHF 0.5 million in liquidity. It might be neces- sary to sell another house under similarly favourable conditions to a not-for-profit organization to support the Goetheanum renovation. Joining forces to preserve Rudolf Stein - er's cultural heritage Following several years of preparatory discussions the Anthroposophical Societ - ies in Switzerland and Germany and the Nachlassverein have joined forces and established a fund in support of Rudolf Steiner's cultural heritage that will guar - antee the basic funding of the Goethea-num's Documentation Department (owned by the General Anthroposophical Society) and the Rudolf Steiner Archives (owned by the Nachlassverwaltung). The two archives need around CHF 765,000 per year, of which around CHF 454,000 were funded in 2013. The Fund for Ru-dolf Steiner's Cultural Heritage was able to raise another CHF 231,000. While this does not cover the basic requirements, it is an important step in the right direction. The Anthroposophical Society in Ger - many contributes 50,000 Euro each year for three years; in Switzerland the branch - es have declared their willingness to take on CHF 30,000; and the Goetheanum and the Nachlassverein contributed CHF 30,000. In addition to that, the Goethea- num passes on donations collected by the F\u00f6rderstiftung Anthroposophie (founda- tion in support of anthroposophy) in Ger - many to the Rudolf Steiner Archives. A thank you to all sponsors and sup - porters I would like to thank all sponsors and supporters very warmly. One cannot always see from the donations where they come from and under what circum - stances they were made, or the sacrifices involved in making them available to the Goetheanum. But in many encounters and conversations one gets a sense that they all come from the heart. The fact that the interest in and demand for what is happening at the Goetheanum is clearly on the rise is not only apparent in the do- nations we have received. I do hope that you will hear about the building activities and the progress di-rectly during the Annual General Meet - ing or at other occasions when you visit the Goetheanum (there are guided tours of the building site every Saturday - booking essential!) and I look forward to experiencing with you the completion of the first building stage, when the Main Auditorium reopens on 26 September 2014 with the first artistic performances. | Justus Wittich, treasurer Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 1/14 | 11 Anthroposophy Worldwide And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\" These words from John, 8:31-32 were said to human beings more than 2000 years ago. As long as these words are not understood, the con - cept of freedom will be limited by the wish to become free and permeated by the many emo-tions which are aroused in the human soul by this magic and sweet word \"freedom\". People struggle and fight for freedom against other people, seeing each other as obstacles on the way to freedom, but as long as this struggling goes on, no one will become free. One remarkable attempt at connecting the concept of freedom with cognition again was made 120 years ago, when Rudolf Steiner's Philosophy of Freedom was first published. With this book, humanity was given a scientifically based method for experiencing freedom through knowledge. Looking at the world today, one realizes that this method has not been understood and accepted. But it is particularly relevant because it points to the connection between free- dom and morality. We are not free as long as we fight each other in trying to establish our right to be free. We are only free when we realize ourselves, as free spir - its, in moral activity. Of course, one starts this individually by developing moral imagination and moral technique, but we need each other on this way because these qualities gain real value only when they are put into practice in social life. In the year when we celebrate the 120th anniversary of the publication of the Philoso- phy of Freedom, we invite all friends to join us in the inter - national conference \"Freedom as the way to keep the human identity\", so we can unite our forces for finding the truth about the essence of freedom as a concept, as a living experi- ence and as a true expression of our humanity. Our joint work is especially important in difficult political situations as we see them now in Eastern Europe, where people look at each other again with fear and mistrust. We hope that all who know that spiritual science has real power to change the world, when it works through human beings united by their love for the truth, can come to Rostov-on-Don from 26 to 30 June 2014 and work together in order to begin to create a new reality based on anthro-posophical insight. Unfortu- nately, one of our lecturers, Sergei Prokofieff, will not be able to join us due to his ill- ness. | Tatiana Pavlova, Ros- tov-on-Don (RU)Russia: On the 120th anniversary of the Philosophy of Freedom Creating a new reality On the occasion of the 120th anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's Philosophy of Freedom, Tatiana Pavlova renews her invitation to the international conference \"Freedom as the way to keep the human identity.\" (Anthroposophy Worldwide 10/2013, p. 7)Addendum to the Annual General Meeting Concern Protecting Rudolf Steiner and his work Heidrun Scholze, Unterf\u00f6hring (DE), submitted the following motion for the Annual General Meeting of the General Anthro- posophical Society: Our motion to the annual general meeting should be discussed with the follow - ing aim: The General Anthro-posophical Society should cease to support the Rudolf Steiner Estate Management Association (Nachlassverein), the Rudolf Steiner Archives and the Rudolf Steiner Verlag, as long as the Rudolf Steiner Verlag collaborates with Chris- tian Clement or frommann- holzboog publishing. The dis-sociation must be announced in the Newsletter. We are con - cerned with the protection of Rudolf Steiner and his work. His work ought to be pub - lished without adulteration; he must not be separated from his work. | Heidrun Mathilde Scholze, Hansjochim von Wick, Anton Dembinsky, Erika Kaiser, Manfred Klein Clarification: A first motion submitted by these members regarding the Critical Edition of writings by Rudolf Steiner in cooperation with frommann- holzboog publishing and the Rudolf Steiner Verlag could not be accepted for the An - nual General Meeting because the decision would affect third parties (Anthroposophy Worldwide 3/2014, p. 8). After the deadline for submitting motions - 15 February 2014 (eight weeks prior to the AGM) - I received an email on 19 Feb - ruary (11.53 p.m.) with a new motion concerning the Critical Edition that was also sent, on 21 February, to all members of the Executive Council. This motion could not be consid-ered because it arrived after the deadline. Yet, both motions were from the beginning clearly driven by a concern that, according to our statute, should be dis-cussed in open conversation at the Annual General Meet - ing: the question is whether the cooperation of the Rudolf Steiner Verlag in distributing the Critical Edition published by frommann-holzboog serves to protect Rudolf Steiner or whether it does the opposite. For the sake of completeness we will publish the text of the motion that arrived too late in this place. | Justus Wittich, Ex - ecutive Council at the Goethea- num Motion submit - ted too late Firstly: The Annual General Meeting should decide that the distribution of Christian Clement's \"Rudolf Steiner's Writings - Critical Edition 5 (SKA 5)\" in the Goetheanum Bookshop ceases with imme-diate effect. Secondly: The Annual General Meeting should decide that the General Anthroposophi-cal Society will not support, above all financially, the Rudolf Steiner Nachlassverein, the Rudolf Steiner Archives and the Rudolf Steiner Verlag as long as the latter collaborates with Christian Clement and frommann-holzboog publish - ing. This dissociation is to be announced in the members' Scholze, Hansjochim Manfred Klein Anthroposophical Society Tatiana Pavlova is a board member of \"Luch Solntsa\", a Rostov City public organiza-tion that promotes Waldorf education and anthroposophic medicine.

It is therefore all the more important to have this historical survey that is devoted cul- turally so significant a movement. In ad-dition, this book with the title Geschichte der anthroposophischen Heilp\u00e4dagogik und Sozialtherapie [History of anthro-posophical curative and social therapy] closes two gaps: In the special- ist publications on special needs educa-tion which have been published since the 1980s, anthroposophical curative education and social therapy is only men - tioned marginally, while the interest of the public in this approach continues to grow. Secondly, within the anthroposoph - ical movement there is a noticeable and growing interest in its own origins, since these origins have to do with the move-ment's self-image, its particular character and its connection with other approaches within special needs' education. Companions Almost a hundred years of curative ed- ucation and social therapy out of anthro- posophy: a sign of continuity and sustain - ability in the daily work with people whose physical foundation is so incomplete - if compared to what is considered usual - that they are in need of the lifelong sup - port and help of attentive companions: companions who see this life as worth liv - ing and who devote their own lives wholly or temporarily to people with special needs. What characterizes the anthropo- sophical approach is the view that the in - dividual's spiritual entity is not affected; it is only prevented, due to physical deficien - cies, to enter earthly existence as deeply as it could do if these deficiencies were not there. People with disabilities only touch on the earth, one might say. Respect, gratitude and critical appreciation With respect and gratitude, the authors, Volker Frielingsdorf, R\u00fcdiger Grimm and Brigitte Kaldenberg, look at what has been achieved by earlier generations, whose commitment and courage can be inspir - ing for one's own life and actions. At the same time they are not afraid to critically assess former traditions, for instance, in their appraisal of the generational change in the decades following World War I, from a more self-sacrificial attitude to a sense of entitlement among the carers; or when they look at occasions such as the breakup between Karl K\u00f6nig and the curative com - munity on the Silesian castle Pilgramshain in 1936, a conflict that ultimately led to the founding of Camphill, which is highlighted as a special 'stream' of anthroposophical community building. The study focuses on the years between 1920 to 1980 and differentiates five de-velopmental phases during that period: the founding and pioneering years from the opening of a remedial class at the first Waldorf school in Stuttgart (1920) through the \"Sonnenhof\" in Arlesheim (1923), the Lauenstein in Jena (1924) to \"Curative Education Course\" Rudolf Steiner gave in June/July 1924; the rise of the Nazis; the destiny of people threatened by this totali- tarian regime; the phase of growth and dif - ferentiation leading up to the 1960s; and the years of inner and outer consolidation in the 1960s and 1970s. We learn about the now approximately 700 centres of Anthro-posophic Curative Education and Social Therapy in 50 countries worldwide and the 50 training centres. The book also looks at the various socio-political contexts across the time and at other approaches to special needs education. The movement's close ties with the chequered events within the Anthroposophical Society are also includ- ed: for instance, Ita Wegman's exclusion from the Executive Council in Dornach or Karl K\u00f6nig's exclusion from the Anthropo- sophical Society in 1935. The consequenc-es that the latter event had for the curative education movement are dealt with in a factual and adequate manner. A reference work In describing the everyday life in the centres, their guiding principles and methods and the therapies they offer, the authors bring to life the destinies of in - dividuals and communities, of carers and of those cared for. It is these people who made and still make progress possible. The many illustrations in the book further enhance the impressions conveyed by the lively descriptions. An appendix that includes indices, a list of centres and associations of Anthro-posophical Curative Education and the addresses of anthroposophical initiatives for Curative Education and Social Therapy make this publication a useful reference work. | Uwe Werner, Dornach (CH)Medical Section: Study on the history of Curative Education and Social Therapy Personal destinies The history of anthroposophical curative education and social therapy, composed by the historian Volker Frielingsdorf, the secretary of the Curative Education and Social Therapy Council of the Medical Section at the Goetheanum (since 1995), R\u00fcdiger Grimm, and his research assistant, Brigitte Kaldenberg, proves to be a well-document - Athena Verlag, Dornach and Oberhausen 2013, 570 pages. Individuals and communities, times and destinies (pictured: extract from book cover) Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 | 13 \u00f3 Anthroposophy Worldwide As educators we seek to meet the unique development of each child. The class teacher does this through the rich curriculum which supports each develop - mental phase as well as developing a rich social and emotional environment. How - ever, there are children in each class whose developmental needs cannot be fully sup - ported in this way. At Little Yarra we offer eurythmy therapy and have developed a specialized program called the Tobias Class to meet the needs of these children. In the first years of life the development of the child is focused on the further shaping of the bodily organs. In a way the invisible forc- es work like an architect whose insight and imagination manifests itself through the building of the material form. The comple- tion of this first phase becomes visible when, at the age of 7, there is a change of the teeth. This is a sign that the forces that hitherto were being used to form the physical being are released to take on a different task and the child becomes eager to learn. The child is nourished by and learns through the vivid images given by the teacher. At the age of 9 the child begins to perceive the world differ - ently. The child begins to feel the difference between the outer world and him or herself. Another way of perception and discrimina- tion of the different elements of the world becomes evident. This process is often ac- companied with a feeling of loneliness and isolation as for the first time children con - front their own mortality. It is a time when the inner being of the child comes into its own. At 12 the inner essence, the first emer - gence of which began at 9, begins develop - ing and growing to the point where it can flower and become manifest. At this point the child is sensitive and vulnerable and the child's being reaches into the social element. Social interaction becomes essential in sup - porting this process The child's development does not al- ways follow this archetypal picture. There are children in each class whose develop - mental needs cannot be fully supported in this way. They are the children whose phys-ical, emotional or spiritual development does not keep pace with that of their peers. They learn differently to the classical model and need individual attention beyond that which is possible in the classroom situa- tion. When this happens at just the right point in time the child continues to develop in a healthy way. At LYSS we offer two ways of supporting children, namely the Tobias Class and Therapeutic Eurythmy. The Tobias Class The Tobias class is a multi-age class of approximately 6 children. The children join the class for varying reasons ranging from specific learning difficulties to sensory overload in a busy classroom. The focus of the class is to engage the children in various hands-on activities as well as more formal studies. It suits kinesthetic learners who are able to participate in small building projects, caring for farm animals, garden - ing or cooking on a regular basis. All these activities have a therapeutic aspect. This al- lows the children to experience a learning environment, which is not stressful. They begin to develop confidence and more re- silience as their progress is supported. The children attend the Tobias class for their main lesson and most other lessons until lunch time. They return to their class for their morning tea and play times as well as those activities which are socially inclusive such as orchestra, singing, Eurythmy and craft. In this way the children are still part of the social milieu of the class, but also have a small and socially inclusive group where they feel comfortable. During the week the children also have a session of Therapeutic Eurythmy. This model of learning is established in Germany, England, New Zealand and other countries. The main difference between the schools in these countries and the Tobias class at Little Yarra is that they are usually separate from the main school streams. The Tobias class is straddling the gap between curative and main stream education - an educational model which is inclusive and where individual needs can be met. Therapeutic Eurythmy In the physical body many processes take place that are, in the first instance invisible; one becomes aware of it when an illness occurs. Those forces that build up and maintain the physical body are used for expression in eurythmy through the movement of the arms and the legs. Eurythmy is like the process of activation in the larynx before a sound is made. The forces behind the speech become visible in eurythmic movement. In therapeutic or individual eurythmy where the gestures are made closer to the physical body to harmonize where a dishar - mony exists in the child's being. When these gestures are repeated, it activates the har - monizing element in the child's being. This then gives the child an opportunity to move forward in development more ably by him/ herself, without continued support. As the child moves through the stages of development, there is always a possibil-ity of retardation or congestion. At such moments therapeutic eurythmy can help so the child can move forward in their de- velopment more easily. We see it as ben - eficial to offer therapeutic eurythmy at LYSS to each child from Preps to class 2 in the form of a series of individual sessions. There is always a possibility to work more intensively or longer with particular chil- dren when the need arises, through the whole school development. These two approaches to supporting the child's development in the primary school have proven to be successful.

By way of an ex - ample, I chose a topic that has interested me for some time, albeit from another point of view - that of the history of the Theosophical Society. The question is in regard to a be- ing called Serapis that was seen as a god in the Egyptian world, which relates to a very comprehensive tradition (cf., for instance, Hans Bonnet, Re- allexikon der \u00e4gyptischen Reli- gionsgeschichte, Berlin 1952, p. 649f.). In my tribute I wrote, \"Some theosophical sources, however, refer to Serapis as Master [...] [followed by ex - amples from Alfred Percy Sin - nett and Henry Steel Olcott, who claimed to have received letters from Master Serapis]. How would theosophists re-late to the statement that Rudolf Steiner was Master [In the Serapis?\"] Rob Stein - buch overlooks the fact that I used the subjunctive (\"sei\"), a grammatical form that is used to express a possibility or sug- gestion rather than a fact. My comments arose from the fact that Judith von Halle even associates Rudolf Stein - er with the name Serapis. To quote from her book Rudolf Steiner, Meister der Wei\u00dfen Loge. Zur okkulten Biographie: \"The seventh in his true being and full human dig- nity, that is, in accordance with his special mission - has really only appeared once. Since this appearance was only just a hundred years ago, his indi-viduality could not yet be giv - en the name of an incarnation [...]. We must remember that around 'a hundred years' must 'have passed' before the bear - er of inspiration can be named exoterically. This is why one has, so far, used a particularly abstract-sounding 'substitute' for the individuality of the sev - enth Master, namely 'Serapis'\" (p. 134f.). Two pages further down von Halle writes, \"This seventh Master of the White Lodge can be found by occult research - and I [Judith von Halle] consider taking the re- sponsibility for this statement before the spiritual world in due course - in the person of Rudolf Steiner.\" This may serve as a short answer, in the context of the history of Theosophy. I con - cluded therefore that \"[...]I find it inappropriate to speculate on Rudolf Steiner's identity in any case, let alone in this con - text.\"| Virginia Sease Thoughts on the Critical Stein - er Edition (SKA) published by frommann-holzboog The first 'critical edition' of Rudolf Steiner's works is being published since 2013, starting with volume 5 which includes \"Mystics after Mod- ernism\" (CW 7) and \"Christian - ity as Mystical Fact\" (CW 8). A number of positive and nega- tive voices have been raised in the anthroposophical world on this \"Critical Steiner Edition\", edited by Christian Clement. My hope is that they may con - tribute to the relationship of anthroposophy and the public. Between closeness and dis- tance A 'critical edition' is not critical of the author; it is more about reliability and in - sight into the textual develop - ment across various editions and publications. It also looks critically at the editor, to see whether he has provided an objective basis for study, as free as possible from his own views. In his introduction, Chris- tian Clement writes that \"an - throposophy is a child of mys- ticism and idealism, whether legitimate or illegitimate is a matter not to be decided here.\" I have the impression that, with the second part of this statement, Clement tries to make clear that his tangi- ble commitment to Steiner's thinking does not jeopardize his objectivity as editor: a cus- tomary gesture of displaying distance. This alternation be- tween closeness and the kind of distance that needs to be demonstrated appears again and again in this introduc- tion, which is nonetheless an important achievement, also in anthroposophical terms. To give but one example: Clem - ent makes it clear that the \"change\" from exoteric indi- vidualist to esoteric theoso-phist that Steiner's critics and opponents claim to have ob - served in him around the year 1900, did not actually happen. Clement explains in detail that the esoteric aspect was there much earlier - at least in dis- position. The edition's professional achievement as well as its im - portance for the work of many researchers and students can - not be emphasized enough. I would like to look at points in the edition's introduction and preface that people who are close to anthroposophy may see as problematic. The issue just mentioned, for instance, is dealt with in an unfortu- nate way in Alois Maria Haas' preface. The reason for this is primarily a - to me incom - prehensible - lack of in-depth consideration of the - discon - certing? - matter itself. Haas finds proof, for instance, for the alleged change in Steiner in the fact that for him, in Mystics after Modernism, \"the mystical knowledge [...] was a real process within the events of the world.\" Failing to see what is there How can one fail to see that for Steiner any knowledge had always been just that - even in his earliest writings? And that in Mystics after Modernism this is also said of the contem - porary knowledge of scien - tists? They just don't know it. For around two decades Stein - er had tried to make it clear to them. Steiner pointed out that, if the old mystics were to come back to study Darwin and Haeckel, they would see this immediately. \"Meister Eckhart as well as Tauler, Jakob B\u00f6hme as well as Angelus Silesius, would feel the deepest satis- faction if they looked at today's natural science. The spirit they bring to their way of looking at the world has fully moved into the way nature is observed to- day.[...].\" (CW 7, Epilogue). The old mystics would see that, within the scientific thinking of modern times, \"a cleansed, self-reliant human spirituality has emerged as [unconscious] experience. (CW 26, \"The con - dition of the human soul be- fore the dawn of the Michaelic age.\") In his entire early work Steiner tried to awaken aware-ness of this experience in his readers. These are aspects that are fundamental to the ques-tion of anthroposophy as a sci-Virginia Sease is a member of the Executive Council at the Goetheanum. Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 1/14 | 15 \u00f3 Forum ence. The preface, which is otherwise very readable, is blind to these aspects. In Christian Clement's intro-duction, on the other hand, this matter as well as the unity of Steiner's thinking, including even his Leading Thoughts, is made unmis- takably clear. Without spite \"Rudolf Steiner has arrived in the academic world, the place he was drawn to all his life, albeit without success.\" Hartmut Traub wrote this in Philoso- phie und Anthroposophie (p. 25). He says this without spite, I think, maybe with a hint of irony, and with the Critical Edition it becomes reality. It should not dis- concert anyone that there are aspects to some of Steiner's works that hardly interest the studying an - throposophist, of which Steiner himself was, how - ever, fully aware. \"Please don't see my 'Christianity' as more than it is meant to be. I know its shortcom - ings all too well, especially the historical ones. The at - tribute 'as mystical fact' needs to be taken serious- ly.\" (CW 39, letter to Wolf - gang Kirchbach of 2 Octo- ber 1902). Those who are prepared to follow this advice can find reliable and compre- hensive help for their work in Christian Clement's in - troduction and commen - tary. The Critical Steiner Edi- tion will show that in Stein - er one meets a thinking to which one cannot simply apply a hermeneutics of insinuation (popular alle- gations as a 'means of in - terpretation'). Just as little, however, will we do justice to Steiner by employing a hermeneutics of venera-tion (passive, reverent re- ception). Much in the 'outside' reception: high-level sci- entific works and admired practices are being rec-ognized - but there is the question as to where the Anthroposophical Society as such locates itself. \"From the beginning, this anthro- posophical movement was fully equal to any scientific requirements.\" But this \"has not been taken seri-ously enough, not even by its members.\" (CW 203, lecture of 8 February 1921; also GA 28, chapter 32). Being public through con - versation This scientific quality it is not about academic forms or intellectual skills; it is about taking respon - sibility for one's thinking and feeling, and about the beginnings (and pos-sibly more) of the inner awakening in thinking and feeling. Can the Anthropo-sophical Society, can the groups within the Society and movement make the inner effort to accompany or carry the Critical Steiner Edition? Rudolf Steiner wanted to enter into conversation - today we would say 'dis-course' - with other spiri- tual forces and streams, even if some differences cannot be overcome imme- diately. Today, we can only \"be as public as possible\" if there is conversation. And if it is, or becomes, genuine conversation, then it will be able to \"convey the most profound esotericism.\" The Critical Steiner Edition can be (made) an important companion on this journey. | Helmut Goldmann, Vienna (AT)Margaret B\u00e4umer Witten (DE) 23 February 2012 Elsa Norlander Malm\u00f6 (SE) 18 April 2012 Inger Siem Oslo (NO) in July 2012 Erkki Flander J\u00e4rna (SE) 1 December 2012 Helge Hedetoft Vikedal (NO) 15 December 2012 30 April 2013 Bodil Vincentz Skanderborg (DK) 21 May 2013 Franca Gatti Milano (IT) 22 May 2013 Rosemarie Braun L\u00fcbeck (DE) 13 June 2013 Niek Wit Chatsworth (CA) 21 June 2013 Ragnhild Norb\u00e4ck Tomelilla (SE) 31 July 2013 Ole Striim H\u00f8jbjerg (DK) 30 August 2013 Ulf Tunius Partille (SE) 6 September 2013 Wolfgang Greifenstein Happurg (DE) 10 September 2013 Luciano Balduino Torino (IT) 14 September 2013 Ib 18.

The Membership Office at the Goetheanum\u00f3 Anthroposophical Society16 | Anthroposophy Worldwide No. 4/14 \u00f3 Feature Ignoring the warning of the fire fight - ers, I went into the room, as if urged by an inner voice. The walls were still giving off heat, like a stove, and hot steam filled in the air. On the heap of ruins that con - sisted mostly of books I made out copies with pages that were not burned; only their covers were pitch-black. The book that survived the fire Opening the book, I see its title: 'Das Wort im Bau' [The word in the building] by Roman Boos. On page 1 I read, \"Fatal fire consumes the 'House of the Word' in the New Year's night of 1922/1923\". And further down, \"Through these heavy shadows of human inadequacy, the gates had to open so that the House of the Word could be pervaded by the adversary spirit of all human striving that lurks wherever a fissure opens between human willing and doing - to interfere as soon as the soul be- comes tired as a result of this fissure: the spirit of darkness, of heaviness, of contra- diction, of resistance that we meet as Ah - riman in the visual and performing arts: in sculpture, in painting, in the carved win - dows and the mystery plays.\" Of course, we cannot compare this in the slightest with 'our' fire, but nevertheless ... A sign? From whom? In front of the window, from where the fire spread, someone discov - ered a damp Michael poster, attached to one of the wooden columns. Thanks to an anonymous donation we were in the process of extending the building to create spaces for the many working groups. Building work had start - ed on 15 January. Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler had donated the takings for two of her lec-tures to the building. We hope for more gifts so that our building will once look the way it is portrayed in the model, so that the word can find at least a soft reso- nance in our building, too. | Horacio M\u00fcl- ler, Capital Federal (AR) Fire caused by faulty wiring Fire investigators and insurance ex - perts established that the fire was caused by faulty electric wiring. Luckily the fire brigade came promptly and could prevent the fire from spreading to the neighbour - ing fashion boutique. They could, howev - er, not prevent that all the German books and the new computer equipment were destroyed by the flames. | R\u00fcdiger Heuer, Buenos Aires (AR)Pioneering Argentina Anthroposophical work started in Ar - gentina in the 1940s and 50s. In 1963, the first Anthroposophical Society of South America was founded here. For a long time it remained without a home, but thanks to the generosity of the members, a house could be bought in 1981, in N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a dis-trict of Buenos Aires, the country's capital. In this house the Society's activities took place: study groups, artistic work, teacher training, lectures: everything connected with the life of the Society. Around three years ago, following the fifth Pan-American Congress for Anthro-posophy, the Society received a consid- erable sum of money as a gift. Since the space available proved less and less ad- equate to accommodate all the diverse events, an impulse to extend the building awakened in the hearts of several mem - bers one year later. The 'big' auditorium, which only seats 70 people, is too small to do eurythmy in a group. The idea of an ex - tension first led to the founding of an \"Ex - tension Committee\", followed by a call for tenders. Of the three proposals submitted, we chose the one that was best suited to our needs and most in harmony with the organic structures of the surroundings. In mid-January 2014 the first columns were raised (the best option for us was to extend upwards). Our enthusiasm grew alongside the building work. But the spiritual world had a surprise in store: On 21 February a part of the building was destroyed by fire. The library and office were most affected; the first parts of the extension less. The fire caused great concern among the members: why did this happen at this time, just as the newly kindled enthusi- asm seemed to point to a new era for the Anthroposophical Society in Argentina? A few hours after the fire we met, also with the people in charge of the building work: we will go ahead with the exten - sion and our enthusiasm is unabated. We now need positive thoughts and contri- butions from friends worldwide, because our situation has become more difficult and turned into a real challenge.| On behalf of the Extension Committee: Elsa Cornide (AR)Argentina: House of the Anthroposophical Society Damaged in fire A donation received three years ago made it possible to build an extension to the House of the Anthroposophical Society in Argentina. Five weeks after building work started - early on 21 February - a fire broke out on the building site. Thanks to the speedy arrival of the fire brigade 'only' a third of the building was affected by the fire.
