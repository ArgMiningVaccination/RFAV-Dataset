It has been at the root of philosophical, medical, and therapeutic discussions for ages. With the advent of modern medicine and pharmacology, mind-body medicine had been downplayed in the Western world until recently, when researchers and practitioners started to see the benefits of combining approaches. MBM emphasizes that one's life experiences, beliefs, attitudes, mental and emotional dimensions, personality, character, and psychosocial and transpersonal aspects are just as important as one's medical measures, molecules and genes. MBM directs special attention to patients' subjective experiences: thoughts, feelings, sensations, beliefs, memories, images, and coping resources. MBM's assessments look for underlying mind-body factors that may contribute to the disease process and can hinder the healing process, such as adverse stressful life events, unconscious roles, difficult emotions, habitual protective mechanisms, false beliefs, or lack of meaning and purpose in life. Purpose of Mind-Body Medicine The purpose of MBM is to tap the mental, emotional, behavioral, psychosocial, and spiritual dimensions of an individual, in order to restore and enhance one's health, awareness, and wholeness. Dr. Harris looks beneath the surface of symptoms and discovers the fundamental causes for the patient's conditions by merging modern medical technology and traditional medicine.
