Prince Siddhartha became overwhelmed and filled with pity over the suffering that all living creatures experience. Here, we see the moment after he leaves the ceremony and meditates under a wood apple (jambu) tree entering into a trance of ecstasy. The sculptor captures Prince Siddhartha's expanding chest and receding stomach in the moment of breath. Take a moment to focus on your breath. Many of us are juggling multiple responsibilities, and it can feel overwhelming at times. Alternate nostril breathing or Nadi Shodhana (Sanskrit for \"clearing the channels of circulation\") is a breathing technique that restores balance and ease in the mind and body. - Sit comfortably, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. - Rest your left hand on your lap and gently lift your right hand to your nose placing your right thumb on your right nostril. - Close your right nostril with your right thumb and inhale slowly and deeply through your left nostril. - Close your left nostril with your right ring finger, release your right thumb and exhale through your right nostril. - Inhale through your right nostril keeping your left nostril closed and switch by closing your right nostril and exhaling through your left nostril. - Inhale through your left nostril, close and switch by closing left nostril and exhaling through your right nostril. - Repeat 3 or more times. - Our breath is our sanctuary. Whenever we feel stressed or overwhelmed, we can always find refuge in our breath "}
