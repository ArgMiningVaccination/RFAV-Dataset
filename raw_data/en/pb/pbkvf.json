The future of mental health care is moving more and more towards an incorporation of brain-based. The idea of brain wave activity as a live picture of the balance and imbalances that may be occurring, but actually where these imbalances lie, allowing us to truly target areas of remedy. As stated, our brain is an organ of frequency, one of its main functions is in absorption of sensory information, organizing and ordering the information in the form of emotion and language and storing the information for use at different states and time. Consciousness (the awareness of experience) may then be an outcome of the brain's activity of gathering sensory information. The awareness may therefore create a mechanism to retrieve from storage or respond in present time, and share as well as provide connections with others through various structures of language i.e. imagery, sound, emotions etc. This function of awareness we refer to as our MIND. Interesting enough our mind functions and extends outside of the skull, being an invisible fabric of connection to other individuals and objects in the form of intangible connections. The harmony and frequencies that our brain experiences and which we can measure also generate the connections in our lives with others, as these our extensions of the very frequency experienced within the neocortex. Studies are showing that an imbalance or disarray of brain frequency are associated with symptoms of psychic pain, emotional blocks and social isolation. As a result, many symptoms could be depression, anxiety, learning and even behaviors of addiction. However, the harmonizing of these frequencies demonstrate profound changes in the quality of life for many individuals. At the Integrative Medical Institute we utilize a myriad of modalities to harmonize the neo cortex and the mid brain via neuropharmacology, neuro-nutritional approaches, [transcortical magnetic stimulation](https://integrative-med.org/brain-optimization/), neuro feedback and or mindfulness therapy. Is your brain in disarray? We have a myriad of modalities to treat depression, anxiety, addiction, and more. "}
