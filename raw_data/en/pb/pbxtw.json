Satvik comes from the Sanskrit word \"Sattva\" which means pure, clean and strong energy. According to Bhagavad Gita, the food that an individual eats directly influences their thoughts, character, mental well-being and health. According to Chandogya Upanishad eating a Satvik food purifies the mind, removes toxins from our body, thus cleansing both the body and mind. Bhagavad Gita is part of Mahabharat wherein Lord Krishna gives valuable advice to Pandu prince Arjuna on how to ward off your tensions and enjoy a happy life. One of the chapters in Gita is solely dedicated to how and what to eat to lead a strong and healthy life. Let us understand the meaning of \"Gunas\". Gunas in Sanskrit means qualities of nature. There are three types of Gunas 1. Sattvic- means purity, well-being, healthy and balanced mind and body, positivity and peacefulness. 2. Rajasic- means desire, passion, active and intense mind, restlessness, anger, stress. 3. Tamasic- means laziness, dullness, inertia, lethargy, slowness. Every object living or non-living component (including humans) in the universe has all these 3 Gunas. The intensity or proportions of these Gunas vary in each individual. A spiritual way of life aims to increase the Sattva Guna to gain a healthy and balanced life. 1. Satvic diet includes fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, sprouts, honey, ghee, nuts, grains, pulses, lentils, ginger, jaggery, unrefined sugar, turmeric, black pepper, dhania, fresh herbs, milk and dairy products. Satvik food keeps a person calm and boosts the immune system. Thereby they are both physically and mentally healthy. 2. Rajasic diet includes foods that are rich in taste using spices, onion, garlic, coffee, tea, sugar, deep-fried foods, instant energy-giving foods or fast foods. Rajasic food is flavourful, spicy and hot foods. This type of food gives instant energy for the time being. These foods slowly harm the digestive system and give a sense of bloating and indigestion. This reduces the energy level in our body and induces stress, dullness and anger. 3. Tamasic diet includes processed food, meat, eggs, deep-frozen food, reheated food, alcohol, stale foods, etc. This type of food makes a person lethargic, dull, unproductive, careless and incompetent.
