Iowa Department of Public Health - Contact Information Page 5 I am pleased to present the 2011 Iowa Department of Public Health Annual Report and Budget Summary. The past year has been a time of adjustment and change for me, the department, and public health in general. With these changes and adjustments come new opportunities, which I find exciting and full of potential for enhancing our efforts to promote and protect the health of all Iowans. This is the first report under my leadership as department director, and I am both pleased and motivated by the successes and challenges outlined in this summary of Iowa's public health efforts. I was able to visit dozens of county public health offices and attend many county Board of Health meetings during the course of 2011. I want to thank all of our public health partners for their hospitality, and moreover, for the work they do to advance the health of Iowans. One thing I have consistently seen in my travels across the state is the collaboration between public and private partners to achieve goals of improved public health. A statewide example of this collaboration is Governor Branstad's Healthiest State Initiative. This effort to make Iowa the healthiest state in the nation by 2016 (according to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index) is ambitious, but possible. I commend all our partners and individual Iowans who participated in the Start Somewhere Walk in October. This walk was literally the 'first step' towards better health for all Iowans. I look forward to more opportunities to advance this initiative, as well as build upon the successes of IDPH's Healthy Iowans program. IDPH and its partners were actively involved in the efforts to prepare, respond and recover from the drawn-out flooding in Western Iowa. This was a challenging public health situation, as the recovery process extended for months, and in fact, still continues today. In addition to property losses and health concerns such as mold and bacteria contamination, mental health issues came to the forefront, as residents faced month s of their daily lives being disrupted by the standing water. I am proud of the work done both at the state level and by local public health to address these and other flood-related concerns. IDPH ventured further into the world of social media in 2011. A Facebook page focusing on youth addiction was launched to join IDPH's presence on Twitter. Our expansion into the social media arena will continue in 2012. A Message from the Director Page 6In 2012, IDPH will continue to work with the legislature and other state agencies as we determine the best way to create and sustain a health information network/exchange or 'eHealth.' In addition, IDPH is working in p artnership with other state agencies to assist in the interface of mental health and substance abuse issues. These types of cross-agency partnerships and projects are indicative of the collaborative nature I contend is critical to the advancement of public health. In this Annual Report and Budget Summary, you will find detailed descriptions of the programs and services that help IDPH achieve our mission of promoting and protecting the health of Iowans. I urge you to take a moment to read about the good work being done by each division, bureau and program. I believe public health's everyday contribution to the lives of Iowans is both significant and necessary to the future of our state. Sincerely, Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, B.S.N., M.Ed., M.D. Director, Iowa Department of Public Health Page 7 Vision Healthy Iowans living in healthy communities. Mission Promoting and protecting the health of Iowans. Guiding Principles We strive for INNOVATION and CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT in our activities to promote and protect the health of Iowans. With a collective sense of SOCIAL JUSTICE, our activities reflect an understanding and acceptance of DIVERSITY among Iowans. We encourage COLLABORATION in our activities and in our decision- making so that we respond more effectively to emerging issues and assure the highest QUALITY of services we can provide. We recognize the value of a healthy COMMUNITY in developing healthy Iowans. We encourage our employees, Iowa's communities, and individual Iowans to work together as PARTNERS to build a healthy Iowa. We are committed to using EVIDENCE-BASED strategies to assure our programs focus on creating RESULTS that improve the health of Iowans. What does Public Health do? Public health is a partnership of local public health, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH), non-profit organizations, health care providers, policymakers, businesses, and many others working together to promote and protect the health of Iowans. Public health strives to improve the quality of life for all Iowans by assuring access to quality population-based health services related to the following goals: Preventing injuries; Promoting healthy behaviors; Protecting against environmental hazards; Strengthening the public health infrastructure; Preventing epidemics and the spread of disease; and Preparing for, responding to, and recovering from public health emergencies. Iowa's Public Health System - Overview Page 8 How does Iowa's Public Health System meet these goals? In Iowa, local boards of health are responsible for protecting the public's health. County boards of supervisors appoint the members of the local boards of health. Iowa law gives broad authority to local boards of health to decide what public health services to provide within their jurisdictions and how to provide them. Thus, the size and structure of local public health agencies and the services they provide varies greatly throughout the state. Local boards of health work with agencies, businesses, health care providers, and others to assure public health services are being provided in their jurisdiction. The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) partners with local public health, policymakers, health care providers, business and many others to fulfill our mission of promoting and protecting the health of Iowans. IDPH's primary role is to support Iowa's 98 county boards of health, 2 city boards of health, and 1 district board of health in this mission. To do this, IDPH provides technical support, consultation, and funding. IDPH also provides a variety of direct services such as licensing health professionals; regulating emergency medical services and substance abuse treatment providers; regulating radioactive materials; and collecting birth, death, and marriage records. The State Board of Health is the policymaking body for IDPH. Iowa's governor appoints State Board of Health members and the department's director. Page 9How the Iowa Department of Public Health is Organized Iowa has had a state public health agency since 1880 when the Eighteenth General Assembly formed the State Board of Health to \"provide for the collecting of vital statistics and to assign certain duties to local boards of health.\" Since then, its duties have greatly expanded. Today's IDPH serves as the state's leader in administering and funding public health, overseeing more than 85 programs and employing more than 425 people. The State Board of Health is IDPH's legally designated policy-making body. The Board has the power and the duty to adopt, promulgate, amend, and repeal administrative rules and regulations. The Board also advises and makes recommendations to the governor, General Assembly, and the IDPH director, on public health, hygiene, and sanitation. The IDPH director works closely with the State Board of Health to develop state health policy. IDPH is organized into seven units. 1. Director's Office 2. Division of Acute Disease Prevention and Emergency Response 3. Division of Administration and Professional Licensure 4. Division of Behavioral Health 5. Division of Environmental Health 6. Division of Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention 7. Division of Tobacco Use Prevention and Control IDPH provides administrative support for 24 professional licensure boards that regulate and license various health professions. IDPH also provides staff for several consumer-oriented councils and task forces. Many Iowans serve on these various boards and commissions. They provide regular input into the department's policy development, program planning, implementation, and evaluation efforts. Contracting is done with more than 725 entities, in all 99 counties, to provide population- based health services and a limited number of personal health services. These contractors include county boards of health and boards of supervisors, community-action programs, public health nursing agencies, maternal and child-health agencies, substance abuse prevention agencies, emergency medical service providers, HIV/AIDS prevention and care providers, and many others. Page 10Total expenditures in State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2011 were $205,207,129. The following chart shows the breakdown for expenditures by funding source: \"Other Funds\" refer to fees collected and retained by individual programs or via memoranda of understanding that have been established with other state agencies, grants received from private organizations, Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure (RIFF) funds, Technology Reinvestment funds, and Underground Storage Tank funds. The following table shows SFY 2010, 2011, and 2012 expenditure information for the department as a whole. This Annual Report and Budget Summary also includes SFY 2010, 2011, and 2012 expenditure information for individual department programs and services. Table 1.

Iowa Department of Public Health - Programs and Services Page 12Access to Quality Rural Health Services s Division of Health Promotion & Chronic Disease Prevention Phone: 1-800-308-5986 www.idph.state.ia.us/hpcdp/health_care_access.asp Rural Iowa has charming towns and productive farmlands. Residents are known for their strong work ethics and mid-west rural way of life. In addition, residing in rural areas sometimes means a lack of timely access to all needed health care services. There are 82 critical access hospitals, 10 rural hospitals, 140 federally certified rural health clinics and several other medical clinics and public health offices offering health and safety services to rural residents. IDPH' s Rural Health programs have a number of projects, and work with partners to ensure strategies and initiatives so rural Iowans are better able to get quality health care, occupational safety programs and disease prevention services. Transportation services also play a role in the ability of rural residents especially the elderly, to readily see their healthc are provider. In the recent IDPH Community Health Needs Assessment and Health Improvement Plan (CHNA & HIP), access to health care was ranked as the top need by Iowa counties. Did you know? According to the 2010 Census, 40% of Iowans live in rural areas. A greater proportion of rural residents than urban residents are uninsured or covered through public sources (23% compared to 19%). Fewer rural Americans receive insurance through their employer than their urban counterparts (64% compared to 71%). A higher number of self-employed people live in rural America. Rural workers pay higher costs for health insurance plans than urban workers. Why is Access to Quality Rural Health Services important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? All Iowans need to be able to get timely emergency health care access. With the Affordable Care Act, Iowa will be adjusting to new systems of care. IDPH is assisting facilities in addressing these changes. All Iowans need to be able to get health care within a reasonable time, using primary care services in a timely fashion to prevent more serious health consequences and to reduce unnecessary emergency room visits. IDPH can effectively speak on behalf of rural health issues at the national and state levels. No other state entity provides a high level of assistance and advocacy for health care access. The Bureau of Oral and Health Delivery Systems programs maintain Iowa's commitment to become the healthiest state in the nation. What do we do? /g120 Provide funding to rural hospitals, organizations, and health systems to assist with implementing projects that will: improve the quality of healthcare, improve financial and operational performance, and develop collaborative regional and local health delivery systems. /g120 Provide technical assistance for variety of improvement activities including: project management, staffing, education, technology purchases, and community engagement initiatives. /g120 Collect and distribute information on the local, state, and national levels on rural health issues.

Coordinate Health Care Reform efforts for Health and Long Term Care and for the Direct Care Workforce. The Bureau of Oral and Health Delivery Systems' three health delivery system programs (State Office of Rural Health, FLEX - Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program, and SHIP - Small Rural Hospital Improvement Program) use federal-state partnerships to find and solve problems regarding rural health care access.

Cases had spent time in both the Mississippi River and county swimming pools. Within a matter of weeks, there were hundreds of cases of the parasitic disease, cryptosporidiosis. Resistant to chlorine, crypto thrives in water environments. Those who ingest the parasite experience profuse diarrhea, stomach cramps, and low-grade fevers. The crypto outbreak of 2007 was the largest in Iowa history with nearly 1,000 cases reported to the Center for Acute Disease Epidemiology (CADE). CADE works to keep Iowans healthy by studying the causes, determining the risks, and controlling the spread of diseases. By continually monitoring, tracking, and testing for diseases, CADE works to prevent future disease outbreaks. Did you know? The majority of food-borne illness originates from f ood eaten and prepared at home. Why is CADE important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? All Iowans are affected by disease. CADE receives an average of 20 disease reports daily (about 5,000 per year) that must be investigated. Epidemiology (the study of disease) helps track illness to determine when there is a widespread threat to your health. Disease is spread in many ways. With the help of county health agencies and providers, CADE investigated and/or referred nearly 4,000 cases of infectious disease. What do we do? Monitor and control infectious diseases. Plan and prepare for public health emergencies through training exercises. Epidemiologists work with counties to fight diseases and outbreaks. Develop and use ways to prevent and control diseases.

Data Source: CADE disease report processing system. Data are available annually. How are we doing? CADE refers disease reports to local public health agencies for follow up investigation. In addition, and as a reminder for investigations that remain open, CADE sends an \"outstanding reports\" notification to counties on a routine basis. This is one indication that local public health agencies are more aware of the importance of complete and timely disease investigation and reporting. What can Iowans do to help? 1.All Iowans can help stay well and prevent the spread of illness with good health habits: Eat healthy foods, exercise, keep your vaccinations up-to-date, and remember to wash your hands! 2. Public health officials and health care providers should be aware of infectious diseases and remember the importance of reporting those diseases to IDPH by phone at 1-800-362-2736 or fax at 515-281- 5698. 3.

Because many societal factors contribute to adolescent health, safety, and well-being, a collaborative effort engaging multiple partners and sectors is necessary. Such joint efforts can also help to promote a more comprehensive approach to addressing adolescent health - one that views adolescents as whole persons, recognizing and drawing upon their assets and not just focusing on their risks. Did you know? Adolescents and young adults are youth between the ages of 10 and 24 years old. They make up 21% of the population in Iowa. This time of life is characterized by significant change and transition (second only to the 1st year of life). It provides a great opportunity to build the capacity and strength of youth to lead healthy, productive lives. Why is the Adolescent Health program important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? As our emerging citizens, adolescents play a vital role in our community that will continue throughout their lifetime. The investment that Iowans make in the health and well-being of young people strengthens our state now and for the future. Adolescence is a period where patterns are established and lifestyle choices have both current and future implications for health and well- being. Risk factors in adolescent's lives include: unplanned pregnancy; homelessness; suicide; motor vehicle crashes, including those caused by drinking and driving; substance use and abuse; smoking; sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and lack of connections to caring and supportive adults, families, schools, and communities. Supporting young people to make positive choices - such as eating nutritiously, engaging in physical activity, and avoiding substance abuse, will decrease their risk of sustaining serious injuries or developing chronic diseases in adulthood. Iowa is committed to the welfare of its youth, as evidenced by the \"Healthy Kids Act\" which promotes nutrition standards for any food purchased on school grounds and mandates physical activity during each k-12 school day.

What can Iowans do to help? 1. Learn more about adolescent health by going to www.idph.state.ia.us/hpcdp/adolescent_health.asp. 2.Share with friends and colleagues how prevention, early intervention and timely treatment improve health status for adolescents, prepare them for healthy adulthood, and decrease the incidence of many chronic diseases in adulthood. 3. Encourage routine health care visits for adolescents to receive reccommended immunizations 4. Physicians and other health care providers can provide anticipatory gu idance during the adolescent well visit by reviewing various risk factors that teens may encounter.

Brain injuries can be the result of something as minor as a fall on the ice or as major as a head-on car crash. Brain Injury affects children a nd adults all over Iowa. Whatever the cause, to whomever the person; brain injuries can result in physical, mental, and social changes. Individuals with brain injury and their families need proper diagnosis and treatment to deal with the daily challenges they face. The Brain Injury program works to improve the lives of Iowans living with brain injuries and their families by linking people with services and by promoting safety to prevent brain injuries from happening in the first place. A life may be changed by a brain injury - but that life goes on and the Brain Injury program works to ensure that life is the best and most productive it can be. Did you know? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1.7% of people in Iowa or approximately 50,000 Iowans are currently living with long -term disabilities caused by a brain injury (CDC, 2008). Why is the Brain Injury program important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? In 2009, there were more than 21,500 emergency department visits resulting in a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Iowa; over 2,000 Iowans were hospitalized because of TBI; and more than 530 lost their lives. Brain injuries happen in a wide variety of ways. The top causes include falls, vehicle crashes, being hit by an object, and assaults. Falls, which can result in brain injury, are the leading cause of injury to elderly Iowans. Brain injury can cause changes in thinkin g, language, learning, emotions, and behavior. It can also increase the risk of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other brain disorders. TBI cases in Iowa, 200 9 What do we do? Promote and carry out brain injury prevention activities. Provide brain injury information, awareness, and learning opportunities. Work through the Brain Injury Association of Iowa to match Iowans with brain injury and their families to supports and services. Study the needs of people with brain injury and their families to better meet their needs. Make recommendations to other state departments to support a comprehensive statewide service delivery system.

But cancer statistics are more than numbers. They represent real people. The Iowa Department of Public Health's cancer programs help educate, prevent, detect, and treat cancer, one person at a time. \"Jane,\" a 60 year-old Iowan with no health insurance, was having wrist surgery when her orthopedic surgeon discovered a lump in her breast. Immediately, the orthopedic surgeon contacted her family and another surgeon was brought in for an emergency breast examination. A biopsy was performed and cancer was discovered. Thankfully, the surgeon was a Care for Yourself provider and knew that the program would cover the breast exam and biopsy. Jane's enrollment in the Iowa Department of Public Health's Care for Yourself program was completed upon leaving surgery. She is now receiving the treatment she needs to live a long life. Did you know? Cancer is the second leading cause of premature death for Iowans. Why are cancer programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Cancer affects nearly all Iowans. Many types of cancer can be prevented, or when detected early, can be successfully treated. More than half of Iowans diagnosed with cancer will survive it. What do we do? Iowa Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (ICCCP) collaborates with the Iowa Cancer Consortium and state partners to develop the state cancer control plan and put it into action. /g57The ICCCP provides financial support for many projects working to reduce the burden of cancer in Iowa. For more information please visit www.canceriowa.org or www.idph.state.ia.us/CCC/ . /g57The ICCCP funds projects that educate Iowans about ways to reduce colorectal cancer and promote screenings. /g57The ICCCP works to raise awareness of the ways to reduce skin cancer among Iowans. Information for schools, homes and worksites is available at www.sunsafeiowa.org . Iowa Care for Yourself Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program helps low- income women access breast and pelvic exams, mammograms, and Pap tests. The program reimburses health care providers for screening and diagnostic services provided to eligible women. The program also works to increase awareness across the state of the importance of early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Iowa Get Screened; Colorectal Cancer Program (IGS) works with community partners, local public heath offices, health care providers and Federally Qualified Health Centers to provide colorectal cancer screening services to Iowans at 250 percent of the federal poverty level and to: /g57Increase colorectal cancer screening rates among Iowan's ages 50 to 64; /g57Provide social marketing and public education to increase screenings and colorectal cancer detection at earlier more treatable stages to lower the mortality rate; /g57Educate health care providers about colorectal screenings; /g57Encourage policy and system changes that will increase screening rates and access to services.

Iowa's Child Health programs promote the development of local systems of health care to ensure that all Iowa children have regular, preventive health care. The Child Health programs strive to make family-centered, community-based, and culturally-sensitive health services available to all Iowa children. Did you know? Research shows that for every $1 invested in early health care and education of a young child, Iowa will see an economic return of $17 per child. Why are Child Health programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Child Health programs provide access to regular preventive health services that affect a child's physical and mental health, success in school, and health in later years. Child Health programs advocate for medical homes that provide a consistent source of comprehensive primary care and facilitate partnerships between families and providers . Child Health programs reach out to underserved populations, who are least likely to access preventive health services. Programs serve low-income children, adolescents, and minorities. Child Health programs address barriers to accessing preventive health services including health care coverage, transportation, and interpretation. Child Health programs link families to community-based services based upon family needs. What do we do? Provide funding for 22 Child Health centers that assure child health services are available in all 99 counties for children and youth ages birth to 22. In FFY 2011, 176,838 Iowa children accessed health care services through Iowa's community- based Child Health centers. Encourage community-based Child H ealth agencies to work closely with medical providers to ensure family-centered, community-based, and culturally- sensitive preventive health services are offered. Provide access to community-based health resources through the toll free Healthy Families Line, a 24-hour information and referral phone line. Assist in developing local health care systems that meet present and future health needs. Support community-based child health agencies that link clients to medical and dental providers.

Our adoption specialist at DHS suggested that we call Child Health Specialty Clinics. At CHSC, the Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner and Staff Nurse conducted a complete developmental and health assessment. Along with the Family Navigator, they made recommendations, helped with paperwork, and coordinated support services. Through CHSC, our family utilized a variety of services including dietician services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, respite, and parenting classes, all of which have contributed to the growth and development of our daughter. CHSC has helped us become more understanding about Erin's developmental disabilities and special health care needs. If I'm ever feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, I know I can call my Family Navigator, even if I don't have an appointment. We are now able to anticipate our daughter's needs and have become better equipped to deal with her behaviors at home and in public. Her overall development has progressed greatly and we hope that she continues to get the help she needs at school and in the community. *Name has been changed Did you know? About 100,000 Iowa children have some degree of a special health care need. Why is the Child Health Specialty Clinics important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Research suggests that about 15 to 20% of all children 0 to 18 years of age have some type of special health care need. Children and youth with special health care needs require services that are more intensive and comprehensive than children and youth without special care needs require. These specialty services are often not available or accessible. Research shows that specialty services are an important addition to primary care services for children and youth who have chronic illnesses or developmental delays. Federal rules require that at least 30% of each state's Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant be used to focus on children and youth with special health care needs. What do we do? Improve access to direct-care pediatric specialty services, including behavioral consultations and nutrition services through telehealth technology. Provide community-based expertise and guidance about specialty care. Offer policy and planning expertise to improve the service system for all children and youth with special health care needs and their families. Provide care coordination to help families organize needed services so that they can be used easily. Provide family support through a statewide family navigator network and partnering family advocacy groups.

No one wants to imagine the mental and physical pain an abused child must endure. Unfortunately, the pain can sometimes be prolonged by the very systems designed to protect the victims. Child Protection Centers provide a safe environment where all exams and interviews can occur in one place. It took great courage for \"Allen,\" a 16-year old boy, to reveal his stepfather had sexually abused him for years. It was extremely difficult and embarrassing for Allen to share the details of his abuse, but with the non-threatening environment of the Child Protection Center, he was able to give authorities enough details to take his case to trial, resulting in a guilty conviction and prison time for his stepfather. Child Protection Centers work to ease the pain of abuse through understanding and awareness. Did you know? In state fiscal year 2011, 3,002 children were served in one of the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) funded Child Protection Centers. Why are Child Protection Centers important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Children who are victims of alleged child abuse are often further victimized by the numerous interviews and exams. At a Child Protection Center, all investigation can occur in one place. The IDPH manages four Child Protection Centers in Iowa, including; Mercy Child Advocacy in Sioux City, Mississippi Valley Child Protection Center in Muscatine, Regional Child Protection Center in Des Moines (Blank), and St. Luke's Child Protection Center in Hiawatha. What do Child Protection Centers do? Provides a comprehensive, culturally competent, multidisciplinary team response to allegations of child abuse in a dedicated, child-friendly setting.

A passenger on that plane has measles. Because measles is a highly contagious and potentially serious disease, it is important that everyone on the plane i s notified of their exposure so they can check their immunization status. The communication of vital health information is a key responsibility of the Bureau of Communication and Planning (CAP). Within hours of a press release alerting the public of the potential measles exposure, phone calls from passengers on the plane came into IDPH. Some of those exposed were unsure of their immunization status and received follow-up testing from local public health partners. The successful collaboration between IDPH, the media, local public health agencies, and providers helped to stop the spread of measles. The CAP Bureau routinely works with other programs in IDPH to prevent threats to the health of Iowans. Did you know? By 2030, Iowa's population over the age of 65 will grow more than 50%. Not only will IDPH and local health partners deal with retiring employees, our public health workforce must evolve to meet the needs of this aging population . Why is Communication and Planning important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? CAP facilitates local, state, and department assessment and planning activities that improve the function of public health for all Iowans. Clear and accurate information helps Iowans stay healthy, live with diseases like cancer or arthritis, and be ready for and cope with public health threats or emergencies. CAP works on modernizing the public health system, quality improvement, and performance improvement. These activities contribute to increasing our ability to meet the health needs of Iowans. A highly trained and competent workforce strengthens the public health infrastructure. This infrastructure allows IDPH to prevent epidemics and the spread of disease; protect against environmental hazards; promote healthy behaviors; prevent injuries; and prepare for, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies. Reducing turnover in talented employees saves the state thousands of dollars in costs associated with rehiring and training. What do we do? Provide accurate information to the media and the public about health-related issues. Help set health goals, create plans to meet them, and then track the progress toward meeting those goals. Provide information to legislators about policies, services, legal requirements, and administrative rules.

I was aware following hospital orientation that newborn hea ring screening was done for all newborns at the hospital. Our two older children had no hearing problems, and there was no history of loss in our family, so while this service was nice, I really didn't think more about it. Julia was born quickly and with no complications. We prepared to leave the hospital with her when our nurse inform ed us Julia had failed the newborn infant hearing screening. This still didn't raise a red flag for me, as I thought many newborns must fail. After she failed her rescreen in a week, we realized there may really be a problem. We were en couraged to visit a pediatric audiologist and ENT for further testing. We learned our daughter had hearing loss in one ear, possibly two. S he was aided with a hearing aid at the age of one month and later aided with two hearing aids after it was determined she had a moderately severe loss in both ears. Julia continues to blossom. Her ability to participate in sports and dancing has not been hindered. She is a remarkable y oung girl that does very well in school with the aid of an FM system. We sometimes wonder when we would have noticed her loss if she hadn't been sc reened early. What we do know is if that happened, she could have missed out on language. Newborn hearing screening was invaluable for us. We were able to determine what was best for her and our family early on. Did you know? About 40,000 children are born in Iowa annually. Each year, an average of 1,850 are born with a congenital or inherited disorder, and approximately 200 babies are stillborn. Three of every 1,000 newborns or 120 babies in Iowa are diagnosed with a hearing loss each year and another 2 to 3 per 1,000 children will develop hearing loss after birth. Childhood hearing loss is the most common birth defect and most babies born with hearing loss are born to parents with normal hearing. The Center for Congenital and Inherited Disorders (CCID) programs serve all phases of the life cycle: prenatal, neonatal, pediatric, and adult. Why is the Center for Congenital and Inherited Disorders important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Screening programs for the early detection of inherited or congenital disorders helps assure that interventions can be provided earlier to eliminate or reduce disability and provide family support. Early detection and treatment can prevent mental retardation and even death in children born with an inherited or congenital disorder. Children born with a hearing loss who are identified early and given appropriate intervention before 6 months of age demonstrated significantly better speech and reading comprehension than children identified after 6 months of age (Yoshinaga-Itano et al., 1998). By the time a child with hearing loss graduates from high school, more than $400,000 per child can be saved in special educati on costs if the child is identified early and given appropriate educational, medical, and audiological services (White, K. R., & Maxon, A. B. (1995). What do we do? CCID provides the structure through which comprehensive genetic health care services, laboratory services, early hearing detect ion and intervention, and surveillance are developed and implemented as vital parts of Iowa's health care system. CCID assures statewide education is provided to promote health and prevent disease and develops policies and programs that assure the availability of and access to quality genetic health care, newborn screening, and laboratory services. The CCID administers eight programs: Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program - provides universal newborn hearing screening, short- term follow up, and referrals to early intervention and family support services. Regional Genetics Consultation Services - regional clinics provide statewide medical consultation and counseling to people with a diagnosed genetic disorder. Neuromuscular & Related Disorders - provides medical consultation and counseling to those with a diagnosed neuromuscular disorder, such as muscular dystrophy. Iowa Neonatal Metabolic Screening Program - conducts newborn dried blood spot testing and short and long term follow-up for metabolic disorders and cystic fibrosis. Testing is done for Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota. INMSP also provides metabolic formula and medical foods for people diagnosed with PKU and other inherited disorders of metabolism that require medically necessary foods. Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders - conducts surveillance for congenital and inherited disorders and stillbirth on children born in Iowa. Stillbirth Surveillance Program - supports stillbirth surveillance activities of the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders. Promotes stillbirths awareness initiatives. Family Health History Initiative - provides resources to explore and compile family health history to determine the risk of inheriting disease. Provides resources for lifestyle/behavior changes and screening tests based on the results of the family health history. Maternal Prenatal Screening Program - conducts prenatal testing to screen for congenital/inherited disorders of the fetus. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

A tomb from 2600 BC marks the death of Hsye-Re, known as the \"greatest to deal with teeth.\" We've come a long way since those ancient days. Today, dentistry involves not only the repair of damaged teeth, but preventive care and even appearance-related treatments, like teeth whitening. The Iowa Dental Board helps keep Iowans healthy by making sure only qualified dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants practice in Iowa. By licensing health professionals, Iowans can be confident they are receiving competent care. Did you know? There are 9,004 dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants licensed in Iowa. Why is the Iowa Dental Board important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? All Iowans deserve ethical and safe care from competent, qualified practitioners. Setting standards for licensure ensures that minimum standards are met. Licensing is an effective way to keep untrained and dishonest individuals from practicing dentistry, dental hygiene, or dental assisting in Iowa. What do we do? License health professionals. Investigate complaints about health professionals. Discipline health professionals who break the law. Monitor disciplined and impaired (e.g., substance abuse, mental health problems) professionals so they can return to practice as soon as it's safe. Provide licensure and discipline data to the public. Educate professional groups, students, and the public. Watch national health care trends to see how they might apply to Iowa.

You may feel sad, frustrated, or even angry. Diabetes is a serious health condition, but it can be controlled. The IDPH Diabetes Prevention and Cont rol Program provides resources to help Iowans learn about the disease and how to live with it. A female in Southern Iowa was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2010. She attended diabetes classes and started counting carbohydrates and exercising. Significant weight loss occurred within the first month of diagnosis. A1c was reduced from 7.6% to 5.8% within the first four months of diagnosis. She says diabetes was the worst thing that happened in 2010, and it was the best thing that happened in 2010. Having diabetes has motivated her to take better care of her health. Diabetes is preventable and controllable. IDPH helps Iowans learn how. Did you know? Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death among Iowans. Why is Diabetes Prevention & Control important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Approximately 173,000 (7.5%) adult Iowans have been told by a doctor that they have diabetes. The likelihood of having diabetes increases as we age. Diabetes represents 3% of all deaths in Iowa. Awareness of diabetes can help prevent or delay the onset of the disease. Strict diabetes control can prevent or reduce complications, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, blindness, kidney disease, nervous system disease, amputations, dental disease, and pregnancy complications. What do we do? Provide education about diabetes prevention and control through training for health care professionals. Provide educational materials for communities and certified outpatient diabetes education programs. Certify community-based outpatient diabetes education programs. Maintain involvement with diabetes care providers and educators statewide. Participate in activities like the Dilated Eye Exam Project. Monitor, evaluate, and report diabetes-related data.

In collaboration with the IDPH Disability & Health program, Joanie and Jeannie completed the Community Access Project training in emergency preparedness for pe ople with disabilities. Now the y provide emergency preparedness guidance through group and individual presentations. TRIL C has become an asset to local emergency responders in planning for people with disabilities. Both Joanie and Jeannie use wheelchairs for mobility and understand the importance of including people with disabilities in all phases of emergency planning. A disability is anything that limits your ability to walk, talk, hear, learn, or function day-to-day. A disability does change a life, but doesn't end it. The goal of the Disability & Health program is to help Iowans with disabilities live well and have full access to community services. This helps all Iowans toward healthier, more productive lives. Did you know? Nearly 19% of Iowa adults report having a disability; 90% of those involve physical limitations. Iowans with disability are more likely to have other chronic conditions, such as arthritis, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Iowans with a disability are five times more likely than those without to characterize their health status as \"fair to poor\". Why is the Disability & Health program important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? A disability is any limitation that affects a person's day-to-day activities. Accessing services for people with disabilities can be difficult, especially in rural areas. People with disabilities are more likely to develop other conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, addiction, or obesity. Iowa's older population is growing. Older people are more likely to be living with disabilities. Helping Iowans with disabilities have access to health services and information allows them to live healthier lives. What do we do? Provide training and assistance so community health providers can improve accessibility following Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. Work with state and local responders and planners on establishing accessible sheltering locations and prepare Iowans with disabilities and their families for what to do in an emergency. Provide Continuity of Operations Planning to community providers to maintain essential services during an emergency or disaster. Work with the Center for Disabilities and Development at the University of Iowa to provide an 8-week course called \"Living Well with a Disability.\" Educate pre-service health professionals on providing better service and communication to people with disabilities.

The Center for Disaster Operations and Response (CDOR) works to protect the health of Iowans by preparing for these natural phenomena along with other public health emergencies like pandemic influenza, an intentional release of a chemical agent, or other disasters that affect the health of Iowans. CDOR doesn't work alone in this task. The bureau works with Iowa's 99 local public health agencies, 118 hospitals, community health centers, the Mesqwaki tribal nation, and other public and private entities by providing guidance, tools, and resources to help prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters . No one can predict the next disaster, but CDOR's work with local partners helps to enhance Iowans' ability to quickly return to normal when disaster strikes. Did you know? CDOR administers Iowa's Health Alert Network (HAN), a web-based alerting system that can notify all local public health agencies and hospitals in Iowa, as well as emergency medical services, emergency management, la w enforcement, and other key stakeholders of a public health emergency within minutes. For more information, see www.idph.state.ia.us/cdor . Why is the Center for Disaster Operations and Response important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Public health emergencies, from human threats such as terrorism, to natural disasters like floods and tornadoes, to disease outbreaks like pandemic flu, can affect all Iowans. Emergencies can happen at any time and anywhere. During such emergencies, public health and healthcare professionals are among the first responders. Coordinating communications, plans, and systems, helps make disaster response more effective at the federal, state, and local levels. What do we do? Administer federal preparedness grants that allow us to: Operate a communications system that links critical disaster response partners. Work to improve plans and processes to inform the public about disaster- related health risks and ways to be protected. Provide equipment, supplies, and other resources so state and local testing labs are able to handle increases in receiving, testing, and reporting samples. Provide technical assistance for the development of a round- the-clock disease reporting system. Recruit and maintain the Public Health Response Teams, which respond to disasters in a matter of hours and relieve overwhelmed locals until other resources can arrive on scene. Provide disaster planning and personal preparedness information to individuals and families in Iowa. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

They indicated that the Lions Club would be giving a free vision screening at the school and asked for permission to have her screened. We hadn't noticed any problems with her vision whatsoever, but thought it was a good idea to have her vision checked. Even though I am a nurse, I never detected any problems. I would not have had her vision checked until just before kindergarten. Her results suggested that she be evaluated for a possible astigmatism. I made an appointment and her doctor was very surprised that her left eye had not turned in as her vision was so poor in that eye. She wanted her in corrective lenses immediately to preve nt any strabismus. When Ellen got her first pair of glasses, she cried; so did we! She was so surprised that she could see things that were far away. It was just before Christmas and when she saw the Christmas lights on the trees during the ride home, she said, \"I never knew there were separate lights on the trees!\" Initially, her vision would only correct to 20/40 with lenses. During the next year, we began patching her right eye in an effort to force the left eye to work harder. She progressed well and under the constant direction of her doctor, she was finally able to correct to 20/20. Also, both eyes have remained conjugate. She looks so cute in her little gla sses. Thank you for the work t he Iowa KidSight Program does. If not for the screening, we may have waited too long, and her vision would have been forever impaired. Did you know? In Iowa, there are over 240,000 young children ages 0-5. Of these approximately: /g12020% live in poverty1. /g12016% have parents with compromised mental health status including depression or anxiety2. /g12040% have mothers with less than \"excellent or very good\" physical or mental health3. Why are Early Childhood programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Despite a recent decline, 2009 data reported an 11% increase of reported child abuse. More than 3,000 Iowa children with a known developmental delay or health condition that puts them at risk for future developmental problems are helped each year through the Early ACCESS program. This number has more than doubled since 2001. U nintended injury is the leading cause of death and disability for children over age 1. Preventing injuries in early child care and education settings has a large impact on the health, school readiness, and lifelong potential of Iowa's children. What do we do? Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) has developed a comprehensive plan that serves as the framework for Iowa's early childhood system. The 1st Five program partners with primary healthcare providers to ensure quality social, emotional, and developmental screenings of children under age 5 and helps practices by offering enhanced care coordination to families in need of diverse community resources. The Birth to Five Community Utility project works with a Polk County pediatric practice to develop a community-based mode l for comprehensively addressing the specific health needs of children from birth to age 5. The project aims to develop a system for care coordination, expand the practice's medical home components, develop the professional competencies needed, and improve child health outcomes. /g120Project LAUNCH seeks to develop the necessary infrastructure and system integration to assure Iowa children from birth to age 8 are thriving in safe, supportive environments , enter school ready to learn, and are able to succeed. Project LAUNCH targets traditionally underserved children and their families in Des Moines with a focus on low-income and minority populations. With the Iowa Department of Education, IDPH coordinates the Early ACCESS program, providing developmental evaluations and services for children from birth to age 3, and coordinates services for children with or at risk for developmental delays. Healthy Child Care Iowa (HCCI) supports the health and safety of children enrolled in early care and education programs through nurse consultation, health education, and facilitating health services referrals. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Strengthen the public health infrastructure Promote healthy behaviors Page 41 How do we measure our progress? /g110 Number of medical practices engaged in 1st Five screenings. Data source: 1st Five Title V Child Health Agencies. Data are available annually. How are we doing? Between FY06 to FY12, the number of known practices in Iowa working to integrate a standardized surveillance tool during well child exams that includes assessing for social/emotional development and family risk factors increased from two to 63. During this same timeframe, the number of children birth to 5 served by this surveillance method increased from approximately 3,000 in FY06 to 65,000 in FY11. For FY12, it is estimated that approximately 5 more practices will be added. Evaluation of referrals shows that for every one referral from a medical practice, an average of 2-3 additional referrals are identified when care coordinators work with families. /g111 Number of onsite visits in early childhood and education settings by a Child Care Nurse Consultant Data Source: ECI Annual Reports and HCCI records. Data are available annually. How are we doing? In state fiscal year 2011, there were 4,154 onsite visits in early childhood and education settings by a Child Care Nurse Consultant. This is a new statewide performance measure for Early Childhood Iowa in SFY11 and is a change from total service requests. What can Iowans do to help? 1.

Iowans rely on the EMS system to provide efficient, well-trained, and reliable out-of-hospital care. The EMS system must ensure this care is available to all Iowans, whether urban or rural, even when resources are scarce. Emmet County found a way to overcome money and personnel E MS challenges by bringing together representatives from the county, cities, EMS, emergency management, public health, law enforcement, hospital, local schools, and a college to form the Emmet County Emergency Responders Association. By working together, all the people of Emmet County are assured the same high standard of care when EMS is needed. The Emergency Medical Services system works to ensure medical help is there when Iowans need it. Did you know? 84% of authorized EMS services in Iowa describe themselves as volunteer and respond to approximately 20% of calls for service. The 17% of EMS services staffed by paid EMS providers respond to approximately 80% of calls for service. Iowa's Trauma System is one of the most comprehensive and established trauma systems in the nation. If an injury occurs anywhere in Iowa, there are thousands of trained providers ready to respond in a timely manner and take the victim to one of the 118 trauma care facilities where life- saving care is immediately available. Why are EMS programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Iowa ambulance services receive 240,000 calls for help each year, resulting in 200,000 patients being transported to a healthcare facility. Trauma is the leading cause of death for Iowans from birth to age 40 and the 5th leading cause of death for all age groups combined. Because trauma most commonly affects the young, it takes a higher toll on society than heart disease, cancer, and stroke combined. Iowa's Trauma System works to decrease the incidence and severity of trauma, and prevent unnecessary deaths and disabilities. Iowa's Trauma System works to keep costs down while improving efficiency. Early CPR and defibrillation usually result in a greater than 50% long- term survival rate for witnessed cardiac arrests. What do we do? Regulate EMS training programs, as well as individual providers and patient care services. Regulation ensures that baseline standards for training, certification, and service authorization are met. Help county EMS associations by providing funds for t raining and system development, and by serving as a resource for local EMS services. Iowa's Trauma System program /g57Certifies all licensed hospitals at a level of trauma care based on what resources are available in the community. /g57Collects, analyzes, and provides trauma data to other state programs. /g57Regulates and provides oversight of Iowa's trauma care facilities.

Environmental Epidemiology helps protect the health of all Iowans by watching for and investigating diseases and illnesses caused by environmental conditions such as food borne illnesses, arsenic in private water wells, carbon monoxide poisonings, lead poisoning, and concerns about diseases during floods or other natural disasters. Environmental Epidemiology also seeks to prevent illnesses that are caused by environmental conditions through activities such as using data about environmental exposures more effectively to prevent disease and illness, assuring children are tested for lead poisoning, reducing exposure for lead-poisoned children, and providing in formation about ways to prevent harmful exposures at home, work, and play. By working to understand and prevent harmful environmental exposures, Environmental Epidemiology helps keep Iowans safe. Did you know? One child out of every 14 Iowa children will be lead-poisoned by their 6th birthday - more than 4 times the national average. This means about 2,000 Iowa children born each year will become lead poisoned by their 6th birthday. In 2010, there were 69 work-related deaths in Iowa, with an age range of 16 to 89 years. 54% involved workers who were age 55 or older. This compares to 46% in 2009, and 31% for those 55 or older across the entire U.S. (Source: IA FACE data) . Why is Environmental Epidemiology important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Everyone is at risk for developing an environmental or occupational disease. Nearly 40% of Iowa houses were built before 1950, and most of these homes contain lead-based paint. Young children who live in pre-1950 houses are lead-poisoned when they put paint chips or exterior soil in their mouths or when they get house dust and soil on their hands and put them in their mouths. In 2009, the rate of reported work-related injury and illness in Iowa was 4.7 per 100 FTE (U.S. rate 3.6). 15,800 reported cases involved days away from work. In 2010, there were three reported deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning in Iowa. What do we do? The Lead Poisoning Prevention program works to prevent childhood lead poisoning by assuring children are tested for lead poisoning, reducing exposure for lead-poisoned children, and educating Iowans about prevention. In 72 counties, local boards of health provide childhood lead poisoning prevention services; IDPH provides funding and technical assistance. IDPH provides direct services in 27 counties. Provide guidance and assistance to local public health officials and other state agencies on environmen tal exposures when needed. Work with other state and local agencies to investigate illnesses caused by food and water. The Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance program tracks, analyzes, and reports work-related illnesses, injuries, and deaths, and cases of lead and pesticide poisoning. It also provides information to workers, employers, and other public health programs. The Environmental Public Health Tracking program involves the ongoing collection, integration, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of data from environmental hazard monitoring, and from human exposure and health effects surveillance. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Protect against environmental hazards Prepare for, respond to, & recover from public health emergencies Prevent epidemics & the spread of disease Prevent injuries Strengthen the public health infrastructure Page 45 How do we measure our progress? /g110 Annual number of pesticide associated illness and injury cases reported to poison control centers, Iowans age 16 or older.

The rate of fatal workplace injuries has varied from 4.9 deaths per 100,000 workers (87 deaths) to 5.7 per 100,000 workers (93 deaths). Roadway transportation incidents accounted for 60% (47 of 78) of the work-related deaths in 2009. /g112 Percent of Iowa children who get a blood lead test by age six. /g113 Percent of Iowa children getting a blood lead test who are identified as lead-poisoned. Data Source: IDPH Childhood Blood Lead Surveillance Database. Data are available annually. How are we doing? Virtually all Iowa children are now tested for lead poisoning. The percentage of children tested for lead who are lead- poisoned is steadily decreasing. However, there is still a need to teach providers and parents about the need for testing. What can Iowans do to help? 1. If you have been diagnosed with an environmental-related disease, make sure your physician reports it to IDPH. For a list of reportable environmental diseases, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/adper/common/pdf/epi_manual/environment al_disease_poster.pdf . 2. All Iowans should be aware of the dangers of pesticides. Report all human pesticide exposures by calling the Iowa Statewide Poison Control Center at 1-800-972-2026. To learn more, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/eh/lead_poisoning_prevention.asp#pesticide . 3. Local public health should consult the Environmental Epidemiology program for help and guidance on possible environmental exposures and health concerns. 4. Iowa parents should be aware of possible exposure to lead hazards and have their children tested for lead poisoning. All Iowans should be aware of lead poisoning risks. To learn more, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/eh/lead_poisoning_prevention.asp . 5. Adults who work with lead should be aware that they can become lead-poisoned, their children could be poisoned by lead brought home on their clothes, and their unborn children can be exposed to lead if they are pregnant. 6. Follow laws requiring training and certification of those who identify or abate lead-based paint, and those who perform renovation, remodeling, and repainting in pre-1978 housing or child-occupied facilities. 7. Iowa workplaces should adopt safety practices to prevent fatal injuries. To learn more, go to www.publichealth.uiowa.edu/face/ .

IDPH works to make sure people are the only thing swimming in that pool; not tiny critters that can make people sick. Cryptosporidi osis (\"Crypto\") is a disease caused by a parasite that results in diarrhea. People get sick when they swallow the parasite. The not-so-appetizing explanation: People get sick when they swallow swimming pool water someone else swam in when they had diarrhea. That's just what happened in 2005, when a group of Crypto cases was traced to an Iowa wading pool. Pool operators worked fast, closing the pool for special cleaning, and reopening as fast as possible. The Swimming Pools and Spas program helps keep Iowans healthy by helping keep the waters they swim in healthy, too! Did you know? The IDPH Swimming Pools and Spas program inspects about 1,300 pools, more than 420 spas, 260 wading pools, and 260 water slides at about 1,260 locations in Iowa. Why are Environmental Health Engineering programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Environmental health engineering principles are fundamental to ensuring public health measures are in place to keep Iowans safe. Iowans use public swimming pools and spas at a variety of locations: municipal pools, YMCA/YWCA, hotels and motels, health clubs, and water parks. There are many health concerns related to swimming pools and spas, including transmission of disease, injuries, and the potential for drowning. Plentiful safe drinking water is important to public health. Improperly installed plumbing poses a risk to drinking water systems by potentially allowing drinking water and wastewater to mix. Proper fluoridation of water is extremely important to good oral health. What do we do? Contract with local health departments to do inspections at public swimming pools and spas. Register about 2,200 pools and spas in Iowa. Issue construction permits and approve plans for new facilities or renovations to old ones. Iowa law requires that a water treatment system that claims to reduce health-related contaminants from drinking water be tested to show that the system achieves the reduction. IDPH maintains a registry of systems that comply. The Fluoridation program monitors the fluoridation of public water supplies, assists and trains water system operators, and helps communities with fluoridation projects. The Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Registration program sets training standards for technicians who test backflow prevention devices and maintains a registry of qualified technicians. IDPH maintains the Iowa State Plumbing Code, the minimum standard for plumbing in Iowa cities. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

Clean water, safe food, and proper waste disposal are things we expect. However, it takes properly trained people at the local level to carry out the work needed to ensure the basics we've come to expect are there consistently. IDPH works to ensure the same services and knowledge are delivered statewide, regardless the size of the community. IDPH supports local boards of health and their employees in providing environmental health programs. Since 2001, over 1,200 attendees from local public health agencies have participated in more than 40 training programs. That's an estimated 7,000 hours of professional training! These trained individuals are key in performing routine inspections on regulated facilities as well as providing technical assistance and guidance to local public health officials and Iowans who have concern regarding environmental exposures and their health. Did you know? In state fiscal year 2011, over 6000 private wells in Iowa had th eir water tested for coliform bacteria and nitrate through the Grants to Counties program. Why is Environmental Health Services and Outreach important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Concerns about environmental conditions continue to increase, but the level of environmental health services is not consistent across the state. Environmental health affects every Iowan every day. The environmental health workforce is vital to making sure Iowans are safe where they live, work, and play. Environmental hazards may affect Iowans in a public health emergency or natural disaster. These include food safety, availability of clean drinking water, management of waste, and air quality. Iowa's environmental health workforce is aging and it is important to recruit new graduates to the field of environmental health. During public health emergencies and natural disasters, federal resources are typically not available for the first 72 hours. Local health agencies must be prepared to respond until additional assistance arrives. What do we do? Offer consultation to local boards of health and boards of supervisors on their role in providing environmental health services. This includes finding and hiring qualified environmental health specialists. Provide training and consultation services to local environmental health staff and public on issues including indoor air quality, water quality, tattoo inspections, and more. Provide technical assistance and consultation d uring a food or water related illness outbreak investigation. Facilitate coordination between state agencies and local public health agencies. Provide equipment, assistance, and back-up staff for local emergency response plans. The Grants to Counties Water Well program provides funding to local health departments for private well testing, plugging abandoned wells, and renovating existing wells.

A baseline for the number of environmental health consultations provi ded will be established from July 2011 to June 2012. In the first 6 months of tracking, the division provided over 20,000 consultations to Iowans and others on issues such as indoor air quality, water quality, lead poisoning, and radiological health and safety, which is an average of nearly 3,500 per month. What can Iowans do to help? 1. All Iowans should develop a personal or family disaster plan. For more information, go to www.ready.gov . 2. Iowans can contact their county environmental health office if they would like a free water test for their private well, or if they need help paying for the cost of plugging a well. 3. Local public health officials, elected officials and board of health members should call 515-281-0921 with questions about the delivery of environmental health services in Iowa. 4.Public health administrators, local boards of health, environmental health directors, and practitioners should attend regional trainings.

The free clinic services were very useful to me during my college years. During my annual exams, I always felt comfortable, not judged, and like the examiners actually cared about my health. I really appreciate that the yearly exams were more than just a Pap smear and that my exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle were also addressed. Thank you for all you do!\" A woman from Southern Iowa wrote, \"I really appreciate that I have somewhere to go for a reasonable price. Unfortunately, I couldn't come in with a payment today. I am grateful to know that I was still welcome.\" The IDPH Family Planning Program provides medical services, health education, and information to Iowans to promote reproductive health in Iowa. Did you know? In 2009, 49% of pregnancies in Iowa were unintended. Why is the Family Planning program important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? There are about 322,270 women in Iowa ages 13-44 that need contraceptive services. An increasing number of men are seeking family planning services. Improving birth outcomes and promoting healthy families and communities are essential to promoting public health. The social and economic circumstances facing low-income or minority families may result in decreased access to family planning services. From 2001 to 2007, the number of Iowa pregnancies steadily increased to 48,305. From 2008 to 2010, the number of Iowa pregnancies dropped to 44,628. Women with intended pregnancies modify their lifestyles and obtain prenatal care earlier than do women with unintended pregnancies. Iowa's adolescents have higher rates of unintended pregnancy, low birth weight babies, and sexually transmitted infections (STI) than any other age cohort does. The national teen birth rate is 41.5. The birth rate for all Iowa teens is 32.1, but disparities do exist. The birth rate for Non -Hispanic Black youth is 88.4 and for Hispanic youth, it is 104.8. Teen childbearing in Iowa cost taxpayers (federal, state, and local) approximately $99 million in 2008, the latest year for which those figures are available. The teen birth rate in Iowa declined 20% between 1991 and 2008, savin g Iowa an estimated $34 million in 2008 alone over what it would have incurred had the rates not fallen. In 2010, Title X providers in Iowa served 71,292 women and 3,781 men. Almost 60,000 of those individuals had an annual income less than 250% of the federal poverty level. Title X providers also provided 4,172 cervical cancer screenings, 16% of which required additional follow up for abnormal findings, 81,019 STI tests, and 7,393 HIV tests. What do we do?

For some, however, gambling leads to serious problems that also harm people close to them and the wider community. For problem gamblers, the Iowa Gambling Prevention and Treatment Program is here to help. Gambling had taken control of Jeff's life two years ago. In that short time, he amassed nearly $110,000 in credit card debt and was on the verge of bankruptcy. He spent hours away from his family and work to be at the casino. He opened extra credit cards and maxed them out. As the bills began to catch up, he knew he needed to stop but couldn't put the brakes on his habit himself. \"I didn't know what I was going to do,\" he said. \"Without Allen Hospital's gambling treatment program, I wouldn't have been able to quit. Treatment hasn't been easy but I've learned to cope with stress and the urges to gamble. I've got a long ways to go to be out of debt but I know I have the skills to do it.... I have hope.\" Did you know? Since the mid-1970's, we have gone from a nation in which legal gambling activity was extremely rare to a nation in which legal gambling is permitted in all but a few states. In Iowa, there are 20 casinos, 2,600 lottery outlets, over 3,000 social and charitable gaming licenses, and countless internet and other illegal gaming opportunities. Why is Gambling Prevention & Treatment important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Approximately 12% of all adult Iowans reported that they experienced a symptom of problem gambling in the last 12 months. More than 1 in 5 (22%) of adult Iowans have been negatively affected by the gambling behavior of a family member, friend, or someone else they know. . Iowans with gambling problems report money spent gambling led to financial, personal, family, and work problems. Treatment is effective in reducing or eliminating gambling and associated problems like debt and employment problems. The 1-800-BETS-OFF helpline offers Iowans help and information. Almost 6,000 calls were logged to the helpline in FY2011. What do we do? Fund counseling for Iowans affected by problem gambling. Fund recovery support services including financial counseling, housing and utility assistance, transportation, and life skills training. Fund proven prevention and education services for schools, community groups, casino employees, and other at-risk groups. Promote a Recovery Oriented System of Care that supports long- term recovery efforts of Iowans. Provide information about problem gambling and counseling referral through the 1-800-BETS-OFF helpline. Provide training and resources for problem gambling counselors and other human services professionals. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

She couldn't afford it, but heard about the hawk-i insurance program for children in working families. She heard about the program from a hawk-i outreach coordinator in her community. She completed and submitted an online application, and soon after her hawk-i coverage began, her daughter broke her arm on the playground at school. No problem. Her daughter saw the doctor and all turned out well. This story shows how the hawk-i program works. Did you know? Over 230,000 eligible Iowa children are enrolled in Medicaid and hawk-i . The hawk-i program offers dental-only coverage for children who have health insurance bu t may not have dental coverage. Why is hawk-i Outreach important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? The Iowa Department of Human Services estimates that about 40,000 uninsured Iowa children under the age of 19 are below 300% of the poverty level. Research overwhelmingly shows that access to health care coverage increases a child's readiness to learn, improves school performance by nearly 70%, increases focus in class by 68%, and improves school attendance. Nearly one-third of all Americans (about 90 million people) have trouble understanding and using health information. According to the 2005 Iowa Child and Family Household Health Survey, 97% of those surveyed said it was very important for children to have health insurance. Are your teenagers covered? The highest percent of uninsured children occurs in the 13-18 age groups (5.6%). The Iowa Department of Public Health recently was awarded a grant to direct a statewide program to implement targeted outreach to families with uninsured adolescents, ages 13-19, eligible for Medicaid and hawk-i . The project will link eligible teens and their families through creative activities that reflect the interest and needs of teenagers to health insurance coverage. What do we do? Work with other organizations and agencies to provide information and hawk-i applications to families at various locations. Help families navigate the Medicaid and hawk-i enrollment process. Develop and deliver timely, culturally- correct education and materials to Iowans through conferences, health fairs, and trainings. Encourage policy and procedure changes in the Medicaid and hawk-i programs to increase the number of people who stay in the programs. Consult with other programs, such as Oral Health, to create effective outreach and communication materials for health insurance, and overall child and family health and wellness. Plan meetings and trainings to discuss ways to expand health care coverage outreach and education, simplify coverage programs, and coordinate coverage.

Iowa had projected that by June 30, 2010, with the continuation of expanded outreach efforts and expanded coverage of children in families with countable income up to 300 percent of the FPL, the total number of children enrolled in the Medicaid Expansion and hawk-i programs would reach approximately 42,186. As of June 30, 2010, enrollment reached 49,496.

Individuals and small businesses can use HBEs to purchase affordable health insurance from a choice of products offered by qualified health plans. HBEs will ensure that participating health plans meet certain standards and facilitate competition and choices by rating health plans' quality. Individuals and families purchasing health insurance through HBEs may qualify for premium tax credits and reduced cost sharing if their household income is between 133 percent and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level. The HBEs will coordinate eligibility and enrollment with State Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs to ensure all Americans have affordable health coverage. Did you know? The Affordable Care Act requires states to have a health benefit exchange certified or conditionally certified on January 1, 2013, or the federal government will operate an exchange for the state. Why is the Health Benefit Exchange important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Historically, Iowa individual and small group health insurance markets have suffered from adverse selection and high administrative costs, resulting in low value for consumers. HBEs will allow Iowa individuals and small businesses to benefit from the pooling of risk, market leverage, and economies of scale that large businesses currently enjoy. HBEs will help individuals and small employers shop for, select, and enroll in high quality, affordable private health plans that fit their needs at competitive prices. HBEs will help eligible individuals receive premium tax credits or coverage through other federal or state health care programs. By providing one-stop shopping, HBEs will make purchasing health insurance easier and more understandable for Iowans. What do we do? A HBE Interagency Workgroup has been formed with IDPH, the Iowa Department of Human Services (DHS), and the Iowa Insurance Division (IID). In September 2010, Iowa was awarded a $1 million, 1-year planning grant to begin the init ial planning of a state based HBE. A major part of the planning grant was a series of regional meetings and focus groups across Iowa to ensure considerable stakeholder involvement throughout the planning of the HBE. The information gathered from the meetings was compiled into a Final HBE Regional Meeting and Focus Group Summary . Iowa has recently been awarded almost $8 million to continue the planning process through Level 1 of the Cooperative Agreement to Support Establishment of State-Operated Health Insurance Exchanges. The grant narrative can be found here: Iowa HBE Level 1 Narrative . Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

If the performer falls and the cable malfunctions, the safety net is there to protect the performer. That's a lot like the way the Health Care Safety Net works. It is intended to \"catch\" Iowans in danger of falling through the cracks in the health care system. By focusing on community health centers, rural health clinics, small rural hospitals, and free clinics, IDPH Safety Net partners are able to reach almost 400,000 Iowans who would otherwise lack access to health care because of where they live, cultural differences, or having little or no health in surance. Iowa has approximately 14 federally qualified community health centers, 140 Certified Rural Health Clinics, 44 free clinics and 98 small rural hospitals across the state. Good health should not be a tightrope walk for any Iowan. The Health Care Safety Net partners IDPH engages provide the assurance of access to care. Did you know? According to the 2010 Census, 40% of all Iowans live in rural areas where the population to provider ratio is twice as high as in urban areas. The disparity in the number of providers makes it difficult to get health care quickly, especially in case of an emergency. An estimated 49.4 million individuals were uninsured in 2010. By 2015, there could be 59.7 million people uninsured and 67.6 million by 2020. Why is the Health Care Safety Net important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? All Iowans need to be able to get health care within a reasonable time, using primary care services in a timely fashion to prevent more serious health consequences and reduce unnecessary emergency room visits. Safety Net services increase access to qualified health professionals and to quality health services for underserved and uninsured Iowans. Safety Net providers, such as community health centers and free clinics, provide needed comprehensive health care services to all Iowans, regardless of ability to pay. In the past, free clinics in Iowa were unable to recruit enough professionals to provide free services due to the lack of professional insurance coverage. The Volunteer Health Care Provider program (VHCPP) now offers indemnification to volunteer health care providers serving Iowa's free clinics. VHCPP free clinics have served more than 30,000 Iowans to date. What do we do? Provide funding and contract management of the Iowa Collaborative Safety Net Provider Network. o3 initiatives to expand access to specialty care. o3 programs expanding access to pharmaceuticals. oDirect financial support to Iowa free clinics, family planning agencies, and Rural Health Clinics. o6 Safety Net Medical Home development projects. Recruit physician assistants and advanced registered nurse practitioners to participate in a postgraduate medical training program so they can provide services in Iowa's mental health shortage areas. Analyze geographic areas of Iowa eligible for CMS-certified Rural Health Clinics. Provide indemnification to health care professionals and free clinics through the Volunteer Health Care Provider program. Currently, more than 500 professionals are enrolled. Provide loan repayment opportunities to primary care providers working in designated underserved areas.

The emergency room needs your vital health information fast. Blood type, allergies, and medications you take can affect the medical care you receive. Trouble is, it can take hours or days before the emergency room receives your medical records. This is time you may not have. That's why the Iowa Department of Public Health, through a public and private collaboration known as Iowa e-Health, is leading an effort to create a statewide health information exchan ge (HIE), which is also known as the Iowa Health Information Network (Iowa HIN). This secure network will give your primary care provider access to your vital health information when and where it is needed, in cases of emergency or during regular appointments. Faster access that may save your life. Did you know? The health information exchange (or Iowa HIN) is not a central repository of health records; rather, it is a \"hub\" that connects different electronic health record systems throughout the state, allowing health information to flow between health care providers and, when appropriate, to IDPH. Why is Iowa e-Health important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Iowa e-Health will help facilitate the sharing of health information across boundaries of individual practice and institutional health settings and with consumers. It is a public good that will contribute to improved: Clinical outcomes and patient safety Population health Access to and quality of health care Efficiency in health care delivery What do we do? Build awareness and trust of health IT. Promote statewide deployment and use of electronic health records and health information exchange. Enable a statewide health information exchange ( also known as the Iowa HIN). Enable the electronic exchange of clinical data (e.g., continuity of care document). Safeguard privacy and security of health information. Advance coordination of health IT activities across state and federal government. Establish a governance model for Iowa e -Health. Execute and manage day-to-day business and technical operations for Iowa e-Health. Secure financial resources to sustain Iowa e-Health. Monitor and evaluate health IT progress and outcomes.

Data Source: IRIS Interoperability Survey, 2011. n=603 How are we doing? One way to measure readiness to use Iowa e- Health services, is to evaluate the extent to which providers are using EHRs or other clinical data systems. 62% of the respondents to the 2011 IRIS Interoperability Survey indicate they are already using an EHR or other clinical data system to store and access patient health information. Last year, only 42% of the Iowa providers that completed the Iowa e-Health Provider Assessment revealed they were using an EHR or other clinical data system. This growth shows that an increasing number of providers are expanding their capacity to exchange health information electronically. /g111 Percent of Iowa prescribers actively e-Prescribin g using the Surescripts Network. Data Source: Surescripts Network Data Set for the State of Iowa, 2011. How are we doing? Iowa prescribers are leading the charge to increase the use of health information technology across the state. 62% of Iowa's prescribers sent electronic prescriptions to pharmacies through the Surescripts Network during 2010. This is up from just 11% three years ago, indicating an e- prescribing growth rate in Iowa that is faster than the national average. As Iowa's HIN is developed and implemented, value cases will be collected and shared through the Financial Sustainability Plan to show how connection to an HIE impacts the quality, safety and efficiency of Iowa's health care. What can Iowans do to help? 1. Every Iowan should communicate with their health care provider(s) to learn how health information technology is being used to enable delivery of high quality, safe and efficient care. 2. All Iowans are encouraged to develop and improve personal computer skills. 3. All Iowans should learn about plans to promote the adoption and use of health IT, including the Iowa HIN. For more information, go to www.IowaeHealth.org. 4. Public health professionals should continue to learn about how health information technology can be fully utilized to promote and protect the health of Iowans.

Who keeps track of all these people? The IDPH Bureau of Health Statistics does. Vital records data has been kept in Iowa since 1880 and every person who was born, died, or got married since then is on file at IDPH. Statistical data isn't just interesting trivia. It's important informat ion that can be used to analyze and report on health trends and issues. It is also the basis for virtually all of the research conducted in the social sciences such as economics, political science, and sociology. These records are also required to prove eligibility for many programs and services, such as a driver's license, passport, or Medicaid. As a convenience, verifying the facts of birth is now available electronically for Medicaid and the DOT's driver services. Much of Iowa's health history can be told through the \"numbers\" and the Bureau of Health Statistics helps ensure they \"add up\" to a healthier future. Did you know? Health Statistics is responsible for maintaining and protecting the confidentiality of nearly 12 million records. Why are Health Statistics important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Health data is used to monitor trends in health and health care, identify health problems, and measure the effectiveness of public health programs. Health data is used to measure progress toward meeting the goals of Healthy Iowans 2010 and other public health plans. Vital records are needed to determine eligibility for many programs and services. For instance, a birth certificate is required for a driver's license or passport. Health statistics help us understand the health of Iowans, including disparities in health and the use of health care by different people. Health statistics help leaders decide where resources are needed and how they can best be used. Statistics also provide a measure of a program's success. What do we do? Provide data to local, state, and national public health agencies so they can plan and measure the effectiveness of programs and make decisions about the use of resources. Provide data to state agencies to help them conduct their official duties. Provide certified copies of birth, death, and marriage records to Iowans and other entitled peop le to establish eligibility for many benefits, including U.S. citizenship. Provide a database to monitor progress on health objectives, identify emerging health issues, and support policy development.

We have significantly increased the number of vital records provided to our customers over the years. After reaching a peak in 2007, we have consistently provided more records in each of the last four years than we did during the previous five-year period. Tracking this information allows planning for staff capacity and our ability to meet the demand of our customers. The requests for copies are decreasing, after the increase we experienced related to Federal Agencies requiring birth certificates for passports, social security, and Real ID requirements of a birth certificate to obtain a driver's license even if you have one in the system. Travel requirements have also contributed to the increase. What can Iowans do to help? 1.All Iowans can learn about health trends by accessing health statistic information.

We knew this from experience because it had taken us almost two years to recruit a medical director to our health center. So where to begin? We didn't have money for expensive recruiters. This is a dilemma facing all community health centers. To attract qualified providers, health centers must first find a way to get noticed by providers seeking jobs and then be in a position to be competitive in salary and benefits. Our Primary Care Association as well as the Iowa Department of Public Health Dental Director recommended putting our dental opportunity on the 3R Net website. The ad was placed in late summer of 2008. This proved to be the answer to our prayers. A young dentist from Virginia who was graduating in May 2009 saw our ad on the 3R Net website and called about our position! We actually achieved more than we had hoped for because this dentist was also bilingual in Spanish and our target patient population is overwhelmingly Spanish sp eaking! The initiation of dental services in our community health center was not the result of actions of any single person or entity. It \"took a village\" and the 3R Net was a key member of our village. We are so grateful and appreciative. -Renee Seagren, United Community Health Center, Storm Lake A competent, qualified, and diverse health workforce is vital to the health of Iowans, especially in rural areas where access is limited. IDPH Health Workforce programs seek to promote and expand the number of health care workers in Iowa to ensure Iowans always have health professionals available when needed. Did you know? Sixty-two of Iowa's 75 rural counties are fully or partially designated primary health care shortage areas, meaning they have an acute shortage of primary health care professionals. Why are Health Workforce programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Sixty-two counties include a Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Area. Ninety Iowa counties are Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Almost half of Iowa's dentists (49%) are over age 50. Sixty-nine Iowa counties are in a Dental Health Professional Shortage Area. Iowa predicts a shortage of 12,000 direct care professionals between 2008 and 2018. DCPs make up the largest workforce in the state and work in homes, nursing facilities, residential care facilities, group homes, and other settings. What do we do? Assist in recruiting students into primary care service- oriented careers. Engage in analysis and strategic planning for health care access and health care reform. Administer the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program for Iowa, providing support to practice sites and clinicians. Lead the Personal and Home Care Aide State Training Program to develop a training and credentialing system for direct care professionals. Assist 25 to 30 physicians to practice in Iowa each year through the Conrad 30/J1 Visa Waiver Program. Coordinate public and private efforts to develop and maintain a stable, well-qualified, diverse, and sustainable health care workforce. Manage grants and contracts related to health workforce. Help professionals repay loans through the Iowa Loan Repayment Program. Loan repayment awards are made to an average of eight health professionals a year who commit to serve in shortage areas for two years.

In February 2010, a letter was received from a WISEWOMAN participant: \"Thanks so much for always getting a hold of me every year. If you did not offer this program, I would not get these physicals done. It means a great deal to me.

I did the Chantix thing; [it] took me two weeks. I will neve r smoke again. My son and his girlfriend have also quit.\" This is just one example of how WISEWOMAN works to help Iowa women reduce their risks for heart disease and stroke! Did you know? Heart disease is the #1 killer and stroke is the #4 killer of Iowa men and women. Why is Heart Disease and Stroke programming important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? In Iowa (2010), 6,859 Iowans died of heart disease; the leading cause of death since records started being kept in Iowa in 1920. Another 1,531 Iowans died from stroke, the fourth leading cause of death. Deaths from these two diseases combined accounted for 30% of total deaths in Iowa. 4,998 deaths, 73% of heart disease deaths, were due to coronary heart disease (CHD): /g57There were 172 CHD deaths for men vs. 98 deaths for women per 100,000 Iowans in 2010, 74 more deaths (or 75% higher) for men than women. /g57There were 126 CHD deaths and 38 stroke deaths per 100,000 Iowans in 2010. /g57Iowa met both goals for the two disease death rates set by the national Healthy People 2010: Reduce the CHD death rate to 162 per 100,000 people, and the stroke death rate to 48 per 100,000 people. /g57The Healthy People 2020 goals are to reduce CHD deaths to 101 per 100,000 people, and stroke deaths to 34 per 100,000 people. What do we do? The Iowa Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Program partners with many organizations across the state to plan, implement, and report statewide activities, which support Iowa's Heart Disease and Stroke Plan 2010-2014. The program works with the WISEWOMAN program to provide patient resources, continuing education coursework, and updated clinical practice guidelines to a diverse network of healthcare providers working with the WISEWOMAN program. WISEWOMAN (W ell-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Wom en Across the Nation ) provides services to Iowa women through the Care for Yourself breast and cervical cancer program. WISEWOMAN provides health screenings associated with heart disease and stroke risk factors (i.e. height/weight, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol readings). Based on screening results, the lo cal programs provide individualized health goals based on nutrition, physical activity, and tobacco-cessation for the women. The WISEWOMAN program serves nearly 2,200 women annually in 98 Iowa counties through 26 Care for Yourself sites. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

In 2007, 1 in 3 Iowa adults age 20+ (34%) reported having been told by a doctor their total cholesterol was high, up by 6 percentage points from 28% in 2000. /g112 Percent of WISWOMEN participants who were offered help to quit tobacco use. Data Source: Iowa Care For Yourself (CFY) and WISEWOMAN data. Data are available annually. How are we doing? Smoking is one leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease. About one third of Iowa WISEWOMAN participants are smokers, much higher than Iowa's general adult population. Offering participants help to quit smoking is one of the program's proven strategies. The recent 3 years data shows that the program referred increasingly more women to Quitline or community-based cessation programs. What can policymakers do? 1. Invest in evidence-based prevention which is less costly than treatment. 2. Use public policy to instill heart-healthy habits in children. 3. Limit tobacco use. 4. Promote early identification and treatment of high blood pressure and cholesterol. 5. Support sodium reduction efforts; engage food manufacturers and restaurants in voluntarily reducing sodium in their products. 6. Promote access to the healthcare systerm for all. What can communities do? 1. Participate in coalitions and advisory groups that engage public health policy. 2. Seek policies and programs that help individuals make healthy lifestyle choices. 3. Promote or volunteer to increase rapid response and quality systems of care for heart attack and stroke. What can Iowans do to help? 1. Know your health numbers (including blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose levels). 2. Increase your amount of physical activity each day 3. Eat moderate portion-sizes of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean-meats and low-fat dairy products. 4. Reduceyour sodium intake. 5. Know the symptoms of a heart attack and a stroke - and know when to call 9-1-1.

Maybe you're one of the 50,000 Iowans who has chronic hepatitis C, but doesn't know it. Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to disease. Finding out early that you are HIV-positive or have chronic hepatitis C means that you can receive treatment earlier and live a longer, healthier life. The HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis programs provide prevention, counseling, testing, and treatment services. Disease Prevention Specialists help people newly diagnosed with HIV learn about the disease, talk to their partners about being exposed, and learn how to get into care. One person wrote the following to their disease prevention specialist: \"You told me at a very low point in my life that I would be fine. You even called me six months later to say \"I told you so,\" and you were right. Since then, I have regained my health, and have returned to work. My outlook is now happy and hopeful. Thank you.\" Through personal awareness and community support, the HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis programs are helping save lives. Did you know? Over one-third of people diagnosed with HIV last year were considered late testers - meaning that they had been infected for many years before they were tested. Should you be tested? Why are HIV/AIDS & Viral Hepatitis programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? HIV diagnoses reached an all-time high in 2007 with 128 persons diagnosed. This was nearly equaled in 2009, when 127 persons were diagnosed. The estimated number of Iowans living with HIV/AIDS has grown to over 2,300 people, including over 500 who are infected but who do not know it. The number of Iowans living with hepatitis C is estimated to be over 53,000. Over 80% of these people are not aware of their infections. Early detection of both diseases can greatly increase the life expectancy of someone who is infected. Medications are available to treat HIV and hepatitis C. The AIDS Drug Assistance Program provides life-saving medications or help with insurance premiums and co-pays to over 450 Iowans each month. Early treatment of HIV infection means an individual is less likely to transmit the infection to partners. It also decreases the number of hospital visits, costs less, and increases the quality of life. What do we do? Provide information, training, and funding to local public health agencies and community-based organizations for prevention programs. Offer counseling, testing, and referral services, including services for the partners of HIV-positive individuals. Provide medication, case management, and supportive services. The AIDS Drug Assistance program provides life-saving medication for HIV infected Iowans when no other resources, including Medicaid, are available. Study and investigate ways to decrease transmission among disproportionately affected pe ople, such as African Americans, Latinos, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users.

My Family Support Worker (FSW) and I meet once a week. For six years I have been in an abusive relationship wi th my boyfriend, I knew the right thing to do was to leave him, but I felt like I couldn't and was scared. My FSW helped me realize that I could do it and I did deserve a better life. My FSW gave me the support and guidance I needed to get out of the abusive relationship. She helped me find affordable housing in a different community and get me domestic violence therapy to help me cope with the situation. In addition, she helped me get enrolled into college to get a degree in disability services, a goal that I have had for a long time. I know that I could not have gotten through this situation without my Family Support Worker; she has given me the resources needed to create a better life for myself and my girls. I really feel like this program saved my life.\" Did you know? /g120Only 8% of families with young children, 0 - 5, are able to access family support programming because of the limited funding available. /g120Only 4% of HOPES-HFI families had confirmed cases of child abuse in 2010, down from 7% of families in 2004. /g120Research shows that the most rapid brain development occurs before age five, when children's brains develop 700 synapses\u2014neural connections that transmit information\u2014every second. Early traumatic experiences can damage those connections. Conversely, evidence shows that when babies have stimulating and supportive interactions with caring adults, they develop healthier brains, better learning abilities, and more successful interpersonal relationships into adulthood and beyond. Why are Home Visiting programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Lower health costs: The Healthy Families America program helped reduce the incidence of low birth weight, which is associated with costly short- and long-term health problems such as high blood pressure, cerebral palsy, and lung disease, as well as other poor outcomes for children. Better health outcomes: One home visitation program has been shown to reduce abuse and neglect\u2014two early indicators of long-term health problems\u2014among children of low-income, high-risk mothers by 48 percent. Adults who experienced childhood abuse and neglect are more likely to suffer from a range of physical problems, including arthritis, asthma, and high blood pressure. School readiness and workforce preparation: At-risk children who participated in one high quality, home visiting program had better cognitive and vocabulary scores by age six and higher third-grade scores in math and reading than the control group. At-risk toddlers who participated in another voluntary home visitation program were 42.5 percent more likely to graduate from high school than their peers who did not participate. What do we do? The Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) program is responsive to the diverse needs of children and families in communities at risk and provides an opportunity to improve health and development outcomes for at-risk children through evidenc e- based home visiting programs. Home visiting is one of several service strategies embedded in a comprehensive, high-quality ear ly childhood system that promotes maternal, infant, and early childhood health, safety, and development, strong parent-child relationships, and promotes responsible parenting among mothers and fathers.

In 2009, there were no cases of polio in Iowa. Why such a dramatic decline? The polio vaccine. During the 1960s, more than 35,000 Iowans got rubella (German measles). Vaccines have changed the world we live in by providing protection against harmful diseases and, in some cases, by eliminating them altogether. According to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Institute of Medicine, and the Centers for Disease Control, vaccines are one of the most successful public health advances in the last century. The Iowa Immunization program's goal is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases. Working with public and private healthcare providers, the program works to increase and maintain the number of Iowans who are properly vaccinated. Vaccines help prevent the spread of disease and the IDPH Immunization program provides the resources to do just that. Did you know? Vaccine preventable diseases still threaten the health of Iowans. In 2006, mumps and pertussis (whooping cough) sickened 2,306 Iowans. Why is the Immunization program important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Vaccines are responsible for the control of many infectious diseases once common in the U.S., including polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, rubella, mumps, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Vaccines help prevent infectious diseases and save lives, giving Iowans the opportunity to live healthy in healthy communities. Immunizations have contributed to our increased life expectancy. Immunization saves money! Each year, routine immunizations save more than $40 billion in costs to society. What do we do? Purchase and distribute vaccine to public and private health care providers through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. About 347,081 Iowans ages 18 and younger are eligible for the program because they are Medicaid eligible, uninsured, underinsured, or American Indian or Alaskan natives. Provide education about vaccine preventable diseases and the benefits of immunization. Provide funding to local public health agencies to conduct immunization clinics and outreach clinics . Manage the statewide Immunization Registry Information System (IRIS), which keeps immunization records for all Iowans, helping to prevent individuals from being under and over immunized.

To better serve our customers and aligning with IDPH quality improvement efforts, the Bureau of Information Management upgraded and redesigned the Help Desk. In February 2011, a new Self-Service Portal was launched for submitting and managing internal IDPH user -support requests. This new system also collects information about service requests and responses, providing the data needed to determine areas of improvement, adjust our s ervice delivery model as needed, an d most importantly, improve customer service. Improving the Quality of Request Submissions (Tickets) Resolution of issues is not consistently documented across tickets and the time to resolve the issue is not documented for the majority of tickets (64%). Technicians are revisiting t he process for categorizing tickets as well as taking steps to ensure consistency across all technicians in recording the closure and effort to close tickets. In addition, the bureau will form a user workgroup to provide feedback on the customer experience with the Self- Service portal, focusing on t he categorization of requests. This will decrease the number of uncategorized or wrongly categorized tickets. Measuring Customer Satisfaction While the new Self-Service portal has provided a wealth of objective operational data, the bureau is looking to gather data on customer satisfaction and establish corresponding performance metrics in the upcoming year.

A Home Nursing visit was requested to assist with blood work. Susan is morbidly obese and was found sitting on a couch in an extremely cluttered and unkempt house. She was unable to move herself independently and so remained on the couch, sitting in her own feces the majority of the time. Nursing services were provided through the LPHS funds allocated through IDPH as she had no insurance or income. Advocacy by the Public Health Nurse working with several comm unity organizations and churches, has provided Susan with Durable Medical Equipment and a power lift recliner so she is able to move herself independently. Providing ongoing nursing assessments, lab draws, and medication assistance has enhanced Susan's health status. A Home Care Aide is providing Susan assistance with a sponge bath, shampooing her hair, and providing some light housekeeping. Without Public Health Services, Susan would need to be in a nursing home. Her husband works at night and needs to sleep during the day so is unable to provide much assistance. As a result of services provided by Public Health, Susan is now able t o transfer herself and elevate her legs. Her health status has improved immensely. She recently went to the dentist and was able to walk on her own to a vehicle for transport. Public Health Services have truly made a difference in the life of Susan! Did you know? Local public health services exist in all of Iowa's 99 counties and local boards of health assure that all communities have services that help promote healthy Iowans and healthier communities. Why are Local Public Health Services important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans?

We promote breastfeeding, as well, which improves infant health, immunity, growth, and development. Why are Maternal Health programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? /g120Early and adequate prenatal care (in the first 3 months of pregnancy) is important to a healthy pregnancy and birth. It helps reduce illness and disability through health care advice and by identifying and managing chronic or pregnancy related risks. According to the Iowa Barriers to Prenatal Care Survey, most Iowa women receive prenatal care; yet, low-income, teen, and minority women are more likely to receive prenatal care after the 3 rd month. Barriers include financial, transportation, and a lack of knowledge that prenatal care is important. The Maternal Health program works to overcome these ba rriers. Premature, low birthweight babies have a higher risk of death and disabilities. Costs for caring for these babies are up to 15 times higher. In 2008, there were 4,621 preterm Iowa births representing 11.5% of live births. Iowa's rate is slightly better than the nation al rate of 12.3% of live births. Maternal Health programs provide education and counseling to decrease risk factors including tobacco cess ation counseling, nutrition counseling to control glucose levels in women with diabetes, referrals for hypertension treatment , and improving access to prenatal care. Maternal health agencies have worked hard to improve the number of pregnant women who have a \"medical home\" - a regular source of prenatal medical care by a physician or midwife - from 68% in 2002 to 90% in 2010. Domestic and sexual violence are pervasive problems that have major impact on health conditions. Research has shown that when women are provided with support and information about their safety options, they are more likely to take steps toward safety in their interpersonal relationships. Iowa's Project Connect works to provide this information. What do we do? IDPH funds 21 Iowa maternal health agencies that provide services to pregnant and postpartum women. For a map with contact info rmation for these agencies, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/hpcdp/maternal_health_services.asp . Services include: /g68Help in finding a medical home. /g68Prenatal and postpartum health education. /g68Transportation to medical visits. /g68Education about lifestyle choices to improve pregnancy outcomes. /g68Breastfeeding education and support. /g68Psychosocial assessment including screening for perinatal depression. /g68Nutrition assessment and education. /g68Oral health assessment and help in finding a dentist to provide a regular source of oral health care. /g68Postpartum home visits by registered nurses to assess the health of both new mothers and their babies. /g68Family needs assessment and referral to community resources to help the family. /g68Pregnant women may qualify for help from publicly funded health insurance (Medicaid) even if they were not eligible before pregnancy. Program staff help families find out if they qualify for services at a reduced or no cost. /g68Referral to family planning and child health agencies after delivery to support the family's ongoing health care needs. In addition, IDPH administers two maternal health specific projects. /g68Project Connect is a violence prevention initiative and funded by the Office on Women's Health of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in conjunction with Futures Without Viole nce. It is designed to identify, respond to, and prevent domestic and sexual violence, as well as, promote an improved public health response to abuse. /g68Iowa's Prenatal Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a part of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention initiative, strives to reduce infant mortality and low birth weight. It is a population based surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected m aternal behaviors and experiences before, during, and after pregnancy.

The State Medical Examiner's Office (SME) performs 650-700 autopsies per year, but that's only a small part of what is accomplished. The SME also reviews over 4,500 death investigation reports from Iowa's 99 counties and provides guidelines and 24- hour consultation services to county medical examiners and investigators. In addition, SME staff are responsible for signing about 600 death certificates and 350 cremation permits per year. While the television version of a medical examiner may appear glamorous, the real-life work of the State Medical Examiner in Iowa is a vital part of Iowa's public health system. Did you know? The physicians employed by the State Medical Examiner's Office are all board certified in anatomic, clinical, and forensic pathology. The Iowa Office of the State Medical Examiner is accredited by the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME). Why is the State Medical Examiner's Office important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Iowa has more than 27,000 deaths each year. Of these deaths, approximately 4,500 need a death investigation by the county medical examiner, deputy medical examiner, investigators, and/or the state office. Approximately 1,400 deaths require autopsy, and of those, between 650 and 700 are performed by the Iowa Office of the State Medical Examiner. State Medical Examiner forensic pathologists provide expert witness testimony at depositions, grand juries, and state and federal criminal and civil trials. The State Medical Examiner's Office has staff appointed to the state's Domestic Violence Team and Child Death Review Team, providing help and expert advice about forensic pathology questions and concerns. The State Child Death Review Team is under the direction of the State Medical Examiner's Office. What do we do? Provide 24/7 consultation to all counties pertaining to death investigations. Perform 650-700 autopsies and review over 4,500 reports each year. Provide funding for up to six county medical examiners and medicolegal death investigators to attend training. Provide lectures, tours, and presentations to schools, professional groups, and other government agencies. Provide internsh ips for investigators, radiology technologists, clinical laboratory scientists, and medical office specialists from many schools throughout Iowa. Maintain a database of medical examiner cases statewide. Forensic pathologists provide more than 40 lectures per year to medical students, residents, mortuary science students, and county medical examiners and their investigators. Provide basic death investigation training sessions across the state to county level investigators and medical examiners. Provide clinical rotations for medical students. Coordinate and lead the state's Disaster Response Team for mass fatality incidents (Iowa Mortuary Operations Response Team [IMORT]). Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Strengthen the public health infrastructure Page 85 How do we measure our progress? /g110 Percent of autopsy reports completed by the State Medical Examiner's Office within 90 days of death. Data Source: SME Database. Data are available annually. How are we doing? In 2011, we completed 99% of all autopsies within 90 calendar days, exceeding the National Association of Medical Exa miners (NAME) standard of 90%. Of the total number of autopsies we completed, 96% were completed within 60 days, and 59% were completed within 30 days. (Note: As of the publication of this report, data from the 2011 calendar year remains incomplete. Cases finalized after 12/15/2011 are not included in the above statistics.) What can Iowans do to help? 1. Every Iowan can view the Iowa Office of the State Medical Examiner as an independent and objective investigative agency. 2. Iowans can encourage more funding for the office as it continues to grow and takes on more cases statewide.

In 2007, chronic diseases accounted for 68% of all deaths in Iowa. The dramatic growth of chronic diseases is a huge burden to Iowa. If this problem is ignored, the cost of treating chronic conditions could overwhelm health care. However, improving preventive care and keeping people healthier is one of the most effective ways to reduce health care costs and is a major focus of health care reform. A medical home is enhanced primary care wher e a team of health professionals work together to coordinate care and provide improved patient-centered care. A medical home provides effective preventative care and care coordination to manage chronic diseases. The care team is available 24/7 and appointments can be made quickly, even on the same day when needed. Provid ers know their patients and remember their health history. The care team makes sure patients understand their conditions and helps them sort through the options. They help patients find specialists, get appointments, and make sure specialists have all the information they need. Did you know? 75 cents of every health care dollar is spent on chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and they account for 7 out of every 10 deaths. The good news is that 80% of chronic conditions can be prevented through improved lifestyle choices such as not smoking, improved diet, and increased physical activity. Why is the Medical Home/Prevention & Chronic Care Management Initiative important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? The patient-centered medical home is a model of care that holds significant promise for better health care quality, improved involvement of patients in their own care, and reduced avoidable costs over time. A medical home is a practice that provides care that is accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. Iowa's current health care system is set up to focus on treating people once they become sick. Some experts describe this as \"sick care\" instead of health care. Iowa will never be able to contain health care costs until we start focusing on preventing people from getting sick in the first place, and putting an emphasis on improving the choices we make that affect our risk for preventable diseases. What do we do? /g120 Iowa's Health Care Reform Act (HF 2539) has tasked IDPH with developing a plan for implementation of a statewide patient- centered medical home system and developing a state initiative for prevention and chronic care management. /g120 To do this, a Medical Home/Prevention and Chronic Care Management Advisory Council was formed, which includes representation from health care, state agencies, academia and consumers. /g120A number of different issue briefs have been developed by the Councils on a variety of important topics related to Medical Home and Prevention and Chronic Care Management in Iowa. /g57Community Utility Issue Brief /g57Disease Registry /g57Patient-Centered Care: What Does it Look Like? /g57Social Determinants of Health Issue Brief /g57Chronic Disease Management Issue Brief /g57Iowa Diabetes Issue Brief /g57Prevention Issue Brief Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

Data Source: 2003 National Survey of Children's Health and the 2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. Data are available approximately every 5 years. How are we doing? In Iowa, 52% of families without a special health care needs child and 57% of families with a special health care needs child reported having a medical home. Nationally, these rates are only 46% and 47% respectively. Iowa ranks better than the national averages, but can still improve. /g111 Iowa Community Health Center's medical home study of diabetics HgA1C levels.

You have many things to be concerned about, but worries about your doctor's competency should not be one of them. The Iowa Board of Medicine strives to ensure that only qualified, skilled physicians and acupuncturists practice in Iowa. In addition to helping Iowans get quality medical care, the Iowa Board of Medicine helps doctors. The Board has improved the license renewal system for doctors. In FY2010, 98% of physicians renewed their license online, eliminating wait-time and allowing for immediate practice. And, by streamlining the peer review system, the Board has been able to take disciplinary action sooner, and when necessary, remove incompetent physicians from practice. Did you know? There are 10,593 physicians and 41 acupuncturists licensed to provide health services to Iowans. Why is the Iowa Board of Medicine important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Iowans deserve medical care and acupuncture from competent, qualified practitioners. By licensing providers, we help keep untrained and dishonest individuals fro m working in Iowa. The medical board provides licensure, investigation, and services for professionals with substance abuse or mental health problems. Iowa law mandates such services. Research shows that monitoring programs, like the Iowa Physician Health program, are highly effective in reducing the likelihood of a return to addictive or problem behavior. Thousands of Iowans use the Docfinder service on the medical board's Web site each year. Docfinder provides information about licensees to the public. What do we do? License health professionals. Investigate complaints about health professionals. Discipline health professionals who have broken the law. Monitor disciplined and impaired health professionals so they can return to practice as soon as they are safe to practice again. Provide information about licensure and discipline to the public, employers, and credentialers. Speak to professional groups, students, and the public. Watch trends in other states and use that information to help form policy. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

In 2010, OMMH received a Department of Health & Human Services Office of Minority Health State Partnership Grant for 2010 - 2013. The purpose of this grant is to address increased staff needs and resources to better serve as the liaison agency within the IDPH, link with and develop partnerships in multicultural communities, increase the engagement of the OMMH Advisory Council in strategic planning and program activ ities, strengthen six regional multicultural coalitions, and produce a disease burden report. We continue to provide pre ceptorships and internships for the Des Moines University C ollege of Osteopathic Medicine, Masters of Public Health Program and partner with other Iowa academic institutions in accordance our goal to provide internships for students of diverse ancestral heritage. Did you know? /g68In 2005, IDPH established the Office of Multicultural Health (OMH) in an effort to increase access to culturally competent health care for Iowa's minority, immigrant, and refugee populations. /g68In 2006, OMH became part of Iowa law. /g68In 2007, OMH developed a strategic plan with the mission to actively promote and facilitate health equity for Iowa's multicultural communities. /g68In 2010, OMMH received its first federal DHHS OMH State Partnership Grant. /g68In 2011, OMMH in contractual agreement with the University of Northern IA completed a 3-phase goal of establishing the opportunity for 6 regional public health minority health coalitions. Why is Minority & Multicultural Health important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? According to the U.S. Census, Iowa had a 97% increase in its minority population from 1990 to 2000. There was a 47% increase in African Americans, a 46% increase in Native Americans, a 214% increase in Asian Pacific Islanders, and a 241% increase in the Hispanic/Latino population. Chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer are more common in Iowa's minority and immigrant/refugee populations. To meet the needs of these growing populations, Iowa must expand its capacity to address minority and immigrant/refugee health issues. IDPH must help local public health agencies and health care providers address the health concerns of new Iowans. What do we do? Work with companies, communities, faith-based groups, and others across Iowa to develop strategies for providing culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Coordinate and provide education and training in culturally and linguistically appropriate health care and service delivery to any state, local, or regional agency, program, or institution. Assure access to networks, contacts, and resources necessary to apply for local, regional, and federal grants and awards. Assure a comprehensive health assessment for newly arriving refugees. Work with partnering agencies to assure appropriate health services are received. Provide information to the public about health disparities. Plan, evaluate, assess, and research health disparities. Develop legislation, rules, and policies related to health disparities. Work with and provide links to communities, local agencies and programs, and regional and federal entities to address the health issues that affect Iowa's minority, immigrant, and refugee populations. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Strengthen the public health infrastructure Page 91 How do we measure our progress? /g110 Number of state and local programs and organizations that have received technical assistance, resources, or training about multicultural health issues and services. Data Source: OMH records. Data are available annually. How are we doing? In 2011, the Executive Director of IDPH, OMMH received the Heritage Legacy Individual Award from the 13 thAnnual I'll Make Me a World in Iowa for recognition of an outstanding African American Iowan whose actions have contributed to the quality of life for African Americans and made the better place for all Iowans. In 2011, we provided technical assistance and facilitated a workshop for 30 undergraduate students of diversity at Cornell College in Mt. Vernon Iowa on the importance of understanding disproportionate health related diseases and prevention of their on- set. In partnership with Iowa Medical Services of Central Iowa, we held the first free African American male prostrate screening event with 25 participants in attendance and, partnered with the IDPH Comprehensive Cancer Control program & Northern Plains Comprehensive Cancer Control program for Building Relationships with Native American Populations (Cultural Competency 101) training with 75 participants. In partnership with Community Health Partn ers of Sioux County Public Health, we provided assist ance with the establishment of the Latino's Women's Support Services Coalition. Within this same year, OMMH has established a lending library for the video \"UNNATURAL CAUSES\" which provides this tool for addressing health equity to any of the Maternal and Child Health contractors to address the state performance measure number #3 . This tool is also available to any community based or public health agency. Technical assistance on the adaptation of this too l was inclusive within three presentational workshops at the Fall MCH conference held in Ames, IA. Each year our goal is to increase by at least 10 the number of state and local programs and organizations that have received te chnical assistance, resources, or training about multicultural health issues and services. What can Iowans do to help? 1.All Iowans can become more aware of the health care and access needs of Iowa's minority, immigrant, and refugee residents. 2. All Iowans can build public, professional, and policymaker support for programs and policies to improve the health of minorities, immigrants, refugees, and their families. 3.Iowa organizations can do more to recruit and retain racial and ethnic minorities as health and human service providers.

The Dallas County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution stating that vending machines on county property will provide at least 30% healthier items using the NEMS-V criteria. Three additional county health departments have consulted with Iowans Fit for Life regarding the steps to pass a similar resolution. Did you know? Over 66% of adult Iowans are overweight or obese, up from 55% in 1995. Why is Nutrition and Physical Activity important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Obesity-related health problems cost Iowans $783 million each year. Medicaid and Medicare cover about 46% of these costs. The rate of overweight and obese Iowans has dramatically increased among adults, teens, and children. Less than 20% of Iowans eat fruits and vegetables five or more times per day. In 2010, 75% of Iowa adults reported engaging in some sort of physical activity for exercise during the past month (other than their regular job). Iowans in poverty are less likely to eat nutritious foods than those with higher incomes. Iowans with incomes less than $15,000 per year are more likely to be obese. Environments that support physical activity and proper nutrition provide a better quality of life for Iowans. Iowans who are physically active and eat nutritious foods are at a decreased risk for overweight and obesity, as well as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and osteoarthritis. What do we do? The vision of the Health Promotion Unit at IDPH is \"Healthy Iowans living in healthy communities.\" Programs within the Health Promotion Unit include 1) Iowans Fit for Life, 2) Iowa Nutrition Network, 3) Communities Putting Prevention to Work, 4) Healthy Communities, and 5) Community Transformation Grant Program. These nutrition and physical activity initiatives: Make it easier for Iowans to eat well and be physically active. The healthy choice should be the easy choice. Bring state and local partners together to build networks dedicated to healthy eating and physical activity. Provide funding and support to improve the food and activity environments where Iowans live, work, and play. Provide resources for communities and organizations to support improvements in nutrition and physical activity environments. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

Everyone wants a bright, beautiful smile. But oral health is more than straight, shiny-white teeth. Did you know poor oral health in children can affect speech development? And, that 51 million school h ours are lost each year to dental- related illness? Did you know poor oral health in adults has been linked to heart disease? Unfortunately, getting needed dental care is difficult for low-income and uninsured families in Iowa. The Oral Health Center within the IDPH Bureau of Oral and Health Delivery Systems has programs that work to improve the oral health of all Iowans, regardless of income. The Oral Health Center (OHC) encourages local public health partners to provide preventive services, like fluoride applications and dental sealants, and to provide education and assist families in making dental appointments. As a result, more than twice as many Medicaid-enrolled children are receiving dental care than in 2000. Expanding access to oral health care for all Iowans is truly something to smile about. Did you know? Nearly 95% of Iowa children have health insurance, but only about 81% have insurance for dental care. Why are Oral Health programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Oral health directly affects the health and wellness of all Iowans. Cavities can be prevented. 22% of Iowa third-graders have untreated cavities; one out of every five low-income children has untreated cavities. Many families don't know about the importance of oral health and know little about proper oral hygiene and preventive care. Access to dental care is a maj or problem for low-income Iowa families. For children on Medicaid, 46% go without any dental services at all. Early access to preventive dental services saves money! For at-risk children, having fluoride applications as soon as teeth erupt reduces the chance that teeth get decayed and n eed fillings or crowns. A fluoride application costs just $14. A small filling costs more than 3 times that. Iowa's dental workforce is aging and decreasing in number, particularly in rural parts of the state. What do we do? Coordinate the I-Smile program, which helps local public health partners promote oral health, provide preventive services, and educate the public about the importance of early and regular oral health care. Increase awareness of children's oral health with physicians, nurses, and physician assistants, and train them to provide oral screenings and preventive care for families. Work with local public health partners to help families make appointments and find payment sources for dental care. Provide funding to public health agencies to provide screenings and dental sealants to low-income, uninsured, and underinsured children in grades 2-8. Coordinate oral health surveillance to monitor and track Iowans' oral health status and ability to access and pay for care. Oversee the school dental screening requirement for children newly enrolling in elementary and high school. Track services provided by dental hygienists working under public health supervision, to assure limited services are provided to underserved families.

Pharmacists play a critical role in protecting the health of Iowans. The Iowa Board of Pharmacy assures the public that only qualified, competent pharmacists practice in Iowa. The Iowa Board of Pharmacy strives to issue licenses and registrations quickly and efficiently. In addition, the Board receives and investigates complaints from Iowans, and when necessary, disciplines pharmacists who have broken the law. With more than 3,000 licensed pharmacists in Iowa, the Board of Pharmacy works to ensure each provides quality health services to Iowans. Did you know? There are over 3,300 licensed pharmacists in Iowa. Why is the Iowa Board of Pharmacy important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? The Iowa Board of Pharmacy licenses pharmacists to ensure Iowans receive competent, qualified care. The Iowa Board of Pharmacy helps pharmacists who are battling addiction. Research shows that monitoring programs for impaired pharmacists are highly effective in reducing relapse. Licensure is an effective way to keep untrained a nd unethical individuals from practicing pharmacy in Iowa. What do we do? License health professionals. Investigate complaints about health professionals. Discipline health professionals who have broken the law. Provide licensure and discipline data to the public, employers, and credentialers. Monitor disciplined and impaired health professionals so they can return to practice as soon as it is safe to do so. Speak to professional groups, students, and the public.

But what if you are diagnosed with a disease that requires expensive medications? How will you pay for that, too? The Prescription Services program is there to help, providing free treatment for Iowans with an STD or with TB infection or disease. By treating 2000 Iowans a year for latent TB infection, approximately 200 infectious cases of TB are avoided each year. The program also provides treatment for about 7,000 Chlamydia cases per year at a cost of $1.81 per case per Iowan and over 1,000 cases of gonorrhea at a cost of $3.30 per case per Iowan. For Iowans not treated soon enough, 10% will develop a serious complication called Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, costing at least $1,167 per patient to treat. Proper treatment prevents exposing others to diseases and their complications. The Prescription Services program provides treatment free of charge because going without treatment can be much more costly. Did you know? Each year, this program provides medication to treat more than 20,000 Iowans for sexually transmitted diseases and TB infection and disease. Why are Prescription Services important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? TB disease remains a public health problem in Iowa with an average of 44 new cases reported every year. Many Iowans are infected by TB, but haven't developed symptoms (latent TB infection or LTBI) and will need antibiotics to prevent them from getting the disease. About 150,000 Iowans are currently infected with TB. More than half of all Iowans will have an STD sometime in their life. Children and young adults are particularly at risk for STDs. In 2010, 74 % of reported Chlamydia cases were among 15 to 24 year olds. Untreated STDs can lead to serious, even life-threatening complications. Early treatment saves money! For example, treating someone with a latent TB infection costs about $15. Treating someone who has developed TB disease costs $2,000. What do we do? Provide treatment for 2,000 Iowans with LTBI or TB disease each year. Provide treatment for more than 15,000 Iowans infected or exposed to chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, and syphilis each year. Ensure medications for active and suspected cases of TB are shipped within 24 hours of the prescription being written. Ensure medications for STD and LTBI are sent within three working days of the prescription being issued. Federal STD and TB grant funds cannot be used to buy medications for treating STD and TB patients. The Prescription Services program pays for medications that federal funds won't cover.

Data Source: Contract pharmacy database. Data are available monthly. How are we doing? 100% of medications are shipped within the desired timeframe. What can Iowans do to help? 1. Iowans of all ages should use safer sex practices, such as choosing one partner and knowing them well, regularly and correctly using latex condoms, or refraining from sex completely. 2.Iowans at risk of getting an STD should be tested, and if necessary, treated for STDs. To learn what puts you at risk of getting an STD, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/HivStdHep/ . 3. Maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially when visiting countries where TB is common. 4. Health care professionals need to know about the availability and benefits of the program. Lack of awareness adversely affects Iowans who have no insurance or are underinsured. 5.Advocate for an increase in funding to continue these services. The rising costs of medication and no increases in program funding means fewer Iowans can be served each year.

In other words, you expect someone who knows what they're doing, and who does it in a courteous, professional manner. The IDPH Bureau of Professional Licensure works to protect the public and improve access to quality health services by licensing qualified professionals. The Bureau of Professional Licensure also strives to make the process of licensing more convenient for professionals. Online license renewal and e-payment services have begun, with the goal of a modernized Web-based program that will allow license renewal in real time from any location. The Bureau of Professional Licensure works to help ensure consistency and quality in Iowa health services. Did you know? You can verify the licensure status of any person or business regulated by the Bureau of Professional Licensure by name or license number. Go to www.licensediniowa.gov . Why is Professional Licensure important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Thousands of Iowans rely on the 43,000 professionals and 5,600 businesses regulated by Professional Licensure. All Iowans benefit when health care is provided by competent, ethical professionals who hold active licenses. Open records and open meetings let the public have input into licensure requirements, rulemaking, continuing education, and discipline of licensees and businesses. Licensure boards are made up of professionals and public members who make sure licensure standards are safe, effective, and clearly communicated to the public. What do we do? Process applications for initial licensure, license renewal, and reactivation of licenses. Coordinate, and in some cases, conduct examinations for licensure. Determine eligibility for licensee participation in the Volunteer Health Provider Program. Address all complaints and implement discipline at the licensing board's direction. Provide executive support to 19 licensure boards and direct services to licensees practicing in Iowa in the following professional categories: Athletic Training Massage Therapy Podiatry Barbering Mortuary Science Psychology Behavioral Science Nursing Home Administrators Respiratory Care Practitioners Chiropractic Optometry Sign Language Interpreters & Transliterators Cosmetology Arts & Sciences Physician Assistants Speech Pathology & Audiology Dietetics Physical & Occupational Therapy Social Work Hearing Aid Dispensing Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

It can save lives, but also endanger lives. The use of radiation must be carefully monitored. The IDPH Bureau of Radiological Health protects Iowans from unnecessar y and potentially harmful exposure to radiation. The machines that produce radiation (like x-ray or mammography machines) and the people who use them are tested and certified to ensure Iowans are being treated by qualified professionals with safe equipment. You've probably heard of radon - a naturally occurring gas that seeps into homes and can cause lung cancer. The Bureau of Radiological Health licenses experts who can stop radon from getting into a home. IDPH works each day to protect the health of Iowans - even when the \"enemy\" is invisible! Did you know? In 1986, the state of Iowa entered into an agreement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to protect the health and safety of Iowans by regulating radioactive material in Iowa. Why is Radiological Health important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Exposure to radiation in large amounts can cause immediate and long-term health effects, including cancer and death. Iowans could be exposed to radiation at any time each day because of the common use of industrial and medical radioactive materials and machines. Radiation occurs naturally in the environment; however, anything beyond this natural exposure may be unnecessary and could be harmful. Iowa has one of the highest rates of indoor radon levels in the country. High quality mammography machines and images are essential to finding breast cancer early. Iowans of all ages are at risk for over-exposure to ultraviolet light from tanning beds. What do we do? Inspect, test, accredit, and certify mammography facilities, machines, radiologists, and technologists. Issue Permits to Practice for individuals who operate or use ionizing radiation producing machines or administer radioactive material for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Coordinate radiation emergency response by working with local, county, state, and federal agencies in case of an accident. License, register, and inspect facilities that use radioactive materials. Educate Iowans about radon gas and credential radon measurement and mitigation specialists. Register tanning bed facilities and post health information about the risks of tanning. Register X-ray producing machines. Investigate allegations and complaints regarding radioactive material and radiation producing machines. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Protect against environmental hazards Strengthen the public health infrastructure Prepare for, respond to, & recover from public health emergencies Promote healthy behaviors Page 105 How do we measure our progress? /g120 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees the Iowa radioactive material (RAM) program and conducts an Integrated Material Performance Evaluation Program (IMPEP) review every three years. The Iowa RAM program successfully completed two consecutive IMPEP reviews scoring SATISFACTORY for all performance indicators. Due to the outstanding score of the IMPEP reviews, the Iowa RAM program was the first agreement state program to receive an extension by the NRC for the next IMPEP review. /g120 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the Iowa mammography program and conducts an annual review. The Iowa mammography program consistently meets or exceeds the requirements set by the FDA. The Iowa program annually inspects 139 mammography facilities including 166 mammography units and 25 stereotactic facilities. To continue providing services to Iowans, the facilities must correct all non-compliances that are found. What can Iowans do to help? 1.All Iowans can make themselves aware of the possibility of exposure to radiation, especially from medical procedures. 2. All Iowans can report any misuse of radioactive materials or ionizing radiation producing machines by contacting the Bureau of Radiological Health at 515-281-3478 or melanie.rasmusson@idph.iowa.gov . 3.All Iowans should learn about radon gas and how to test for it in their homes.

However, without early testing and treatment, complications can include Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), chronic pelvic pain, tubal pregnancy, infertility, infecting an infant during childbirth, increased risk for HIV infection, and even death. Sexually transmitted diseases are a significant health threat in Iowa, with more than 11,000 STD infections diagnosed and treated in 2009. The Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention program works to stop the spread of STDs in Iowa through reducing the number of Iowans who are infected without knowing they are infected, and providing treatment for those who are infected. One of the best ways to find undetected STD infection is to screen patients during annual exams and to find, test, and treat the partners of people who are positive. The STD Program maintains a screening collaborative with 68 public clinics across Iowa targeting those most at risk for adverse outcomes of undetected infection. In both the public and private sectors, the STD Program offers technical assistance for sexual health program development, promotes clinician/patient dialogue about STD prevention, and ensures proper testing and treatment of exposed partners. Did you know? About 75% of reported chlamydial infections and about 65% of reported gonorrhea infections are found in young Iowans ages 15 to 24. Why is STD Prevention important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? STD cases have increased steadily over the last ten years. The increases may have many causes, but much of it is due to cases that are not diagnosed until one partner has already infected others. Early testing and treatment is important. In more than half of STD infections like Chlamydia , gonorrhea, and certain stages of syphilis, there are no symptoms, yet there can be internal damage that is irreversible. National studies suggest that every dollar spent on STD education and prevention saves an estimated $43 on complications that can lead to hospitalization, surgery, infertility, and death. What do we do? Provide funding for testing supplies and patient and provider education at 70 STD testing sites across Iowa. Offer confidential partner notification and counseling statewide to inform persons who might not otherwise know they have been exposed to an STD. Provide treatment medications at no expense to Iowans with STDs to stop the spread of disease. Monitor the number of reportable STD cases and types of risk behaviors, so that appropriate educational programs and community outreach can occur. Offer technical assistance to clinics, hospitals, and laboratories to ensure correct identification, treatment, and follow- up care of STD patients. Identify and contain STD outbreaks to prevent further spread of infection. Develop and enforce legislation, rules, and policies to address emerging trends in STD infection transmission. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Prevent epidemics & the spread of disease Strengthen the public health infrastructure Promote healthy behaviors Page 107 How do we measure our progress? /g110 Percent of all reported infectious cases of syphilis located by state and local disease prevention specialists (DPS) within seven working days. /g111 Percent of all reported cases of gonorrhea located by state and local DPS within 14 working days. /g112 Percent of all priority** cases of Chlamydia located by state and local DPS within 14 working days. Data Source: STD surveillance program and Iowa Disease Surveillance System. Data are available monthly and sent to state DPS and local health department clinic supervisors. ** Due to the high volume of Chlamydia cases, not all are located. Priority cases include those under age 18, pregnant, seen in an E.R., co-infected with another STD, re-infected, not treated by the provider , and/or specifically requested by the provider. How are we doing? Better collaboration with medical providers and laboratories, combined with better use of the Internet to locate persons in need of services, allowed for improvements in the number of persons with syphilis located within 7 days. The ability to find persons with gonorrhea continues to improve for the same reasons. A steady increase in the number of Chlamydia cases, coupled with a decrease in resources to investigate these cases, has prompted the STD Prevention Program to assign only certain priority cases to public health investigators for follow-up. What can Iowans do to help? 1. Promote abstinence-based, medically accurate, comprehensive sexual education for youth. Sharing correct and complete information with those most at risk for infection has been shown to help those persons make different decisions about the behaviors that put them at risk. 2. Iowans of all ages should use safer sex practices, such as choosing only one partner and knowing them well; regularly and correctly using latex condoms; or refraining from sex completely. 3. Iowans at risk of getting an STD should be tested, and, if necessary, treated for STDs. To learn what puts you at risk for an STD, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/HivStdHep /. 4. Health care providers, correctional systems, and edu cational systems should contact the IDPH STD Prevention Program at 515-281-3031 to get information about STD prevention.

Finding a licensed and qualified treatment program should not be. The department's Bureau of Substance Abuse licenses substance abuse and problem gambling programs to help ensure Iowans receive quality treatment. Did you know? Iowa currently has 115 licensed substance abuse assessment and treatment programs, with services available to residents of every county. Eleven of those programs are funded to provide substance abuse treatment and problem gambling treatment services statewide. Why is regulating Substance Abuse & Gambling Treatment Programs important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Addiction to substances and problem gambling affect the health, family relationships, and employment of too many Iowans. Addiction sometimes leads to problems with the law. Substance abuse and problem gambling impact all Iowans. In 2010, 46,808 Iowans who contacted an addictions professional for an assessment were admitted to some level of treatment. 548 Iowans were admitted to gambling treatment. Iowa has experienced an epidemic of methamphetamine abuse. Over 5,000 Iowans entered treatment because of meth use in 2010. Alcohol continues to be the most abuse substance for Iowans. Marijuana is the second most common drug of abuse. Iowa law requires licensing of substance abuse and gambling treatment programs. What do we do? Onsite licensing inspections of substance abuse and problem gambling treatment programs to assure they meet rules and regulations Complaint investigations an d recommendations to the State Board of Health Substance Abuse Problem Gambling Program Committee for possible discipline. Technical assistance to substance abuse and problem gambling treatment programs on operating and evaluating their services.

At age 8, he chased frogs, played baseball, and loved cookies. But at age 12, he quit sports and made new friends his parents didn't like. At age 17, he quit school. At age 21, he was in jail. What happened? Drugs. Abuse and illegal use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs ch anges a person; not only causing health problems and heartbreak, but also costing Iowans money. Research from Iowa State University shows that every $1 invested in overall prevention services yields a return of almost $10. In terms of addiction, every $1 dedicated to drug and alcohol prevention saves $7-10 in costs of crime, incarceration, emergency room care, productivity, and premature death. Maybe \"Josh\" didn't know about the dangers of using drugs or alcohol. Maybe he didn't know there were other ways to deal with the challenges every teenager faces. Maybe he didn't know that most teenagers choose not to use alcohol and other drugs. Maybe if he'd received and understood substance abuse prevention messages, his life would have been different. The IDPH Substance Abuse Prevention program strives to stop the pain and cost of substance abuse by preventing it from ever starting. Did you know? Substance abuse is related to many serious health and social problems. At least 72 health problems that require hospitalization are caused completely or in part by substance abuse. Why is Substance Abuse Prevention important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Substance abuse and related problems are among society's most far- reaching health and social concerns. About 100,000 people in the U.S. die each year because of alcohol. It costs every person in the U.S. nearly $1,000 each year for health care, law enforcement, motor vehicle crashes, crime, and lost productivity due to substance abuse. Prevention wor ks! According to the Iowa Youth Survey, the percentage of high school juniors who report binge drinking decreased from 41% in 1999 to 25% in 2010. In addition, the percentage of 11th grade students who used alcohol in the past 30 days decreased from 48% in 1999 to 32% in 2010. What do we do? Fund organizations that use proven prevention programs to increase abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs by people under age 21. Fund organizations to utilize the Strategic Prevention Framework which is a five- step planning process that assists communities in addressing substance abuse issues. Fund proven prevention programs that focus on out-of- school youth development opportunities for ages 5 to 18. Fund coalitions to prevent or reduce substance abuse in communities. Fund mentoring programs certified by the Iowa Mentoring Partnership to provide or support local mentoring services.

Mary was homeless, unemployed, and facing criminal charges. She had lost custody of her child who was in foster care. She was fighting the disease of alcoholism. Today, after receiving primary treatment and ongoing aftercare through a substance abuse treatment program, Mary rejoices in her successes: over one year of sobriety, stable housing, full-time employment, and reunification with her daughter. During Mary's recovery, Access to Recovery assisted by providing her with transportation so she could get to recovery support services and by purchasing clothing to wear for job interviews. Over the past three years, the IDPH Division of Behavioral Health has been working to transition addiction services to a Recovery-Oriented System of Care (ROSC). To be effective, this system of care must be a partnership encompassing community partners, prevention and treatment providers, the recovery community, and other stakeholders. Did you know? In 2011, nearly 2,000 Iowans attended the National Recovery Month Event at Adventureland Amusement Park near Des Moines. Why is access to Substance Abuse Recovery important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? As effective as good prevention is, it can't stop all addiction from occurring. And when addiction does occur, it is a chronic illness that requires a long-term recovery process. Just some of the barriers to seeking treatment and successfully working through a program of recovery include /g57child care /g57co-pays /g57sober living activities /g57housing assistance /g57integrated therapy /g57transportation Access to Recovery (ATR) helps people in recovery by funding these and other support services. Iowa is an ATR grantee. What do we do? Over 50 providers across the state participate in the Access to Recovery program, offering recovery support services to eligible Iowans. Recovery Peer Coaching is a new and valued service in Iowa. Individuals in recovery are matched with a coach who is experienced with successful recovery techniques and can provide assistance and guidance. Recovery- Oriented System of Care trainings are being offered throughout the state. Recovery Calls are another form of support offered in Iowa. Individuals working a recovery program can choose to have Recovery Calls providers contact them each week basis to check-in and offer support and referral. Through a partnership with ATR providers and Iowa Drug Courts, a pilot project has been developed to assist in meeting the recovery needs of this population. For the last several years, State and local celebration events have been held for National Recovery Month in September. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

One of the requirements of the ATR project is to complete Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) Interviews. The data collected are extremely valuable in determining the effectiveness of our program. The full GPRA interview process includes an initial interview, which provides a baseline of a client's history and behaviors. As the individual continues involvement in ATR, addi tional interviews are completed at discharge and during a specific follow-up window of 5-8 months after admission.

Did you know? In Iowa, 55% of substance use disorder clients served reported alcohol as the most common primary substance used, followed by marijuana at 26%, and methamphetamine at 9.6%. (Data Source: IDPH Central Data Repository, State Fiscal Year 2011) Why is Substance Abuse Treatment important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Substance use disorders and related problems are among society's most far-reaching health and social concerns. Every year, nearly 50,000 Iowans seek substance abuse assessment and treatment services through an IDPH-licensed program. According to the National Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 90% of people in the U.S. who experience substance abuse problems and need treatment do not perceive the need for care. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2009) identified Iowa as one of 10 states with the highest reported binge drinking. In 2009, approximately one-quarter of Iowa traffic fatalities (93) involved an \"alcohol-involved driver.\" What do we do?

She was depressed and withdrawn and lacked self confidence. Looking back, the high school junior says she wasn't serious about her declarations, but the emotion behind such statements was real. \"She seemed to hold things inside, and I could barely get her to talk,\" said her mother, Jennie. \"She always looked like she was going to cry.\" Things are different now. Molly, 16, has dyed her hair coppery red and lost at least 40 pounds. More importantly, she's made friends. \"Now, I don't want to cry,\" she said. The family ties Molly's transformation to TeenScreen, a program developed by Columbia University to identify kids who may be at risk for suicide, and the therapy sessions she started after school counselors identified her as at-risk in ninth grade. Wi th a federal grant that brought TeenScreen to schools across the state, Iowa officials hope Molly's story will become more common and that the number of suicides, the second-highest killer of teens in Iowa after vehicle accidents, will decrease. - Based on an article by Alison Gowans from the Cedar Rapids newspaper, The Gazette (November 2007). Did you know? Suicide was the 2nd leading cause of death for Iowans ages 15 to 40 from 2002-2007. Why is Youth Suicide Prevention important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Suicide is not only the 2nd leading cause of death for Iowans ages 15 to 40; it results in thousands of friends and families left behind to try to make sense of their loved one's tragic death. For every suicide death, there are an estimated 25 suicide attempts. For youth, the ratio is even higher. In the 2010 Iowa Youth Survey, 6% of 11th grade females and 4% of 11th grade males admitted to attempting suicide in the past 12 months. Suicide is a preventable cause of tragic death and injury. It is estimated that 90% of those who died by suicide had a diagnosable mental health problem such as depression or bi-polar disorder. What do we do? Provide information about symptoms of depression and warning signs for suicide. Provide resources for Iowans on suicide and prevention strategies. Reduce the stigma associated with suicide, mental illness, and seeking help. Develop suicide prevention strategies, with partners, in schools and communities. Support efforts to reach out to survivors of suicide (those left behind). Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

Current smoking rates among high school students have dropped from 32% in 1999 to 16% in 2010. Because of these declines, 84,850 fewer kids alive today in Iowa will grow up to be addicted adult smokers and 72,610 fewer of today's residents in Iowa will ultimately die prematurely from smoking. In addition, by prompting current adult and youth smokers to quit, Iowa has locked in enormous savings over the lifetimes of each person stopped from future smoking. The substantial ongoing improvements in public health from the smoking declines detailed above have saved $3.1 billion in future health care costs and $400.8 million in future Medicaid costs. Did you know? New tobacco products, called \"dissolvables,\" look like mints, breath strips and toothpicks. Why is Tobacco Use Prevention and Control important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death of Iowans. More than 4,400 Iowa adults die each year from smoking and as many as 66,000 kids now under 18 and alive in Iowa will ultimately die prematurely from smoking. Smoking increases the risk of cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema. Smoking causes coronary heart disease, Iowa's leading cause of death. Annual healthcare costs directly caused by smoking are now $1.01 billion in Iowa. Iowa Medicaid covers approximately $301 million of these costs. What do we do? Forty-one Community Partnerships are funded to do tobacco prevention and control activities at the local level covering 89 counties. For more information, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/tobacco . Provide resources and information about the Iowa Smokefree Air Act at www.IowaSmokefreeAir.gov and 1- 888- 944-2247. Support Quitline Iowa (1-800-784-8669), which provides free, effective counseling to help Iowans quit using tobacco. Collaborate with other state agencies to enforce laws prohibiting tobacco sales to minors and to enforce the Smokefree Air Act through education and compliance checks.

The Toxicology Program at IDPH provides health consultations evaluating the health significance of exposures to chemicals and substances associated with environmentally contaminated areas, outside air, surface and drinking water, and any other sources of exposure to potentially toxic substances in the environment. The Toxicology Program at IDPH is a resource for all citizens in the State of Iowa. In addition, the Toxicology Program at IDPH assists other state agencies such as the Iowa Department of Natural Resources in the establishment of environmental standards. IDPH also provides funding to the Iowa Statewide Poison Control Center, which works to reduce illness, deaths, and costs associated with poisoning through providing statewide around-the-clock emergency telephone advice. Did you know? Several factors play a key role in whether you will get sick from a chemical exposure. These factors are - the type of chemical, the amount of chemical, the duration of exposure (how long the exposure was), and the frequency of exposure (how many times you were exposed). If you prevent exposure to chemicals, you won't get sick or have any harmful effects on your health. Why is Toxicology programming important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Improper management of hazardous wastes, chemical spills and accidents, and previous industrial use of land may expose Iowans to dangerous chemicals. Iowans are concerned about environmental exposures to chemicals that can affect their health or the health of their children. Iowans need trusted health informat ion to prevent harmful exposures and disease-related exposures to toxic substances. People of all ages are at risk of exposure to poisons. 52% of Iowans exposed to poisons are children. What do we do? Prepare health assessments and health consultations for state and federal agencies and for communities. Develop fact sheets and informational documents for state agencies and communities summarizing health effects from exposure to specific sites and specific chemicals. Provide reliable medical information for healthcare providers and the public. Provide advice and information to local officials, medical professionals, and the public about potential chemical exposures during natural disasters or other emergencies. Work with the Department of Natural Resources to monitor recreational lakes and beaches for blue-green algal blooms and track cases of human illness related to exposure to these blooms.

Data are available annually. How are we doing? We have been meeting the goals set by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) for this program. We continue to meet with the public to discuss health assess ments and consultations. We attempt to provide fact sheets with each consultation and for other special situations. Chemical fact sheets are being developed that discuss exposure to common chemicals and chemicals of special concern. Three out of four poisoning cases can be managed safely at home. This is the primary economic benefit of the Poison Center, saving millions of dollars in unnecessary health care costs. What can Iowans do to help? 1. All Iowans can learn about existing or potential exposure to hazardous chemicals and how to protect themselves. 2. Physicians and healthcare providers need to get accurate information about the health risks from exposure to environmental chemicals and how these exposures can be diagnosed in their patients. For more information, go to www.atsdr.cdc.gov . 3. Industry and emergency response workers can learn how to prevent chemical spills by going to www.chemsafety.gov . 4.

Archeologists have found mummies with signs of it. Your grandparents or great- grandparents called it \"consumption.\" Today, we know the disease as tuberculosis, or TB. Althoug h an ancient disease, it's still around and the Iowa Department of Public Health's Tuberculosis Control program continues the fight against TB. You may not know that Christmas Seals were introduced to help raise funds to fight TB. The organization that pioneered the Christmas Seals, the National Tuberculosis Association, became what's now known as the American Lung Association. Less than two decades ago, Iowa averaged 65 TB cases each year. Now, through the efforts of the TB Control program, the number of cases has fallen to an annual average of 44 cases. Did you know? Patients who do not take their medications correctly or who are improperly treated can develop a virtually untreatable form of TB. Why is the TB Control program important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? Tuberculosis remains a public health problem in Iowa with an average of 44 cases reported each year. Thousands of Iowans are diagnosed with latent TB infection each year. Latent TB infection (LTBI) can lead to future cases of TB disease. Infectious cases of TB must be treated to prevent others from becoming infected. What do we do? Provide funding for local health departments to give TB tests, treatment, and chest x-rays for TB patients. Provide funding for the University of Iowa Hygienic Lab to perform TB testing. Maintain a system to ensure positive TB lab tests are reported to IDPH for surveillance and disease investigation. Advise healthcare providers who evaluate and treat Iowans with TB and LTBI. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve? Prevent epidemics & the spread of disease Strengthen the public health infrastructure Promote healthy behaviors Page 123 How do we measure our progress? /g110 Percent of patients with newly diagnosed TB, for whom therapy for one year or less is indicated, who complete therapy within 12 months. Data Source: CDC software program - Tuberculosis Information Management System. Data are compiled annually, but possibly not complete until 9 months into the next year. How are we doing? Iowa consistently meets or exceeds the national program objective of 90%. Completion of therapy for patients with infectious TB is assured by local health departments providing directly observed therapy (DOT). This means a designated health care worker watches the patient take each dose of medication. This is the only way to ensure completion of therapy and thus stop the transmission of disease. DOT is the standard of care in the most effective TB control programs in the country. The TB Control Program provides incentive funding to local public health departments to perform DOT. Consequences of incomplete therapy include: /g120 treatment failure, /g120 relapse, and /g120 multiple drug tuberculosis (MDR-TB). /g111 Percent of contacts to sputum AFB-smear positive TB cases evaluated for infection and disease. Data Source: CDC software program - Tuberculosis Information Management System. Data are compiled annually, but possibly not complete until 9 months into the next year. How are we doing? Iowa prioritizes the evaluation of those with recent and significant exposure to infectious TB and is above the national average for this objective. All infectious cases require a contact investigation by the local health department to identify contacts who: /g120Have TB disease so that they can be given treatment and further transmission can be stopped. /g120Have Latent TB Infection (LTBI) so that they can be given treatment for LTBI, and active disease can be prevented. What can Iowans do to help? 1. Maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially when visiting other countries where TB is common. For more information, go to wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-TB.aspx . 2. Local public health should follow recognized standards when caring for TB patients. For more information, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/adper/tb_control.asp . 3.

In the past, staff would have written her off as 'non-compliant.' Instead, the clinic nurse gently probed about what was preventing her from making scheduled appointments. The nurse discovered that the client's boyfriend had been locking her in their apartment so she could not leave. They talked with the young woman about her boyfriend's behavior and the impact it could have on her health and risk for pregnancy. The staff's attitude became more positive and supportive of the client as opposed to judgmental and closed. The client was more willing to talk about options for interpersonal safety with the health care staff. IDPH violence prevention programs seek to reduce the rate of injury and death from intentional violence, especially suicide, domestic, and sexual violence. By supporting prevention programs and conducting professional training, communities are better able to recognize, appropriately intervene, and prevent further violence. Did you know? Intentional injuries, such as interpersonal violence and suicide, are among the leading causes of death and injury for younger Iowans. People exposed to interpersonal violence and other adverse conditions in childhood are more likely to experience depression, substance abuse, and other health problems later in life. Why is Violence Prevention important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? An average of 19 Iowans die each year due to domestic violence homicides or suicides. One in five Iowa women will experience physical violence by an intimate partner and one in 10 will experience sexual violence in their lifetimes. Men also experience this, but at much lower rates. Children who see violence often suffer the consequences later in life, such as increased substance use, mental health problems, and other chronic health conditions. Research has shown that preventing the first act of sexual or domestic violence can stop the cycle of violence that often occurs in families and high-risk populations like women and low-income Iowans. Public health methods are effective in preventing violence through community involvement, education, and challenging the beliefs and habits that support violence. What do we do? Analyze violence data (including domestic abuse homicides and suicides) and release reports on violence prevention issues. Provide training and technical assistance to identify, assess, intervene, report, and document domestic violence and sexual assault for healthcare providers and other community professionals. Coordinate public information campaigns to change social beliefs that contribute to violence. Provide funding, training, and technical assistance for targeted prevention campaigns aimed at individuals, organizations, and communities. Make recommendations to state officials, agencies, and community leaders on how to prevent violence. Which Iowa Public Health Goals are we working to achieve?

For some Iowans, that means buying a used car instead of a new one. But for others, the decision may be between paying the rent and buying food. The IDPH WIC program ensures that some of the most vulnerable Iowans \u2014 low-income pregnant , breastfeeding, or postpartum women and their children up to age five \u2014 never have to go without good nutrition. WIC services are the gateway to good health. Families looking for help with food through WIC also find access to other services such as prenatal care, well-child care, immunizations, lead screening, and many others that help families stay healthy. Through WIC, all Iowa children and their mothers have access to a healthy start. Did you know? Each month, the Iowa WIC Program serves approxi mately 71,000 women, infants, and children, which is approximately 88% of those estimated to be eligible for services. Why is WIC important to promoting and protecting the health of Iowans? More than 45% of infants born in Iowa receive WIC. One in every three pregnant women in Iowa receives WIC. Nearly one in five children in Iowa between ages 1 and 5 participates in WIC. WIC strengthens families by influencing lifetime nutrition and health behaviors. The WIC program coordinates services with many other programs including prenatal and postpartum care, well child care, immunizations, lead poisoning prevention programs, early intervention services, child care, Head Start, hawk-i , breastfeeding support, parenting education programs, food assistance programs, and more. What do we do? Provide access to nutrient-rich foods. Offer nutrition education and support in making positive behavior changes in diet and physical activity. Provide breastfeeding education and support. Make referrals for health care and social services. Offer community- based services through 20 local contractors. Improve access to Iowa grown fruits and vegetables through the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Project (in cooperation with the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship). Stimulate the Iowa economy by buying over $46 million dollars of food from more than 650 Iowa grocery stores and pharmacies that accept WIC checks for the prescribed supplemental foods. Support Iowa agriculture by providing supplemental foods produced in the state (milk, fruit juice, whole wheat bread, and eggs). Provide statistics to local, state, and federal public health programs and organizations to monitor the nutrition and health status of women, infants, and children.

Data Source: CDC Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance Data. Data are available annually with the release determined by CDC priorities. How are we doing? Initiation rates continue to increase slowly, just as the rates for all Iowa infants are increasing. Of all Iowa infants born in 2007 , 74% of were ever breastfed (Data Source: National Immunization Survey). Duration rates have increased, but at a much slower pace. Duration rates are particularly a challenge because Iowa has the highest rate of maternal employment for families with children under age 6. The women served by WIC are also more likely to work in places that do not support breastfeeding. Of all Iowa infants born in 2007, 42 % were still being breastfed at 6 months of age (Data Source: National Immunization Survey). What can Iowans do to help? 1. All Iowans can promote and support breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is the best way to feed healthy newborns. To learn more about breastfeeding, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/wic/breastfeeding.asp x. 2. All Iowans can refer potentially eligible families to WIC. For more information about WIC, go to www.idph.state.ia.us/wic/families.aspx . 3.All Iowans can provide information about WIC services in your community.
