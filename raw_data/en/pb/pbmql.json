Advances in medicine and technology are astounding, nonetheless the critical elements of our well begin are often quite basic and holistic. Although we treat individual conditions with individual therapies, we recognize that many aspects of our lives interrelate with others including but not limited to: - Stress - Sleep - Diet - Nutrition - Exercise Unraveling these relationships may change how discomfort from fibroids is perceived by individual women. Women with mild symptoms on watchful waiting or those who desire holistic approaches are welcomed by the UCLA Fibroid Treatment Program. By modifying many of these factors with any combination of nutrition and lifestyle counseling, vitamin and herbal supplements, homeopathy and bodywork therapies, symptoms may be decreased or even eliminated. For example, nutritional modifications such as a decrease in the intake of inflammatory foods (caffeine, alcohol, processed junk foods) and environmental hormones (red meats and dairy products with estrogens) with an increase in the intake of anti-inflammatory foods, whole fiber and organic foods may improve symptoms. This can be performed with lifestyle modification, the use of herbal supplements and/or procedures like acupuncture, to decrease or eliminate fibroid related symptoms. These approaches can also be complementary to traditional allopathic medical and surgical approaches including watchful waiting, MRgFUS, UFE and robotic surgery. The UCLA Uterine Fibroid Treatment Program recognizes that this approach is valuable for many patients and may decrease the need for medical, surgical and radiological therapies. We help women desiring these approaches to find a suitable practitioner to address these needs. Of course, the decision to have any form of treatment is an individual one. We just want you to know there are alternative treatment methods and physicians who may help you. We encourage you to understand your options and make a treatment choice that's comfortable for you. "}
