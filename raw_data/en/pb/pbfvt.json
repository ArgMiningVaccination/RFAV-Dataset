My name is Liz Vitale and I'm a practitioner of East Asian medicine in Pacific City, on the beautiful Oregon Coast. Our clinic is located on unceded land of the Nestucca Tribe. Acupuncture and natural medicine have been practiced for thousands of years, refined by physicians as they passed their healing arts down through the generations. My approach to practicing East Asian medicine tends towards gentleness, reflecting the knowledge that our bodies are incredibly capable of healing themselves, given appropriate stimulus and space. The myriad interconnections within us and among us, including our environment, mean that healing one part is not separate from healing the whole. A small shift in one system can lead to a sea change. I value working with diverse communities - people of all ages, cultures, and walks of life. I have experience in treating a variety of conditions from acute pain to chronic disease, including autoimmune conditions, mental & emotional health, sports injuries, digestive & gastrointestinal issues, respiratory complaints, skin conditions and gynecology. A typical treatment may include acupuncture, craniosacral therapy, and an herbal formula to continue the healing process until your next visit. I am a licensed acupuncturist with a Masters of Science degree from the National University of Natural Medicine and went on to complete a residency at their teaching clinic in Portland, Oregon. My undergraduate education in Art History & Archaeology still inspires me to attentively and reverently explore the depths and search for patterns. When it comes to health, this means that I am always working towards treating the root cause of imbalance, which can lead to lasting relief from symptoms. Originally from New York, I moved west to study medicine and now find myself at home on the Oregon Coast. Black Lives Matter. All Black Lives Matter. I aim to provide compassionate care in a way that is inclusive of all LGBTQIA2S, all BIPOC, and people of all abilities and sizes. Your first visit is $150, which is one hour and includes the initial intake & treatment. All follow-up treatments are $125. As far as insurance goes, I'm in network with Regence BCBS of Oregon, and with our local OHP care organization, Columbia Pacific, here in Tillamook County. I can also bill insurance for MVAs once you have a claim number. For all other insurance, I'm an out-of-network provider and can provide a detailed receipt (superbill) which you can submit directly to your health insurance company for reimbursement.

I am fully vaccinated and wear a mask, and require all patients wear a mask regardless of vaccination status. If you prefer a phone or video appointment, send me a message and I would be happy to set that up. There is still so much we can do together, including a full intake with herbal, nutritional, and lifestyle recommendations.
