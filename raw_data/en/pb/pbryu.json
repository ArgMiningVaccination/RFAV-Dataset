Why were the results so devastating when European and African diseases entered the New World? While the general outcome was unmitigated suffering over two continents, why were some Native American groups less severely affected than others? What was the relationship between war and disease? i. CORE CONCEPTS: 1. THe effects of disease were so drastic because of BIOCULTURAL SYNERGISM. Both the biology of never having the illness/microbe exposure combined with their culture (burying the dead and small population size) made it really hard on indians. 2. The effect of disease varied between tribes due to GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION 3. War INCREASES the effects of disease. A shot man that gets ill dies faster than just an ill man. ii. The Native diseases of the NA were measles, smallpox, and other childhood diseases. iii. Individual Immunity = 1st exposure -> ger germs -> live through disease -> Build Antibodies -> can fight off next exposure. iv. Natives were not exposed to diseases due to population size and density. Small populations like native american tribes do not have enough kids/people to keep the virus alive; so the disease will keep coming back each generation since a childhood disease pattern will not be formed. Even if one person is able to become immune does not mean the disease will be extinct because individual immunity does not equal heredity. Immunity is not passed down, it must be acquired from each generation. v. Native American health was already in decline. vi. BIOCULTURAL SYNERGISM: the way biology and culture work together vii. Conditions affecting the likelihood of exposure: (varied between tribes) Accessibility to arriving europeans (near the Atlantic coast) Wealth that attracts europeans Trade w/ europeans or w/ infected tribes Urban population density Lack of mobility/ escape routes War: invasion, Intentional spread Quarantine traditions/ burying the dead Conversion to european lifestyle viii. Factors that affect the severity and outcome of disease: Physical conditions: a. War wounds b. Slavery c. Refugee conditions d. Starvation - horses helped natives find food. Psychological: a. Stress b. Exhaustion c. Cultural loss d. Ability to find/interpret the meaning of loss Social: a. Complex interdependent societies vulnerable to disruption and chaos b. Ability to adapt to new conditions of conquest If everyone is sick at once, fewer recover ix. Europeans were able to create a childhood disease pattern, but the natives were not. x. Conditions that affect long-term outcome after initial epidemics: Birth rate among survivors Number of survivors Cultural desire for reproduction Population density of survivors Continued contact w/ outsiders post-first-epidemic xi. Ability to adapt to post conquest conditions Physical, social, and cultural conditions. xii. CULTURAL ASPECT OF BIOLOGICAL SYNERGISM: Missionaries were also big proponents of spreading disease. God welcomes vs God rejects a. Which God is causing the problem - who is being punished for what - presents issue for missionaries b. EX [LeJune]: natives were living w/o right and wrong -> they get converted -> if they slip up, they get punished with epidemics c. EX [Juan de Sepulveda] argued that God did not want indian converts, so he sent epidemic. d. EX [Fr. Lallemant] thought missionaries spread disease-> is God so pleased with conversion that he takes them right away? Missionaries were baffled at how the natives dies so easily. b. If the major factor in the initial epidemics was the Native Americans' lack of immunity due to lack of prior exposure to Old World germs, why did these viii. The continued contact with outsiders was a big component of why the disease was so deadly. Missionaries, fleeing indians, and european fighters were the three biggest invaders of the native americans. European missionaries wrote their feelings: 1. God welcomes vs God rejects 2. Which God is causing the problem - who is being punished for what - presents issue for missionaries 3. EX [LeJune]: natives were living w/o right and wrong -> they get converted -> if they slip up, they get punished with epidemics 4. EX [Juan de Sepulveda] argued that God did not want indian converts, so he sent epidemic. 5. EX [Fr. Lallemant] thought missionaries spread disease-> is God so pleased with conversion that he takes them right away? c. Syphilis may have been an American disease brought back to Europe. Compare the effects of syphilis on European society with the effects of European diseases on Native American societies. How were the experiences similar? Why did the eventual outcomes differ? i. CORE CONCEPT 1. European disease in Native American society was MORE DESTRUCTIVE than syphilis in european society 2. They BOTH, however, were deadly, worsened with social conditions, and worsened from war and violence. 3. Outcomes differed because of the native's inability to develop the CHILDHOOD DISEASE PATTERN due to their population size and density ii. SIMILARITIES between syphilis and Smallpox: - Both proved deadly - Social conditions worsened disease - war/violence/social construction/chaos worsened disease - Syphilis, much like diseases of the native americans, spreads extremely fast. People who have syphilis often have many similar experiences to those with smallpox, including high fevers, and sores all over the body. iii. DIFFERENCES between the two: - Europeans had no external conquest w/ disease, so they recovered faster. - Europeans also had a childhood disease pattern due to their large population. This made it less of a problem for successive generations. Natives did not have this, so their successive generations continued to get the disease as first exposure. - The length of suffering is a bit different though. Those with syphillis tend to die fast, yet small pox and other diseases of the Native Americans often have prolonged periods of suffering, some up to a month. iv. Ultimately, the Europeans were able to rebound from their disease, but the natives were not largely due to population size, war, and the childhood disease pattern. v. BIOCULTURAL SYNERGISM: the way biology and culture work together vi. Biological effect - childhood disease pattern and prior exposure vii. Cultural effect - this is where the natives had trouble. They had traditions around burial as well as healing methods that inhibited them from recovery. War could also be part of this. viii. Factors that affect the severity and outcome of disease: - Physical conditions: a. War wounds b. Slavery c. Refugee conditions d. Starvation - horses helped natives find food. - Psychological: a. Stress b. Exhaustion c. Cultural loss d. Ability to find/interpret the meaning of loss - Social: a. Complex interdependent societies vulnerable to disruption and chaos b. Ability to adapt to new conditions of conquest - If everyone is sick at once, fewer recover ix. It was, however, especially to blame when militaries used disease to decimate natives. [Amherst] authorized throwing scabs and blankets at the indians as they attacked so that it would kill them when/if they went home from battle. They would also then infect their tribe with the germs. x. Some like [Bouffen] saw the native's struggle and argued that many didn't care for the new world compared to the old. xi. Others, like [Jefferson] argued that the native's survival shows their strength - the old world is decaying - the new world is vigorous. xii. One important detail that [Crosbey] noted as will I is that most diseases went from the old to new world rather than from new to old. Many more inhabitants of the New World were infected with many more varieties of disease including smallpox. Syphilis was serious to the old world, but pales in comparison to what the new world was going through on the front of disease. xiii. ii. EX [LeJune]: natives were living w/o right and wrong -> they get converted -> if they slip up, they get punished with epidemics iii. EX [Juan de Sepulveda] argued that God did not want indian converts, so he sent epidemic. iv. EX [Fr. Lallemant] thought missionaries spread disease-> is God so pleased with conversion that he takes them right away? B. Is Biology Destiny?: The \"Lessons\" of Medical History a. Many among both the Native Americans and the colonists saw the outbreak of disease in religious terms. But not all Native Americans or all colonists reacted in the same way. Why did some Native Americans see the epidemics as a reason for adopting western religion, western medicine; why did others see the same epidemics as a reason for rejecting colonial culture? Why did some Europeans disagree over who or what was to blame for the epidemics? i. CORE CONCEPTS: Native Americans had a range of conflicting opinions. THeir science was based in religion - each had logic and evidence behind it. Europeans DIFFERED in their views on epidemic spread/ who was to blame ii. 6 ways Natives responded to disease: Escape COnversion Revitalization Syncretism Resistance Fatalism iii. [Hurons] had 3 reactions Some tried to convert to christianity in hopes that God held the cure Some worshiped both old gods and God (new gods) (called syncretism) in hopes that one of the gods held the cure. Others fought by escaping and resisting conversion and clinging to their old gods because they thought they were being punished by a native disease iv. [Meiachkawa] (Huron)'s wife was notably angry at christianity for bringing the disease. v. [louskeha] claimed that christianity was the right religion and claimed to be jesus. vi. God welcomes vs God rejects Which God is causing the problem - who is being punished for what - presents issue for missionaries EX [LeJune]: natives were living w/o right and wrong -> they get converted -> if they slip up, they get punished with epidemics (spanish) EX [Juan de Sepulveda] argued that God did not want indian converts, so he sent epidemic. (spanish) EX [Fr. Lallemant] thought missionaries spread disease-> is God so pleased with conversion that he takes them right away? (french) EX [Eliot] (brit) made prodistant training school at harvard - all students died- moved it to an island - all of them die= thought god was testing ELiot (identified as Job). Also thought devil caused epidemics; denounced shamans C. Smallpox Inoculation: Medicine, Religion, Risk, and Responsibility a. Smallpox inoculation was promoted in North America by Boston clergyman Cotton Mather in 1721. It aroused a bitter debate. Try to understand why each side acted as it did, rather than simply looking for which side was more \"scientific\" or closer to modern views did advocates claim to be the benefits of inoculation? What did opponents claim to be its dangers, for the individual who underwent it, and for the rest of the community? How did supporters and opponents assess the legitimacy of risks in medicine? Why didn't statistics resolve this debate? Was the controversy seen as a conflict between science and religion? If you had 18th century knowledge and held 18th century values would you have favored or opposed inoculation; why? i. CORE CONCEPTS: The 1721 DEBATE had two sides. One side argued that INOCULATION KILLED NOBODY [Mathers]. ALTRUISM The other side argued that INOCULATION DID KILL and that RISK OF DEATH IS NOT WORTH INOCULATING. [Douglas] Inoculation was DANGEROUS FOR COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUAL Supporters saw death while inoculating as DEATH FROM OTHER CAUSES, while opposers saw those same deaths as DEATH FROM INOCULATION STATISTICS WAS NOT USED in debate because there was no MATHEMATICAL OR ETHICAL way to get them and analyse if inoculation was bad. NO, God gave us RELIGION AND SCIENCE to GO TOGETHER to teach us how to avoid avoidable suffering NO because I would feel bad for my community. ii. What did advocates claim to be the benefits of inoculation? They allow for the body to gain a bit of immunity to smallpox, in an exposure that will not harm the body as much as the typical exposure. their life, then it is ultimately up to them. Self-preservation justifies increasing the risk to innocent others in the community. v. Why didn't statistics resolve this debate? - Some of the statistics were fabricated so no one really knew what was going on. People would fabricate a death just to justify their own beliefs (EX a woman who is praying while ill after inoculation = a woman who knows she is dead and is praying for forgiveness before her death.). - Even then, when doctors came out with their official amount of deaths (typically 0-1/100), people would not believe them and they would have to specify how some of their patients had died of other causes. Even after their explanation, people were still skeptical. vi. Was the controversy seen as a conflict between science and religion? - Religion: a. Some religions felt that it was a sin to make your body sick voluntarily. b. Another argument: since the sickness was sent by God, the reaction should be in repentance and reformation. Inoculation increased the guilt of the human race since it is a rebellious act toward God's work. c. God has determined how we will die already. Getting a cure to our possible death would be taking the power out of God's hands. - Science: a. Some felt it was not unlawful to make yourself sick, but rather a duty to oneself of protection from the disease. b. Noone thought purging and other medicines of the time the people were using were sinful, so why should vaccinations be. - [Clavin] the leader of the puritans believed that epidemics were warnings to the whole community - disease is communicable punishment. GOD gave people REVELATION and REASON to prevent unnecessary suffering. D. Health and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment a. Why did Jeffersonians believe that politics can cause sickness and health? What kind of political system did they believe to be healthiest? How do their beliefs compare with modern medical concepts about the connection between politics and health? i. CORE CONCEPTS: 1. THey believed that POLITICAL = balance between FREEDOM AND ORDER; and SICKNESS id BAD SOCIAL ORDER. If you have bad balance, it can cause sickness, if you have good balance, you are well. 2. REPUBLICAN LIBERTY and PUBLIC AUTONOMY (free gov) is the best form of government. - ENLIGHTENED LIBERTY (only for white men) 3. They believe the SOME - bad politics = bad health ii. Why did Jeffersonians believe that politics can cause sickness and health? - Jeffersonians, in general, saw politics as good for society, mainly because it helped inspire mental stimulation which will help in longevity for life. - They also were able to have their views heard through the party system, which made each member of society feel heard by the political leaders running the country and creating the laws they must abide by. - However, politics can become bad. - [Jefferson] foreshadowed in a letter to [Adams] that the political parties will continue to become more polarized. Jefferson argued that this polarization was not healthy for the country. - Moreover, Jefferson believed in a balance focused on nature. If one got too disconnected from nature, and too far into the political sphere, it would not be good for their health. Overall though, I believe Jefferson thought politics did more good for promoting health than bad. - [Jefferson] and [Rush] believed sickness was bad social order. Politics was the balance between freedom and order iii. What kind of political system did they believe to be healthiest? - [Jefferson] believed in a strong federal government with a democracy for the people. - He was very much a constitutionalist, so he believed that, if we follow the constitution, the country would flourish. - He was, most notably, against monarchy. He explicitly stated this in the reading for class, saying that (paraphrased) monarchy would fall apart and the American democracy will continue. - He also believed that America must stay an egalitarian society, where agriculture, and thus, nature is the focus. Through this, America will be able to stay grounded. - THe Concept of Natural Laws (Saying the universe is 1. Predictable 2. Understandable 3. Automatic 4. Consistent) was the basis for his beliefs. iv. How do their beliefs compare with modern medical concepts about the connection between politics and health? x. IMMIGRATION #: 1% pop growth per year till 1850s. Cities like NYC then doubled every 20yrs. Majority of NYC were foreign born by 1860. Majority of US still rural xi. NO COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT due to hatred of the poor. xii. Modern day treatment is an IV of clean water to cleanse the body. Corolea was a geographical disease. xiii. [Rosenburg] argues that pandemics were caused by breakdown of old town government xiv. [Stevin Smith] founded american public health society xv. [Griskem] saw the need for cleanliness in the midst of the ruckus brought about by urban growth. Either you need to pass laws forcing people to clean or have the city clean the garbage b. What was blamed for causing cholera, what was done to prevent it, and how did the answers to those questions change from 1832-1866? What role did statistics and probability play in assessing who and what was responsible? i. CORE CONCEPTS: - 1832= sick individual was blamed, and the disease was supernatural (God sent it intentionally) - 1849= The community was to blame and the disease was still supernatural - 1866= The community was to blame, but natural laws caused it. - STATISTICS studied comparative death rates which helped us learn where the disease was coming from - The blame shifted from INDIVIDUAL BLAME to COLLECTIVE BLAME as well as it coming from SUPERNATURAL CAUSES to NATURAL CAUSES ii. The blame: iii. exposure- eat drink human feces from a previous Cholera victim; \"Germ theory\" grew in reliance as time passed. This theory helped support the importance of sanitary. iv. People like [Rosenburg] and [WALKER} blamed the indivisual, saying they were lazy, idle, filthy snobs, sinners, catholics, stupid, and have bad eating habits. v. Others like [Silvester Gram] attributed no infection to hygiene, and felt it was the individual's job to have a good regimen (remnants of [Galen]) He was a vegetarian and abstinent from alcohol. vi. Gram inspired others like {CW Post] and [Khelogs]. They all capitalized off their beliefs (Gram Crackers, Grape nuts, and flaked corn diet) vii. As time went on, it shifted from the individual to the collective blame. [Griskem] (ahead of his time) believed it was the community at fault for not promoting hygiene and not cleaning after the poor who cannot clan themselves. viii. 1866- the health board was created based on belief in collective blame/ ix. People who believed in SUPERNATURAL; 1. Unpredictable, awesome-frightening, concerned, caring, mercy possible - GOD gives you punishment for disease x. People who believed in NATURAL: (1866) - Predictable, controllable, awesome-wonderful, remote, unfeeling, unforgiven - Burn your finger - God created fire to teach you not to burn it. xi. Statistics were created for 2 reasons: - New math made it easier to evaluate who is getting sick - New faith that disease follows predictable patterns - patterns reveal causes xii. [John Snow] GRAPHED where cases clustered - most on broad street. He removed the pump handle and with that, he cured the area. xiii. Statichians believed that cholera was mostly toward the migrants and minorities - primitive - No stats controls, raw #s, spotty reporting and cover up, self deception/bias. c. How did Griscom and Walker disagree over whether individuals or government were most responsible for preventing disease? What evidence and logic was there for each side in the 19th century? Do these two sources fit Rosenberg's chronology of when ideas about responsibility changed? i. CORE CONCEPTS: 1. Grimson and Walker disagreed over whether the INDIVIDUAL VS COLLECTIVE blame 2. STATISTICS were the evidence for the INDIVIDUAL vs COLLECTIVE debate 3. WALKER represents 1832 VIEWS ON I vs C and GRIMSEN represents 1866 views ii. Griscom vs. Walker: iii. sanitary conditions of the city iv. [Walker]- Individual: if one does not clean or eat properly, he is violating God's law/ it is a sin to be sick. v. The blame: vi. exposure- eat drink human feces from a previous Cholera victim; \"Germ theory\" grew in reliance as time passed. This theory helped support the importance of sanitary. vii. People like [Rosenburg] and [WALKER} blamed the indivisual, saying they were lazy, idle, filthy snobs, sinners, catholics, stupid, and have bad eating habits. viii. Others like [Silvester Gram] attributed no infection to hygiene, and felt it was the individual's job to have a good regimen (remnants of [Galen]) He was a vegetarian and abstinent from alcohol. - Unpredictable, awesome-frightening, concerned, caring, mercy possible - GOD gives you punishment for disease iii. People who believed in NATURAL: (1866) - Predictable, controllable, awesome-wonderful, remote, unfeeling, unforgiven - Burn your finger - God created fire to teach you not to burn it. iv. In 1832, people saw supernatural as the main cause of disease. THey blamed the individual for the disease. v. People like [Rosenburg] and [WALKER} blamed the indivisual, saying they were lazy, idle, filthy snobs, sinners, catholics, stupid, and have bad eating habits. vi. In 1866, the shift happened that there was a belief in natural law, where God created the world and we caused the endemic. THis belief that disease is predictable and controllable gave rise to STATISTICS which helped cure disease. vii. As time went on, it shifted from the individual to the collective blame. [Griskem] (ahead of his time) believed it was the community at fault for not promoting hygiene and not cleaning after the poor who cannot clan themselves. viii. [John Snow] GRAPHED where cases clustered - most on broad street. He removed the pump handle and with that, he cured the area. ix. Statichians believed that cholera was mostly toward the migrants and minorities - primitive x. No stats controls, raw #s, spotty reporting and cover up, self deception/bias. xi. In 1849, the general belief was in SUPERNATURAL and COMMUNITY BLAME. So it is possible that you can not believe in the individual and still believe in the supernatural xii. Attributing disease to natural laws does not necessarily mean community action. If everyone blames the individual for disease, then they attribute the responsibility of fixing it to the individual. THis makes it very hard to form a lasting health board with enough funding, since many saw it as not a community problem. xiii. How did Griscom and Walker disagree over whether individuals or government were most responsible for preventing disease? - Griscom: a. The poor are the most affected by this illness due to i. Principle of tenantage- no comfort, convenience or health. Becomes dirty because tenants always moving and there is never anyone to clean their messes. ii. No Ventilation- deficiency of water iii. The cellars- dark, smelly, lots of grime b. HE wants inspections of these places for cleanliness. c. Sickness is the fault of the environment, not the poor. It is the government's duty to fix this. 2. Walker a. Sickness is a sin against physical law done by the individual. Therefore, it is the individual's job to fix it so he may not sin. xiv. What evidence and logic was there for each side in the 19th century? G: The evidence of the garbage and crowded communities affecting those near them and making them more susceptible to chorola than others. Also, Water pollution is a big one. W: supported by faith at the time. Many viewed chorola as God's retribution on the sinful. Therefore, if you were sick with chorola (the sickness of sinners), then you have sinned. It is your fault. That is why chorola hospitals were not great places to die. It was like a scourge on your name. This also is an explanation for the wealthy dying. If the wealthy dies, then he had a secret vice. Walker was enforced by most religious of the time, while G. was enforced by the physicians. xv. Do these two sources fit Rosenberg's chronology of when ideas about responsibility changed? G.'s explanation of the causes of chorola represent the 1845 outbreaks quite well. Most people blamed the tenant living more than the individual's sin. W. wrote his piece in 1861. xvi. How did religion relate to ideas about responsibility for disease? Those who were more christian had the disease affect them less. Many believed this was God's way of purifying the human race. Therefore, things like the national fast day were proposed to the president. Religious groups, however, were divided on this issue. The president believed that, so to uphold the freedom of religion in the amendments of the constitution, a national day of prayer would be an oversight. Some other religious groups insisted on the importance of combating this disease. Therefore, it was a split issue, but most believed the disease came from God and, thus, will be taken from the world by God once the dirty and vile people were gone from the earth. xvii. Did people who believed diseases like cholera were a supernatural punishment from God always blame the individual behavior of the victims? Not always. \"New York seemed especially vulnerable, the largest and filthiest, the most crowded and vice disfigured of american cities\" (17). Catholic hospitals, catholic schools, catholic health programs [Catherine Mcally] created the sisters of Mary vii. African American DIFFERENT from Irish Blacks welcome link of public health and antislavery [James Smith] MD from U of Edinburgh - trained in statistics - showed effect of poverty and conditions - black abolitionist Like US born whites: a. Blacks compete with immigrants for jobs and status b. Blacks blame immigrants for bringing cholera C. Professionalism and the Risks of Treatment a. How and why did 19th century physicians disagree over the use of dangerous treatments? How did their positions compared to earlier views on risk expressed in the 1721 debate over smallpox inoculation? How did the development of statistics and probability change the way doctors judged the benefits and dangers of medical treatments? i. CORE CONCEPTS: Physicians disagreed over dangerous treatments because of DIFFERENCES IN IDEOLOGY and showed their disagreements by splitting into 5 SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT 1721 debate was all about ASSESSING RISK and those assessments were DIFFERENT between DIFFERENT PHYSICIANS, just like 1721 STATS allowed doctors to assess the EFFECTIVENESS of a treatment ii. Dangerous treatments: Heroic- extreme risks necessary a. {RUSH] use of bloodletting is considered heroic (not by him, by the observer. Nihilist- no risk justified, even if it means no treatment conservative- take risks only if the probability of benefit is statistically greater than the probability of harm iii. MAIN SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT: ALLOPATHS- used treatments to COUNTERACT symptoms HOMEOPATHS- Used treatments to INCREASE symptoms HYDROPATHS- Used WATER (steam, ice etc) for all symptoms THOMSONIAN - Used HERBS and WATER for all symptoms ECLECTIC - Used SOME OF EACH iv. 1721: Debate on whether or not inoculation did damage [Douglas] anti inoculation - was more of a nihilist (NOT self proclaimed) he also used bloodletting, so it depended on the sickness {Mathers] pro Inoculation - inoculation never killed in his mind, so he used heroic methods (NOT self proclaimed Heroic) v. How and why did 19th century physicians disagree over the use of dangerous treatments? 1. The 19th century physicians disagreed over the use of dangerous medication by splitting their views up into three different classes: a. Heroic: Approved of use of dangerous medication. b. Nihilist: Never use any remedy that causes harm or is capable of doing so c. Conservative: Use remedy that does the most good for the most people - some may be hurt but it's ok. 2. The people that believed in the use of dangerous methods (Heroics) argued that the medical remedy must be more extreme than the disease. This, in their view, was the only way to eradicate the disease. The Nihilist directly opposed this view, since they believed extreme measures were morally wrong and could never be implemented due to the risk of loss of life, which heroics accepted as part of treatment. Lastly, conservative medicine believed if the medics could prevent the disease from taking life, it was their moral obligation to do so, even with the risk of loss of life. THeir belief was that inaction was worse than no action in the moral sense. THey disagreed over the dangers of medicine because, at the time, it was taking lives, so it was a major issue. vi. How did their positions compared to earlier views on risk expressed in the 1721 debate over smallpox inoculation? - I believe their views translate to this debate quite nicely. Mathers, who was pro-inoculation, did deny that there were deaths due to that medicine, but I believe he still would have been a heroic or a conservative. He did approve of extreme measures of inoculation, and he also believed in the use of inoculation since the benefit exceeds the probability of harm. THerefore, he has undertones of both views. Davis, on the other hand, most likely identified as a nihilist most due to his beliefs against inoculation. He believed that any chance of harm or risk to life was unacceptable. THerefore, through this analysis, the arguments of the 19th century translate well to the 1721 debate. THe only difference is the 19th century created names denoting the school of thought one ascribed to, where as in the 1721 debate, the only names were pro and anti inoculation. vii. How did the development of statistics and probability change the way doctors judged the benefits and dangers of medical treatments? - Statistics revolutionized the use of remedies in the 19th century. Created by [Pierre Louis], statistics \"enabled doctors to measure the survival rates of patients with and without medical therapy\" (Pernick 14). This allowed doctors to assess the effectiveness of a Exam 1 His 284 Study Guide "}
