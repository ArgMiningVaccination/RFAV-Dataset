Chapter 16.03.10, Medicaid Enhanced Benefits, has rate increases resulting from two years of negotiations with providers. Sarah Clendenon , Health Freedom Idaho (HFI), testified in opposition to Omnibus Docket No. 16-0000-1900 . The terminology change to \"student\" is not defined in code. Child protection services (CPS) investigations done before any charges are made against the parents ignores their rights and religious beliefs, causing traumatic exams for the children. Miste Karlfeldt , HFI, testified in opposition to Omnibus Docket No. 16-0000-1900 . Chapter 16.06.01 Section 0101.01 provides federal funding to fast track parental rights removal to place children in foster care and adopt them out to strangers.

Jinny Peterson , HFI, testified in opposition to Omnibus Docket No. 16-0000-1900 , sharing her concerns regarding the DHW circumventing the legislative process.

Ms. Prisock agreed to send the committee a summary of the public meeting comments. Barbara Parshly , Idaho Citizen, testified in opposition to Omnibus Docket No. 16-0000-1900F . The herd immunity concept was coined in 1933 for measle patterns when less than 69% of the children had developed a natural immunity , not referring to vaccinations.

Quarterly meetings refine the standards manual to provide EMS best practice procedures. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0202-1901. Motion carried by voice vote. DOCKET NO. 19-0101-1900F: Susan Miller , Executive Director , Idaho Board of Dentistry (IBOD), presented Omnibus Docket No. 19-0101-1900F , the reauthorization of existing agency rules in line with the Red T ape Reduction Act. Changes include expiration of the telehealth radius requirement and much of the dental assistant rules. The dental assistant supervising dentist was given delegation responsibility . Sections were combined and dental sedation was simplified. Fees and continuing education were placed into tables. T aylor W ilkins, Dental Director , Marimn Health, testified in support of Docket No. 19-0101-1900F . As has been experienced in other states, dental therapy is a safe and ef fective care delivery model. The dental therapist in the clinic has provided the culturally-confident piece of the model for their patients. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . Chairman W agoner declared Rule 80 stating a possible conflict of interest but that he would be voting on the docket. MOTION: Rep. W ood made a motion to approve Omnibus Docket No. 19-0101-1900F . Motion carried by voice vote. Chairman W agoner requested he be recorded as voting NA Y . DOCKET NO. 19-0101-1901: Susan Miller , Executive Director , Idaho Board of Dentistry (IBOD), presented Docket No. 19-0101-1901 , which are promulgated rules for dental therapists. The scope of practice includes a limited practice location within or contiguous to a tribal location. After a stakeholder impasse occurred regarding the duties and associated supervision levels, the IBOD adopted the collaborative practice agreement (CP A) as a bridge. The CP A allows the supervising dentist, practicing within the same facility , to determine the permitted duties based on the dental therapist's training, skills, and abilities. A copy of the CP A could be required for cause or during an of fice inspection. Class III mobility extractions are allowed under general supervision or at a higher supervision level, as specified in the CP A. This is the easiest extraction and is part of the dental therapist's training. Any complications following extraction would be addressed in a treatment plan and anticipated prior to the extraction. These rules allow the dental therapists to practice their profession while protecting public safety . T aylor W ilkins, Dental Director , Marimn Health, testified in support of Docket No. 19-0101-1901 . This is a safe and ef fective care delivery model with the CP A as a key part of the safety . He explained how the tribal member dental therapist bridges the cultural sensitivity so patients receive better care and are more satisfied. Answering questions, Dr . W ilkins explained there is a dentist on staf f during their clinic's hours. Any CP A he makes is predicated upon his comfort level with the dental therapist and would be updated as needed. Extractions could be set under any of the three allowed levels. Dentists review cases prior to procedure authorization. T yrel Stevenson , Legislative Director , Coeur d'Alene T ribe, testified in support of Docket No. 19-0101-1901 . This new profession is based on a federal model under the Indian Health Services (IHS) and is a CP A model. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Federal T orte Claims Act (FTCA), and the GAP insurance plans combine to impact providers, services, and general supervision within the clinics and contiguous locations. MOTION: Rep. Burns made a motion to approve Docket No. 19-0101-1901 . SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to approve Docket No. 19-0101-1901 with the exception of Section 036, Subsection 04.b , which will be rejected. Responding to committee questions, Mr . Stevenson said dentists inspecting, examining, and diagnosing before and during every procedure, is a conflict with the goal to address the cultural barrier and resulting high decay rate. The community members' degree of discomfort with someone who is dif ferent than themselves keeps them from getting care. Dental therapists are part of the community , provide the cultural trust, and free the dentists to work at the top of their scope. AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. W ood made a motion to approve Docket No. 19-0101-1901 with the exception of Section 035 and Section 036, Subsection 04.b , which will be rejected. Elizabeth Criner , Idaho State Dental Association (ISDA), testified in opposition to Docket No. 19-0101-1901 , Sections 035 and 036, which do not reflect the content of the law for appropriate supervision levels for each authorized service or procedure. A national standard does not exist, and there are varying models in other states. Although a site visit is scheduled for March, a Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) accredited program is not guaranteed for this year . T wo states successfully use the CP A, very detailed scopes of practice, and very detailed language for the CP A both in rule and law . A CP A was not delegated in this code to assure the IBOD would outline specific procedures. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE W ednesday , January 15, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 If a patient requires additional procedures during an extraction, beyond the dental therapist's scope, it is important to have a dentist in the building to assure the community standard of care is maintained. For this new provider type and to make the Alaska model very successful, more work is required to assure the rule provides appropriate parameters to protect patient safety and provide clear guidance. John Kris , Dentist, testified in support of Docket No. 19-0101-1901 . He stated the program is important to access of care. However , explicit rules and guidelines for dental therapists are needed to assure success. Dr . Steve Bruce , ISDA, testified in opposition to Docket No. 19-0101-1901 , sharing his concerns about the limited scope of practice gray areas, such as performing unstipulated procedures. There is time to do this right to assure this program works well. T im Olsen, Representative, Nez Perce T ribe, testified in support of Docket No. 19-0101-1901 . The current rule is an ef fort to provide regulation and meet the opposition half way . Legislation next year can get more specific. Carolyn Brammer , Member , IBOD, Dental Hygienist, testified in support of Docket No. 19-0101-1901 . The required graduation from a CODA approved program assures public safety , although there are currently no accredited programs. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . Chairman W agoner declared Rule 80 stating a possible conflict of interest but that he would be voting on the docket. VOTE ON MOTION: Roll call vote was requested.

WASDEN The Honorable Fred S. Martin Idaho State Senator 3672 Tumbleweed Place Boise, ID 83713 Re: Constitutionality of IDAP A Provisions , Child and Family Services Dear Senator Martin: You have inquired about the constitutionality under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of IDAPA 16.06.01.559.01 and 16.06.01.559.02. The Idaho Legislature has clearly placed the authority and responsibility to investigate reports of child abuse, abandonment, and neglect in the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Idaho Code \u00a7 16-1631. The Depaiiment' s rules provide guidance on how those assessments should be conducted. IDAPA 16.06.01.559.01 and .02. Neither provision violates the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments on their face. However, the rules implicate some Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protections against unwanted state interference in parent-child relationships that have been acknowledged by the courts. See Kirkpatrick v. Cy. Of Washoe, 843 F.3d 784, 788 (9th Cir. 2016). Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment ensures freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. Two elements must be established for a Fomih Amendment violation: there must be government conduct that amounts to a search or seizure, and if so, then that conduct must be unreasonable. See Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 409-10 (2005). A search \"occurs when the government violates a subjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.\" Kyllo v. U.S., 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001). A seizure is government conduct that restrains one's libe1iy \"by means of physical force or show of authority.\" Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386,395 n. 10 (1989), In determining whether an interview constitutes a seizure, a court must determine whether a reasonable person would have believed he was free to leave. U.S. v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544,554 (1980). The comis consider factors such as the number of officers P.O. Box 83720, Boise, Idaho 83720-0010 Telephone: (208) 334-2400, FAX: (208) 854-8071 Located at 700 W. Jefferson Street, Suite 21 O Senator Fred S. Maiiin September 30, 2019 Page 2 present, whether weapons were displayed, whether the officer's demeanor or voice implied compliance was compelled, and whether person was advised of the right to terminate the interview. Id. The United States Supreme Court has not yet addressed what factors to consider for a social worker's interview of a child in a child abuse investigation, but lower comis have considered the child's age, education, mental development, sophistication and familiarity with the interview process. Aguilera v. Baca, 510 F.3d 1161, 1169-1170 (9th Cir. 2007); see also Doe v. Heck, 327 F.3d 492, 510 (7th Cir. 2003)(comi found seizure where no reasonable child would have believed he was free to leave when removed from classroom escorted by school personnel and interviewed by caseworkers and an officer for 20 minutes). Even if one assumes the first element is established -that interview of a child or parent amounts to a search or seizure -the mere fact of questioning does not establish the second element of unreasonableness. Thus, inquiry into whether a Child Protection social worker's interview has violated a child's or parent's Fourth Amendment rights requires examination of the facts and circumstances of that interview. Neither the United States Supreme Comi nor the Ninth Circuit have addressed when a seizure of a child in the context of a child abuse investigation is unreasonable. An interview based on exigent circumstances would not be unreasonable. Arguably, an interview based on reasonable suspicion of abuse may be reasonable, as federal court cases finding an unreasonable seizure have relied on findings that the social worker lacked a reasonable aiiiculable suspicion of child abuse. See Dees v. Cy. of San Diego, 302 F.Supp.3d 1168, 1180-81 (S.D. Cal 2017); Phillips v. Cy of Orange, 894 F.Supp.2d 345, 365-366 (S.D.N.Y 2012). Fourteenth Amendment The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees substantive due process; no one shall be deprived of life, libe1iy, or property without due process oflaw. In the child protection context, a parent's interest in the \"care, custody, and management of their child\" is a \"fundamental libe1iy interest protected by the Fomieenth Amendment.\" Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982); State v. Doe, 144 Idaho 839, 842 (2007). However, this libe1iy interest is \"limited by the government's compelling interest in protecting a minor child.\" Dees, 302 F.Supp.3d at 1180-81. The \"right to family integrity clearly does not include a constitutional right to be free from child abuse investigations.\" Id. at 1181 ( other citations omitted). Most Fourteenth Amendment challenges have arisen in the context of a child's removal from parental custody or directing medical care of a child contrary to parents' wishes. To state a claim for a Fomieenth Amendment due process violation, one must show that state action \"shocks the conscience\" or conduct is in \"conscious or reckless disregard of the consequences.\" Id. Some courts have found that a state official's seizure and subsequent interview of a minor on school grounds without judicial authorization, parental consent, or exigent circumstances amounted to unconstitutional interference with the parent-child relationship. See Williams v. Cy of San Diego, 2017 WL 6541251 at *7-8 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2017). However, not all courts agree that a mere investigation does not infringe on a parent's Fomieenth Amendment Senator Fred S. Maiiin September 30, 2019 Page 3 right. Doe v. Heck, 327 F.3d at 524; but see Barber v. Miller, 809 F.3d 840, 847 (6th Cir. 2015)(mere investigation into child abuse does not infringe on parents' Fourteenth Amendment rights, so protections for in-school interview of child were not clearly established). But again, as under a Fourth Amendment analysis, one must consider the facts and circumstances of a child protection social worker's interview of a child or parent to assess whether a substantive due process violation has occurred. The fact of an interview, by itself, does not establish a constitutional violation. Conclusion For these reasons, it is my assessment that if challenged, a court would find IDAPA 16.06.01.559.01 and .02 do not on their face run afoul of the Fourth or Fomieenth Amendments. Where a particular interview by a social worker is challenged, a court will consider the exigency of circumstances, the reasonable perceptions of the child or parent, the reasonable suspicion on which abuse allegations is based, the perceived freedom of the interviewee to not be interviewed, and other factors. If you have other questions or concerns or would like to otherwise discuss possible amendments to the rules to help avoid constitutional challenges, please feel free to contact me.

H 31 1: Blake Brumfield , Program Manager , Developmental Disabilities (DD) Crisis Prevention and Court Services Program, Division of Community and Family Services, DHW , presented H 31 1 . The designated evaluation committee members for court-ordered Developmental Disability (DD) evaluations are a social worker , a psychologist, and a physician, with specific legal training. This legislation will allow licensed professional counselors (LPC) to serve interchangeably with social workers in this capacity . The change will share duties with existing trained and credentialed DHW LPC staf f, relieving the current workload. H 31 1 also allows medically licensed independent practitioners serve in place of the physician on guardianship and conservatorship evaluations for the evaluation committees. This will address the physician member shortage, particularly for specialized populations evaluations. The changes will improve the DHW's ability to recruit and provide a multi-disciplinary team for the evaluation committees. Additionally , the quality and quantity of court-ordered assessments will be improved with the discipline expansion. Answering committee questions, Mr . Brumfield explained the staf f LPCs have been trained in clinical assessments and social history . The discipline dif ferences for clinical psychologists prohibit such an interchange. Richelle T ierney , Policy Analyst, Council on DD, testified in support of H 31 1 . Replacing a licensed practitioner is one solution to a common problem when trying to find rural physicians to serve on the committees. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify .

H 312: Ericka Rupp , Program Manager Licensing, DHW , presented H 312 , with changes based on provider input. A new standard requires a disaster preparedness plan, including processes and procedures for evacuation and relocation of children during an emergency . Health inspections are increased to annually . Criminal history background checks are changed to every five years. Current pediatric CPR and first aid training is required. A new transportation standard requires providers use proper safety restraints when transporting children. Safe sleep, another new standard, requires providers practice safe sleep for infants under twelve months. The current four hours of annual provider training is increased to twelve hours.

Following the end of the session, the sign-in sheet will be filed with the minutes in the Legislative Services Library . Chairman W ood called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. H 317: Kelley Packer , Bureau Chief, Idaho Bureau of Occupational Licenses (IBOL), presented H 317 , which is a rewrite of the outdated Optometric Physician Licensing Act, consistent with other regulated professions and occupations. The scope of practice expansion stipulate the specified laser surgical procedures can be done once examination and experience requirements are met. Attestations from universities show the current scope of training includes the procedures. Licensure provides guardrails to assure the optometrists are working within their scope of practice. An exclusionary procedure list is included in the legislation. The optometric profession is asking for personal responsibility and accountability through their board. Answering a question, Ms. Packer clarified one of the six states with similar legislation has allowed these procedures for twenty years. Dr . Nathan W elch , Board Certified Opthamologist, President, Idaho Society of Opthalmology , testified in opposition to H 317 . The proposed surgical procedures allow eye surgery by non-surgeons and non-medical physicians. There is currently no backlog of laser procedures and no need for this expansion. Dr . W elch cited an Oklahoma study which indicated once optometrists were permitted, the procedure availability did not increase. In fact, patients were often encouraged to travel past an optholmologist's of fice to an optometrist's of fice to maintain the care network. Of the similar bills proposed in twenty-one states, nineteen states have rejected the legislation. A year-long V ermont study could not conclude optometrists are properly trained to perform the advanced procedures. The U.S. Department of V eteran Af fairs announced only optholmologists will be permitted to perform therapeutic laser procedures in all states. The legislation allows successful performance of only five supervised procedures, not five surgeries for each type of procedure. This is inadequate to assure competency . Dr . W elch agreed regarding the need to update and modernize the statute, but without scope of practice expansion. The exclusion list would allow many unlisted surgeries to be done by non-surgeons. Responding to committee questions, Dr . W elch stated the exclusion list was given to the IBOL with the intent of further discussions and final approval, which did not happen. An optholmologist has four years of medical school, followed by hospital internship, and three years in a clinic with physician oversight. Since the billing code is the same, the procedure costs would also be the same. There are currently three types of therapeutic lasers. The open ended nature of this legislation does not protect against use of any laser developed in the future. It is important to recognize the disease stage and appropriate type of treatment or procedure. In some instances urgent surgical intervention is required to prevent the person's sight. T estifying in opposition to H 317 were Dr . Jason Halverson , Specialist, Dr . Surgeon, Dr . Mark Miller , Optholmologist, Corneal Disease Specialist, Dr . Dr Partner , Sara Olson , Executive Director , Idaho Society of Optholmologists, Their statements included apprehension regarding resultant lower Idaho standards of care. With no exclusion for children, surgeries by untrained individuals could be done on this vulnerable population, including delicate interocular injections on newborns. While there were over 300 Medicare eye surgery procedures, there are only 32 listed exceptions in this legislation. The ability to handle complications during or after procedures is also a concern. Dr . Aaron W arner , Chairman, Idaho State Board of Optometry , testified in support of H 317 . The Red T ape Reduction Act provided the opportunity for the rewrite and stipulated inclusion of all interested parties. Ef forts to resolve concerns from opponents have led to the exclusionary list, which was given to Director Packer by representatives of the Society of Opthalmologists. The proctored live procedures, which would have typically been worked out in rules, are also included to resolve opponent concerns. The Board takes seriously the mandate to protect the public and not advocate for the profession. Idaho's optometric practice is safe and many of the procedures have been performed for years. In answer to questions, Dr . W arner explained the legislation defines the Board's disciplinary powers when the community standard of care is not met. Any procedure performed without the proper training or experience would result in action by the Board and possible lawsuits. T estifying in support of H 317 were Dr . Jack Zarybnisky , Idaho , Optometrist, Grove Eye Care, Dr . Robert Ford , Optholmologist. Their testimony included the past expansions of their scope of practice, which are now commonplace, and the presence of opposition to each expansion request. The lack of opthalmologists in many counties leads to multiple visits, as well as lengthy waiting and travel times. The exclusion list should not be included because it will never be complete. The expansion will allow some patients to have their procedures on the same day , saving time and money . The same fears regarding dilation and pharmaceutical prescriptions have proven to be unsubstantiated. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to send H 317 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Thursday , January 23, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 In closing remarks, Kelley Packer , said most of Idaho's statutes have no listing of what can or cannot be done by the professional because the boards oversee this aspect. This legislation's exclusion list, which can be updated in the future, was a compromise with the opthalmologists. The Board's disciplinary language aligns with other license governing boards. The optometrists need to be allowed to accept the responsibility and govern themselves.

For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to approve Docket No. 16-0201-1901. Motion carried by voice vote. Pat Kelly , Executive Director , Y our Health Idaho (YHI), presented the YHI annual legislative update. The key 2019 accomplishments include an enrollment of 95,000 Idahoans, with over 800 agents, brokers, and enrollment counselors. YHI has the lowest operating costs and the highest per-capita enrollment of all state-based exchanges. The 1332 Medicaid expansion waiver was crafted by YHI, Governor Little's of fice, the Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), and the Department of Insurance (DOI). With the waiver determined to be incomplete, work continued to mitigate consumer confusion, implement a seamless Medicaid transition, and provide consistent and collaborative messaging across all agencies and entities. The user experience was improved to allow available, current, or previous plans and optimize the mobile user shopping platform. Navigation of the customer dashboard was made easier . Enhanced automation was developed for American Indian, Alaska Natives, and non-traditional household use. The consumer connector training program was revamped and brought in-house. In-person training has been condensed and streamlined. T raining now includes DOI and DHW representatives. The market research outreach is focused on building awareness and partnerships with community health groups, hospital systems, and non-profits. In alignment with the overall goal of a flawless customer experience, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) continues as a measurement tool. The NPS 2019 average score was 30, which is well above industry standards. The new customer follow-up process and quality assurance metrics improve the customer experience. Seasonal team members were added incrementally prior to the 2020 open enrollment. The 2020 open enrollment data indicates there were 20,000 calls, 2,000 emails, and a 40% increase in web visits. As of December 23, 2019, 78,500 Idahoans had enrolled in Medicaid and 10,500 had enrolled in a dental plan. Over the next year , the YHI will be implementing agency portal technology to improve the agent and broker experience. Phone and ticketing systems will be updated to improve speed and ef ficiency . A separate shopping platform will be created for new products, such as enhanced short-term plans. Responding to committee questions, Mr . Kelly said prior to this year , families with Native Alaskan or American Indian members required a manual process due to their dif ferent coverage and eligibility requirements. The vision is to of fer separate Af fordable Care Act and traditional qualified health plan (QHP) options. The Medicaid eligibility notifications came from the DHW , carriers, and YHI renewal notices. The YHI stand-alone dental plans are for adults, cannot use tax credits, and require exchange medical coverage. Mr . Kelly of fered to send the committee the zero pay review , once it is completed in three to four weeks.

Davis made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 20 and 21, 2020, committee meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. H 340: Sen. Mary Souza , District 4, presented H 340 . This legislation provides an immediate way to address the rising teen drug and suicide rates in Idaho. Children under 18 years of age cannot go to crisis centers or enter adult rehabilitation programs. The Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) found only three qualifying teen programs in Idaho and their fees ranged from $10,000 to $12,000, which is prohibitive for most families. This legislation opens af fordable options by providing a licensing exemption for residential programs with temporary alcohol-drug abuse treatment for individuals age thirteen through seventeen. It does not include individuals with mental health issues or children under 13 years of age. The children's residential care facility definition excludes foster homes, residential schools, and children's camps. There is a residential limit of four-months per calendar year . Local law enforcement must be notified of the facility's existence prior to accepting any children for treatment. A health care facility with emergency medical care must be located within fifty miles. Staf f background checks are required. Prior to accepting any child for treatment, the facility must verify the child has a medical physician's prescription, the school counselor or court-appointed advocate has been notified, and a signed consent has been received for medical, surgical, substance abuse, or alcohol treatment. The facility will be reviewed by the Child Protection Legislative Review Panel (CPLRP) after two and five years of operation. The review will include a report from local law enforcement. Rep. Ron Mendive , District 3, further presented H 340 . In describing an existing three-month adult program, he emphasized the af fordable cost of such a program, the availability of scholarships, the high five-year tracking success rate, and their desire to restart a previous teen program. Over 90% of the adults who have completed or are in the program have indicated their abuse began between the ages of eleven and fifteen. Early intervention will change family dynamics and could save the prison system an estimated $55M. Answering questions, Sen. Souza said the facilities will set up their own intervals for background checks. Since staf f members may have been previously in the program, misdemeanors or felonies disclosed during background checks are expected. Every regulatory stipulation will increase the cost of the programs. The existing northern Idaho faith-based program discontinued the teen program because they did not want government interference through licensing. T eens have dif ferent treatment program needs than adults. The existing facility has separate bedroom and bathroom facilities. The legislation and the existing program in northern Idaho has agreed to provide a resource for other programs.. The Deputy Attorney General and Attorney General indicate the Jef f D. Settlement requirements do not apply to this private program because no public funds are involved. Ruth Y ork , Idaho Federation of Families, testified in opposition to H 340 , stating the head of the Idaho Sherif f's Association has indicated they can do nothing unless a crime has been committed or alleged. They cannot shut down a center . She expressed concern regarding the safeguards. The concept of a program based on religious teachings without clinical oversight is inappropriate for such a vulnerable population. Jim Baugh , Citizen, testified in opposition to H 340 . Child abuse and neglect under the Child Protection Act (CP A) only covers civil actions for abuse, neglect, and abandonment by parents and guardians. Child abuse and neglect by others are handled through criminal cases under T itle 18. The CPLRP does not deal with substance use disorder (SUD). Licensing is very important in discovering abuse and neglect, even from resident to resident, and of fers a scheme for the medically supported detoxification levels. There are no exclusion requirements for background checks and no recourse if a facility is not living up to any of the requirements. Pat Martell , Self, Clinical Social W orker , Mental Health Advocate, Idaho Federation of Families, Public Health Professional, Clinical Social W orker , testified in opposition to H 340 . Scientifically proven methods are ef fective for behavioral health issues. Assessments and plans are an integral part of any program, as are schooling, confidentiality , staf f-child ratios, family involvement, and separate dormitories. Ben Chappell , Citizen, testified in opposition to H 340 . He shared the story of his drug addiction, time in a rehabilitation facility , three years of sobriety , and work as a facilitator . The creation of a solid structured plan was very important to his recovery . Answering a committee question, He said not requiring licensure removes safeguards and structure, which are very important, especially for youth. He was around 15 years old when he first went into a rehabilitation program. Christine Pisani , Executive Director , Idaho Council on Developmental Disabilities (DD), testified in opposition to H 340 . Individuals with serious substance abuse disorders may also have complex medical or mental health conditions. The legislation does not provide an oversight agency , a way to handle non-compliance, and any staf fing guidance prior to the background check completion. Many abuse perpetrators have no convictions. Although the example program is very good, this opens Idaho up to any type of service. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , January 28, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Linda Miller , Parent, testified in opposition to H 340 , sharing her concern regarding unintended consequences. 50% to 70% of youth with substance abuse problems have also experienced trauma. Persons working with the teens need to be qualified and trained in trauma treatment methods for teens. Parents would have to share concerns with the legislature, not a state licensing board, which would be a slower process. Parents in this situation may not be informed enough to know if the facility would meet their needs. Ms. Miller , in response to committee questions, said adult mentors are a good idea as long as they are not living with the youth. She shared how panicked her family was when looking for a facility while dealing with the teen. Dr . Sheila Sturgeon Freitas, Clinical Psychologist, testified in opposition to H 340 . The programs need to include medical services, mental health services, educational services, transparency , and safety in order to provide anchors for the teens. Intervening the wrong way with children whose brains are still developing can have dire consequences. Answering a question, she said parents are desperate when they are trying to intervene against issues their kids are doing to themselves. Kathy Garrett , NAMI Idaho, testified in opposition to H 340 . There is a serious lack of youth treatment programs, especially abuse programs, even with advancements made to resolve the Jef f D. Lawsuit and the promising Y outh Empowerment Services (YES) programs. Licensing standards provide needed resident pre-screening, staf fing level minimums, staf f qualifications, resident and parental rights, complaint procedures, investigations, and other ways of protecting not only the youth, but the families and staf f. Joe Gonzalez , Idaho Parents Limited testified in opposition to H 340 . Without licensing standards, the risk factors for the children, families, Idaho, and providers increase. This type of residential treatment requires a 24-hour structured environment. A child experiencing medical and psychiatric needs along with severe alchohol/SUD puts everyone at risk. A parent could find themselves with poor outcomes and no financial recourse. Complaints within the two-year or five-year review period are not addressed. There is no ability to close down or prevent a facility from reopening under another name. Licensure will avoid such risks and ensure the best outcomes. Howard Belodoff , Citizen, Attorney , testified in opposition to H 340 . Putting 13 year-old children together with 17 year-old children is not a good policy . There are no provisions for education, children leaving, restraints, punishments, liability insurance, peer counselors, contact with parents, or background check standards. Licensure provides responsibility . Keith Y ork , Citizen, Parent, testified in opposition to H 340 . Sharing his 13 year-old son's SUD, he said they had no idea regarding what questions to ask. They have since learned SUD and mental health disorder cannot be separated. Licensing provides a level of confidence with the professional training and continued education of the staf f. Parents need this help during an emotionally devastating situation. Michelle Battin , Owner , Hopeful Connections Parenting, Consultant, T rauma Specialist, Idaho Federation of Families, testified in opposition to H 340 . The exampled faith-based program's conflict with regulatory issues appears to be the reason for this legislation. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , January 28, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 3 In closing remarks, Sen. Souza said having more meetings to figure out various regulations will ignore the desperate crisis existing now . Because of government issues and the Jef f D Lawsuit, government programs can no longer be used. The anti-traf ficking group thought this would be very helpful when removing highly addicted teens from traf ficking. Currently , the teens have no treatment options and return to traf ficking to get their substances. The doctor's prescription provides a safety determination regarding whether or not a program is appropriate for the teen. She urged the committee to give this a chance and help the kids who are in need right now . MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to send H 340 to General Orders. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to HOLD H 340 in committee. AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Zollinger made an amended substitute motion to send H 340 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation.

Lickley made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 13, 2020, committee meeting. Motion carried by voice vote. T amara Prisock , Administrator , Division of Licensing and Certification, Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), presented an update on the implementation of the Of fice of Performance Evaluation (OPE) 2018 Residential Care Report. The report focused on three of the eighteen types of facilities: nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and children's residential care facilities. The recommended children's residential care facilities' survey process improvements have been implemented. Sending more than one surveyor to large facilities to reduce the survey team's on-site time is working well. Anonymous customer feedback cards and an informal dispute resolution process have been implemented. Assisted living providers, through the OPE questionnaire, revealed inconsistencies in surveyor licensing rules interpretations. T o date, the 202 post-survey questionnaire responses have indicated no conflicts with past information given during surveys. T o support the Assisted Living T eam Supervisor , the Field Supervisor role was added, with two seasoned individuals permanently appointed. The most serious concern involved workplace issues and deteriorating provider relationships with the Long-term Care T eam, which surveys skilled nursing facilities. During a Human Resources Of fice workplace assessment, both supervisors resigned. Changes included hiring two supervisors with solid leadership skills, as well as revising both job descriptions and performance expectations. The team meets more often, with communication and collaboration barriers removed. Surveyors indicate the work environment has vastly improved. The 2018 Idaho Health Care Association (IHCA) partnership agreement included an initiative to examine and improve the survey process. T wo joint training sessions with the IHCA members have been held. A six-guiding-principle training course will be held to increase surveyors and facility staf f productivity . The OPE licensing fee recommendation has not been implemented. A work group indicated fees would further exacerbate current staf f shortage issues, which require financial signing incentives. V oluntary assisted living facility accreditation was a suggested option to relieve the Division's assisted living team's workload. As of July 1, 2019, accreditation in lieu of Department licensing surveys is available. Answering questions, Ms. Prisock , said accreditation reduces the workload by removing the quantity of surveys. The IHCA is working with the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) to allow the accreditation, provide training, and help with recruitment. Chairman W ood put the committee at ease at 9:13 a.m. The meeting was called to order at 9:14 a.m. Miren Unsworth , Administrator , Division of Family and Community Services, DHW , presented the Southwest Idaho T reatment Center (SWITC) OPE recommendations for system wide and day-to-day operations. There were two core recommendations: development of a strategic plan and formal quality improvement process; and, developing a long-term vision for the crisis care system and its role as a provider of last resort. The 2019 strategic plan addresses safety , staf fing levels, facility improvement, professional development, and quality management. A decrease in workers' compensation has occurred over the last two years, with a safety committee established to recommend additional training and equipment. A twenty-four hour response team, trained to intervene when clients are being challenged by significant behaviors, will be deployed in February . Safety ef forts have yielded a 40% decline in lost time costs and a 50% decrease in workers' compensation costs. A vital key to staf f and client safety has been maintaining the right number of direct-care staf f by moving to four ten-hour shifts. Facility changes include sensory rooms on each unit, encouraging clients to individualize their rooms, and hiring a therapeutic recreational therapist to increase client activity opportunities. This spring a therapy dog will be chosen to work with the clients. T wo staf f members have been assigned to the new extensive quality improvement program, with direct reporting to administration. Four board-certified applied BH analysts and a full-time investigator with adult protection experience have been hired. Four nursing positions have been upgraded to registered nurses. The improved discharge process allows clients to move into the community with an assigned case worker who meets monthly with SWITC staf f. The SWITC Advisory Board identified a service gap for individuals with intellectual and Development Disabilities (DD) for specialized acute and sub-acute levels of care. Ef forts to fill the gap have utilized the Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/ID) licensing structure, which SWITC has grown beyond. A proposed replacement system of care entails the creation of an observation, assessment, and stabilization unit as a short-term in-patient facility with the goal of stabilizing acute psychiatric, behavioral, and medical symptoms while preparing for future residential options. A step-down model and treatment center will be a home-like environment on a shared campus and designed for individuals preparing to return to the community but still in need of successful community living development. The focus on community capacity building helps providers serve clients who are medically fragile, have autism, or have significant communication deficits. A project plan is being developed to implement the new system of care. A report will be presented next session with a possible budget request to begin the implementation. In answer to committee questions, Ms. Unsworth explained the average SWITC client's stay is between eighteen months to two years. They anticipate all clients will be returned to the community with the new model of care and additional community supports, although some clients may need to return to SWITC during a crisis event. The goal for every client is to transition them safely and successfully back into the community . HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE W ednesday , January 29, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Matt W immer , Administrator , Division of Medicaid, DHW , presented information on Non-Emergency Medical T ransport (NEMT). This required Medicaid benefit moves individuals to and from their medical appointments. A brokerage model is used in most states, including Idaho. The current contract broker , Medical T ransportation Management (MTM), further contracts with a network of transportation providers and is paid on a per-member per-month basis. V eyo, the previous broker , terminated their contract in 2017. In March, 2018, the contract passed to MTM. During the contract broker transition there was a lot of instability and missed trips. The Joint Legislative Oversight Committee (JLOC) requested the model's ef fectiveness be examined by OPE. Delivery of information to OPE was not as timely as expected, which led to a management letter instead of a report. OPE recommended the Division strengthen its management of the risks, inherent to a capitated payment structure, through three key improvements. In response to the delivery analysis recommendation, the Division is working with an accounting firm to examine costs and analyze service utilization by geographic regions and a member eligibility category . Preliminary results are expected this week. The second recommendation was to proactively plan for annual rate adequacy reviews. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be developed to include annual use-based rate adjustments, costs, and service quality . Contract rebidding will occur in April, 2021. OPE also recommended a robust contract monitoring process. Strategic leadership changes have been made to improve accountability , ownership, oversight, and quality . W ork with managed care consultants will refine the contract monitoring and data analysis activities. The amended contract will include additional performance metrics and outline the associated financial penalties. Additionally , an independent complaint database will allow direct submission to Medicaid using a web-based customer and stakeholder submission form. The Division has taken part in a national group of states working on NEMT programs. In 2019 1,714,678 trips occurred, with an issue free rate of 99.88%. Ranging from minor to significant, escalated complaints are investigated. The current contract ends April 4, 2021. The projected RFP release is spring, 2020. Compilation of responses is expected December 2, 2020. Meetings will be held for stakeholder and provider engagement in the contract process. Best NEMT practices used in other states are being researched. Responding to committee questions, Mr . W immer stated when a trip is missed the broker is called and can schedule another trip, denoting it as an urgent trip, if necessary . The online complaint form is a real-time monitored form, allowing immediate calls to the broker . Lori W olff , Deputy Director , DHW , presented an update on Medicaid expansion, including implementation and waivers. The Expansion State Plan Amendment was approved and coverage began January 1, 2020. The four required waivers include coverage choice, work requirements, family planning services, and Idaho Behavioral Health (BH) transformation. Enrollment methods include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) re-evaluations, specialized enrollment for target populations, submitted applications, and advanced premium tax credit (APTC) renewals. The eligibility process included signed applications, information verification, eligibility notices, and the Medicaid opt-out ability . No automatic enrollment occurred. As of January 23, 2020, 60,423 individuals are enrolled in Medicaid. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE W ednesday , January 29, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 3 Additional Idaho Medicaid services include optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, dentists, and preventive health assistance. Individuals have ninety days to select their primary care provider , during which time they see any provider . If no provider is selected after the ninety days, one will be assigned. Ninety percent of Idaho primary care providers are enrolled with Idaho Medicaid. Ms. W olff explained the waiver implementation process from the draft application to the final implementation. A letter has been received on the coverage choice waiver stipulating it did not meet the federal deficit neutrality guardrails. The work requirements waiver is at the federal approval level, which takes eight to sixteen weeks. They continue to negotiate with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) regarding the family planning and IMD waivers. Once negotiations are successfully completed, the waivers will continue to the final approval process. The medicaidexpansion.idaho.gov website provides public information and will, beginning in March, share information regarding what services are being utilized by the expansion population. In response to committee questions, Ms. W olff stated there have been no additional staf f hired. Milliman was used for some of the waiver writing. Individuals can maintain their physician and existing coverage, for any reason, during the ninety-day period. Only 6% of the general population experienced their existing physician not listed under Medicaid. Few individuals opted out of the Medicaid expansion program. She agreed to send the weekly enrollment statistics to the committee.

Rep. Lickely requested she be recorded as voting NA Y . Rep. Blanksma will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 342: Rep. Blanksma , District 23, presented H 342 , which removes the audio and visual telehealth first contact requirement. Rural areas with limited broadband and telecommunication resources are positively impacted by this change. Dr . Donna Campbell , Physician, Board Certified Emergency Room Physician, Emergency Room Department Medical Director , Previously Board Certified Opthamologist, Physician and Company Expert for T eledoc, T exas State Senator , testified in support of H 342 . Citizens and providers have found telemedicine to be a good experience. Physician shortages and large areas of broadband deficits exist. Removal of the video mandates will increase patient access and improve outcomes. Phones have been used for years for treating patients. Cell phones can provide a high definition picture which can be used to treat or refer the patient. There is no data showing audio video to be a superior modality in all instances. Claudia T ucker , V ice President, Government Af fairs, T eledoc, testified in support of H 342 . This legislation removes the video first encounter requirement. The use of interactive audio allows the physician's discretion. Josh Archambault , Senior Fellow , Opportunity Solutions Project (OSP), testified in support of H 342 . Patients access more providers through telehealth in rural areas. OSP also suggests adding language and guardrails for cross-state care for providers. The provider definition could be broadened to allow clinical lab personnel or paramedics to provide telehealth services, without mandating insurer coverage. This inclusion will help patients with disabilities, including the elderly , and ease the burden on caregivers. Ken McClure , Idaho Medical Association (IMA), testified in opposition to H 342 . Having worked with the legislation's sponsors, the IMA had hoped to negotiate one change to assure the quality of care. This legislation will allow the use of emails, which could harm the quality of care by eliminating the physician talking directly to and getting to know the patient. The IMA would like the stipulation of two-way audio or audio and visual contact. Answering committee questions, Mr . McClure said the task force for the health care transformation is examining the entire statute and interested in a more robust telehealth program. The IMA would like the committee to either change this legislation or wait to see what the task force brings forth. MOTION: Rep. Christensen made a motion to send H 342 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Elizabeth Criner , Idaho State Dental Association (ISDA), testified in opposition to H 342 . The ISDA is comfortable with an audio conversation and addressing the video concern; however , they are not comfortable with the use of email. Dentistry is a hands-on activity and is using telehealth successfully to help patients who have limited access, chronic conditions, or special needs. Many oral health diagnoses cannot be done using high definition pictures or cameras. In response to committee questions, Ms. Criner stated the ISDA concerns could be addressed if two-way audio or two-way audio video were required when establishing the provider-patient relationship. This legislation is not just for physicians. T elehealth is used between dentists and dental hygienists in extended access settings. Francoise Cleveland , Director of Advocacy , AARP Idaho, testified in support of H 342 . This legislation provides new ways to access care and reduce transportation issues. Mobile devices are gaining popularity for tracking and providing health information. This legislation continues to allow more innovations, fewer barriers, increased patient choice, and the ability for providers to help patients. For the record no one indicated their desire to testify . HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Thursday , January 30, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Rep. Blanksma , in closing, said rather than wait for the task force, we can correct one issue with this legislation. Providers are trained in how to establish patient relationships. The telecommunication methods need to be left open in order to adapt to quickly changing technology and provide options for rural areas. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to send H 342 to General Orders. Motion failed by voice vote.

H 351: Matt W immer , Division Administrator , Division of Medicaid, Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), presented H 351 , which addresses two challenges for Medicaid reimbursements. The first challenge is to manage Medicaid spending by reducing general fund needs for state fiscal years (SFYs) 2020 and 2021, as requested by the governor . This will be accomplished through hospital payment reductions and temporary nursing facility assessment increases. The second challenge is to improve Medicaid budget management. Idaho is the last state with a cost-based payment methodology . With Medicaid expansion in place, the SFY cost of $850M would increase to nearly one billion dollars in combined state and federal spending. By changing the payment basis, the Department can ef fectively manage the costs and give ultimate growth control to the Legislature. Nursing facility budgets will be set at the beginning of each fiscal year , ef fective July , 2021. The nursing facility assessment will increase by approximately $1.8M, SFY 2020, and $5M, SFY 2021. T emporary assessment rate increases will draw down federal dollars to of fset the assessment increase. Limitations are removed for institutions for mental diseases (IMDs), which are freestanding psychiatric hospitals with more than sixteen beds, to allow a temporarily reduced Medicaid payment rate. Reimbursements for out-of-state IMDs are established at 95% of cost and state-owned hospitals are set at 100% of cost. The Department is directed to reduce hospital general fund reimbursements by $3.1M in SFY 2020 and $8.7M in SFY 2021. The Department is also directed to work with hospitals to establish a value-based payment method, ef fective July , 2021, and set a budget before the start of each fiscal year . An emergency clause provides this legislation to be ef fective immediately in order to achieve the SFY 2020 spending reductions. Answering committee questions, Mr . W immer said they are moving cautiously with the IMD changes to keep from impacting the IMD waiver . They will work with the hospitals to determine an equitable reduction. Reimbursement costs are based on those annually reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who also verifies the costs. The federal government sets a cost ceiling equal to Medicare payments for the same services. There are Medicaid access requirements for rate submission. Steve LaFort , Chairman, Idaho Health Care Association (IHCA), Legislative Committee, Director of Operations, Cascadia Health Care, testified in support of H 351 . The competitive labor market and wage increases have created tight nursing facility operating budgets. This temporary loss of reimbursement funds is manageable while the new payment program is being developed. The IHCA is committed to assisting in this process. For the record no one else indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Davis made a motion to send H 351 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Committee discussion included the expenditure system change. Concern was expressed regarding resulting Medicaid supplementals. If done right, the health care system will assume financial responsibility for their product and be sustainable. Costs shifting to other rate payers was also a concern. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send H 351 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Christensen and Zollinger requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . Chairman W ood will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 339: Emily Hunter , Risch Pisca, Representing the Idaho Physical Therapy Association, presented H 339 . The original Physical Therapy Practice Act specifies the dry needling course be determined by the federation of state boards of physical therapy or another nationally recognized accrediting body . No such boards or accrediting body exists. This legislation removes that requirement and gives the Physical Therapy Licensure Board the authority to determine which courses meet their standards. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to send H 339 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send H 339 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Lickley will sponsor the bill on the floor . RS 27415: Rep. Caroline Nilsson T roy , District 5, presented RS 27415 . Idaho has been a site targeted by the opioid distributors. This proposed memorial thanks our Congressional Delegation for their support of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act. It requests the President and Idaho's Congressional Delegation continue their ef forts to strengthen sanctions against opioid traf fickers. MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to introduce RS 27415. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 27545: Emily McClure , Idaho Medical Association, presented RS 27545 . Previous civil liability limitations protected physicians volunteering at free clinics and health screening events. The proposed legislation extends the limited liability protection to other health care professionals and supervised students. If the provider is a student, recipients must be notified and sign a release. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , February 03, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 MOTION: Rep.

Motion carried by voice vote. H 386: Pam Eaton , President, CEO, Idaho Retailers Association and Idaho State Pharmacy Association, presented H 386 . Prescription Benefit Managers (PBMs), third party administrators, contract to manage prescription drug programs. The current PBM practices have led to the need for transparency and fair business practices. This legislation requires annual PBM registration with the Department of Insurance (DOI), using existing processes. The registration fee is $80. Gag clauses are prohibited to allow pharmacists to inform patients how to pay less for prescriptions. T ransparency is ensured for maximum allowable costs (MAC) determinations and regular price change updates are required. Retroactive claim denial or reduction of reimbursements, except for legitimate reasons, are prohibited. This provides transparency over regulation and recognizes the unusual retail channel of pharmacies. Answering committee questions, Ms. Eaton said the existing DOI process is used for other healthcare and prescription entities. If issues arise the pharmacy can contact the DOI, who would then contact the PBM. Similar legislation in other states shows a positive impact for pharmacies and their ability to stay in business. Patients with mail order prescriptions turn to their pharmacists when they have questions. Larry Johnson , CVS Health, testified in opposition to H 386 , expressing concerns regarding the low percentage of interactions this impacts, unclear registration language, the fee limit, inadequate amount of time listed for reimbursement claims, and the ef fect on performance contracts. T im Olson , American Health Insurance Plans, testified they are neutral to H 386 , requesting language clarification. They agree with the concerns expressed by Larry Johnson's testimony . This is a complex issue. Anthony Hollis , Pharmacy Owner , testified in support of H 386 . He shared his experience with the PBM enrollment process, the $1,200 application fee, ten to twelve week time frame, lack of response from the enrollment department, and a call for help to Sen. Fulcher's of fice. In comparison, Medicaid enrollment took seven days and there was no fee. The resulting wait caused a delay opening his pharmacy . Answering a question, Mr . Hollis stated neither he nor Sen. Fulcher's of fice received a response, although they suddenly received their contract. Eric Schlerf , Pharmacist, Custom Rx Pharmacy , testified in support of H 386 . It used to be rare to be reimbursed for medication at a lesser amount than they paid. Now it is common, forcing pharmacies to make up the dif ference by cutting their labor force and using other methods, such as charging for deliveries. Doug Fuchs , Pharmacist, Pharmacy Owner , testified in support of H 386 . The PBM formulary lists name brands instead of generics, which may not be covered by insurance. Big pharmacies are paying to have their products on the formulary . Dif ficult to understand PBM contracts are not negotiated. The PBM-owned pharmacies can fill prescriptions at a higher quantity than allowed to independent pharmacies, with no price dif ference. Imposed refill limitations encourage customers to go to the PBM-owned pharmacies. The PBMs do not give any explanation when MAC payments are below the pharmacy's cost and not within the Star Rating. Rob Geddes , Abertsons Pharmacies, Director , Pharmacy Legislative and Regulatory Af fairs, testified in support of H 386 . These steps protect the pharmacies and assure the rural pharmacies do not become pharmacy deserts. He shared an example of two PBMs merging and changing the MAC list. The subsequent appeals would require 400 hours and two full-time employees. Claims are denied, even during the two-step submission process, without any basis or support information. MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to send H 386 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Melinda Merrill , Northwest Grocery Association, testified in support of H 386 . This strong bill has been sparsely designed on purpose. Existing processes can be used without further legislation. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify .

PLACE: Room EW20 MEMBERS: Chairman W ood, V ice Chairman outs, Lincoln County; Al Lawrence, LSO Chairman W ood called the meeting to order at 9:01 a.m. Dr . Bonnie Halpern-Felsher , Professor , Division of Adolescent Pediatrics, Stanford Medicine, Founder , Executive Director , T obacco Prevention T oolkit (TPT), presented information to the committee on what parents should know about vaping. National 2019 data indicates less than 10% usage of cigarettes by high school, which is a dramatic decline. Unfortunately , e-cigarette use has risen from 20.8% in 2018 to 27.5% in 2019. Both students and educators report the numbers are under-reported. A 2019 survey shows 48% of Idaho's high school students have used e-cigarettes at least once. The original product, introduced in 2007, looked like cigarettes, were disposable, and did not deliver much nicotine. The kids did not like and were not using them. The product's second generation were large, rechargeable pens and introduced e-liquids with flavors. T eens started to use the products. The third generation of the product can be modified and has been nicknamed Mods. The Mods create a large aerosol plum. T eens used them, but not in record numbers. The fourth generation products were pod based, high tech, high in nicotine, sleek, smaller , and easy to hide. This was more attractive to teens, whose use numbers began to rise significantly . These are called Juuls, after the main manufacturer . The fifth generation e-cigarettes are disposable and use similar technology to pods or Juuls. They are small in size and of fer a rainbow of flavors and colors. Concern has been raised regarding the environmental impact of these products. When comparing e-cigarettes to cigarettes, it is important to note they are all tobacco products, contain nicotine, and are addictive. One pack of twenty cigarettes has 8mg of nicotine, with a yield of one and a half milligrams. One Juul pod contains 59mg per milliliter (MI) of nicotine with up to 41mg of nicotine during use, which is an 80% nicotine yield. PHIX and Suorin pods contain the nicotine equivalence of 75 to 90 cigarettes. The puf f bar has one third milliliter of product and twice the amount of nicotine as a Juul. Adolescents report using one or more pods a day or week; however , they are using them 24/7 and are unaware of the amount of nicotine within each pod. T eens using one to three pods a day are receiving the same amount of nicotine as one to six packs of cigarettes each day . There are over 69 chemicals found in e-cigarettes, few of which are listed on the package. Some of the chemicals, when combined are extremely dangerous. The chemicals found in vaping products rewire and change the brain. Adolescent brains continue developing until approximately twenty-five years of age. Dr . Halpern-Felsher said everyone is born with the ability to become addicted, especially when reinforced before turning 25 years of age. E-cigarette companies, knowing this fact, have targeted young people. Research is showing a direct link between heart and lung disease or injuries with these products. E-cigarette, or V aping, product use Associated Lung Injury (EV ALI) has hospitalized approximately 2,700 people, with sixty confirmed deaths as of January 21, 2020. T eens are now coming to clinics presenting other conditions which are being linked to e-cigarette products. The size of a quarter or small paperclip, the products are easy to hide from parents, schools, law enforcement, etc. Misleading product packaging does not reflect the actual nicotine amount. T eens are unaware of addiction and what nicotine does to their bodies. There are currently 15,500 unique flavors, and counting. Research shows the teens are not interested in products without added flavors. Nicotine, as in cigarettes, has a painful hit when used, which is unappealing to teens. Juul and other products use salt-based nicotine to change the pH level and remove the harsh hit. The products produce aerosol, not vapor . Product marketing has produced youth-focused pop-up advertisements on social media and online homework tools. It is important to know where vape shops are and what they are doing. Some stores of fer student discounts. Products cost less than cigarettes and disposables cost $1 each. Legislation to keep the products away from youth until their brains develop must be enforceable at both local and state levels. There is no good evidence to indicate switching to e-cigarette products helps adults quit smoking. For every adult who quits, 80 teens are getting addicted to nicotine. Regulation as a pharmaceutical product under the FDA is required to get the products out of the hands of kids. The Federal Government required e-cigarette producers to file an authorization and none did. The FDA is banning flavored, cartridge-based, non-refillable e-cigarettes such as the Juul device. There has not been any legislation passed regarding disposables, freebase, or salt e-liquids. V ape shops must be required to have enforceable permits. E-cigarettes need to be included in all tobacco policies. Because youth are price sensitive. T axing e-cigarettes like all other tobacco products and equalizing price points will have an impact. Answering questions, Dr . Halpern-Felsher said youth are giving or selling the products to their friends. Parents are purchasing the products for gifts, unaware of what they are doing.

With approximately 40,000 current users in the registry , the current system lacks the ability to provide documents when and how they are most needed. A new bidirectional, voluntary , 24/7 web-based registry would integrate the data into the electronic record. Answering committee questions, Ms. Shaw-T ulloch explained the $500,000 ongoing cost estimate is split between the registry and outreach provider training. The current basic program has no funding. This would create a patient-based, user friendly , interfaced program. MOTION: V ice Chairman W agoner made a motion to introduce RS 27496. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 27554: RS 27554 is presented by Kalli Y oung, and Jake Mesecher a consortium of students, Eagle High School. Kalli Falck explained RS 27554 prohibits smoking and vaping in a vehicle in the presence of minors, with a secondary of fence citation fee of $75. Children, whose brains and bodies are more susceptible to the product toxins, are also vulnerable because they are either unaware of the dangers or do not have the voice to protect themselves. T obacco is the number one killer in Idaho. On average, children are exposed to more second-hand smoke than adults, resulting in illnesses and premature deaths. Marjorie Dehlin further presented RS 27554 , stating eight states have banned smoking in work places and in vehicles when minors are present. Exposure for as little as ten seconds can simulate asthmatic symptoms. Minors exposed to second-hand smoke are more likely to become adult users and expose their children to the same dangers. Current standards are no longer acceptable. The committee shared concerns regarding the definition of vape and the unexpected inclusion of persons inhaling medication. There was also concerns regarding the age dif ference between the smoking cessation product age and this legislation. Chairman W ood said this teaching exercise helps youth understand and be involved in the legislative process by following a piece of legislation, even if it goes to the amending order . MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to introduce RS 27554. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a substitute motion to return RS 27554 to the sponsor .

Priscilla Giddings , District 7, presented RS 27575C1 , for the prevention of blindness and disease in infants. The rule section outlines the procedures and testing to be performed. Dual sections list a misdemeanor of fence if the birthing attendant, for births at home, does not provide specified newborn screening data to the state. The DHW Director is responsible to report to the county prosecuting attorney when data is not provided. From 2009 to 2018 close to 800 home births had someone other than a doctor or midwife as the birthing attendant. Births at home are increasing due to rising costs or rural locations. The changes remove the misdemeanor of fence and the Director's reporting duty . Chairman W ood stated this section of code originates in the early 1920's and, to his knowledge, no one has been cited in modern history . MOTION: V ice Chairman W agoner made a motion to introduce RS 27575C1. Motion carried by voice vote. H 385: Kris Ellis , Idaho Health Care Association, presented H 385 , for certification of Medication Assistants. Applicants must first be Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) with education from an accredited program through the U.S. Department of Education. The certification exam must be the medication aide certification exam (MACE), which is approved by the National Council of the State Board of Nursing. There is grandfathering language for the one Idaho licensee. This will help skilled nursing facilities better serve their residents and provides another stepping stone for CNAs who may want to become a nurse. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Davis made a motion to send H 385 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep.

Davis made a motion to approve the minutes of the January 28 and 30, 2020, meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. Dave Jeppesen , Director , Idaho Department of Health and W elfare (DHW), presented the annual DHW budget update. The DHW mission is to promote and protect the health and safety of Idahoans. The vision is to provide leadership for a sustainable, integrated health and human services system. Through the course of the year the DHW will interact with over half of Idaho's population through dif ferent entities. The strategic plan, state fiscal year 2020-2024, paves the way to address the issues facing Idaho's most vulnerable citizens. The DHW staf f meets weekly to discuss each of the four plan goals in detail. The performance measure, to move the metrics as needed or complete a specific project, includes target dates. This has helped complete 34% of the plan tasks and has led to identification of new tasks. There are four strategic plan goals: Goal 1: ensure af fordable, available healthcare that works. Current legislation, H 351 , directs the hospitals, nursing facilities, and DHW to work together to establish new Medicaid reimbursement methods. State Hospital W est, an adolescent facility , has a budget request of $2,964,000 from the General Fund (GF) to address the expanding need of the facility . The expansion will free up twenty beds in State Hospital South, allowing them to meet the adult population's need. This is a start-up request with operation to begin in February or March, 2021. State funding is required until certification is received and Medicaid billing begins. Staf f will be added to this facility and the existing adolescent staf f will be retained at State Hospital South. Goal 2: protect children, youth, and vulnerable adults. The first objective is to ensure children who have experienced abuse or neglect have safe, permanent homes. This is reflected in the Child W elfare T ransformation Project budget request of $5,348,000 GF and the child welfare staf fing budget request of $198,100 GF . This project, in its third and final year , uses the child safety module to provide quick, ef fective assessments to move children to safety . Case management is the next portion to be implemented. The staf fing request addresses the need to have the right number of staf f to achieve the objectives in a timely manner . The second objective is to transform the Idaho behavioral healthcare (BH) system for adults with serious mental illness and addiction. A $500,000 GF request will assure Community Recovery Centers stay viable. Goal 3: help Idahoans become as healthy and self-suf ficient as possible. The target suicide rate reduction, 20% by 2025, is much bigger than any provider , family , community , or individual can address alone. The Idaho Suicide Prevention Collective has been successful with their robust plan to pilot a specific zero suicide prevention approach. Fourteen hospitals have been trained in the approach. Using the Sources of Strength program, the Collective has helped twenty-three schools this year . Goal 4: strengthen the public's trust and confidence in the DHW . A customer experience mapping tool tracks an individual's journey and interaction, indicating where improvements can be made, especially when crossing multiple programs. Director Jeppesen drew the committee's attention to several zero dollar line items, which may have a budget impact. These include ambulatory surgical centers, Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) re-procurement, non-emergency medical transport (NEMT) contract increases, and electronic visit verifications, which are now required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Advance Care Directive Registry $500,000 GF request addresses its move from the Secretary of State's of fice, providing direct access so the loved one's wishes are followed. The voluntary Home V isitation Program, $1,000,000 GF request, is an ongoing request. This prevention program helps individuals learn how to be parents. This is important to help persons without parenting models provide stability and keep their families together . Answering committee questions, Director Jeppesen explained the child welfare staf fing request amount includes benefits. The ambulatory surgical center rates remain less than hospitals. There is an epidemiology team, with a plan and national partners, on call and monitoring Idaho for any coronavirus outbreak. The DHW is prepared to respond quickly and ef fectively to protect Idahoans. Action to improve BH services continues, in conjunction with the Governor's executive order , the Supreme Court's proclamation, and Senate legislation, with the formation of the BH Council. The council will include thirteen cross-functional members. An advisory group will also be created with as many providers involved as possible.

John McCrostie , District 16, presented RS 27613 . This proposed legislation stipulates an Idaho licensed mental health professional shall not engage in the practice of conversion therapy , which seeks to change sexual orientation or gender identity , for anyone under eighteen years of age. Survivors of this practice are at a high risk for extreme depression, abuse of alcohol or drugs, illicit behavior , and suicide. This does not apply to clergy and religious counselors, as long as they are not acting as mental health professionals. Parental rights are protected, as long as the parents are not acting as mental health professionals. MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to introduce RS 27613 . SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep.

VOTE ON ORIGINAL MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the original motion to introduce RS 27613. Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Christensen, Blanksma, and V ander W oude requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . S 1240: Colleen Shackleford, Nurse Practitioner (NP), Committee Chairman, Nurse Practitioners of Idaho, presented S 1240 . This global signature authority bill allows NPs to practice independently and sign specified forms, normally signed by physicians, used in their medical of fices. It provides comprehensive patient care, especially where there is limited access to primary care professionals. The NP is most familiar with the patient, so requiring a physician signature is redundant, increases costs, is a duplication of ef fort, and delays care. This will allow NPs to practice at the top of their license and education. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Davis made a motion to send S 1240 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Davis will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 392: Emily McClure , Idaho Medical Association, presented H 392 to expand the civil liability limit for health professionals and students volunteering at free clinics and health screening events. Patients must be informed if the provider is a student and waive the liability . Students must also be under direct supervision of a licensed health care provider . The health care provider definition is updated, expanded, and specifies the volunteers are practicing within their scope of practice.

Strong traf ficking corridors exist through Idaho Falls and Coeur d'Alene. Melinda Smyser , Governor's Of fice of Drug Policy , testified in support of HJM 12 . Because it is absorbed through the skin, fentanyl the size of a grain of sugar can kill a person. Idaho heroin drug seizures are growing, as evidence by five large quantity heroin arrests this year . Fentanyl is used to cut heroin, create more product, and increase product strength. The absorption danger extends to first responders and the general public. As a result, the Idaho State Police (ISP) are no longer doing roadside testing. Drug prevention starts with families, individuals, and communities. Idaho needs more awareness and education of substance use. W ork is being done by her of fice to address prevention for 18 to 25 year-olds. Answering questions, Ms. Smyser said the ISP has disposal procedures which include sending product to out-of-state testing facilities. Our youth do not perceive any danger and need to be educated.

Caroline Nilsson T roy , District 5, presented RS 27680 , regarding missing or murdered indigenous people. Because indigenous women face the highest rates of violence, awareness needs to be increased. Predators may target native women and girls because they are seen as marginalized and outside of the protection of the regular legal system. This proposed legislation designates a day of awareness and supports ef forts to research and find solutions to make a dif ference to the Native American people.

The fiscal note is an estimate based on the average amount of care, health insurance, financial status, and any eligibility for state or federal programs. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 27696. Motion carried by voice vote. HJM 13: Rep. Jake Ellis , District 15, presented HJM 13 . Idahoans face restrictions and barriers when seeking help for a family member addicted to opioids. Suboxone is an ef fective method to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and is part of medication assisted treatment (MA T) programs. Removal of the access restrictions are requested of the U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, and Idaho's Congressional Delegation. Pamela Myhre , District 15 Constituent, testified in support of HJM 13 , sharing her family's struggle to find help for an addicted family member . Although a deadly illness, addiction does not receive the same treatment support as other illnesses, like cancer . Of the Idahoans suf fering from addiction, only 8% receive treatment, with only 16.8% of Idaho treatment facilities of fering MA T . This is the third worst national rate. With the help of Suboxone, her family member is no longer addicted, has a job, and has a new life. Other families have not been as lucky . This is a step to make changes and achieve better outcomes for loved ones. Rep. Ellis stated Idaho is not alone. The elimination of the X waiver is a national trend because it's restriction has caused a glitch in the federal law . Nicki Chopski , Executive Director , Board of Pharmacy , was invited to answer questions. She explained there is abuse potential with Suboxone. The long-term ef fects are similar to many of the opioids. There is an increased risk of overdose when it is combined with alcohol or other drugs. There are some warnings regarding liver issues when liver damage is an existing condition. She has been unable to find specific side ef fects from long-term bupenorphine use. The existing lack of MA T programs can lead to Suboxone diversion for individuals wanting to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Euphoric ef fects are only seen in people who use Suboxone when they do not have opioid dependencies. This product is available in long-acting injectable or implantable forms, decreasing the diversion risk. Rep. Remington commented a wrap-around program is needed to assist individuals who are no longer addicted to opioids. He was concerned the problems experienced with Methadone will be repeated with this product. MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a motion to send HJM 13 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . Answering committee questions, Rep. Ellis said the Joint Memorial is the only tool available to give a strong voice to Idaho's delegation. He hopes the Governor's of fice will take the next step through the Opioid Drug W ork Force. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send HJM 13 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep.

Chairman W ood called the meeting to order at 9:00 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to approve the minutes of the February 5, 12, and 13, 2020, meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. H 498: Rep. Britt Raybould , District 34, presented H 498 , to amend the Prevention of Minors Access to T obacco Act by including electronic smoking devices and products. This inclusion provides parity between traditional tobacco products and electronic smoking devices and products. The retail permitting process is expanded. There are no new retail taxes. T reating both traditional and electronic devices in a comparable fashion is in the best interest of individuals choosing to use the products. Erin Bennet , Government Relations Director , American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, testified in support of H 498 . This inclusion ensures under-age users do not have easy access to electronic smoking devices and provides a method to assess the impact of the devices. Outdated statistics have been removed. The tobacco products definition is updated to include electronic smoking devices and allow for medication delivery devices. Retail permitting is updated to include electronic smoking devices and the Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) is authorized to set a permit fee. All cigarette references have been updated to include electronic smoking devices. There are no new regulations and no impact to any current taxes defined in other statutes. Corey Surber , Director of Advocacy , St. Alphonsus Health System, testified in support of H 498 . The vaping youth epidemic is of great concern considering the appeal of these unregulated devices. She shared statistics and information regarding the devices, the health ef fects, and the targeted marketing techniques. Samantha Kenney , Self, Parent, testified in support of H 498 . She shared how her conversations with her daughter indicated the high number of students using vaping products and the impact to their school attendance. These products are gateways to life-long addiction and regulation is needed. Answering a question, she said some teens look or are old enough to purchase the products for their friends. Rep. Rubel commented regarding her daughter's friends, who have been able to purchase smoking devices in retail outlets since they were 15 years of age. Heather Kimmel , Director Health Promotion, W estern Division, American Lung Association, testified in support of H 498 . Research shows a 56% greater risk of heart attack, stroke, chronic asthma, and adult chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis in high school juniors and seniors has doubled. Y outh introduced to tobacco and nicotine through electronic devices are four times more likely to advance to using regular cigarettes. It is exciting to see progress to keep these products out of our youths' hands. T eresa V awter , Idaho Government Relations Director , American Cancer Society , Cancer Action Network, testified in support of H 498 . This is a straight forward bill for parity among those selling tobacco products. These are not harmless products when approximately 30% of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco use. This is of added concern as a new generation of youth become addicted to tobacco use. Pam Eaton , Idaho Retailers Association, testified in support of the concept of H 498 , although there are concerns. Idaho retailers follow the W e Card Program, with a 95% compliance rate. Recent reports indicate 86% of the youth are getting the products somewhere other than at retail stores. Their concerns include maintaining uniformity and a level playing field with taxes, fees, and regulations. She requested the section giving local units of government the opportunity to pass more stringent legislation be amended and align with other statutes. Additionally , the instructions for rules promulgation by the DHW for permits and fees will impact retailers. Answering a committee question, she said retail shops selling only vape products are not members of the Idaho Retailers Association. Alacia Handy , Human Services Program Specialist, DHW , Division of Behavioral Health, testified in support of H 498 . The current statute has two definitions, one for tobacco products and one for electronic cigarettes. As such, current oversight and inspection is only stipulated for tobacco product retailers, not for vape shops or retailers selling only vape products. T aylor Jepson , High School Student, American Heart Association, testified in support of H 498 . Many of her friends, who are vaping, would not smoke cigarettes because they are neither cool nor taste good. The vaping flavors, colors, and hi-tech design make vaping products attractive to youth. Although tobacco advertising is barred, vaping products are directly marketed through social media, targeting her generation and younger middle school students. Answering a question, Ms. Jepson explained raising taxes and fees will transfer to the consumer , increase the product cost, and impact teen access. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a motion to send H 498 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Zollinger made a substitute motion to HOLD H 498 in committee. AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made an amended substitute motion to send H 498 to General Orders. Committee discussion included agreement regarding the need for parity and inclusion of electronic smoking devices. Concern was raised regarding the fee rule promulgation without legislative review , possible competing statutes, the generality of the nicotine definition, non-inclusion of retailers in discussions, and the possibility of a new piece of legislation to address the issues. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST : Rep. Zollinger made a unanimous consent request to vote on the substitute motion before voting on the amended substitute motion.

RS 27772: Chairman W ood stated the sponsor of RS 27772 has requested removal of the proposed legislation from the agenda and committee consideration. It will be returned to the sponsor . RS 27729: Rep. Britt Raybould , District 34, presented RS 27729 . This is a comprehensive approach based on Medicaid Interim Committee discussions regarding funding the expansion population with the Catastrophic Health Care Cost (CA T) and county medical indigency programs. The medically indigent adjusted gross income is updated to 133% of the federal poverty limit (FPL), ef fective upon passage of this proposed legislation. The county medical indigency program will continue to accept applications for six months and adjudicate for an additional six months before it ceases to function. The CA T Program will be suspended on June 20, 2021, although it will continue to handle existing transactions. Within the next eighteen months both programs will cease to be operational. The sales-tax based formula will be implemented for a stabilized fund based on actual Medicaid enrollees. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 27729. Motion carried by voice vote. RS 27692: Rep. Jarom W agoner , District 10, presented RS 27692 , to continue the extended employment services for individuals with significant disabilities under the direction of the Department of Health and W elfare (DHW). MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 27692. Answering committee questions, Rep. W agoner said the existing program has functioned for many years and its statute language will be provided for the hearing. The currently budgeted $4.2M will be transferred to the DHW from V ocational Rehabilitation. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to introduce RS 27692. Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Davis and Chew requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . RS 27657C1: Julie Hart , Ideal Option, presented RS 27657C1 , proposed legislation to provide more treatment options for opioid and substance use disorder (SUD). The existing tools are not being deployed to maximum impact. This is an evidenced-based treatment approach and one way to address the problem. MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a motion to introduce RS 27657C1. Motion carried by voice vote. H 436: Elke Shaw-T , Administrator , DHW , presented H 436 . This legislation transfers the existing health care directive registry from the Secretary of State's of fice to the DHW . Through this move, the health care directive registry will continue to document an individual's end-of-life care wishes using a bidirectional platform with easy 24/7 access for care providers. This will save on the cost of life-sustaining procedures which may not align with the patient's wish. The new directory will be combined with a robust education outreach element to increase the public's awareness of the program. The current program houses 40,000 directives which are only available during of fice hours to the individuals named on the directives. Answering committee questions, Ms. Shaw-T ulloch said this will continue to be a voluntary program. There will be no transfer filing fee for the current 40,000 participants. Other states who have not included the outreach and educational element have experienced minimal participation. Chad Houck , Chief Deputy Secretary of State, was invited to answer questions. He said the current system does not have version control. Because the Secretary of State has absorbed the operating costs into their daily operations budget, a $20,000 registry operating balance will be moved to the DHW with the registry . Keyana Deeble , Hospital, Nurse Facilitator , Honoring Choices Idaho, testified in support of H 436 . She shared how an individual's advanced care directive, produced prior to dementia and health issues, allowed the family to make confident decisions and brought them peace. Patients who have not kept copies have experienced dif ficulty and delays in care while obtaining them through the current system. Dr . Bart Hill , Former Emergency Medicine Physician, Current Chief Quality Of ficer , St. Luke' s Health System, testified in support of H 436 . In formulating this legislation, a review of successful programs in other states showed advanced care planning must be a coalition and community program with outreach to citizens. Responding to committee questions, Dr . Hill explained at the end of a life there is a disproportionate amount of cost associated with a person's care. These costs can be decreased with healthcare directives provided at the time of need. Lindsey W inters Jewel , Director , Honoring Choices Idaho, testified in support of H 436 . Medical staf fs are being trained to help patients be well-informed regarding advance directives. Standardized tools, marketing tools, and reporting are needed to measure the success of the program. Christine Gibbons , Program Coordinator , St. Alphonsus Health Care Palliative Care, testified in support of H 436 . Including an individual in their health care is important, which becomes a challenge when they may not be able to communicate. Having 24/7 access allows family members to stay at the hospital with their loved one, instead of having to go home and look for documents prepared years earlier . Francoise Cleveland , Director of Advocacy , AARP , testified in support of H 436 . No matter the age or stage of life, individuals facing end-of-life situations want a quality of life where they are heard and their wishes are respected by their health care professionals. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Thursday , February 20, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Brian Whitlock , President, Idaho Hospital Association, testified in support of H 436 . He shared how knowledge of a loved one's wishes within a state with such a registry provided comfort to his family . Without easy access to directives, the default care can be very aggressive, expensive, and beyond the patient's desire. With the DHW migration a secure, robust registry can be developed in compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIP AA) compliance. Chad Houck , Chief Deputy Secretary of State, testified the Secretary of State's of fice is 100% in support of H 436 . The original program was designed to be archival and no longer meets the needs of Idahoans. Attempting to build the current system within the Secretary of State's of fice would cost more and lead to dif ficulties with HIP AA security . This and other security issues are already addressed through other DHW programs. MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to send H 436 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a substitute motion to send H 436 to General Orders. Committee discussion included agreement regarding the need to upgrade the registry . Concerns were expressed regarding the ongoing budget request's use for education and promotion, and the amount of authority given to the DHW Sen. Steve Bair , District 31, was invited to respond to questions. Promoting directives ahead of time through television and radio advertising allows the individual and family to consider , discuss, and know their directive will be available when it is needed. Rep. Blanksma stated the usefulness of the system is not an issue in her debate, only the possibility that people within the communities are better teachers than the government.

VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send H 549 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Amador will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 519: Rep. John V ander W oude , District 22, presented H 519 . He shared the origins of this legislation, Simon's Law , and the death of an infant who had a do-not-resuscitate order (DNR) placed without his parents' knowledge. This legislation stipulates any DNR placement requires at least one parent's or legal guardian's approval, maintaining their rights. Dr . T im Johanns , Self, Neurological Surgeon, testified in support of H 519 , stating neither he nor his colleagues place DNRs without long conversations with the families. This legislation should also address medical bill payments when treatment is against the parents' wishes. MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to send H 519 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Blaine Conzatti , Director , Family Policy Alliance, Idaho, testified in support of H 519 . Parents have the right to be included in these decisions, focus on their child, and not fight with physicians over treatment. Dr . Jud Miller , Emergency Family Physician, testified in opposition to H 519 . He said any DNRs he has placed have been after many family conversations. Parents, who bring love and human bonding to the equation, must have a seat at the table and be allowed to transfer the child, if they disagree. Jackie W akefield , Legislative Assistant, Right to Life, Idaho, testified in support of H 519 . This is significant pro-life legislation. It protects parental rights, provides transparency , enhances the dignity of children with disabilities, and combats the sanctity of life ethic's erosion in our culture. T oni Lawson, V ice President, Government Relations, Idaho Hospital Association (IHA), testified in opposition to H 519 , expressing the IHA's concern with the tenor and concept of the legislation. There is an assumption of conflict between the providers and patient families, with providers not honoring parental choices. The IHA was not contacted until after the bill was introduced and have had no response regarding their questions and concerns. Any decision about medically futile care goes through a careful, deliberative review process. Mandating timelines actually eliminates parental rights. The 48-hour timeline will increase pain and suf fering for parents who have already given consent by delaying their right to carry out their decision on their own terms. This legislation is not needed. Answering questions, Ms. Lawson said the cost determination becomes complicated due to varied and high level case costs. Many code protections exist for removal of life sustaining treatment and facilities have DNR policies. Rick Bassett , Critical Care Advanced Practice Registered Nurse, testified in opposition to H 519 . This legislation introduces a component to fix a time frame for life-sustaining procedures. It introduces alternatives and medically inappropriate language with no focus on the individual needs of the children. The proposed stipulations are in conflict with existing law . Mr . Bassett , responding to questions, stated care conferences include family members and determine the child's care treatments. Ethics consultations and multiple care conferences are used when conflicts arise. Sandi Enzminger , Eagle Resident, testified in support of H 519 . She shared how St. Luke's made an evaluation of her child's life, based on her chromosomes number , threatened child protection services intervention, and asked them when they wanted a DNR implemented. After much conflict, they were given permission to take their baby home on comfort care, expressing the opinion she would die within a month. An Omaha physician agreed to perform her daughter's successful heart surgery at 4 months of age. T oday her daughter is thriving and growing just like any other baby . If they had listened to the doctors she would not be here today . Upon committee questioning, Ms. Enzminger said there was no DNR placed on her child, but they were coerced and pushed towards thinking about end of life, fed hopelessness, and were told intervention would be futile, with her death being more humane. Christian W elp , Catholic Church in Idaho, testified in support of H 519 . This legislation does not suggest Idaho doctors are placing DNRs without parental input. It is currently legal for a DNR to be put on a patient's file legally without family notification. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE W ednesday , February 26, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 David Ripley , Executive Director , Idaho Chooses Life, testified in support of H 519 . Such incidences may not be known by the parents. Intervention is one thing, but no patient should be denied food and water to expedite their demise. This legislation af firms the value of every life and assures parents their right to be involved in decisions regarding their child's life and death. Dr . Stewart Lawrence , NICU Medical Director , St. Alphonsus Hospital, Past Medical Director , St. Luke's Hospital, testified in opposition to H 519 . Placing a DNR without extensive conversation and agreement with families would be horrific and something he has not witnessed. Processes and systems exist to compel physicians to discuss a baby's issues and treatment with their families. The waiting period and resulting extraordinary levels of care could create unnecessary pain and suf fering for the babies and their families. Responding to questions, Dr . Lawrence explained families and health care providers work together as a humane and compassionate team. An ethics committee exists to assist when there is a dispute. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . Committee discussion included concern regarding compassionate care, the possibility that seventeen year olds who are ready to make a final decision are overridden by their parent, undermining parental wishes, and withdrawal of life support if a transfer is delayed. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to HOLD H 519 for time certain, March 4, 2020. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST : Rep.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST : Chairman W ood made a unanimous consent request to remove H 558 from the agenda. There being no objection, the request was granted. H 531: Julie Hart , Ideal Option, presented H 531 , telehealth legislation to address rural shortages in addiction recovery clinics, treatment facilities, and physicians. Definitions have been updated to include medication-assisted treatment (MA T). Prescriptions have been updated to allow Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved MA T medications. These changes allow doctors the ability to provide the best treatment, no matter the proximity . Dr . Richard Mattis , Ideal Option, MA T Provider , testified in support of H 531 . Recruitment of general practitioners and those certified in addiction recovery is a struggle in rural areas, where there is also a rapid growth of substance use and abuse. Inclusion of telemedicine addiction treatment allows rural patients access to quality specialized professionals. T reatment, such as is of fered at Ideal Option locations, includes MA T , assessments by medical assistants (MAs), updated histories, and reconciled medications. Focused doctor-patient interactions enable the doctor to help patients deal with social, housing, anxiety , other medical, and mental health issues. When needed, referrals are made to primary care and other local resources. Frequent telehealth or in-person visits have been shown to lower relapse rates. The results of the non-punitive MA T are individuals who become productive members of the work force and their communities. Answering committee questions, Dr . Mattis said recovery is not a relapse. It is a sixty to ninety day abstinence. Most patients require six months of treatment to reach this point. The best use of MA T is for opioid addiction because it addresses symptoms and provides counseling. He said experience has taught him how motivational interviewing is the most ef fective technique to determine where a patient is in their desire to stop the drug use. Narcotics anonymous works as well as traditional counseling, if the group is chosen carefully . MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a motion to send H 531 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . Ms. Hart , in response to questions, stated there will need to be some education to assure Idaho doctors understand the training required to provide this treatment option. Ideal Options will be looking for Idaho physicians to work with as they expand their clinics. Responding to further questions, Dr . Mattis explained local clinics are not set up for MA T therapy because patients need frequent visits, tests, and a lot of staf f attention. For this reason, combining these patients with other medical patients is dif ficult. T raining includes a board certification class, 1,500 patient contact hours, and continuing medical education credits. T elemedicine provides the ability to see thirty to forty patients a day . A live provider can optimally see fifteen to twenty patients a day . New patients require more time for the interview process.

RS 27875: Caroline Merritt , Idaho Association of Chiropractic Physicians, presented RS 27875 . This is the third version of legislation to add licensed chiropractors to the list of professionals who are permitted to return a youth athlete to play . The chiropractic physician must successfully complete a board of chiropractic physicians approved concussion management education program with instruction on comprehensive concussion and other brain injury evaluations, ongoing patient reassessments, recognition of a typical response to brain injury , implementation of appropriate plans of care, return to activity determinations, and referrals to other health care providers.

Chairman W ood put the committee at ease at 9:08 a.m. Chairman W ood resumed the meeting at 9:09 a.m. H 538: Rep. Britt Raybould , District 34, presented H 538 , a revised version of electronic smoking devices legislation which addresses committee concerns. The nicotine definition mirrors the FDA, with no need to include food groups. Because they were outside the intended scope of this legislation, the rule making, local ordinances, and local provisions were removed. Cessation products for nicotine replacement therapy are addressed in other statutes. This legislation is intended to provide equal treatment and standards for all shops selling these and comparable products. Neither the regulation of flavored products nor the 18 to 21 age change are impacted by this legislation. Answering a question, Rep. Raybould explained part of the process is to establish the number of existing vape shops. The permitting process should pay for itself. Erin Bennett, American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, testified in support of H 538 , stating funding from the substance abuse block grant requires a compliance check percent to the tobacco project for the compliance checks. inclusion of other smoking devices might put this at risk. MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to send H 538 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Pam Eaton , President, CEO, Idaho Retailers Association, testified in opposition to H 538 . Although they support the concept, the regulatory issues do not support a uniform or level playing field. The previously suggested preemption language was not included. They do appreciate the removal of the fee. For the record no one else indicated their desire to testify . SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a substitute motion to send H 538 to General Orders. In closing, Rep. Raybould stated the preemption language was not included because it could impact existing tobacco product statutes and it deserved a separate debate. There is no desire to create dif ficulty for businesses. Other state inspections already include a program participation fee. The committee discussed the need for preemption language and raised the question of sending legislation to general orders this late in the session. ROLL CALL VOTE: Roll call vote was requested.

MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a motion to introduce RS 27906. Motion carried by voice vote. H 578: Rep. John V ander W oude , District 22, presented H 578 , Simon's Law . This legislation replaces H 519 . The changes allow the parent to put a do not resuscitate (DNR) in place immediately , instead of waiting for 48 hours. It also indicates the patient is to be discharged from the hospital, with the assumption they will go home. The fifteen-day transfer time frame includes execution of a transfer and an option for the physician. Blaine Conzatti , Director , Family Policy Alliance of Idaho, testified in support of H 578 , which closes the existing legal gap regarding DNRs for children, protecting them. Life deserves to be protected, no matter the disabilities or circumstances. Bob Aldridge , Attorney , Idaho Health Continuum Care Association, T rust and Estate Professionals of Idaho, testified in opposition to H 578 . He shared his concern regarding the need for legislation, the low costs represented in the fiscal note, conflict with existing guardian and parent statutes, placement of the notice not in policy and procedure, and the ability for parents to understand the requirements. He requested the bill be held in committee to address issues during the interim. Christine Gibbons , Registered Nurse, Palliative Care Program Coordinator , St. Alphonsus Health System, testified in opposition to H 578 . In response to previous questions regarding the legal consequences of a DNR placement without informed consent, the Board of Medicine was contacted. Ms. Gibbons read the response from Anne Lawler , Executive Director . (See attachment 1) In her letter , Ms. Lawler wrote failure to provide medical care that meets the community standard of care is a violation of both the Medical Practice Act and Rules, including consent for medical treatments performed or withheld. This would also mean possible discipline by the Board of Medicine. Ms. Gibbons stated the language in this legislation needs to be clarified and requested the bill be held in committee. Jackie W akefield , Right to Life for Idaho, appeared on behalf of Kerry Uhlenkott, Legislative Coordinator , in support of H 578 . Simon's Law is significant pro-life legislation recognizing rationed care against children with life limiting diagnoses is a real issue. A frightening number of children with chromosomal disorders are denied life saving medical treatment. Responding to a question, Ms. W akefield said the case information is unavailable and she personally does not know of any cases. Christian W elp , Catholic Church of Idaho, testified in support of H 578 . This legislation closes a legal gap regarding the possibility of a physician placing a DNR order on a child without parental consent by requiring notification. Blaine Conzatti , Director , Family Policy Alliance of Idaho, was invited to answer questions. The medical community is unsure if consent is required in statute due to its use of the word \"may .\" The mere change of \"may\" to \"shall\" would not address issues for families transferring their child to another facility . For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . In closing remarks, Rep. V ander W oude said because of its cost of treatment complexity , the budget writers developed the fiscal note numbers. This legislation provides notification and a procedure to help a parent understand the next steps. Bob Aldridge , Attorney , Idaho Health Continuum Care Association, T rust and Estate Professionals of Idaho, was asked to answer a question. Existing laws address the rights of both parents and custodial care. Other parental rights, even without custodial care, allow inclusion in decisions. This language states \"a\" parent or guardian without clarifying the type of notice, which parent is notified, and what happens if there is a disagreement. This bill would create situations when one parent would not get notified at all, which could lead to a lawsuit. MOTION: Rep. Christensen made a motion to send H 578 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to HOLD H 578 in committee. Rep. Rubel shared with the committee information regarding several existing statutes for this type of situation, including a list of the persons who can give consent.

The Medical Practice Act and related IDAPA Rules govern the licensure and regulation of all physicians and physician assistants. Please note that the Medical Practice Act and Rules do not specifically address the fact pattern you have presented. The Medical Practice Act and Rules are structured on a Community Standard of Care standard: Failure to provide medical care that meets the community standard of care is a violation of both the Act and Rules. This community standard of care would likely require that all medical treatments (or lack of treatment) are subject to appropriate consent. If placement of a DNR order on a hospital chart without appropriate info rmed consent would violate the community standard of care, then that would violate the Medical Practice Act and Rules. In addition, failure to follow all state or local laws and rules governing the practice of medicine also violates the Medical Practice A ct and Rules. If there are regulations in other sections of Idaho Code that address informed consent, and those sections are violated, then that could in turn violate the Medical Practice Act and Rules. Accordingly, a licensee taking any actions that do n ot meet the community standard of care and/or violate other state or local laws, then that licensee may be subject to discipline by the Board of Medicine. Please let me know if you have further questions. Kind regards, Anne K. Lawler, JD, RN Executive Director Idaho State Board of Medicine anne.lawler@bom.idaho.gov Direct: (208) 577- 2508 AGENDA HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE 8:00 A.M.

Following the end of the session, the sign-in sheet will be filed with the minutes in the Legislative Services Library . Chairman W ood called the meeting to order at 8:05 a.m. MOTION: Rep. Christensen made a motion to approve the minutes of the February 26 and 27, 2020, meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. H 342aaS: Rep. Blanksma , District 23, presented H 342aaS . The Senate amendment removes a portion of 54-5705(1) regarding general suf ficient technology with \"use of two-way audio and audio-visual interaction.\" Although this terminology is not broad enough to cover existing and future rapid technology changes, Rep. Blanksma recommended the committee concur with the amendment. MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to concur with the amendments made in the Senate to H 342aaS. Motion carried by voice vote. Chairman W ood will report on the floor . DOCKET NO. 16-0000-1900F IDAP A 16.02.08: Elke Shaw T & W elfare presented IDAP A 16.02.08 of Docket No. 16-0000-1900F , which was presented January 9, 2020, and held for separate discussion. The chapter provides guidance related to vital records, forms, registration requirements, amendments, reporting, and outlining associated fees. MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a motion to approve Docket No 16-0000-1900F , IDAP A 16.02.08 with the exception of Subsection 06. Kathy Griesmyer , Policy Director , American Civil Liberties Union Idaho, testified in support of IDAP A 16.02.08 . The existing birth certificate gender marker af firms gender expression, reduces harassment, eliminates discrimination, and addresses public safety concerns. Over 100 adults and fifteen minors have successfully applied to make this change, which does not jeopardize the veracity of state documents. Chairman W ood requested a letter from Lambda Legal stating they are in support of IDAP A 16.02.08 be entered into the committee minutes. (See attachment 1) Emilie Jackson Edney , Idaho Citizen, testified in support of IDAP A 16.02.08 . She complimented the DHW vital statistics department for being professional and proficient when changing her vital statistics records. Because all of her identity documents are now congruent with her name and marker , her individual liberty , autonomy , and dignity are preserved. Her original birth certificate is still public record. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Davis made a substitute motion to approve Docket No. 16-0000-1900F , IDAP A 16.02.08 in its entirety . Commenting to her motion, Rep. Davis stated approval in full is in compliance with legal rulings and shows all Idahoans they are valid. Rep. V ander W oude reminded the committee recent legislation covering this topic has passed the House and is the reason to not approve the entire section. VOTE ON SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the substitute motion to approve Docket No. 16-0000-1900F , IDAP A 16.02.08 in its entirety . Motion failed by voice vote. VOTE ON ORIGINAL MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the original motion to approve Docket No. 16-0000-1900F , IDAP A 16.02.08 with the exception of Section 201, Subsection 06. Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Davis and Rubel requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . H 577: Rep. Brian Zollinger , District 33, presented H 577 , which is a reiteration of previous legislation to add chiropractic physicians to the list of medical professionals who can return an athlete under 18 years of age to play after a concussion. An educational piece has been added to more clearly define what education chiropractic physicians need to be proficient and assure the athletes are safe to return to play . This is more important in rural areas where there is a lack of access to qualified physicians, leaving the coaches to make the decisions. Caroline Merritt , Idaho Association of Chiropractic Physicians, testified in support of H 577 . This will bring the chiropractic scope of practice in line with athletic trainers, who they supervise. She gave an overview of the education aquired by chiropractic physicians, including specialized additional education. Matt Kaiserman , Self, testified in opposition to H 577 . He shared his concern regarding the lack of input from youth sports stakeholders. Because this is a complex injury , which takes up to 24 hours for symptoms to fully manifest, returning to athletes play too quickly can have a variety of consequences, including death. This legislation, rather than provide a resource to return athletes to play , needs to focus on providing the time and appropriate care for recovery . Dr . Kurt Nilsson , T eam Physician, the College of Idaho, the US Ski T eam, and the US Soccer Federation, Medical Director , St. Luke's Concussion Clinic and Applied Research, testified in opposition to H 577 . Concussions, which are traumatic brain injuries, may require long term care for neurologic recovery . Identifying the appropriate concussion providers is important. Chiropractic training does not intersect with the other medical professionals who constitute the team treating a brain injury . He shared concern regarding the existing training program and the ability of the Chiropractic Board to judge the quality of any training program. Luke Bahnmaier , V ice President, Idaho Athletic T rainers Association, testified in opposition to H 577 . This legislation requires trainer competencies, which cannot be learned in a continuing education one-hour course or weekend workshop. The language does not identify how chiropractic physicians will be certified or recognized upon completion of the mandates. The American Board of Chiropractic Sports Physicians has a list of providers who have passed the athletic exam and are current with their course. No one in Idaho is on the registry . A more collaborative manner is needed. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE W ednesday , March 04, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 Dr . Spencer Zimmerman , Doctor of Chiropractic, licensed Nurse Practitioner , testified in support of H 577 . He has treated individuals with concussions, both acute and chronic, and agrees with the importance of immediate treatment. Chiropractic training includes the cervical spine, which is often missed in concussion evaluations. Chiropractors excel in evaluating function, which is important with this invisible injury . These injuries impact the growing number of athlete suicides. Answering a question, Dr . Zimmerman explained the right imaging has to be done to assure the student has actually recovered. Dr . T im Klena , Chiropractic Physician, testified in support of H 577 . This legislation increases their education further to appease their licensing board and align with other professionals. Referrals to other professionals are not always available in rural areas. Dr . Rob Sanders , Chiropractic Physician, testified in support of H 577 . As a recent graduate, he shared his training, which included the SCA T5 protocol along with simulated concussion evaluation and treatment. As physicians, any time a referral is needed, they must comply . Anne Lawler , Executive Director , Idaho Board of Medicine, which also has the Board of Athletic T rainers, testified without an opinion regarding H 577 . They worked with the legislation's sponsor to assure all authorized parties have had adequate education in all aspects of concussion and brain injury management. In response to a question, Ms. Lawler said the proposed language was paraphrased from the Standards 76 section of The Standards for Accreditation of Professional Athletic T raining Programs. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: V ice Chairman W agoner made a motion to send H 577 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Kelley Packer , Bureau Chief, Bureau of Occupational Licenses (BOL), was invited to answer a question. If H 577 is passed, the BOL will take on the standards of negotiated rule making, with input from stakeholders, to determine authority and course requirements. The resulting rules will be brought to the Legislature next year for approval prior to implementing the certification process. Committee discussion included giving rural Idaho a chance to benefit from this added support professional, concern surrounding long term concussion implications, and the need for a team of medical practitioners. VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send H 577 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Lickley requested she be recorded as voting NA Y . Rep. Zollinger will sponsor the bill on the floor .

Box 83720 Boise, ID 83720 -0081 Re: Statement for the Record on Rules Governing Completion and Correction of Certif icates; Vital Statistics Rules 16.02.08 Dear Chairman Wood, Chairman Martin , and Committee Members, As member s of the legal team that represent ed the P laintiffs in F.V. v. Barron , 286 F. Supp. 3d 1131 (D. Idaho 2018 ), we write to submit a statement fo r record regarding the rules governing the Completion and Correction of C ertificates . We write in support of these rules, which were a direct response to , and in compliance with, the U.S. District Court's March 5, 2018 decision in F.V. ordering the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) to accept applications made by transgender people for the purpose of correcting their gender markers to reflect their gender identity . These rules are a straightforward means for IDHW to comply with the Court's orde r: they replac e the previous, unconstitutional policy with a new, constitutionally sound procedure for amendment of birth certificates. In invalidating the previous policy as violating the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution , the Court noted the \"potential implications of restrictions and restraints IDHW may place on the ability of transgender people to . . . change the sex listed on their birth certificates\" and cautioned that \"any new rule m ust not subject one class of people to any more on erous burdens than the burdens placed on others without constitutionally -appropriate justification.\" Id. at 1141 -1142 . The Court also explained that \"any constitutionally sound rule most not include the revision history as to sex or name.\" Id. at 1135. Finally, the Court chose as its remedy to permanently enjoin the Department from enforcing the prior unconstitutional policy, and to order the Department to \"begin accepting applications made by transgender people . . . a constitutionally -sound ap proval process.\" Id. at 1146. March 4, 2020 Page 2 These rules are a direct response to the Court's order in F.V. They allow a transgender person to apply to have the gender marker on their birth certificate corrected in order to reflect their gender identity , and require that the amended certificate will not include any indication of amendment or revision history. In doing so, the rules comply with the order in F.V. without imposing burdens on transgender people in violation of the equal protection clause. Id. at 1141. Indeed, in the nearly two years since these rules f irst took effect in A pril of 2018, transgender people with Idaho birth certificates have been able to correct their gender designation without issue . These rules are necessary to alleviate the immense harm and r isk to the health and safety of transgender people who are not able to correct the gender designati on on their birth certificate. Transgender people are at intense risk for discrimination, including verbal harassment and physical assault, especially when they are perceived or identified as transgender.1 In particular, t ransgender people with identity documents that do not match their gender identity are frequently publicly identified as transgender, exposing them to hara ssment and discrimination.2 These numbers are even worse in Idaho \u2014thirty -six percent of tr ansgender Idahoans who showed identity documents that did not match their presentation were verbally harassed, denied benefits or services, asked to leave an establishment, or assaulted.3 Additionally, in the two years since implementation of these rules, nothing has transpired whatsoever to suggest that the rules pose any risk of confusion, fraud, or any other conceivable harm to an identifiable public interest. The status quo, upon which t ransgender people born in Idaho have already relied for nearly two years, should be maintained. To ensure continued compliance with the Court's order, and in the interest of protecting the safety and well -being of all transgender people born in Idaho, we urge that these rules remain in place as a 1 About half of all transgender people surveyed in the landmark 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey reported that they had been verbally harassed due to their gender identity , and nearly one in ten had been physically assaulted due to their gender identity. James, et al ., The Report of the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey , 198 (2016), https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS -Full-Report -Dec17.pdf . 2 Overall, about a third of transgender respondents who have shown IDs with a name or gender that did not match their presentation reported negative experiences, with about a quarter reporting verbal harassment.

PLACE: Room EW20 MEMBERS: Chairman W ood, V ice Chairman IAC; Alacia Handy , IDHW Chairman W ood called the meeting to order at 8:00 a.m. RS 27849C2: Rep. John V ander W oude , District 22, presented RS 27849C2 , proposed legislation for statewide uniform for tobacco products and electronic cigarettes laws which prevent implementation of varying regulations by local authorities. This would not interfere or limit any local unit of government from regulating public use or planning and zoning of these products. MOTION: V ice Chairman W agoner made a motion to introduce RS 27849C2. Motion carried by voice vote. H 600: Rep. Britt Raybould , District 34, presented H 600 . This legislation has three primary sections: the County Medical Indigency Program, the Catastrophic Fund Program (CA T), and the county Medicaid cost share. The County Medical Indigency Program is increased to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Six months after H 600 is enacted, the counties would stop accepting applications and resolve existing applications. Six months later , one year after enactment, the counties would finalize all outstanding applications, with determinations of what and how much to pay . At that point the County Medical Indigency Program would end. Answering questions, Rep. Raybould said the current application process takes 45 days. The counties determined the time frame would halt the majority of applications without impacting someone who had received care and had their application already in process. Upon enactment, the CA T Program eligibility would also change to 133% FPL. Acceptance of applications would cease in one year to allow processing of existing applications. At the hard cut-of f date of June 30, 2021, the CA T program would adjudicate all remaining applications and the CA T Board would be suspended. The lengthy time frame takes into account third party payers. The board's suspension allows reconvening to review any claims which cannot be adjudicated by June 30, 2021. Rep. Raybould , in response to questions, explained the next legislative session could determine what to do with the board. The Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) budget includes administrative costs for ongoing payments and repayments by individuals who received assistance from the CA T program. Also part of the consideration is the Obama Care court case determination, which may present options within eighteen months. Current law does not allow individuals who are eligible for Medicaid to apply for these programs. The DHW would determine the county quarterly portion by multiplying the quarterly Medicaid statewide enrollee count by the Medicaid annual member cost, which is then multiplied by the county share of 30%. This total would be divided by four . The formula results would be sent to the T ax Commission who, starting December 31, 2020, would subtract the county quarterly cost share from the county's sales tax revenue share. Quarterly share funds, seat belt fines, and reversions from the previous year would go into a stabilization fund. Because the data collection date inserts a nine-month ongoing delay . After the original count, the first 2020 FY payment would occur December 31, 2020. The delay provides enough time for the T ax Commission to assure the numbers are calculated correctly and the counties understand the calculations. This method would provide a more sustainable and diversified funding source for ongoing costs and potential fluctuations. In response to committee questions, Rep. Raybould explained the changes in this legislation address the counties' comfort level with explicit references to Medicaid rate reimbursements. The cost share was increased from 23% to 30% after reviewing the final budget of fsets and the full program cost. The repealed sections are those related to the administration of the County Medical Indigency Program. The per member , per year cost is a forecasted number because there is only three months of data available. The $452 per person per year amount could decrease if the anticipated 90,000 participation number is not reached. The funding silo provides financial management accountability in the event the expansion is considered unconstitutional. Seth Griggs , Executive Director , Idaho Association of Counties, testified the association is taking no formal position on H 600 . Upon passage of this legislation, anyone eligible for Medicaid expansion would be ineligible for the county program. Their application base includes individuals above the 138% FPL who have not purchased insurance. After the program is terminated these individuals and the hospitals will have to determine how the expenses are paid. The counties have 100% expense responsibility for involuntary commitments until the individual is released from payment or transferred out of custody . The counties are seeing expenses for this group increasing. The county program is not an insurance program and requires repayment. Some counties will see a net savings if the critical IMD waiver is granted. The most negative impact is expected in eastern and northern Idaho. Diversion of revenue sharing for justice related services remains an issue, although the charity levy can be broadened for these and other services. Smaller counties use one employee to process applications along with their other duties. Larger counties, with specialized staf f, could experience employee cost savings. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Zollinger made a motion to HOLD H 600 in committee for time certain, Friday , March 13, 2020. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a substitute motion to send H 600 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Committee discussion included the complexity of the subject, the existence of multiple methods, the calculations indicating no county would suf fer a loss when the charity levy was included, the helpfulness of more review time, the possibility of the Senate shutting down their committees, and the fate of the Medicaid appropriations bill if there is no county funding.

He shared the Secretary of State's letter recommending the registry move. (See attachment 1.) The changes include instruction to the Department of Health & W elfare (DHW) to create and maintain the registry . The fiscal note includes one-time costs for the requests for proposal (RFPs), license purchases, and personnel. The listed ongoing costs will maintain the personnel and software licenses. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to introduce RS 27921. Motion carried by voice vote. H 61 1: Rep. John V ander W oude , District 22, presented H 61 1 . This legislation stipulates local units of government may not adopt or enforce any more restrictive than state law requirements for the regulation, marketing, or sale of tobacco products or electronic cigarettes. This does not preclude the local units of government from regulation of zoning and land use laws. MOTION: Rep. Blanksma made a motion to send H 61 1 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Rubel made a substitute motion to HOLD H 61 1 in committee. Commenting to her motion, Rep. Rubel said the Clean Indoor Air Law exists for smoking. Any vaping in public areas regulation would have to be at the local level. The public use reference could be construed to include public parks. Chairman W ood turned the gavel over to V ice Chairman W agoner . Pam Eaton , President, CEO, Idaho Retailers Association, testified in support of H 61 1 . This legislation does not prevent any public use of tobacco products or electronic cigarettes and does not interfere with local regulation for zoning and land use, which is part of the Clean Indoor Air Law . This maintains the uniform retailer laws which provide consistency across Idaho. Answering a question, she said this legislation does not repeal any of the Clean Indoor Air Law . Theresa V awter , Idaho Government Relations Director , American Cancer Society , Cancer Action Network testified in opposition to H 61 1 . Localities need to assure healthier living for their residents by addressing evolving trends and their unique community needs.

Supervisors for prescribing psychology students, which are required in their second year , are hard to find. This legislation adds family practice physicians to the supervisors list. The requirement for specialized medication training, which does not exist for physicians, has been replaced with a minimum experience requirement of two years. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a motion to send S 1305 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Gibbs will sponsor the bill on the floor . S 1295: Elizabeth Criner , Idaho State Dental Association, presented S 1295 to amend the Dental Practice Act in two sections. Language is added to assure telehealth dentistry is in accordance with both the community standard of care and the T elehealth Practice Act. Dentists are required to provide patients with licensure and contact information and advise them regarding the possible need for in-person care. The dentist has the option to provide a referral or instruct the patient to locate a dentist. Dentists authorizing or performing corrective malposition procedures must do so in accordance with the community standard of care. Some Idahoans have experienced serious oral health issues with direct-to-consumer aligners when the dentist did not have adequate knowledge or images to determine what was going on below the gum line. This legislation also ensures dentists cannot represent, contract with, or be employed by an entity which limits the patient's right to file a complaint with the Board of Dentistry . Dr . Laura Lineberry , Idaho State Dental Association, testified in support of S 1295 . In her practice Dr . Lineberry strives to keep up with rapid technological changes to assure the best possible patient care. Use of aligner treatments require the doctor and patient to agree on the appropriate plan. She described cases where the consumer's health was threatened due to improper fit, poor quality images, lack of x-rays, and no in-person exam. Clinical exams are more extensive, include the person's full health, and can reveal issues indicating the individual is not a good candidate for aligners. Consumers may not be able to contact the remote dentist or orthodontist directly to address issues. Full transparency and community standard of care are important for the care Idahoans deserve. John Foster , Contract Lobbyist, Kestral W est, Opportunities Solution Project, testified in opposition to S 1295 . Requiring x-rays and an of fice visit before a person can avail themselves of teledentistry creates a barrier not in alignment with Idaho's low regulatory goal. T eledentistry providers are meeting a demand and providing free market opportunities. Alignments are less critical than extraction surgeries, which do not require prior x-rays or dentist visits. Dr . Steve Bruce , Dentist, State Dental Association, testified in support of S 1295 . When at a national meeting, he shared concern regarding the inability for a standard of care defense without an examination. Dr . Blaine Leeds , Dentist, Nashville, TN, T eledentistry Practitioner in Nine States, testified in opposition to S 1295 . He was the first dentist trained to do Invisalign paraligners. There are five teledental providers in Idaho. He described the three to six month process of minor orthodontic tooth movements using paraligners. Obtaining and returning the aligners comprise the majority of complaints. Answering committee questions, Dr . Leeds said a very detailed medical history is required, along with a release form stating they have a regular dental team who has prescribed them as healthy . Upon receipt of their first aligners, the patients are encouraged to contact the support team to provide photos and feedback on the progression of their case. He speaks to his patients on a routine basis to discuss their progress. Any complaints are addressed as soon as possible. They use iT ero scanners which are also used by board certified orthodontists for high definition images. Any patient can submit existing dental record information. Dr . Leeds , answering further questions, stated S 1295 requires patients have a referral relationship prior to starting any procedure. It also requires the patient submit their records, causing a delay and defeating the ef ficiency of teledentistry . Patients experiencing issues are re-scanned. Some consumers cannot and should not be treated. Kate Haas , Smile Direct Club, testified in opposition to S 1295 . Almost all of the Idaho teledentists contracting with Smile Direct Club have brick and mortar practices. The vague terminology creates interpretation issues for referring dentists. Referrals usually happen when a problem arises, not before a service occurs. An informed consent is already included in the T elehealth Access Act. Most problematic is the telehealth malposition requirements, including community standard of care, within the punitive section. Brick and mortar dentists use their knowledge to provide the appropriate treatment without any regulatory or Board of Dentistry intervention. Ms. Haas , in response to committee questions, said the Board of Dentistry , as with other professional boards, provides oversight of licensure and public protection. According to her client, this is a market decision consumers are making after seeing their regular dentists. HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE T uesday , March 10, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 David Lehman , Primus Policy Group, American T eledentistry Association, testified in support of S 1295 . The Board of Dentistry has the clear statute authority to handle this issue and the Dental Hygienist Association wants to collaborate with the board. This is a reasonable approach to the issue and the committee needs to allow the telehealth statute, not legislation, to regulate the practice with adjudication by the regulatory board. Dr . Kathleen Beaudry , Board Certified Periodontist, State Dental Association, testified in support of S 1295 , sharing an example of her patient, who was not a good candidate, who used direct-to-consumer aligners, without a direct exam, no dentist or orthodontist information, and experienced severe issues as a consequence. The prescribing dentist needed to be better informed and have diagnostic radiographs. There could be few complaints because most patients do not know they have a problem until months or years after they undergo the process This will better insure patients are more appropriately evaluated and not sold a harmful device. MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to send S 1295 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Michael McGrane , Idaho Dental Hygienist Association, testified in support of S 1295 . This legislation provides patient protection and does not prevent teledentists. Hygienists see the results and the problems. In closing remarks, Elizabeth Criner stated the legislation supports online telehealth models and assures patients who should not get aligners are protected. Dental records are readily attainable within five days and the patient can ask the online system to retrieve the records. A prescribing dentist's review will insure the oral health of the patient is right for this type of service. Answering questions, Ms. Criner said the American Association of Dental Boards released guidance for this type of legislation for all states. (See attachment 1) Even the provider testifying today supports the AADB recommendation. (See attachment 2) Many border communities have dentists licensed in multiple states and all teledental rules respect cross-partner communities. The community standard of care is established by those within the profession. Dr . Steve Bruce , Dentist, State Dental Association, was invited to answer a committee question. The standard of care is the care which would be provided by any prudent dentist in their community . The American Dental Association has no written standard of care for every procedure. If challenged, a court would determine the standard of care. Answering a question, Elizabeth Criner stated the board is the authority for implementation and management. SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Remington made a substitute motion to send S 1295 to General Orders. AMENDED SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Rep. Zollinger made an amended substitute motion to HOLD S 1295 in committee. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST : Rep. Zollinger made a unanimous consent request to withdraw the amended substitute motion. There being no objection, the request was granted.

This legislation's ef fective date is July 1, 2020. A maximum 4.04% levy rate will be used for the funding mechanism, with a higher rate only by the vote of the people. MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to send S 1332 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. W ayne Denny , Bureau Chief, Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and Preparedness, responded to committee questions. Adams county has two separate ambulance districts. The current law allows a city to remove itself from the ambulance district, without relieving the citizens from paying the tax. This creates questions regarding who provides what service where. This legislation allows cities to opt in for the formation of a new district. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send S 1332 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Gestrin will sponsor the bill on the floor . H 616: Brian Whitlock , President, Idaho Hospital Association, presented H 616 . There is general agreement in the value of a statewide health care registry with immediate access and easy updates. These legal documents share medical care wishes when an individual is incapacitated and unable to communicate. Moving the existing registry to the Department of Health and W elfare (DHW) provides a single HIP AA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant technology platform, increases the number of documents available within the registry , and allows easy retrieval by providers. The one-time budget request of $350k will allow purchase and set up of the new system. The $150k annual cost request includes software license renewals and personnel. For the record, no one indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Lickley made a motion to send H 616 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. V ander W oude will sponsor the bill on the floor . S 1348 Rep. Mike Kingsley , District 6, presented S 1348 . This legislation increases the Prescription Management Program's (PMP's) ef fectiveness to combat opioid misuse by requiring a review of a patient's prescription drug history prior to prescribing opioid analgesic or benzodiazepine. Exempted patients are those in inpatient settings, emergency scenes, ambulances, hospice care, or a skilled nursing home care facility . Invited to answer a question, Nate Fisher , Of fice of the Governor , said the October 1, 2020, start date aligns with the federal requirement. Matthew Conde , AAA Idaho, testified in support of S 1348 . It is important individuals taking prescriptions are aware of how they impact operating a motor vehicle. Seniors take seven or more medications for their quality of life. The PMP allows doctors to quarterback their patients to assure medication usage is safe. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . MOTION: Rep. Davis made a motion to send S 1348 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. M otion carried by voice vote. Rep.

Most Idaho Medicare accepting hospitals are subject to both Idaho's Rules and Minimum Standards for Hospitals and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS') Conditions of Participation. This legislation addresses regulatory inconsistency and confusion among providers by stipulating IDAP A T itle 39, Chapter 13, when more restrictive than federal guidelines, shall not apply to hospitals certified by CMS through accreditation, survey , or otherwise. T oni Lawson , Idaho Hospital Association, testified in support of S 1354 . This legislation decreases duplication and confusion. She gave an example regarding the use of restraints and the dif ference between the IDAP A requirement and the CMS requirement. The confusion has negatively impacted staf fing. MOTION: Rep. Gibbs made a motion to send S 1354 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Answering questions, Ms. Lawson said corrections during the rules review process involved many sections and rejecting any section would detrimentally impact non-Medicaid accredited hospitals. The few hospitals not Medicaid certified are licensed psychiatric facilities who do not take Medicare or Medicaid patients. Adrienne Frazier testified in support of S 1354 and returned to her seat. Emylie Patten testified in support of S 1354 and returned to her seat. Jennifer Misajet , Chief Nurse, St. Alphonsus Health System, testified in support of S 1354 .

For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send S 1354 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Rep. Gibbs will sponsor the bill on the floor . S 1331: Caroline Merritt , Idaho Association of Chiropractic Physicians, presented S 1331 . Under current law , chiropractic physicians certified in clinical nutrition must use an outsourcing facility or a 503B pharmacy to obtain the products they may administer . This legislation allows a chiropractic physician to obtain patient-specific prescription for of fice use from a licensed Idaho compounding pharmacy . There is no expansion of the prescription drugs list. With only one 503B Idaho facility , the current legislation is cost prohibitive and cumbersome. Requests to order from out-of-state facilities have been denied. MOTION: V ice Chairman W agoner made a motion to send S 1331 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Dr . Cory Matthews , Boise Practitioner , testified in support of S 1331 . He explained the issues surrounding the practicality and cost ef fectiveness of getting the product to his patients. Such products are used for overall wellness and can be a simple vitamin compound. Because the products have to be made in large batches, there are often long waits for the product and practitioners have to go in together to purchase them. Answering questions, Dr . Matthews explained administering at a doctor's of fice provides quality control. He would like to use 503A pharmacies as well as the one 503B pharmacy to meet his patients' needs. For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . VOTE ON MOTION: Chairman W ood called for a vote on the motion to send S 1331 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation.

PLACE: Room EW20 MEMBERS: Chairman W ood, V ice Chairman Seth Grigg, IAC Chairman W ood called the meeting to order at 1:02 p.m. MOTION: Rep. Davis made a motion to approve the minutes of the March 10, 1 1, 12, 13 a.m. and 13 p.m., 2020, meetings. Motion carried by voice vote. Chairman W ood turned the gavel over to V ice Chairman W agoner . H 642: Rep. Fred W ood , District 27, presented H 642 . This legislation does four things. It limits the County Indigency Program eligibility . It reassigns the first $12M, approximately , of county revenue sharing to the Medicaid Expansion Program. It creates the Medicaid Expansion Account for these funds. It provides for the use of the charity levy funds for the Justice Fund Programs. Stipulation is made to prevent fund comingling with the Co-op Usage Funds. The sales tax county distribution is 28.2% for fiscal year 2021. The requested $12M, approximately , equals 17% of that distribution amount and does not impact the indigency program administrative costs. Seth Grigg , Executive Director , Idaho Association of Counties (IAC), testified in opposition to H 642 . The amendments for justice related purchases codifies what they have been working toward for some time. T en counties do not have the justice levy and two counties do not have the charity levy . Charity levies also pay for indigent burials and jail medical expenses. T rying to assess the actual county fiscal impact prior to the IMD waiver approval is dif ficult because individuals at IMD facilities continue to have counties pay their expenses. The Governor has recommended the counties pay $8.5M for the Medicaid Expansion costs. This legislation has been developed without the knowledge of the full expansion program cost and its impact on the indigent program. The IAC requests a one-year wait to better assess what is needed for a county funding strategy . Answering a question, Mr . Griggs said they have determined the litigious nature of some hospital claims to be one reason for the dif ferences in the individual county indigent costs. They know this is not the whole story . For the record, no one else indicated their desire to testify . In closing remarks Rep. W ood said for several years the counties have been spending $20M for their indigent program, including $7M to $8M for administrative costs. This is a simple, straight forward method to determine the county participation for this gordian knot of a problem. This asks for a little over 50% of what the counties have been paying. The IMD waiver is a facilities Medicaid billing allowance waiver and has nothing to do with Medicaid eligibility . MOTION: Rep. V ander W oude made a motion to send H 642 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Committee discussion included how a delay would impact county budget setting in October , the need to wait until the work requirement waiver secondary gap population size is determined, the eligibility change impact on hospitals, the impact on taxpayers and emergency services during this health crisis, the need for action during this session. VOTE ON MOTION: V ice Chairman W agoner called for a vote on the motion to send H 642 to the floor with a DO P ASS recommendation. Motion carried by voice vote. Reps. Rubel, Davis, Chew , Christensen , and Gibbs requested they be recorded as voting NA Y . Rep. W ood will sponsor the bill on the floor . V ice Chairman W agoner turned the gavel over to Chairman W ood . ADJOURN: There being no further business to come before the committee, the meeting adjourned at 1:35 p.m. ___________________________ ___________________________ Representative W agoner Irene Moore Chair Secretary HOUSE HEAL TH & WELF ARE COMMITTEE Monday , March 16, 2020\u2014Minutes\u2014Page 2 "}
