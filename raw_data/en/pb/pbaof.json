It is a new field, but one that has already stimulated substantial discussion regarding it s technical possibilities, its role in addressing global challeng es, and its use in increasing our understanding of biology. Discussion has also focused on burgeoning social, ethical and regulatory questions, as well as on the field's economic potential. Attention is also being g iven to synthetic biology's position in national and international scie nce and governance strategies. T h e m y r i a d o f i s s u e s r a i s e d b y s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y a r e l i k e l y t o be viewed differently and to receive differing levels of attention across the international landscape. This can affect the development of the field and the realisation of its potential benefits. It is therefore impo rtant to u n d e r s t a n d a n d t o a d d r e s s g l o b a l l y t h e o p p o r t u n i t i e s a n d c h a l l e nges p r e s e n t e d b y s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . T h i s r e p o r t , a n d t h e s y m p o s i u m on which it draws, aim to contribute to this process. Key points S y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y i s a s e t o f t o o l s a n d t e c h n i q u e s w h i c h m i x engineering and biology and support the development of new f u n c t i o n s o r a p p l i c a t i o n s . N e w a p p l i c a t i o n s m a y b e f o u n d i n medicine, energy, environment and materials. Synthetic biology also aims to increase our understanding of biological systems; in particular, it may offer an approach to managing their complexi ty. I t i s c r u c i a l t o i n v e s t i n u n d e r p i n n i n g t e c h n o l o g i e s , s c i e n c e , education and policy in order to ensure the safe and efficient development of synthetic biology. Investments in automated technologies such as DNA synthesisers and combinatorial tech- nologies are important to enhance research and optimise the use of researchers' time. Rewarding and publishing advances in synthetic biology would also be a strong stimulus for the field . The gap between applications and tools and techniques must be bridged. This calls for investments to develop tools and tech- niques. 6 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 The degree to which experience and knowledge gained from other emerging technologies are being drawn upon and used is not clear. Issues raised during the symposium that would benefit from further investigation and, in so me cases, policy interventions at multiple levels, include: - standardisation, for example of biological parts; - the shaping of an intellectual property model; - international collaboration and co-operation in the regulation and governance of synthetic biology, as well as scientific and technical development. Opportunities for public debate and discussion of synthetic biology need to be created. Part of the challenge will be to develop a common, widely understood language for discussing ethical and social, as well as technical aspects of synthetic b i o l o g y . T h e p u b l i c s h o u l d b e i n v o l v e d i n a h e a l t h y a n d o p e n dialogue. What is needed is real dialogue and engagement with the public rather than a simple communication strategy. C o m m u n i c a t i o n b e t w e e n t h e m a n y s t a k e h o l d e r s i n v o l v e d i n novel technologies and science depends on a variety of complex factors and is context-dependent.

The symposium was organised around expe rt talks and discussions on issues such as: the state of the field a n d i t s commercial and scientific potential; scientific, educational an d commercial infrastructure needs; emerging financial and business models fo r its commercial development; the challenges synthetic biology may pr esent to legal and regulatory arrangements ( e.g. biosafety, biosecurity, intel- lectual property rights); and the related ethical dimensions. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 7 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 One of the aims of the symposium was to identify issues and are as for future study and help generate policy-level discussions of synthetic biology.

Synthetic biology: an overview O v e r t h e l a s t f i v e y e a r s t h e r e h a s b e e n m u c h d i s c u s s i o n o f opportunities and challenges in synthetic biology. The symposiu m aimed to evoke a wide-ranging discussion of the value of synthe tic biology rather than carry out a traditional risk-benefit analys is. Risk- benefit analyses are important, but examining wider opportuniti es and c h a l l e n g e s h e l p s d r a w a t t e n t i o n t o t h e e v o l v i n g n a t u r e o f s y n t h etic biology, to the surrounding public and policy dialogue and to t he fact that risks and benefits shift and reconfigure over time: what i s an opportunity one day may become a challenge the next. Synthetic biology arrives at a time when science's role and pos ition in society face increased public scrutiny. Difficult questions are raised, i n clu di n g : W h o i s to i m ag i n e th e f ut ur e o f s ci en c e? H ow d o w e d ecide which scientific and technological interventions to undertake f or society? Who is responsible for the consequences of innovation whether positive or negative? In thinking about such questions, Shelia Jasanoff (Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies, Harva rd U n i v e r s i t y , U n i t e d S t a t e s ) a r g u e d a t t h e s y m p o s i u m t h a t s y n t h e t ic biology's potential power requires us to explore ways to be \"mo re in charge of the process by which imaginative futures enter our li ves\". 8 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 The scope of synthetic biology In his presentation, Drew Endy (Assistant Professor, Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, United States) suggested t hat descriptions of synthetic biology tend to be limited. They typi cally emphasise one or more of the following elements: synthetic biol ogy is a natural science that contributes to expanding our knowledge of biology; it is a synthetic science, analogous to synthetic chemistry, wh ich seeks to construct novel molecules and systems for useful purposes; o r it is a technology available to engineers, again to put to useful purpo ses. It w a s a r g u e d t h a t a l t h o u g h a c c u r a t e , d e s c r i p t i o n s i n t h e s e t e r m s are partial and tend to underplay aspects of this work's wider cont ext. Following Jasanoff's call to expand our imagination, it was poi nted out that synthetic biology raises opportunities for humanity an d at the same time raises the question of what it means to be human. Syn thetic b i o l o g y c a n h e l p a d d r e s s k e y c h a l l e n g e s f a c i n g t h e p l a n e t a n d i ts population, such as food security, sustainable energy and healt h. This potential raises questions such as how we should (and how we wi ll) c h a n g e o u r s e l v e s a n d o u r e n v i r o n m e n t s . S y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y m a y b e especially powerful in this respect because it frees the design o f biological systems from the process of natural evolution.

Synthetic biology has already made some significant contributio ns to the need to meet global challenges. The best known is the sy nthesis of artemisinic acid in E. coli and yeast. Artemisinic acid is needed for artemisinin, the most effective known anti-malarial drug. Howev er, this achievement also represents the high-water mark of metabolic engineering. Relying on the tools of biotechnology and genetic engineering which changed little in three decades, this effort took several years and USD 25 million. There are already reports of resistance to artemisinin and the yeast-derived alternative has not yet reached the market. More efficient and flexible biotechnology i n the future will require new tools. Synthetic biology could offer this \"tool revolution\".

Thinking and language for synthetic biology Paul Rabinow (Director of Human Practice, Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, United States) proposed further te chnical and non-technical features that may distinguish synthetic biolo gy from previous developments in the life sciences including: its empha sis on i n s t r u m e n t a l g o o d s ; i t s s h i f t o f a t t e n t i o n a w a y f r o m t h e m o l e c u le and the gene as primary objects of interest; its attempt to make bi ology an engineering discipline; and its endeavour to establish new coll aborative \" v e n u e s \" f o r s c i e n t i f i c r e s e a r c h . \"Venue\" here means the organi sing concepts and forms of knowledge used, as well as the physical s pace in which they might be brought together and assembled. Rabinow argued that synthetic biology requires \"refreshed venue s\" - a radical rethink of how we think about the significance of w ork done in this area, particularly the relative contributions of ethics and science. Frameworks developed for thinking about recombinant DNA in the 1970s and the genome sequencing effort of the 1990s fall short of the task, in part because the science and technology have evolved, but also because the social and political environment for this work has changed.

The US Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) is examining critically the role synthetic biology plays in promot ing human well-being. It does so les s in terms of technical optimis ation than of what counts as a good life and what the biosciences may cont ribute.

While these are important, they are not sufficient give n the far- reaching potential of synthetic biology. Going further, other delegates felt that established categories s u c h as biotechnology, genetics, society and the public may no longe r apply, a l t h o u g h m o s t d i s c u s s a n t s w e r e h e s i t a n t t o a b a n d o n t h e m .

F o r i n s t a n c e s , d e f i n i t i o n s o f c o n c e p t s s uch as risk, public good and ethics vary significantly across countrie s and public sectors. This is a challenge which will require attentio n. As the language and terms continue to evolve, the importance of s t a r t i n g a n d s u s t a i n i n g d i s c u s s i o n s o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y w a s d e scribed in stark terms: we are at the point at which we could fashion o ur own version of the living world but we must take collective respons ibility for this. We need a \"post DNA-synthesis\" discussion that takes acco unt of the progress made in various fields of technology, but is also sensitive to the historical framework this work may now have outgrown. Participants discussed the difficulties in enabling the public to understand and influence the development of synthetic biology; science is global, uncertain, contested and not currently part of popul ar culture and discourse. It was suggested that public discussion needed t o begin w i t h a r e a l i s t i c a p p r a i s a l o f t h e p r o m i s e o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y , a n d t h a t current visions take too much account of ill-founded assertions . In reply, it was pointed out that it can be difficult to secure re search r e s o u r c e s w i t h o u t c l a i m i n g t h a t t h e w o r k w i l l h e l p s o l v e i m p o r t ant problems. Moreover, such claims can help build interest and exc itement in the public space beyond the research and funding communities . The role of public engagement in discussions of synthetic biology w as a recurrent theme throughout the symposium, and is further discus sed below. National and international public policy E m e r g i n g n a t i o n a l s t r a t e g i e s a n d p o l i c i e s w i l l p l a y a r o l e i n t he d e v e l o p m e n t o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y , b u t h o w t h e y w i l l a f f e c t r e s e arch, grass-roots activity and international exchange is not currentl y clear. What is certain is that different countries will intervene in d ifferent ways in the development of synthetic biology. A richer comparat ive understanding of nati onal cultur es of innov ation can help to re cognise i n t e r n a t i o n a l d i f f e r e n c e s a s w e l l a s o p p o r t u n i t i e s f o r c o l l a b o r ation. In this respect, three national perspectives were highlighted at t he sympo- sium. United States The US National Science Foundation (NSF) is a major federal supporter of basic research. The NSF has identified synthetic b iology as a tr an sfor m ati ve fi eld w hi ch has the poten ti al to deli ver g r eat k n ow ledg e SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 11 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 and benefits to society, revolutionise and disrupt accepted res earch and theory, and destabilise markets. The NSF recognises that invest igating and understanding social, ethical and public aspects of synthet ic biology is essential for what Arden Bement, Jr. (Director, National Sci ence F o u n d a t i o n , U n i t e d S t a t e s ) d e s c r i b e d a s \" s o p h i s t i c a t e d a n d s u b t le solutions, the very best we can devise\" to the challenges prese nted by synthetic biology. The NSF funds research into these wider aspe cts of synthetic biology at SynBERC in addition to SynBERC's basic and a p p l i e d r e s e a r c h o n s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . T h e N S F h a s a l s o c o l l a b o rated with the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in an intensive workshop (or \"sandpit\") to develop and allocate funds to innovative projects in synthetic biology. United Kingdom Central funding for specific research projects is just one of a range of possible government interventions in synthetic biology. In the United K i n g d o m , t h e g o v e r n m e n t s e t s t h e o v e r a l l s t r a t e g y f o r f u n d i n g a nd research.

The UK govern ment distributes around USD 4.5 billion (GBP 3 billion) a year in th is manner - added to by other funding partners such as The Wellcome Trust . Syntheti c biology is begin ning to feature in the funding distri buted by the research councils. Overall, around USD 27.6 million (GBP 17 million) has been allocated to synthetic biology projects and related ac tivities. In line with much of the discussion at the symposium, Adrian Smith (Director General for Science and Research, Department of Busin ess I n n o v a t i o n a n d S k i l l s , U n i t e d K i n g d o m ) s t a t e d t h a t \" t h e s c i e n c e a n d thinking about the science must continue in parallel\". In addit ion to the EPSRC/NSF \"sandpit\", Smith cited the EPSRC-funded Centre for Sy nthetic B i o l o g y a n d I n n o v a t i o n ( C S y n B I ) , w h i c h b r i n g s t o g e t h e r t h e s c i e ntific research labs at Imperial College London and the BIOS Centre at t h e London School of Economics, which focuses on social science.

In a separate initiative, four UK research councils came togeth er to put just under GBP 1 million int o seven synthetic biology netwo rks. Spread across eight institutions, the networks aim at facilitat ing multi- disciplinary work and finding a \"common language\" between biosc ience and engineering research groups. Some networks address the deve lop- ment of basic tools, and others explore specific technical chal lenges and 12 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 applications. Some institutions involved in the networks, in pa rticular the University of Edinb urgh, the Universi ty of Cam bridge and Im perial College, are developing education and training opportunities at undergraduate and postgraduate level. The UK activities benefit from, and are often part of, activiti es taking place at the European level.

I t w a s n o t e d t h a t t h e o f f i c i a l U K view is that most synthetic biology research will be covered by current regulations on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and that t here is no need, at present, for new regulations relating specifically to synthetic b i o l o g y .

It was argued t hat this pattern holds for synthetic biology. In contrast, it was argued that in the early days of genetic engineering, regulators and others were q uite clear on the nature of the science and its boundaries. This fac ilitated the establishment of regulations. It was suggested that since the s ituation of synthetic biology is not clear, self-regulation is likely to pr evail. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 13 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 China In China, synthetic biology has only recently gained ground. Haunming Yang (Director, Beijing Genomics Institute, China) des cribed China as a latecomer to the field, as it was for genomics.

I f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y i s c o n c e i v e d a s a n a t u r a l e x t e n s i on of genomics - from the reading to the writing of genome sequences - then China is well placed to take an active part. Prospects for international collaboration Delegates discussed the challenges of international collaborati on on several levels, from individual scientists and research groups to c o u n t r i e s a n d w i d e r g e o g r a p h i c a r e a s . I t w a s n o t e d t h a t t h e U n i ted Kingdom, along with other countries in Europe and the United St ates, is positioning science and technology at the centre of the nationa l strategy for recovery from the current economic downturn. But narrow nat ional strategies might risk deterring international collaboration. Di scussants pointed out that the link between science and innovation and ec onomic growth is well founded, but it was suggested that emphasising s cience's economic potential may lead to investments in areas that promis e short-term economic gain. Realising the benefits of synthetic b iology is likely to require sust ained long-term investment. It was furthe r suggested that international collaboration thrives on bottom-up, research er-led activity that is not determined by centralised policies. International communication and collaboration by scientists, in cluding those from emerging economies, will be a key part of the succes sful development of synthetic biology, but there are system factors that 14 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 w o r k a g a i n s t t h i s .

Innovation in synthetic biology Enabling innovation: tools and techniques Synthetic biology was presented as a set of tools and technique s that bring together engineering and biology and support the developm ent of new entities, functions or applications. Caroline Ajo-Franklin (Staff Scientist, Biological Nanostructures Facility, University of Ca lifornia, Berkeley, United States) described new functions including the ability to create new ecosystems by enabling intercellular communication, as well as novel regulatory networks that monitor the development of ge ne products. The development of these tools and techniques underpi ns synthetic biology's potential to tackle challenges such as gree ner energy production ( e.g. development of alternative energy sources such as bio- fuels), the environment and better health. A gap between tools and applications Synthetic biology promises to advance smart therapeutics. Howev er, Christina Smolke (Assistant Professor, Department of Bioenginee ring, Stanford University, United States) described hurdles that stil l impede the use of syn thetic bi ology for inn ovati on in health or other domains. Mainly, there is a gap between the development of technology an d tools and their applications. Bridging this gap is an important step in ensuring the growth of the field, but it represents a significa nt challenge w h i c h i s n o t w e l l a p p r e c i a t e d . I t w a s a r g u e d t h a t t h e d i f f i c u l t y of translating tools into applications is due to the following: SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 15 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 First, the development of a tool , its refinement and optimisati on (e.g. going from the conceptual design of a function to a genetic s e q u e n c e t h a t f u l l y i m p l e m e n t s t h e f u n c t i o n ) r e p r e s e n t s a significant technical challenge and a significant investment of time and money. Second, the invention and implementation of engineering design principles in biology is critical for effective tool developmen t and thus for moving more applications forward. However, the culture of biological research traditionally rewards novelty to a much greater extent than the contributions of engineering. To ensure that synthetic biology can make its full contribution, i t is critical to recognise the part that engineering plays. T h i r d , f r o m a t e c h n o l o g y d e v e l o p m e n t s t a n d p o i n t , i t i s i m - portant to develop computer-aided design tools that support the design and programming of devices and their implementation in systems. Such tools are currently insufficiently developed and accessible. Fourth, to address scalability, public libraries of refined par ts would have to be set up. These libraries could also include man y di ffer en t cl as ses o f m o lec u les s uc h as: m e tab o li tes fo r r esear c h on biosynthesis; disease biomarkers for biomedical research; and exogenous chemicals for research on agricultural bio- technology. Finally, applications generally focus narrowly on the end produ ct rather than on developing a technology base to support many different products. Companies often base their strategy on the end product they plan to distribute. Investing in or integratin g new tools and technologies is often not a priority when this do es not lead directly to a specific product. These arguments highlight the importance of investing in the development of tools to generate more applications. A key point is the need to think through strategies and mindsets that support the implementation of underpinning t echnologies and tools. Funding is also important to support the development of tools and technologies in synthetic biology at scales and time frames that are appropriat e for the challenges that synthetic biology seeks to address. 16 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 I s s u e s l i n k e d t o i n t e l l e c t u a l p r o p e r t y ( I P ) m o d e l s a n d r e g u l a t o ry frameworks were also raised.

Groups such as the International Association for Synthetic Biol ogy in Europe and the Synthetic Biology Industry Agency in the United States have taken a step towards bringing companies together and devel oping instruments such as a code of conduct for facilitating risk man agement in tools development. Eco-innovation I n d u s t r i a l a n d e n v i r o n m e n t a l b i o t e c h n o l o g y w a s d e s c r i b e d a s t h e third wave of biotechnology innovation (following health care a nd agriculture). James Greenwood (President and CEO, Biotechnology I n d u s t r y O r g a n i s a t i o n , U n i t e d S t a t e s ) p o i n t e d o u t t h a t t h e i n c r easing a t t e n t i o n t o i n n o v a t i o n i n i n d u s t r i a l b i o t e c h n o l o g y i s p a r t l y d ue to major challenges that this century is starting to face: How do we reduce our dependence on petroleum? How do we decrease pollution? How can w e i m p r o v e m a n u f a c t u r i n g p r o c e s s e s s o w e g e n e r a t e l e s s h a z a r d o u s waste and use less energy? How can these processes serve the d e v e l o p i n g w o r l d a s w e l l a s t h e y d o t h e d e v e l o p e d w o r l d ? T h e s e and m an y o th er q u es ti on s w er e r ai sed, an d i t w a s pr op o sed th at sy n t hetic biology was able to help find the answers. Synthetic biology, biotechnology and the chemical industry Sven Panke (Associate Professor of Bioprocess Engineering, Depa rt- ment for Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETHZ-Basel, Switze rland) argued that biotechnology is increasingly used in the chemical industry for the following reasons: First, it improves the chemical industry's sustainability and offers recyclability, stability and biodegradabi lity of bio-bas ed products as well as increased safety and sustainability of the p r o d u c t i o n p r o c e s s i t s e l f . A g o o d e x a m p l e o f t h e l a t t e r i s production of vitamin B12, in which bioprocesses have made it p o s s i b l e t o r e d u c e s o m e 1 2 s t e p s o f r e a c t i o n s t o o n e - s t e p fermentation. Another example is the use of biotechnology in th e production of amoxicillin to reduce the production of 50 kilo-SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 17 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 grams of waste per kilogr am of product in the 1970s to two to five kilograms today. A second driver is the ease and efficiency of using biotechnolo gy processes instead of chemistry to obtain certain end products. For example, a product marketed under the name Sorona\u00ae and developed by Dupont is a polymer composed of propanediol, a monomer that is easily made biotechnologically but is difficult to synthesise chemically. The life cycle analysis for this particu lar product shows that 35% less energy is required to produce a kilogram of propanediol using biotechnology, but both biologica l and chemical methods have similar energy balances. The main interest in using biotechnology therefore is that propanediol i s simply much more easily produced by biotechnology. W h a t c a n s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y b r i n g t o t h e c h e m i c a l i n d u s t r y ? T o d a y, b i o t e c h n o l o g y i n t h e c h e m i c a l i n d u s t r y i s m a i n l y a b o u t m e t a b o l i c engineering. However, \"traditional\" metabolic engineering is ra ising important challenges because of the complexity of metabolic pat hways. The production of a pharmaceutical composed of five precursors illus- trates this complexity. The easiest way to produce such a molec ule is to identify the enzymes that help convert glucose to these five pr ecursors in a certain number of steps and to put them together in a reac tor and o b t a i n t h e e n d p r o d u c t . H o w e v e r , i t i s d i f f i c u l t t o c o n t r o l r e a ction pathways and there is, for example, the possibility of an accum ulation of particular intermediates which creates an imbalance that may be toxic f o r t h e c e l l , m a k i n g t h e s y s t e m c o l l a p s e . B e c a u s e o f t h e c o m p l e xity of biological systems, chemical processes are sometimes considered more reliable than biotechnology. This accounts for some of the dela ys in delivering the promise of biotechnology in this industry. The complexity of biological systems frustrates their engineeri ng.

Artemisin is now produced faster and more cheaply. 18 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 It was argued that for biotechnology to reach its full potentia l in the chemical industry, synthetic biology is essential. It would all ow more predictable and faster chemical development. It would also allo w the development of more complex production pathways and novel produ cts. However, certain issues stand in the way of broader use of synt hetic biology in the chemical sector. For example, the development of chassis s t r a i n s i s s t i l l i n i t s i n f a n c y a n d t h e r e i s a l a c k o f r e g i s t r i es of high- quality parts. Access to materials is not always straightforwar d, in part because of compartmentalised intellectual property structures. Kinkead Reiling (Co-founder and Senior VP, Corporate Develop- m e n t , A m y r i s , U n i t e d S t a t e s ) a l s o p o i n t e d o u t t h a t t h e s c a l a b i l ity of synthetic biology tools has yet to be tested. Currently, synthe tic biology works at very small scales, but industry needs to produce large amounts of products, especially for biofuels. How can synthetic biology processes be scaled up? How can low-cost, profitable end products be achi eved from an innovative front-end microbe? These and many other ques tions will need to be answered to ensure the uptake of synthetic biol ogy tools and techniques by industry. Synthetic biology for bioremediation The 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of genetic engineering fo r environmental purposes. Bacteria with superior catalytic activi ties were p r o d u c e d a n d a b a c t e r i u m a b l e t o d i g e s t p e t r o l e u m o r p e t r o l e u m components was developed. Genetic engineering, and to an even greater extent synthetic bi ology, can now be used in many different ways to tackle environmental challenges: for mobilisation, such as modification of bacteria to increase their ability to absorb metal; for detection through biosensors; for transformation, such as setting up catalytic reactions to convert industry waste to CO 2 or water; for bioremediation or biodegradation. This last point raises difficult issues. Genetic engineering fo r bio- r e m e d i a t i o n p u r p o s e s g e n e r a t e d g r e a t e n t h u s i a s m i n t h e m i d - 1 9 8 0 s.

For example, the bacteria developed in laboratorie s were not robust enough to survive in the environment, and their capa city for bioremediation developed in a laboratory did not transfer readi ly to the natural environment. As in the chemical industry, the complexity of biological syste ms has hampered their use in bioremediation; engineering bacteria that a r e predictable when released in the environment has proved difficu lt. Here again synthetic biology was shown to be able to help tackle the problem conceptually by emphasising the importance of engineering princ iples (such as standardisation of parts or plasmids) blended with pri nciples of biology. Synthetic biology and the food industry A t p r e s e n t , t h e u s e o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y i n t h e f o o d i n d u s t r y i s l i m i t e d t o i n c r e m e n t a l m o d i f i c a t i o n s i n c u r r e n t p r o c e s s e s o r a p plica- tions. Vitor Martin s Dos Santos (Systems an d Synthetic Biology Group, H e l m h o l t z C e n t r e f o r I n f e c t i o n R e s e a r c h , G e r m a n y ) s h o w e d t h a t k ey contributions are likely to be made in the areas of health and nutrition. F i v e a r e a s o f t h e f o o d i n d u s t r y p a r t i c u l a r l y l i k e l y t o p r o f i t f rom synthetic biology tools and techniques were described: metabolites, health products ( e.g. vitamins) and processing aids in the man ufacture of food and food derivatives, such as nutra-ceuticals, probiotics and glycol nutrients used to raise the va lue of certain foods or nutrient-enriched plants; preservatives, an area already largely based on genetic enginee ring; flavours and fragrances; biosensors, for example to replace the human \"nose\" in the food industry with an artificial nose; food waste processing. A g r e a t d e a l o f m o n e y i s i n v e s t e d i n t h e s e f i e l d s , a n d s y n t h e t i c biology is seen as able to facilitate, enhance and reduce the c ost of pro- duction processes. An example given was the food preservative N isin. This molecule is traditionally obtained by natural fermentation o f Lactobacillus plantarum . Fermentation can be relatively inefficient, especially for these kinds of compounds from the lantibiotics f amily. A synthetic biology approach can facilitate the design of compoun ds that may be produced more efficiently than by the usual fermentation . The design of compounds beyond those found in nature will also be 20 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 possible. This will enable the food industry to enlarge its por tfolio of products. B i o s e n s o r s a r e a n o t h e r e x a m p l e o f e f f i c i e n c y g a i n s t h a t m a y b e achieved through synthetic biology. For example, it is expensiv e to e m p l o y a h u m a n n o s e t o t e s t a r o m a s ; t h e i n d u s t r y w o u l d t h e r e f o r e profit from automation of this activity. Researchers are workin g on the development of an artificial nose composed of thousands of micr o- sensors, each based on particular bacteria or enzyme systems to allow the detection of a specific compound. Challenges for developing these advances in the food industry a re s i m i l a r t o t h o s e d e s c r i b e d f o r t h e c h e m i c a l i n d u s t r y a n d b i o r e m edia- tion. Technology platform development was seen as a crucial iss ue for structuring the field. Intellectual property is also an issue: in complex s y s t e m s t h e r e a r e w o r r i e s a b o u t t h e p r o t e c t i o n o f a l l o f t h e p a rts needed to construct a system. Health and medicine Richard Kitney (Chairman of the Institute of Systems and Synthe tic Biology, Professor of Biomedical Systems Engineering, Departmen t of Bioengineering, Imperial College, United Kingdom) mentioned tha t synthetic biology is expected to bring important advances in th e field of biomedical research with the development of biosensors, vaccine s and the optimisation of drug development processes. For example, sy nthetic biology is expected to help reproduce and improve natural thera pies. Synthetic biology should make it possible to scale up and impro ve pharmaceutical production processes, as in the case of Artemisi n. Synthetic biology may also have a part to play in developing no vel, more efficient biosensors, that could be useful, for example, in tac kling poorly u n d e r s t o o d , c o m p l e x d i s e a s e s b y a l l o w i n g t h e c o l l e c t i o n o f d y n a mic quantitative data in minimally invasive ways. Further, it may i nfluence the development of personalised medicine, which aims to identif y groups with a better chance of responding to particular therapi es by using markers and other techniques to segment patient groups wi th confidence. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 21 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Synthetic biology in immunology Several applications of synthetic biology for detecting viruses , triggering antiviral activities or developing vaccines were pre sented. Frank Notka (Manager, Research and Development, Geneart, Germany) showed the opportunities that gene synthesis can offer synthetic biology. According to Notka, gene optimisation (codon choice, sequence modification) and gene synthesis can contribute signif icantly t o t h e d e v e l o p m e n t o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . T h e e x a m p l e g i v e n w a s development of a vaccine. In this case, the objective was to de velop an H I V v a c c i n e b a s e d o n H I V g e n e s , a h i g h l y d i f f i c u l t t a s k . H I V g e nes are not expressed to a high level in human cells. In order to incre ase gene expression, the codons used by the HIV were exchanged with codo ns used in human genes. The following steps were taken to define which virus strains to use, which targets to include in the vaccine, and which delivery sys tems to use. The main strain used was the C virus whose genetic sequenc e was almost integrally kept in order to include as many relevant epi topes as p o s s i b l e i n t h e a n t i g e n . F o r s a f e t y r e a s o n s , p a r t s o f t h e p r o t e ins were split, the active sites were removed an d addition al modifi catio ns were introduced to enhance the efficiency of the production and secr etion of the antigen. An algorithm was developed to optimise a given gen e e x p r e s s i o n f o r a s p e c i f i c h o s t . N e g a t i v e e l e m e n t s s u c h a s r e p e a ted sequences, RNA secondary structure and splice sites were remove d. Naked DNA and viral vectors were chosen as delivery systems: th e New York Vaccinia Ankara viral system. The final step was the clinical trial: one-half of the volunteers received the vaccinia virus only, th e other h a l f t h e s y n t h e t i c D N A e x p r e s s i o n s c o n s t r u c t . P a t i e n t r e s p o n s e to the synthetic construct was good; responders had a greater capacity t o induce memory immune cells. Roman Jerala (Head, Department o f Biotechnology, National Insti - tute of Chemistry, Sloveni a) presented two other possible appli cations of synthetic biology in the immunology domain. The first is a d evice able t o r e c o g n i s e a v i r a l i n f e c t i o n , i n t h i s c a s e H I V i n f e c t i o n , a n d trigger antiviral activity once the infection is detected. The device i s designed to detect a specific viral function (attachment of the virus to cells or HIV-specific protease activity) rather than to detect specific viral proteins, which frequently m utate i n the case of H IV an d could compromise the functioning of the device. Once the infection is detected, the device triggers mechanisms that prevent, for example, further spread o f infection or prime neighbouring cells against the virus. 22 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 The second application concerns the design of vaccines able to uncover the stealth of bacteria by making bacterial components visible to the immune system. The example given was Helicobacter pylori . The flagellin (a specific protein co n t a i n e d i n t h e f l a g e l l a o f b a c t eria) of H. pylori is not recognised by the immune system but the flagellin of E. coli is. A vaccine was designed based on a chimeric flagellin compo sed o f a s e g m e n t f r o m E. coli a n d a s e g m e n t f r o m H. pylori . This chimeric protein is able to activate the immune system and make it produ ce antigens that will recognise a future infection by H. pylori . Jerala u n d e r l i n e d t h a t t h e c o m b i n a t i o n o f i m m u n o l o g y k n o w l e d g e w i t h synthetic biology tools show great promise for developing novel therapeutics, vaccines or detection tests. Developing smart therapeutics Christina Smolke described the use of synthetic biology tools i n the field of cellular therapeutics. The example given showed how sy nthetic b i o l o g y c a n h e l p e n g i n e e r t h e i m m u n e s y s t e m t o t r e a t d i f f e r e n t diseases. Normally, T cells (one type of immune system cell) wo rk by b i n d i n g t h r o u g h r e c e p t o r s t o a p a t h o l o g i c c e l l . O n c e b o u n d , T c ells release cytolytic proteins to kill the disease cell and release d i f f e r e n t types of proteins that will send a signal to amplify the immune response as other disease cells are detected. In the case presented, the goal was to engineer receptors that would allow T cells to recognise dis ease cells that they would not normally recognise, such as cancerous cells and to build a synthetic system control that can induce the amplificat ion mechanism that does not exist in ex vivo engineered cells. The system is based on a biosensing device built through RNA construction (input/output tools). The device is able to recogn ise a drug o n c e i t i s a d m i n i s t e r e d t o a p a t i e n t . O n c e t h e d r u g i s r e c o g n i s ed, the d e v i c e e s t a b l i s h e s t h e c i r c u i t t h a t t e l l s T c e l l s t o b i n d t o t a rget cells (e.g. cancerous cells), activate and proliferate. This circuit syste m principle can be used for many different purposes; for example, it could r e c o g n i s e a b i o m a r k e r o f a c e r t a i n d i s e a s e a n d r e l e a s e a s p e c i f ic drug once it recognises the marker. Developing the field: the need s of academia and industry To move forward, synthetic biology requires the development of a better environment, including research infrastructures, educati on and intellectual property. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 23 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Research infrastructures The symposium emphasised that for synthetic biology to become a n innovation-enabling technology, strategies and mindsets that su pport the implementation of underpinning technologies, adequate resea rch infrastructures, and technology platforms had to exist. Francoi s K\u00e9p\u00e8s (Research Director, French National Centre for Scientific Resea rch, and Founding Director, The Epigenomi cs Project, Genopole, France) s uggested steps to follow to develop these supportive infrastructures: Fund blue-sky projects and ensure efficient co-operation between academia and industry . Synthetic biology was presented as lying between exploration and exploitation. Currently, exploration needs to be strengthened and the funding of underpinning studi es and blue-sky projects is especially important. As research in synthetic biology has both basic and applied aspects, small and medium-sized companies will be increasingly involved in this baseline research. Synthetic biol ogy is seen as an area in which collaboration between academia and industry will be particularly enriched by true scientific co- operation. This co-operation could suggest that academia should have the capacity to retain and capture intellectual property i n the spirit of not \"doing industry's job\", but rather maintainin g balanced relations between academia and industry. Establish technology transfer units. There remains some uncertainty over the best way to establish technology transfer units and where to locate them. In discussions, it was suggeste d that these units should be locat ed within academic laboratories . Develop full-stream translational research . There is a need to encourage multidisciplinary training of students, for example b y having PhD supervisors from biology, mathematics and physics, and by facilitating student mobility across borders. Develop technology platforms. Developing capabilities such as D N A s y n t h e s i s e r s a n d D N A r o b o t i c a s s e m b l y t h a t a r e a v a i l a b l e to both industry and academia was viewed as an important step in ensuring efficient synthetic biology research. These capabil i- t i e s c a n b e a u g m e n t e d b y b i o l o g i c a l r e s o u r c e c e n t r e s ( e.g. DNA banks, cell banks, biological models). However, it was pointed out that work is still required to adapt existing repositories to the needs of synthetic biology research ( e.g. good practice, standards).

Developing the field: case study Synthetic biology in the health industry Adriano Henney (Director, Obsidian Biomedical Consulting, Unite d Kingdom) pointed out that major pharmaceutical companies are not yet involved in synthetic biology to any gre at exte nt although the y alre ady conside r its sister fie l d \"systems biology\" as crucial to tackling complex diseases. Synthetic and systems bio logy are particularly tightly linked in the context of human biology and medicine. S y n t h e t i c b i o l o g i s t s a r e c o n f i d e n t t h a t t h e i r w o r k i s o f i n t e r e s t a n d i m p o r t a n c e t o industry. However, Henney suggested that industry needs more pr oof of utility before making significant use of synthetic biology in health in novation. Proposals to shape a more persuasive position for synthetic and systems biol ogy were put forward. For example, it was noted that from December 2000 to F ebruary 2008 the top 15 companies in the industry lost approximately USD 850 bil lion in stakeholder value and that that current processes and approaches to generat ing pharmaceuticals would not be sustainable in future. The pharmaceutical industry n e e d s t o f i n d n e w ways to innovate, and systems and synthetic biology have a part to play. Why is the pharmaceutical industry facing this crisis? Post-gen ome biology is focused on entities: isolated proteins and engineered cell lines which are outside of any physiological context. It then tries to translate the data obta ined to humans by using a s s o c i a t i ve mo de l s wh i c h ma y o r m a y n ot h a ve a re l a t ion t o hu m a n physiology. To complicate the issue, patients may be taking other drugs that c an affect the action of the target entity, but such models do not take this into accoun t.

These ke y developments in synthetic and systems biology will largely be driven by academi a, but Henney emphasised that it is important for academia and industry to st art working closely together. Academia would have to be ready to demonstrate the ap plicability of its knowledge in an industrial and commercially relevant context, a s industry in- creasingly faces economic and regulatory hurdles which reduce i ts willingness to invest in blue-sky research. To bring the benefits of synthetic and systems biology to industry, it is crucial to draw the different communities and s takeholders together to drive change. Better co-ordination is needed to create a signif icant impact and mechanisms need to be found to get industry on board.

The issue of safety is also central . Each iGEM team now has to write a report on how the safety of their proje ct relates to the world around them. Education can play a central role in ensuring advances in synth etic biology, and the very innovative iGEM competition illustrates h ow it can help the field develop. In terms of maintaining and enriching e ducation for emerging fields, Pam Silver (Professor, Department of Syste ms Biology, Harvard University, United States) raised the following questio ns: How can we ensure that students at all levels of the engineering and sc ience system become skilled? How can the training environment maintai n the l e v e l o f e x c i t e m e n t w i t h w h i c h s t u d e n t s c o m e i n t o t h e f i e l d ? H o w can students become more involved in moving from innovation to comm erciali- sation? Intellectual property challenges iGEM's open system makes parts freely accessible and exchangeab le. What would happen to this contest if parts became patentable, o r were patented? The answer is not clear, and indeed many questions re garding intellectual property in synthetic biology remains unanswered. Richard Johnson (Senior Counsel and Senior Partner (Ret.), Arnold & Por ter LLP, a n d C E O o f G l o b a l H e l i x L L C , U n i t e d S t a t e s ) r e c a l l e d t h a t t h e p atent landscape is complex, especially in synthetic biology because i t deals with a cumulative and convergent set of technologies. There is a real risk that patent thickets will hinder the ability to do researc h and commercialise applications. Much has been done to attempt to clarify how patenting should b e o r g a n i s e d i n t h e f i e l d o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . M a n y i n t h e f i e l d advocate openness and minimal patenting, but others indicate that, in so me cases, a strong intellectual property regime that can be contro lled is the best way to protect openness. The major issues raised by Johnso n were: SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 27 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Patents. T h e w o r l d o f p a t e n t s i s c o m p l e x , e s p e c i a l l y f o r a discipline like synthetic biology which relies on the convergen ce of multiple disciplines. Moreover, there is a range of unresolv ed patent issues that will have a major impact in shaping the futu re o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y ( e.g. patentability, how prior art is applied, non-obviousness). Material transfer agreements. There are major concerns over o w n e r s h i p a n d a c c e s s t o m a t e r i a l a n d i n f o r m a t i o n c r e a t e d t h r o u g h s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y .

Interaction and bundles of rights . There are potentially some very interesting issues around design rights, especially in Europe. In the United Kingdom, 10 to 15 years ago, there was a series of cases concerning interoperability of parts, and there was a \"must fit, must match\" exemption to intellectual property rules for designs. Does this apply for synthetic biology? Database operation. Information and materials ( e.g. parts) e m e r g i n g f r o m s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y r e s e a r c h a r e a l r e a d y b e i n g placed in registries or other types of database. There is conce rn about the operation of these databases. OECD publications on human genetic research databases, as well as the guidelines on biological resource centres, already address some of these issues. Copyright. Copyright protects originality and expression. In synthetic biology, an increasi ng decoupling of design from manufacturers and processes might increase the likelihood of copyright issues. Trademark. Biobricks have value. Logos and trademarks are important quality control tools. An important point, often raised when talking about synthetic biology and intellectual property, is the question of openness. Competi- tive visions of openness were described: \"Open source\" is a term which is often misinterpreted. It relie s o n a v e r y r o b u s t i n t e l l e c t u a l p r o p e r t y s y s t e m . T o b e e f f e c t i v e , \"copyleft\" and other types of licences require a very efficient and effective intellectual property system. 28 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 O p e n i n n o v a t i o n i s a n i m p o r t a n t n o t i o n f o r i n d u s t r y a n d u n i - versities. Johnson mentioned that \"you don't have to do it all or to be vertically integrated\". One can, for example, take strate gic opportunities that are not a core part of the business outside of the company. I n t h e s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y c o m m u n i t y , t h e t e r m \" s e m i - c o m m o n s \" i s increasingly used to emphasise that biological parts are intera cting c o m m o n s a n d a t t h e s a m e t i m e f o r p r i v a t e u s e . T h e s e r e s o u r c e s a re dynamic, scalable and can adjust to different mechanisms. Johnson pointed out a number of other IP issues in synthetic biology. A clash of cultures is likely to become an issue. A ph arma- ceutical company, a chemical industry, a university or a semico nductor company all see intellectual property rights differently, and i t is difficult t o a l i g n t h e i r i n t e r e s t s . T h e s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y c o m m u n i t y i s a l so built a r o u n d t r u s t b e c a u s e t h e o u t p u t v o l u m e i s r e l a t i v e l y s m a l l . A s the community grows, there will be a transition from trust to contr act, and the role of intellectual property will be particularly importan t. Innovation in synthetic biology is going to be user-driven. Joh nson emphasised that it is important to think of policies as user-fo cused rather than, as is commonly the case, producer-oriented. Open d evelop- ment is another important issue. It needs to be community-drive n and align its needs with priorities in shared resources and open ac cess. A s s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y i s a n e m e r g i n g f i e l d , c o m p a r i s o n w i t h o t h e r fields is useful when thinking about intellectual property.

The work of the OECD and the National Academies on dif ferent types of collaborative mechanisms also offers good sources of r eferences. Investment model for synthetic biology Government funding agencies, philanthropic foundations and priv ate investors gave an overview of in vestments in synthetic biology and the challenges that could affect investment in the field. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 29 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Factors influencing investment Investment in synthetic biology relies on different factors, an d Mark Waxman (Partner and Chair of the Health Care Industry Team, Fol ey and Co., United States) noted the following: the perception of synthetic biology by the public; the regulatory regime that will be devel oped for synthetic biology; the need or not for product liability insura nce; industry involvement; and patent thickets and intellectual prop erty models. T h e i n d u s t r y a n d t h e v e n t u r e c o m m u n i t y a r e l o o k i n g f o r w e a l t h c r e a t i o n a n d s u s t a i n a b i l i t y . A c c o r d i n g t o G r e g K i s o r ( V i c e P r e s ident, Investor Relations, Intellectual Ventures, United States), the public good alone is not sufficient to attract venture funds, so innovation might have to rely on philanthropy and government funding. IP rights under pin the ability to create wealth, which is critical for attracting vent ure investments. Companies that work with venture investment models i n intellectual property are currently little involved in syntheti c biology. Kisor specified that synthetic biology is a small part of an in vestment in two of his company's funds. It was proposed that to help fund t he next generation of research, governments might look at grants and co nsider whether they lead to intellectual property. If so, governments should take the IP rights and make them more generally available. A further influence on the development of synthetic biology is the balance of investment between tools and applications. It is dif ficult to k n o w w h e t h e r m o r e f u n d i n g i s c u r r e n t l y a l l o c a t e d t o b u i l d t h e n ext generation of applications or to enhance tool development direc tly. As a first impression, discussants felt that funding seems to be mor e oriented towards applications. Philanthropic funding Several grants from philanthropic organisations are directed towards synthetic biology. Paula Olsiewski (Program Director, A lfred P. Sloan Foundation, United States) stressed the significant invol vement of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in synthetic biology, especially i n governance issues. In order to improve understanding of ethical , social a n d p o l i c y i s s u e s b y s c i e n t i s t s a n d e n g i n e e r s a n d t o i m p r o v e u n der- standing of science and engineering by policy makers, journalis ts and the public, the Sloan Foundation has invested at least USD 2 mi llion in addressing societal issues raised by synthetic biology. 30 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 I n 2 0 0 5 , t h e S l o a n F o u n d a t i o n f u n d e d a g r a n t w h i c h w a s a j o i n t venture between the J.

The Foundation also actively participates in Synthetic Biology #.0 meetings throughout the world, particularly in sessions on societal issu es. Recent engagements of the Foundation include the present symposium, pr o- jects with the Hastings Center, the Woodrow Wilson Internationa l Center for Scholars, and the Venter Institute. The European Commission funding plan The European Commission is investing in syn thetic b iology as pa rt of a wider structure of investment. Two sets of projects were l aunched and some continue through publications or public relations, suc h as Synbiosafe or TESSY. Ioannis Economidis (Principal Scientific O fficer, European Commission) pointed out that the idea is to cover not only basic research linked to synthetic biology but also more applie d topics such as medicine, new generations of pharmaceuticals, new chemi cals, environment and energy. The current funding programme of the European Commission is the Seventh Framework Programme. It covers funding for seven years at a l e v e l o f E U R 5 3 b i l l i o n . T h i s f u n d i n g p r o g r a m m e h a s s e v e r a l d i m en- sions. One is linked to basic research and includes some projec ts on s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y .

The major funding comes from the Cross Co-ope ration Programmes which encourage young scholars to exchange their exp eri- ences. Synthetic biology might also be funded under health, env ironment and nanomaterials development. It was noted that in the context of the Knowledge-based Bioecon omy Programme of the European Commission, synthetic biology is cons idered an advanced tool, and a merging of biotechnology knowledge esse ntial to promote bioeconomy. An investment of EUR 1 million has been dedicated to using synthetic biology to find solutions to envir onmental issues and aspects of bior emediation. T his program me brings sch olars together to create critical mass for work on these particular i ssues. A further investment of EUR 3 million is under discussion to broa den the i s s u e a n d t o t r y t o u n d e r s t a n d h o w s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y c o u l d a d v a nce biotechnology more broadly.

The interest of this second is to ensure that Febit has access to the most advanced technologies and to have ready access to risk management for th e risks that could result from the company's activity. Outstanding issues: developing a roadmap for investment The discussion made clear the need for a comprehensive study of investments in synthetic biology. Answers to a range of questio ns would help clarify how the field is organised. These include: Is fund ing directed more towards applications than towards tools? Who is investing in tools and who is investing in applications? Do countries differ in th is respect? Is there a fundamental difference between the two types of inve stment, given that synthetic biology is still an emerging science and t he link between applications and tools is still very tight? Developing a roadmap for funding agencies and government to hel p them plan how and when to invest in synthetic biology was sugge sted as a us ef ul o ut co m e o f th e m eeti n g an d a n e xt s tep . Mor e t ha n s imply focusing on synthetic biology, the roadmap could help ensure th at investments work to improve processes in engineering biology mo re broadly. It was mentioned that the synthetic biology community would hav e to have all the tools and resources it needs to make this field m o v e forward. The consensus seemed to be that this is currently not the case. 32 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Governance issues related to synthetic biology Biosafety R o b u s t r e g u l a t i o n s f o r t h e s a f e u s e o f b i o t e c h n o l o g y a n d r e c o m - b i n a n t D N A t e c h n o l o g y a r e i n p l a c e , a n d i t w a s c o n t e n d e d t h a t n o known incidents have occurred. However, synthetic biology is fr e- quently conceived as an extension of these established technolo gies, and perhaps a step change, so it is frequently asked if current biosafety procedures and regulations are sufficient. In response, regulat ors and synthetic biologists typically argue that current regulatory re gimes are a d e q u a t e f o r t h e w o r k t h e y d o . I n c o n t r a s t , i t i s m o r e c o m m o n l y acknowledged that adaptation may be required with regard to bio - security. However, it was argued that biosafety and biosecurity should not be treated as separate issues. They face many of the same p roblems, i n clu di n g the s am e r o ot i s sue: how to as ses s an d r e spon d t o r i s k. The following difficulties concerning safety and security for synth etic biology were identified: It is more difficult to identify agents of concern . Taxonomy c a n a c t a s a g u i d e t o p a t h o g e n i c i t y , b u t i t i s l e s s u s e f u l f o r s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . N o v e l o r g a n i s m s w o u l d p r e s e n t a p a r t i c u l a r challenge because of the lack of prior experience. Identifying sequences with pathogenic properties is also difficult, and con - ventional tools may no l onger be appropriate. Science and politics have changed since the initial rDNA regulations . Things have moved on since Asilomar. Science and technology are increasingly available and easy to access, and t he proliferation and distribution of knowledge makes oversight increasingly difficult. In the lab, the intermingling of discip lines helps synthetic biology progress, but awareness and training in biosafety issues differ across disciplines. Outside the lab, heightened security threats increase attention to biotechnolo-gies as possible sources of harmful agents. The context for biosafety may have changed . Notions of \"harm\" - what should be prevented and how to do it - are fluid. For example, debate continues over the meaning of the \"natural e n v i r o n m e n t \" t h a t i s u n d e r t h r e a t f r o m b i o t e c h n o l o g i c a l i n t e r -ventions. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 33 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 The purpose of regulation may not be clear and needs to be examined . For example, regulation may serve a technical need or may aim to allay public anxiety. These challenges suggest that synthetic biology offers an oppor - tunity to revisit established concepts in biosafety and biosecu rity.

RNA viruses include those responsible for influenza, mumps, measles, ebola and HIV. The first infectious cDNA clone of an R NA virus (polio) was reported in 1981 and work on infectious viruses has led to better understanding of their life cycle and pathogenesis and p rogress in anti-viral drug and vaccine development.

I n 2 0 0 2 t h e f i r s t chemical synthesis of polio virus, using only sequence informat ion, was achieved. The synthesis of polio is comparatively easy.

Perhaps more than the threat of bioterrorism, the relative ease o f production of viruses raises the chances of accident. There are documented cases of virus leaks from laboratories, including sm allpox in the United Kingdom (1978), SARS in Singapore (2003) and Chin a (2004), and several cases of accidental polio release, includin g the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n i n 2 0 0 3 o f a l a b o r a t o r y s t r a i n c i r c u l a t i n g i n t h e general population.

In pa rticular, the report Addressing Biosecurity Concerns Related to the Synthesis of Select Agents noted biosafety concerns arising from the diverse institutiona l settings and disciplinary backgrounds of practitioners of synth etic b i o l o g y . S o m e o f t h o s e u n d e r t a k i n g r e s e a r c h i n s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y are educated in disciplines that do not routinely conduct formal tr aining in b i o s a f e t y , a n d N S A B B f o u n d s o m e a r e u n c l e a r a s t o t h e c i r c u m s t a nces under which they should consult their Institutional Biosafety C ommit- tees (IBC). Furthermore, some research is now undertaken in ins titu- t i o n s s u c h a s h i g h s c h o o l s w h i c h d o n o t h a v e a c c e s s t o a n I B C . Taken together with technical advances that fall outside the scope of t h e guidelines (such as synthesised RNA viruses and synthetic DNA t hat is synthesised de novo ) a trans-federal policy co-ordination process took the decision to modify the NIH guidelines. The NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), which advises the Director of the NIH on rDNA research, was charged w ith considering the application of the NIH guidelines t o s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . The RAC looked at the degree to which this technology is covere d, and whether the scope of the guidelines needs to be modified to cap ture synthetic biology research. The RAC made a series of proposed m odifi- cations including: a revised definition of rDNA molecules; an e xemption for synthetic nucleic acids that cannot replicate, provided the y are not used in human gene transfer; and an update of the \"spirit claus e\". This clause recognises that mitigating risk depends in large measure on the motivati on an d good judg ement of individuals and that all conce ivable experiments involving recombinant and synthetic DNA cannot be foreseen. It is therefore proposed to emphasise that new geneti c mani- pul ati on te c hn i q u es m ay e n ab le w or k t o b e a cc om pli she d fa ster , more efficiently or at larger scale, and to reiterate that as the fi eld develops, the guidelines may need to be updated. It was noted that the NIH guidelines are not legally binding al though a d h e r e n c e t o t h e m i s a c o n d i t i o n o f o b t a i n i n g a g r a n t f o r r e s e a rch f u n d e d b y t h e N I H , a n d o t h e r f u n d i n g b o d i e s h a v e a d o p t e d t h e g u ide- lines as best practice. Because the guidelines apply at the ins titutional SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 35 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 level, it is the responsibility of IBCs to ensure compliance.

The NIH is aware of IBCs that are reviewing their work in the light of synthetic biology. The approach taken by the NIH is th erefore to work with practitioners and oversight committees toward shared goals rather than act as a sanctioning and regulatory body. The NIH guidelines apply only to research, but synthetic biolog y is also covered by existing regulations, in particular when used f or commercial purposes. It is not, or would not be, regulated as s ynthetic biology per se b u t a c c o r d i n g t o i t s u s e , f o r e x a m p l e i n d u s t r i a l b i o - t e c h n o l o g y , c o n s u m e r p r o d u c t s o r a g r i c u l t u r e , b y t h e r e l e v a n t f ederal agency.

One issue was left hanging: Would we recognise the point at whi ch evolving synthetic biology research posed a fundamental challen ge to the current regulatory structure, a challenge that could not be m e t b y modifying existing structures? Biosecurity \"Synthetic biology presents risks, but so does biology and in f act so does everything we do on a day-to-day basis\", said Michael Impe riale (Arthur F.

Technologies . Imperiale divided synthetic biology into two types of technologies: genome sy nthesis and engineering. Both s e t s o f t e c h n o l o g i e s p r e s e n t r i s k s . A s n o t e d , g e n o m e s y n t h e s i s allows the synthesis of virus genomes and, eventually, the derivation of a virus from this genome. It may also become possible to build de novo an organism which can escape current system controls. Engineering techniques include molecular shuffling or self-replicating systems which might also pose security threats. The following actions would help integrate al l the components needed to evaluate risk and ensure an efficient regulatory framework for synthetic biology: - Develop uniform and standardised screening tools to deter- mine what is dangerous and what is not, especially in the case of synthetic genomics. - Develop a rationalised list of agents to determine the most dangerous or risky and prioritise screening. This is difficult, however, an d managing risk in this case is complex because the mechanisms of pathogenic agents are not fully under- stood and it is currently difficult to identify agents that may be hazardous. - Build a database of risky sequences or experiments to help stratify and keep track of risk. Practitioners. Practitioners include traditional scientists, other g r o u p s s u c h a s i G E M c o m p e t i t o r s a n d , p e r h a p s a t s o m e p o i n t , t e r r o r i s t s . A l t h o u g h i t i s i m p o r t a n t t o b e m i n d f u l o f r i s k s associated with terrorism, the risks posed by the scientific enterprise itself were presented as needing immediate attention .

SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 37 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 The public .

I t i s important to engage the public in dialogue and discuss potentia l risks and benefits. Debates are already taking place concerning the safety, securit y and ethical aspects of emerging technologies. The presentation poin ted out that it is important to look into these debates and learn from the past. It was suggested that industry should start a dialogue with the p u b l i c a n d s h o u l d e n g a g e i n e s t a b l i s h i n g a f r a m e w o r k t o r e g u l a t e synthetic biology, especially in terms of providing relevant da ta.

It was noted that there are more discussions about the adequacy of the regulatory framework in the United States than in E u r o p e b e c a u s e t h e o r i g i n a l n e t w o r k o f r e g u l a t i o n s i s s o m e w h a t stricter in Europe.

A number of instruments which may be of inte rest for synthetic biology regulation were analysed ( e.g. federal regulation to monitor and control DNA synthesis; guidelines; harmonisation an d controls; education and training programmes; and a committee to check and control synthetic biology research). Nicolas B\u00e9card (Projec t Manager, Secretariat of National Defence, France) presented four recomme nda- tions that emerged from this analysis: 38 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Adaptation to limit malicious applications . Instruments are already in place to limit malicious application. There is an international regulation with United Nation resolutions. The chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons C o n v e n t i o n n o r m a l l y l i m i t t h e r i s k o f d e v e l o p m e n t o f n e w agents. There are also European regulations for export control. The list of biological and chemical items is determined by the Australia group list. European regulations for biological risk and warfare are more oriented towards biosafety but deal with some issues raised by biosecurity. Specific regulations in place in different countries allow for control over the order of DNA par ts (this includes DNA synthesis, DNA sequences, micro-organisms and toxins). However, according to B\u00e9card, further analysis is required to ascertain whether these regulations are sufficient to cover all the risks that synthetic biology could raise. This wo rk is ongoing in France. Controlling DNA synthesis . I t s e e m s d i f f i c u l t t o c o n t r o l D N A synthesis directly from a biosecurity point of view.

In France, the French Academy of Science has reported that by developing a good awareness and education programme for the scientific community, biosecurity could be significantly improv ed, and conferences and seminars are given on this topic to train a nd inform scientists. Some university degrees have modules dealing w i t h b i o s e c u r i t y a n d b i o s a f e t y i s s u e s a n d o t h e r s a r e b e i n g developed. B\u00e9card said that these recommendations are not specifically dir ected at synthetic biology, but are for all emerging technologies. Fr ance will have guidelines specifically dealing with biosecurity for synth etic biology. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 39 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Public engagement and participation A drive to engage with the public and promote discussion of the i s s u e s r a i s e d b y s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y h a s c o m e b o t h f r o m w i t h i n t h e synthetic biology community and from outside (for example from policy m a k e r s , c i v i l s o c i e t y g r o u p s a n d r e s e a r c h f u n d e r s ) . I t i s n o t c lear why some forms of science and technology provoke calls for public d ialogue, w h i l e o t h e r s d o n o t , a l t h o u g h i t w a s s u g g e s t e d t h a t o n e f a c t o r is the extent to which that science or technology is framed as new or emerging. Synthetic biology obviously falls into this category. Accepting that public engagement and dialogue are important for s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y , q u e s t i o n s r e m a i n . T h e s e i n c l u d e : W h a t i s m e a nt by \"the public\", especially in a global environment? How is the pu blic to be engaged and do we have successful models? Will engagement succe ed with so few products to talk of? What is the role of the media? Delegates discussed studies on emerging public views of synthetic biology , the potential participants in engagement, and the functions and rol es of the media. Emerging public views on synthetic biology A study undertaken by the Woodrow Wilson Center Synthetic Biology Project explored public awareness and views on syntheti c biology in the United States. The research consisted of a repre sentative national telephone poll and two focus groups (one with female a nd one with male participants). The results were compared with those o f focus g r o u p s i n t h e U n i t e d K i n g d o m a s p a r t o f t h e R o y a l A c a d e m y o f Engineering inquiry into synthetic biology, and with earlier wo rk undertaken on nanotechnologies. In the poll, 67% had not heard of synthetic biology (nanotechno logy i s b e t t e r k n o w n , w i t h 4 9 % h a v i n g n o t h e a r d t h e t e r m b e f o r e ) .

Both males and females c on- sidered biofuels the most promising potential application, a fi nding reflected in the UK research. Drugs for treating diseases, and new ways to treat cancer and clean up the environment were also well sup ported. W h e n a s k e d w h o i s b e s t p l a c e d t o r e g u l a t e o r m a n a g e r i s k s associated with synthetic biology, participants did not think i ndustry should have full responsibility for testing their products. The f e d e r a l government was considered most appropriate for managing risks, but females also tended to favour the scientific community and othe rs 40 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 i n v o l v e d i n a d v a n c e m e n t s t o r e g u l a t e s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y .

Generally, however, participants did not favour a morator ium, and recommendations for the road ahead, such as increasing trus t through openness and transparency, were similar across the Atla ntic. The research also pointed to potential challenges for communica - t i o n a b o u t s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y t o t h e p u b l i c . F o r e x a m p l e , D a v i d Rejeski (Director, Foresight and Governance Project, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, United States) noted that th e reaction o f p a r t i c i p a n t s w h e n f i r s t i n t r o d u c e d t o t h e t e r m s y n t h e t i c b i o logy \"pushed buttons that nanotech never pushed for them\". It may be that the term will be a liability in a way that \"nanotechnology\" is not. Added to this, a convergence of factors might mean that there is high potential for risk amplification. These factors include: greater public a nxiety over biological issues and threats following the H1N1 pandemic; a ge neral decline in the number of dedicated science journalists; a decli ne in trust in government agencies; and the possible rise of new opponents. T h e last of these factors is based on research by Kahan et al. who showed t h a t a g r o u p k n o w n a s \" e n v i r o n m e n t a l r i s k n a y s a y e r s \" , w h o a r e typically unconcerned by potentially hazardous issues such as n uclear p o w e r , c l i m a t e c h a n g e a n d b o v i n e s p o n g i f o r m e n c e p h a l o p a t h y ( B S E ), show concern for synthetic biology. Why this should be requires further exploration, and this is ju st one suggested avenue for further research on the public and communi cation aspects of the field. Other near-term needs include applied res earch on public attitudes and perceptions, including international compa risons that may be used as a basis for a communication and engagement strategy. Differing reactions to synthetic biology across natio ns and r e g i o n s c a n a f f e c t t h e f u t u r e g e o g r a p h y o f s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y . F or example, the generally negative public reaction to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Europe is well documented and the economic loss to the US economy of the failure of GMOs on the European market may be some USD 300-400 million a year. However, research commissio ned for the Royal Academy of Engineering inquiry into synthetic bio logy found a more positive reaction to synthetic biology, including the term itself, than from US counterparts. It was suggested that UK par ticipants preferred to learn more about the science and technology before making a judgement. SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 41 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 The increasingly global nature of modern life sciences is an important consideration in discussions of the meaning and signi ficance of synthetic biology. It will not be possible, nor would it be desirable, for public debate and dialogue to be restricted to a few countries and a few experts. Facilitated by information communication technologies, b o t h the science and the debate about the science will be widely kno wn. Participants in engagement Robert Cook-Deegan (Director, IGSP Center for Genome Ethics, La w and Policy, Duke University, United States) argued that emergin g r e s e a r c h p o i n t s t o a d i f f i c u l t p u b l i c l a n d s c a p e f o r s y n t h e t i c b iology: it has an unfavourable name; no apparent communication strategy; n o clear leadership; and no media channels through which to pass o n information. Yet it was suggested that the issues raised by syn thetic biology are shared by many new technologies, such as neuroscien ce, stem cells and agricultural biotechnology. It was argued, there fore, that the task is not to educate all the public so that anyone and ev eryone can enter policy discussions, but to determine which broad set of s take- ho lder s i s li k ely to b e af fe cte d b y thi s te ch n ol og y an d b r i n g t hem into discussions. This needs to be done with an awareness of the bro ad n a t u r e o f t h e s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y r e s e a r c h b a s e i n t e r m s o f t h e r ange of research agendas that constitute \"synthetic biology\" and the fa ct that s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y i s b e i n g d e v e l o p e d b o t h w i t h i n a n d o u t s i d e o f t h e traditional arenas of science and technology R&D. The iGEM comp eti- ti on an d th e r i se o f t he \"g ar ag e b i ote ch n ol og i st\" i ll u str at e th is. A wide range of people therefore need to be engaged in policy discussi ons. Media roles Some see reasons for optimism in public communication regarding synthetic biology. Adam Bly (Founder, CEO and Editor in Chief, Seed Media) argued that synthetic biology arrives at a time when US govern- ment support for science is at an all-time high, and science is currently considered essential to the vitality of the nation. Synthetic b iology can b e p a r t o f t h i s p o s i t i v e v i e w o f s c i e n c e . F u r t h e r m o r e , t h e s y n t hetic biology community is quite ready to explore non-traditional med ia as a channel for communicating their work. This means that synthetic b i o l o g i s t s c o u l d a u g m e n t , e v e n c i r c u m v e n t , t r a d i t i o n a l m e d i a s o urces and more closely control their messages. 42 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Bly argued that traditional media may \"fail\" synthetic biologis ts because they lack the required scientific literacy to deal with a field that is this complex, challenging and developing at a rapid pace. Bl y summed u p h i s p o s i t i o n b y s t a t i n g , \" I w o u l d n ' t e v e n c o n t e m p l a t e t h e n e ed for mainstream media ...; bypass it and focus on new tools for scie ntific c o m m u n i c a t i o n . \" H e a r g u e d t h a t t h e s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y c o m m u n i t y has an opportunity to revise and reform science communication and s cience literacy based on three factors: a shared sense of social respo nsibility w i t h i n t h e s y n t h e t i c b i o l o g y c o m m u n i t y t h a t w i l l a p p e a l t o t h e wider public; synthetic biology has the potential to be a participato ry science; the open and transparent forms of communication currently prefe rred b y m a n y w i t h i n t h e c o m m u n i t y a r e r e a d i l y t r a n s f e r a b l e a n d a l r e a dy a c c e s s i b l e t o t h e p u b l i c . M o r e o v e r , b e c a u s e i t i s c h a r a c t e r i s e d b y unpredictability, synthetic biology can pave the way for a new form of debate about science, in which unpredictability and uncertainly a r e openly discussed. Bly suggested unpredictability is likely to b e an increasing feature of future science. The synthetic biology community is already undertaking some public engagement both passively (through researchers' use of o pen access web-based tools) and actively. When added to initiatives under- taken and planned by other organisations ( e.g. the Woodrow Wilson Center, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the UK research counc ils), the question arises whether communication and engagement call f or a m o r e d e t a i l e d a n d c o - o r d i n a t e d s t r a t e g y . I t w a s e v e n i n f a c t a s ked whether it would make any difference if there were no public en gage- ment effort at all. Some participants felt that there was little need for a public e n g a g e m e n t s t r a t e g y . H o w e v e r , t h i s w a s s e t a g a i n s t t h e e x a m p l e s o f G M O s a n d h u m a n g e n e t h e r a p y ( H G T ) . I t w a s s u g g e s t e d t h a t a b e t t er public engagement strategy in the early development of GMOs mig ht have led to a more productive technology that better matched pe rceived needs. In the case of HGT, it was suggested that powerful relig ious groups in the United States lobbied the federal administration and influenced decision making. This was viewed as a narrow evidenc e base on which to base policy. Wider dialogue about emerging science and technology may lead to different outcomes. It was also noted that in the United Kingdom and elsewhere ther e is a general move away from communication strategies that resemble marketing campaigns towards initiatives that foster dialogue am ong scientists, policy makers and the public with a view to feeding i n t o decision making at the research and policy levels. This is the aim of SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report - 43 \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 f o r t h c o m i n g e f f o r t s b y t h e U K r e s e a r c h c o u n c i l s . I n t h e U n i t e d States, engagement initiatives linked to policy processes already exist . For example, as part of the redraft of the above-mentioned NIH guid elines, proposed changes were considered at a conference involving stak e- holders. However, the number of public participants was describ ed as disappointing, although turn-out from civil society groups was better and led to rich discussion. 44 - SYMPOSIUM ON OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE EMERGING FIELD OF SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY: Synthesis Report \u00a9 OECD, ROYAL SOCIETY 2010 Annex Agenda of the Symposium: Opportunities and Challenges in the Emerging Field of Synthetic Biology Under the auspices of The U.S. National Academies The Organisation for Economic Co -Operation and Development (OEC D) The Royal Society 9-10 July 2009 The National Academies' Keck Center 500 5th Street, NW Washington, DC Thursday, 9 July Welcome: Ralph J.
