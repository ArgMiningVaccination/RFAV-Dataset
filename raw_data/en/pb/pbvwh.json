I have been into athletics since my school days. I love playing outdoor sports. Now, I am 28years and am married since last 1 year. Soon after marriage with all the house routines becoming a task for me has taken a toll on my health and I am a gym freak. I have never experienced this before but since last 6 months I get tired very easily and cannot tolerate doing the exercises I once would enjoy doing. As a sports person I have always taken homoeopathy every time I would be injured or was ill. When I started feeling so tired, I visited my homoeopathic doctor and on seeing me she immediately advised me to first get my thyroid hormone test done. I was detected with Hypothyroid. As she knew me since a long time, she prescribed me homoeopathic medicine and I was asked to keep a regular check on my thyroid hormones. Slowly and steadily I was able to cope with my new married life routines and my thyroid was also back to normal. I again started doing workouts the way I use to do it before. Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland becomes underactive. Defective development of thyroid gland can lead to hypothyroidism at birth. Sometimes the body starts making its own antibodies which in turn fight against the thyroid gland and lead to hypothyroidism. Previous surgery of thyroid gland can lead to hypothyroidism. Over treatment of hyperthyroidism may lead to hypothyroidism. Person suffering from hypothyroidism suffer from tiredness without much physical or mental work, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, sore muscles, lack of energy, hairloss, constipation, slow heart beats and feel cold in warm weathers. Homoeopathic Treatment for Hypothyroid Conventional treatment causes drug dependency unlike homoeopathy which is non-addictive. Homoeopathy is a holistic multi-factorial approach. Homoeopathy deals with individual case taking which helps to identify the distressing symptoms of thyroid, stress at physical and mental level, associated complaints. Homoeopathy are natural medicines and help to attain balance in thyroid functioning which helps to regulate weight, hairloss, skin pigmentation, physical weakness, mental weakness, pains, digestive troubles like constipation and enhances absorption. Homoeopathic medicines improve the immunity levels which help to enhance the nutrient absorption and assimilation. Homoeopathy improves the overall general health. If a person is on conventional medicine then slowly and steadily the doses can be slowly tapered. Self help for Hypothyroid Regular checkups are a must and report the changes, if any, to your doctor. Caffeinated drinks and dairy products should be avoided. Regular exercise helps to reduce stress and a high fibre diet often helps in maintaining thyroid function and preventing constipation. Apply a good moisturizing cream to combat dryness caused due to hypothyroid. Consume fruits, dry-fruits, green vegetables, beans and legumes in adequate amounts to combat nutritional deficiencies. Any nutritional supplement should be taken under the guidance of your doctor. "}
