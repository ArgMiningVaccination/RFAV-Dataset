Have you been told that your labs are normal but still aren't feeling well? Are you wanting to improve your body literacy and become empowered to live your best life? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you are in the right place! My mission is to be a resource, educator, and health-detective for women looking to improve their health in an individualized, holistic way. I help you reach your health goals through a comprehensive review of your story along with a root-cause analysis of your symptoms using a functional medicine approach. Over the past decade, I have been helping women achieve their wellness goals so they can get back to being their best selves. "}
