Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a healthcare system dating back thousands of years. Rather than merely treating symptoms, this medicine focuses on building and correcting the body's own vital energy so the body can heal itself. TCM is based on a philosophy of balance. When we are balanced, health and wellbeing exist. When we are out of balance, illness or disease can manifest. TCM uses many modalities including acupuncture, herbal medicine, diet, exercise, body work, and food therapy to achieve this balance. Acupuncture & Acupressure Acupuncture is a method of balancing and building the body's life force energy known as \"qi\" or \"chi\". During your initial visit a full health history will be taken, allowing your practitioner to make a thorough TCM diagnosis and treatment plan. Acupuncturists gently insert tiny disposable needles along pathways called meridians through which this energy circulates. These noninvasive treatments can enhance immunity, support both physical and emotional health, alleviate pain, and improve overall wellbeing. Acupuncture and other modalities of Chinese Medicine help bring the body into a balance and promote an optimal state of health. In the treatment of children, gentle acupressure with small, pain-free tools is often used in place of needles. For these reasons, TCM can be helpful to anyone of any age.
