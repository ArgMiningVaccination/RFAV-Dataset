In The Virus and the Host, naturopathic doctor Chris Chlebowski, teaches readers how to take control of their health - and decrease susceptibility to infectious viral disease, such as COVID-19, before it strikes. The book demonstrates how robust health, good immunity, low inflammation, low toxic burden and freedom from stealth infection and chronic disease is our best defence against infectious viral disease. Dr. Chlebowski contends we need to take better care of our health before disaster strikes: improving our diets, losing weight, exercising and managing stress. The way our bodies interact with infectious disease is complicated - both a function of the \"germ\" (virus) and the \"terrain\" (host). In Part 1 of The Virus and the Host, Dr. Chlebowski describes emerging science on the virome as well as how toxic exposure, chronic inflammation, stealth infections and chronic diseases interact and predispose us to poor outcomes from acute viral infection. As we move forward from the tragedy that was COVID-19, it is essential that we come together to learn from our mistakes and work hard - and work together - to prevent a similar crisis, or worse, in the future. It is likely we will see more pandemics in the next decade. When we do, we need to be better prepared. Now is the time to do something and it is the best investment we can make so that when - not if - the next \"big one\" hits we can keep our loved ones and ourselves safe and healthy. "}
