The work is intended to facilitate the standa rdization of extracts and products of A. sinensis , which may be used for evaluating safety and efficacy in human clinical trials. The following specific aims were addressed in this study. 1. A series of approaches were established in order to botanically verify raw materials of A. sinensis . 2. The phytochemical investigation of bioactive principles from A. sinensis was conducted guided by a 5-HT 7 receptor binding assay. As a result, two botanical samples were verified as Angelica sinensis , and six new compounds of angeliferulate 17 known including five phthalides ( 1-4, 13), a and others ( 10, 12, 15-18) were isolated and identified. Some of these comp ounds exhibited serotonergic and GABAergic activities in the 5-HT 7 and GABAa competitive receptor binding assays, which might contribute to the pharmacological effects of A. sinensis related to premenstrual symptoms. At the same time, the spectral data included in the text might serve as refe rence data for future dereplication and identification of isolates from this plant or from other species. 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. INTRODUCTION AN D SCOPE OF STUDY In Asia, the dried root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Dong Quai or Dang Gui) has been used for centuries as a women's tonic for alleviating PMS, menstrual cramps, and symptoms related to menopause, and is regarded as the second most important herb ( Panax ginseng being the first) among thousands of herbs. It has been used broadly as a dietary supplement for perimenopausal symptoms in the West. Although suspected by some of having estrogenic activities based on its use for women's diseases, A. sinensis has not been reported to display remarkable estrogenicity pharmacologically or clinically. This suggests an alternative mechanism for its potential efficacy for its treatment of gynecological disorders. As interest increases in A. sinensis products, the development of botani cally, chemically and biologically standardized extracts is becoming n ecessary and important for the acquisition of safe and efficacious pr oducts, as well as for use in well-controlled clinical trials. Our preliminary data (Table 5) showed that a methanol extract of A. sinensis roots exhibited serotonergic activity with a 59 % inhibition of [ 3H] LSD binding to the 5-HT 7 receptor at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL, and a 97% inhibition of the binding of [3H] diazepam to the GABAa ( -aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter receptor) at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. The hypothesis proposed herein is that Angelica sinensis contains active constituents that elicit serotonergic and GABAergic effects. The following two specific aims will be addressed in this project in accordance with the above stated hypothesis. Aim 1 . Establishment of analytical meth ods used for verification of plant raw materials. 2 Acquisition and verification of plant materials was the first step in this project and was critical for the acquisit ion of reproducible samples as well as for future evaluation of the safety and ef ficacy of the extract. To botanically verify the plant materials, a series of analytical techniques was validated and used including the examination of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, thin layer chromatogr aphy (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprints. Aim 2 . Isolation and identification of bioactive markers by conducting bioassay-guided fractionation and isolation. Plant materials authenticated in Ai m 1 were extracted with methanol, and then subjected to partitioning wi th pet ether (PE), chloroform (CHCl partitions were subjected to chromatographic fractionation using a 5-HT 7 receptor binding assay in collaboration with personnel in Project 2. A series of chromatographic techniques such as open column, vacuum liquid packing materials (normal-phase and reverse- phase silica gel) and various solvents were used for the separation and purification of bioactive constituents. The isolates were chemically characterized using a variety of spectroscopic methods including UV, IR, mass spectrometry two-dimensional (2D) NMR, and X-ray diffraction. The determination of biological activities for the active isolates were expressed in terms of IC 50 values for the 5-HT 7 and GABAa receptor binding assays. 3 1.2. SIGNIFICANCE OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME Epidemiological surveys have indicated that up to 75% of women with regular menstrual cycles suffer some sy mptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which negatively af fects the quality of life.1,2 PMS is a periodic phenomenon of physical, psychological, or behavioral symptoms. It begins during the second half of the menstrual cycle and stops at menses.1,2 The symptoms relating to PMS may include mood swings, depression, tension, anger, anxiety, irritability, difficult y concentrating, headache, bloating, mastalgia, and increased appetite with food cravings.3-5 Behavioral irritability (either anxiety or depression) and fatigue are two basic symptoms.6 PMS can badly impact personal relationships, social activities, or job performance.7 Premenstrual syndrome signific antly decreases with age in the transition to menopause, and ends at menopause with the overlap of certain symptoms such as depressed mood, i rritability, and anxiety. Women experiencing PMS are more likely to su ffer menopausal hot flushes, depressed mood, and poor sleep than those without PMS.8,9 Women with a history of PMS are more likely to suffer mood symptoms during menopause.10 Therefore, PMS may act as a predictor of menopause to some extent.8 Although the etiology of PMS remains unclear,11 it is generally regarded as a psycho-neuro-endocrine disorder and is believed to involve reproductive hormones, and neurotransmitters, as well as other brain processes. 2,12 It has been proposed that PMS is closely related to a deficiency in central serotonergic activity,13-15 which involves common symptoms such as depression, and irritability during the menstrual cycle.6,16,17 Leonard et al.18 suggested that serotonin is a critical fa ctor in regulating mood and might be involved in pathophysiology based on the phenomenon that psychiatric disorders (anxiety and depression) are closely related to changes in serotonergic neurotransmission. Studies by Halbreich et al. 19 found low 4 serotonin and melatonin metabolism in women with severe PMS compared with healthy controls. Serum serotonin concentrations in postmenopausal women are related to the severity of climacteric symptoms.20 This evidence suggests a rationale for some herbs wi th serotonergic activities for the treatment of PMS. Serotonin (5-HT) is distributed in many tissues in the central and peripheral nervous systems where it modulates a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including anxiety, sleep regulation, feeding, depression, cardiovascular function, thermoregulati on, sexual behavior, circadian rhythms and aggression by activating different families of receptors. 18,21-23 Serotonin receptors are classified on the basi s of operational, structural, and transductional criteria, and are related by amino acid sequence, pharmacology, and intracellular mechanisms.24 Since serotonin was discovered in the late 1940s, 14 different types of serotonin receptors from seven families 5-HT 1 to 5- HT7 have been identified.25,26 In additional to serotonin, the ne urotransmitter GABA might also be involved in the symptoms of PMS and menopause. The GABAa receptor is regarded as one of the most intriguing drug targets to mediate anxiolytic, sedative, anticovulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic activities,27 and modulators GABAa receptors relate to improvement of depression and anxiety-related symptoms observed in PMS and menopausal women.28 Current treatment strategies for PM S include both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. Non- pharmacologic approaches such as dietary modifications (a diet low in sa lt, fat, caffeine, and sugar), dietary supplements, aerobic exercise, and stress management have been recommended to most women as first-line treatments for mild PMS symptoms.1,3,29 Pharmacologic interventions are usually used for severe symptoms and include therapy with antidepressants such as selective 5 serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSR Is), anxiolytics and agents to suppress ovulation.30 A combination of the antipsychotic olanzapine and the serotonin-selective re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine were shown to be effective for depression overlapping with mania in a trial including 28 patients. 31 However, an increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer, random vaginal bleeding, as well as ot her adverse effects when taking these medicines hamper their broad clinical application.32-34 A review based on 7 retrospective studies and 24 case report s of bleeding in 43 different people indicated a risk of uppe r gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and perioperative bleeding during SSRI use.35 To evaluate the safety profile of sertraline versus other SSRIs immediat ely following the introdu ction of sertraline to the Dutch market, a study of this and other SSRIs was carried out in the Netherlands to evaluate their safety . This study included 1251 patients (659 used sertraline and 592 used other SSRIs, i.e. paroxetine, fluoxetine or fluoxamine) and revealed that nearly th ree out of four patients reported an adverse event, such as headache , diarrhea, sweating, or dizziness.36 1.3. PLANTS AS POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES Botanical medicines have been app lied for the treatment of various women's diseases with thousands of years of history in Asia and are sharing a large market in the form of drugs, diet ary supplements, and foods. In the West, botanical medicines are categorized as complementary/ alternative medicines (CAM), dietary supplements, or foods. In 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) defined a dietary supplement as \"a product, other than tobacco, intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of (a) vitamin, (b) mineral, (c) herb/botanic al, (d) amino acid, (e) supplement that increases total dietary intake, (f) a concen trate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of (a, b, c, d and/or e)... that must either be in the form of a 6 tablet, capsule , powder, soft gel, gel ca p, liquid droplet, or be in some other forms that is not presented as a conventi onal food\". FDA also requires a label disclaimer that \"This product has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, mitigate, tr eat, cure or prevent any disease\" on all products, and manufacturers must submit samples of each new product label to the FDA within a month after marketing.37 In a survey including 223 questionnaires regarding the topic of \"which complementary and alternative therapies benefit which conditions\", stress/anxiety symptoms were listed as being most important for patients seeking complementary and alternative therapies.38 There is a recent increase of interest in complementary and alternative medicines for relief of premenstrual and menopausal symptoms because of perceived side effects caused by chemical drugs. Treatment wi th herbs has shown efficacy for some patients with PMS.39,40 Hardy40 identified several popular herbal medicines claimed useful for PMS and menopause. Evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis L.) was one of the plant medicines used for the treatment of PMS, particularly for the improvement of mastalgia. Effi cacy was proposed due to its rich content of fixed oil, i.e. about 65% linoleic acid and up to 10% of gamma- linoleic acid. This was based on an observation that abnormally low levels of essential fatty acids are found in PMS women. Chaste tree berry ( Vitex agnus- castus L.) was indicated to alleviate PM S via its dopaminergic effects. A standardized product of black cohosh ( Cimicifuga racemosa L. Nutt.), Remifemin, showed relief for menopaus al symptoms, as an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. Many other herbs with diffe rent mechanism of action have been used for women's, such as red clover (Trifolium pratense effects for 7 dysmenorrhea. Angelica sinensis is one of the most important and popular herbs in Asia for the treatment of a vari ety of gynecological disorders and will be addressed in more detail in section 1.5. 1.4. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM There are numerous A. sinensis products on the market. Given the reality of botanical confusion of plant materials and unclear mechanisms of action, it is difficult for manufacturer s to guarantee the reproducibility, and further to ensure safety and efficacy of the products. As a result, this might adversely affect the health of consumers. On the basis of these problems, this project was designed to address the following specific aims: A. Establishment of analytical methods for botanical identification of plant materials of A. sinensis. B. Chemical and biological characteri zation of active principles from the roots of A. sinensis . After completion of specific aims A an d B, this research will be helpful for standardization of extracts of A. sinensis and will contribute to the acquisition of reproducible, safe and efficacious marketed products. 8 1.5. PHARMACOGNOSY OF ANGELICA SINENSIS 1.5.1. BOTANY, TAXONOMY AND IDENTIFICATION The word Angelica refers to the genus name, derived from the Latin word angelus , meaning angelic. In European folklore, this genus name is associated with a mythological story that an angel came to a monk to save an almost destroyed Europe by offering an he rb, and from then on, it was named angelica . The species name sinensis also originated from a Latin word, Sina, meaning China. 41,42 The following lists the botanical name , synonyms, and the classification of Angelica the largest family of the Apiales, Apiaceae (the carrot family) consists of ca. 430 genera and 3000 species. Most plants are aromatic with hollow 9 stems. The Apiaceae have been recogniz ed since ancient times, both as a morphologically distinct group of plants and as a source for food, medicines, poisons, etc., and are widely distributed in most parts of the world, particularly in the north-temperate zone.43 Umbelliferae is an alternative name for Apiaceae, implicating \"bearer of umbels\". A series of features can be applied to distinguish it from other families morphologically. Members of the family have alternate leaves, widening at the base into a sheath that clasps the stem. The stems are often furrowed. Some parts of the plants usua lly have a strong aroma, primarily due to the presence of various essential oils. The small and compound flowers are always concentrated in umbels; the flowers have 5 petals, usually un even, and 5 stamens. The seeds and fruit form below where the petals and stamen originate. Seeds are in tight pairs, often conspicuously ribbed, and sometime \"winged\". Walters et al. 43 described this family with the following morphological characteristics: Herbs (rarely shrubs or trees). Leaves alternate (occasionally opposite) or all basal, simple to variously lobed or compound, estipulate (rarely stipulate) with petioles sheathing, with internal oil t ubules abd often strongly scented. Plant synoecious (occasionally polygamous, rarely dioecious). Inflorescence of compound umbels (rarely of simple umbels, heads, or axillary flowers). Flowers perfect (rarely imperfect) regular or irregul ar. Sepals 5, small, often very reduced and apparently absent, distinct. Petals 5 (0), distinct. Stamens 5, distinct, alternate with petals. Carpels 2, connate; ovary inferior with 2 locules and 1 apical-axile ovule per locule; styles 2, often subtended by bulging stylopodia (rarely elongated into a beak in fruit). Fruit a schizocarp with 2 mericarps, often strongly ribbed, sometimes winged and samaroid or covered with tubercles or prickles. 10 Plants in the Apiaceae have significant economic value. Some members are edible , such as vegeta ble crops of Daucus carota L. (carrot), Apium graveolens L. (celery), and a culinary herb of Petroselinum crispum (P. Mill.) Nyman ex A. W. Hill (parsley). However, some members are poisonous, such as Conium maculatum L. (poison hemlock) and Cicuta spp. (water- hemlock). A. archangelica L. (garden Angelica ) which is famous of its green, crystallized decorative strips. 1.5.1.2. The genus Angelica Angelica is a genus consisting more than 60 species of tall biennial and perennial herbs, native to temperate an d subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Asia, Europe, and North America.41 They grow up to 8 feet, with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or greenish-white flowers. A summary of the distribution and traditional application of plants in the genus Angelica is listed in APPENDIX A (Table 9 ).41 Many plants in this genus are important medicinal herbs wi th the following activities: anti- inflammatory, diuretic, expectorant and di aphoretic for the treatments of colds, flu, influenza, hepatitis, arthritis, indigestion, coughs, chronic bronchitis, bacterial and fungal infections, and for diseases of the urinary tract. Phytochemicals such as coumarins, po lyacetylenes, chalcones, sesquiterpenes and polysaccharides have been characterize d as active principles in this genus, and exhibit antimicrobial, anticancer, an titumor, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, Diels is a fragrant, he rbaceous perennial plant, 0.5 to 1 m tall.44 It flowers from August to September, and the seeds ripen from September to October. Indigenous to the west of China, such as Hubei, 11 Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shanxi an d Gansu provinces, with Gansu being famous for its superior quality plants,45 Angelica sinensis is rarely available from wild sources. Currently it is cultivated and harvested in late autumn after three years. The American Herbal Pharmacopoeia (2003) describes the morphological characteristics of A. sinensis as follows: Stem: Erect, 4-10 leaves 1-pinnate; petiole 3-11 cm long, with base and stem; leaflets ovate or ov ate-lanceolate, margin dentate, fine white hairs on leaf veins and margin. Inflorescence: Compound umbel, 10-14 per plant, peduncle 4-7 cm, densely with fine wooly hairs; umbel, 2, short, the disc, forming Fruit: Schizocarp splitting into 2 one-seeded carpels compressed against each other and separately attached by the apex to a carpophore; each carpel ovoid or ellipsoid, the tip rounded or slightly notched, 4-6 mm long, 3-4 mm wide, with 5 dorsal ribs, the marginal ridges winged, wings pale purple; oil glands solitary in each vitta (sinus between the ribs), with 2 on the commissure (inner side).\" Figure 1. Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) family parts: the dried roots Nicknames: Female ginseng or Lady's ginseng 12 Common names for A. sinensis as it is popularly used in different areas include Dang Gui, Dong Qu ai, Tang Kuei, Ming-gui, Chinese Angelica, Toki (Korea), Tanggi (Japan), etc.45 1.5.1.4. Identification of A. sinensis plant material Many species other than A. sinensis have been used as its substitutes in various areas, such as Angelica acutiloba (Sieb. & Zucc.) Kitag in Japan, Angelica gigas Korea, and Levisticum officinale W.D.J. Koch in Europe.45-47 In addition, there are sinensis adulterants, effects of these substitutes and adulterants might be different from A. sinensis (Oliv.) Diels based on differences in their phytochemical constituents, especially in the essential oils.46,48 In A. sinensis , the contents of major constituents in its essential oil, such as ligustilide, butylidenphthalide, and butylphthalide are reported to be higher than Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa and in Levisticum officinale W.D.J. Koch,49,50 especially is 10-fold in Angelica acutiloba Kitagawa and Angelica gigas Nak..47,51 The essential oils of six different species of Angelica were analyzed by HPLC, and the results showed differences with respect to butylidenepht halide, ligustilide, butylphthalide, and the carboxylic acids, ferulic acid and nicotinic acid. 49 Therefore, it is necessary to botanically verify plant materials of A. sinensis before use, which could be conducted on the basis of the macroscopi c, microscopic characteristics, as well as their chemical constituents. Macroscopic characteristics: The dried root is cylindrical in shape, with 2-10 main branches and more fi ne branches at the lower part, and approximately 15-25 cm long. Externally it appears yellowish-brown to brown, with longitudinally wrinkled and transve rsely lenticellate. The root is divided 13 into three parts, the root stock, the main root, and the branching root. The root stock is 1.5-4 cm in diameter lo ng, annulated, apex obtuse and rounded, possessing purple or yellowish-green remains of stems and leaf sheaths; the main root is uneven and crude on the su rface; the branching root is usually 0.3-1 cm in diameter, with the upper po rtion thick and the lower portion thin, mostly twisted and showing a few rootlet scars. Other characteristics include flexible texture, yellowish-white or yellow-brown fraction, brown and thick bark with some clefts and many brown do tted secretory cavities, paler wood, and yellowish-brown cambium ring. It has a strongly aromatic odor, and is sweet and pungent with a slightly bitter taste. 44,45 The highest quality plant materials are claimed to be strongly aromatic an d oily. Woody, withered and not oily roots, or those with greenish-brown on the fracture are not suggested to be used for medicinal purposes.49,52 Microscopic characteristics: According to the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (PPRC 2000), transverse sections of the dried roots of A. sinensis exhibit the following characteristics: \"Cork cells in several layers. Cortex narrow, scattered with a few oil ca vities. Phloem broad, more cleft, oil cavities and oil tubes subrounded, 25-160 \u00b5m in diameter, relatively large on the outer side, gradually becoming small inwards, surrounded by 6-9 secretory cells, cambium in a ring. Xylem ra ys grouped, arranged radially, parenchymatous cells containing starch granules.\" Powdered roots of A. sinensis are yellow-brown, usually exhibiting the following microscopic features: \"parench ymatous cells show a fusiform shape with slightly thickened walls and very fine oblique crisscross striations, sometimes thin transverse septa are visible. Vessels are scalariform and reticulate, up to 80 \u00b5m in diameter. Oil cavities or its fragments may be visible. Cork cells are yellowish. Starch grains are rarely found, which are in ovate, spherical or ellipical and in 3-8 \u00b5m in length, if visible.\"52 14 As a traditional technique for botani cal identification, examination of microscopic characteristics individually may not be sufficient to identify plant materials of A. sinensis in most cases. However, microscopic analysis may be used to quickly differentiate adulterants from A. sinensis . This is possible since the abovementioned microscopic fe atures are absent from some common adulterants. Phytochemical characteristics: The identification of plant materials on the basis of different phytochemical constituents focuses on either the qualitative analysis of characteristic constituents, or the quantitative assay of major constituents by means of TLC, HPLC, GC-MS and LC-MS. TLC has been widely used as a rapid method to distinguish A. sinensis from other plants, including A. pubescens (characterized by osthol and various angelol type coumarins), A. dahurica (characterized of ligustilide and falcarindiol). 53,54 Qualitative and/or quantitative HPLC analyses of the constituents in the roots of A. sinensis have been used for quality control.53,55-58 Ferulic acid is one of most commonly used markers fo r the quantitative analysis of A. sinensis and its products by using reverse-phase HPLC techniques.56,59-62 As a major bioactive constituent in the essential oil of A. sinensis , Z-ligustilide is another popular marker for the quality control of A. sinensis and its products.47 GC-MS and LC-MS have been applied for the chemical analysis of A. sinensis.53,63. 1.5.2. PHYTOMEDICINE In Asia, the dried root of A. sinensis has been widely used for the treatment of many diseases, such as dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea, premenstrual and menopausal syndrome s, anemia, abdominal pain, injuries, 15 migraine headaches, and arthritis for thousands of years.45,64,65 Angelica sinensis is also called \"lady's ginseng\" or \"female ginseng\" to indicate its importance and popularity for various wo men's ailments. The earliest record of its use is in the Divine Husbandman's Classic of the Materia Medica (Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing) that was published during the Han Dynasty (AD 25-225). After being introduced to the West in 1899 by Merck in the form of a liquid extract named \"Eumenol\",66 A. sinensis has been gradually used by westerners, its many products are included in th e Swiss, the Austrian and the German Pharmacopoeias.41 Currently there are countless A. sinensis products on the market all over the world. The common name of A. sinensis in Chinese is Dang Gui, which literally means \"recovery to normal conditions\", in dicating its ability to help the body return to a normal condition of well-being from weakness or illness. A. sinensis is claimed to have the functions of \"Nou rish blood and promote its circulation, regulate the menstruation and relieve its pain......\" in the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2000), A. sinensis is officially applied to the symptoms of \"menstrual disorders, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, anemia with dizziness and arthralgia, traumatic injuries, carbuncles, boils, and sores.\"52 In addition to be used alone, A. sinensis is often used in combination wi th other formulas in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).67,68 O v e r 8 0 f o r m u l a s i n t h e Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (2000 version) and 56 formulas in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia contain A. sinensis root as one of their components.69,70 16 1.5.2.1. Gynecological Uses Although A. sinensis has been used for gynecological disorders for many years, there are few clinical reports in the literature on A. sinensis publishes dealing with these effects. Three problems exist that hinder its broader use in modern medicine. 1. Most clinical studies have been performed with formulated herbal products, i.e., mixtures of different plants, rather than A. sinensis only; 2. Clinical trials have been conducted by using the principles of TCM theory, which are difficult to convert accurately into the corresponding terms of western medicine; 3. Only a few randomized placebo-co ntrolled clinical trials have been carried out. These problems are grounds for concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of A. sinensis dietary supplements. It is generally believed that A. sinensis is estrogenic based on its broad applications to female ailments. However, in vitro experiments in our UIC/NIH Botanical Center showed that a methanol extract of A. sinensis has very weak affinity to estrogen receptors (IC 50 > 50\u00b5g/ml).71 In a 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involv ing 71 postmenopausal women, a daily dose of 4.5 g of a dried aqueous extract of A. sinensis was not found to exhibit estrogenic activity.72 This indicates that A. sinensis does not have estrogen-like activities in vivo or in vitro and does not qualify as a phytoestrogen. A medicinal preparation of herbal extracts (Climex) consisting of Angelica sinensis and Matricaria chamomilla was evaluated for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in a placebo-controlled experiment including 55 postmenopausal women. 73 Significant improvement of menopausal symptoms including hot flushes, sleep disturba nces and fatigue was observed in the 17 study group in comparison with the control group (90-96% vs 15-25%, p < 0.001). It was concluded that hormone-free Climex with A. sinensis as a major principle was effective in treatment of menopausal symptoms without adverse effects. Hardy40 rigorously reviewed the efficacy and safety of some herbs that have been traditionally used to trea t gynecological complaints such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and me nopausal symptoms in controlled studies. He concluded that A. sinensis was effective for PMS when used in traditional Chinese formulas with good safety profiles. Approximately 30% of women afflicted with migraine have menstrually associated attacks. These migraines are often refractory to treatment. Johns declared that A. sinensis has tranquilizing and sedative effects that can relieve mood swings and irritability in premen strual women and recommended it for the treatment of migraine headaches caused by PMS.74 A liquid extract of A. sinensis named \"Eumenol\" was also recommended for the treatment of menstrual disorders in the West as early as 1927.66 In a clinical study, both the aqueous extract and ligustilide, one of the major constituents in the essential oil of A. sinensis were administered for 3-7 days for the treatment of dysmenorrhea . As a result, ligustilide exhibited an efficacy of 77%, much higher than the 38% efficacy observed in the group receiving the aqueous extract. This in dicated that ligustilide is an active principle for dysmenorrhea, and its mech anism of action might be associated with its uterine spasmolytic effect.75 Successful treatment on amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea by using a fluid extract of A. sinensis was also reported.44,76 By administrating 5 ml of the fluid extract of the roots of A. sinensis to female patients prior to menstruation three times a day before meals for 7 days, a significant relief of premenstrual pain and chronic endome tritis, as well as induced menstrual flow in patients, was observed. 18 The root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels is a major ingredient of 'Four Things Soup', the most widely used formula of a woman's blood tonic (for blood vacuity) in China. The other three herbs included in this formula are Rehmannia glutinosa Pall. In a case study, Angelica sinensis was observed to significantly improve anemia of chronic renal failure.77 Polysaccharides of A. sinensis were demonstrated to increase hematopoiesis in the bone marrow in an in vivo study.78 1.5.2.2. Other Uses In addition to gynecological disorders, A. sinensis has also been widely applied to other diseases due to percei ved cardiovascular, hepatoprotective, hematopoietic, antioxidant, antispasmo dic and immunomodulatory activities. In a clinical study on the treatment of acute cerebral infarcts with an injection of A. sinensis , 1404 patients were divided in three groups: 692 patients in Group A were treated with Angelica inj ection; 390 patients in Group B were treated with Salvia; and 322 patients in Group C were administered dextran. 79 The results showed that the total ef fective rate in Group A (78.8%) was markedly higher than the other two groups (B-63.6% and C-59.3%) (P < 0.05). As an active constituent of A. sinensis , ferulic acid (as sodium ferulate) has been widely used as a drug in China to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and prevent thrombosis. Ferulic acid has antithrombotic, platelet aggregation inhi bitory and antioxidant activities. Its safety and efficacy in coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, pulmonary heart disease, and thrombosis have been demonstrated clinically.80 An extract of A. sinensis roots was evaluated for therapeutic effect on peripheral circulation and whole blood viscosity after oral ad ministration by humans. The results showed that it decreased blood viscosity ca. 180 min after oral 19 administration.51 Significant therapeutic effects of the roots of A. sinensis on hemorrheology in patients with acute ischemic stroke observed.81 PHARMACOLOGY 1.5.3.1. In vivo activities Gynecological effects effects of essential oil of A. sinensis (EOAS) were studied in three in vivo experiments with diazepam as a positive control. In the elevated plus-maze experiment, EOAS at a dose of 30.0 mg/kg increased the percentage of open-arm time, reduced the percent of protected head dips, and exhibited a modest anxiolytic effect compared with diazepam. In the light/dark test, EOAS at a dose of 30.0 mg/kg prolonged the time staying in the light area while maintaining locomotor activity of the animals. In the stress-induced hyperthermia experiment, rectal temper ature was measured twice after 60 and 70 min of drug administration, EOAS (30.0 mg/kg) inhibited stress-induced hyperthermia. As a conclusion, these results showed that essential oil of A. sinensis has in essential oil of A. sinensis , were found to reverse the pentobarbital (PB) induced sleeping time in mice. Both compounds (20 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the inhibitory effects of yohimbine and methoxamine stimulants of central noradrenergic system) and FG7142 (a benzodiazepine inverse agonist) on PB sleeping time in mice.83 These results demonstrated the effects of two phthalide components in A. sinensis on central noradrenergic and/or GABAa systems . A polysaccharide from A. sinensis has been shown to have anti-anemic and immunofunction regulating activity . Its biological mechanism of action 20 might involve direct or indirect stimulation of cells in the hematopoietic inductive microenvironments such as lymphocytes, bone marrow stromal cells and macrophages.84 As an analgesic, the polysaccharide markedly decreased the frequency of the writhing reaction induced by estradiol and oxytocin as well as prolonging the latent period and the elevated pain threshold of mice on the hot plate after administering polysaccharides (0.25 g kg-1).85 One of the primary benefits of A. sinensis is its ability to relieve cramps by helping relaxation of the uterus.86 Angelica sinensis has an adaptive action on the uterus, and its pharmacologically active ingredients in this aspect can be grouped into tw o distinctive components: non-volatile components (water-soluble) and the al cohol-soluble compon ents containing the essential oil. The water-soluble non-volatile elements of the roots were observed to be able to increase the contraction of the uterus, while the volatile elements act as an antispasmo dic to relax the muscles of the uterus in vivo .87,88 The essential oils containing o ver 70% ligustilide significantly inhibited the contractile function of is olated uterine smooth muscle of mice in a concentration-dependent manner whether the uterus was isolated or in mice treated with oxytocin.89 Ex vivo experiments showed that ligustilide and butylidenephthalide contained in the volatile oils have a strong spasmolytic effect on isolated uteri.90,91 They can also inhibit prostaglandin F2- (PGF 2-), oxytocin-, or acetylcholin e-induced contraction of non- pregnant rat uteri.92 While the in vitro mechanism of relaxant activity remains incompletely eluc idated, it might involve both histamine receptor blocking activity and calcium ion channel effects.89,93,94 The muscle relaxation induced by vasodilating and antispasmodic effects of A. sinensis are regarded as the mechanism underl ying its effectiveness in treating dysmenorrhea.74 21 Other effects In addition to gynecological effects, A. sinensis exhibited many other in vivo pharmacological effects, i.e., effect s on cardiovascular and blood systems, as well as immunological, antioxi dant, antitumor, pulmonary, and antiarrhythmic functions.91 hemodynamic experiment, aqueous extracts of A. sinensis significantly increased coronary blood flow, and reduced coronary and peripheral vascular resistance and myocardial oxygen consumption, as well as arterial blood pressure after i.v. administration to anesthetized dogs (2g/kg).45 Some phthalides such as butylphthalide from Angelica sinensis roots exhibited a significant relaxant effect on animal tracheal smooth muscle, which is a direct action on the tracheal smooth muscle suggested by a rapid and potent anti-BaCl 2 action on tracheal smooth muscle. Phthalides displayed a potent antagonistic effect on acetylch oline- and histamine-induced tracheal muscle constriction, and histaminergic were not involved in this action.95 Ligustilide and senkyunolide were found to cause muscle relaxation in an in vivo study on the crossed extensor reflex in anesthetized rats.96 The hepato-protective action of ferulic acid (as sodium ferulate) from A. sinensis was demonstrated in an in vivo study. Sodium ferulate can inhibit the activity of serum alanine aminotransferase, prevent the depletion of liver glycogen increase the liver homogenate and microsomal glutathione S-transferase activities, an d reduce the malondialdehyde content, the membrane fluidity of liver microsomes and the mitochondria in paracetamol induced liver toxicity in mice.97 Sodium ferulate was also shown to significantly reduce the increase of medium lipoperoxide (LPO) and inhibit 22 3H-thymidine incorporation dose-dependently, indicating its inhibitory effect on the proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells.98 In an in vivo study, a chloroform extract of A. sinensis suppressed the growth of malignant brain tumors of ra t and human origin, and also decreased the volume of in situ glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).99 Polysaccharides of A. sinensis exhibited anti-tumor effects in vivo in experimental tumor models (sarcoma 180, leukemia and Ehrlich ascitic carcinoma),100 they were also found to activate the immunologi c function of rat Kupffer cells.101 An acetone extract of A. sinensis on human cancer cells.102 Sodium L-malate from the water extract of A. sinensis was found to exhibit protective effects against both nephrotoxicity (ED50: 0.4 mg/kg, perorally) and bone marrow toxicity in rats (ED50: 1.8 mg/kg, perorally).103 A n-hexane fraction of A. sinensis attenuated various drug-induced amnesia effects in rats, which are related to memory processes.104 Polysaccharides from A. sinensis are also suggested to be useful to in the prevention of neutrophil- dependent mucosal injury in the gastrointestinal tract.105 1.5.3.2. In vitro activities In vitro evaluation of estrogenic activity of several plants was performed by Liu et al. .71 A methanol extract of A. sinensis (MEAS) was assayed for competition with estrodiol for binding to ER and ER and for induction of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity in cultured Ishikawa (endometrial) cells. MEAS showed weak ER binding activities (IC 50 > 50 \u00b5g/mL), as well as weak induction of the progesterone receptor ( PR) and presenelin-2 ( pS2). These findings were consistent with a clinical study which showed non-estrogenicity of A. sinensis.72 These studies indicated that any activity of A. sinensis against gynecological disorders must be through non-estrogen pathways. 23 Liao et al.106 established receptor binding assays to evaluate the bioactivities of water extracts of A. sinensis in vitro . These assays were used to explain these effects on the central nerv ous system (CNS) at the receptor level. The results showed that a water extract of A. sinensis acted on 5-HT 1A and GABAa receptors with strong binding affinity (Ki values) of 6 \u00b1 3 \u00b5g/mL and 0.6 \u00b1 3 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. An aqueous extract of A. sinensis and its constituent ferulic acid were found to inhibit platelet aggregation via i nhibition of platelet serotonin release, which was associated with its pharma cological effects on cerebrovascular disorders.107 Ferulic acid also exhibited D PPH radical scavenging activities with EC 50 of 63.9 \u00b5M and acte d as an antioxidant by protecting cells from oxidative stress.108 The mechanism of antioxidant activity was attributable to its phenolic nucleus and conjugated side chain, which could easily form a resonance stabilized phenoxy radical.109 Ferulic acid has been used in many cosmetics due to its photoprotect ive function and in foods because of its inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidati on. In addition, s odium ferulate (0.8 \u00b5M and 3.2 \u00b5M) exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition on the synthesis of thromboxane B2 (TXB 2), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), and F 2 (PGF 2) with inhibitory rates of 93.8%, 90.3% and 47.4% at a concentration of 3.2 \u00b5M, respectively.110,111 Ferulic acid is currently not permitted to be used as a food additive, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical in the USA. Butylidenephthalide in A. sinensis showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the aggregation and release reaction of washed rabbit platelets induced by arachidonic acid, collagen, platelet aggregation factor (PAF), Anti-aggregation activity of butylidenephthalide were associated with the inhibition of the enzyme COX and a calcium-antagonizing effect.112 In another study, researchers found that butylidenephthalide strongly inhibited rat uterine contractions induced by 24 prostaglandin F2 , oxytocin, and acetylcholine. The mechanism of its nonspecific antispasmodic action was diff erent from that of papaverine, which inhibited tonic contractions more selectively than phasic contractions.113 Polysaccharides of A. sinensis have been studied for different activities. These have inhibitory effects on the inva sion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.100 In addition, these polysaccharides produce a direct mucosal healing effect in isol ated gastric epithelial cells in vitro .114 As a coumarin constitu ent, imperatorin has be en reported to inhibit human cytochrome P450 CYP3A with an IC 50 value of 1.1 \u00b5M in an in vitro assay.67 In addition, imperatorin showed potent relaxing activity in the phenylephrine-precontracted co rpus cavernosum with an IC 50 value of 0.85 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5M. This activity is stro nger been repo rted to have antioxidant activities in in vitro assays inhibition anion, and radical scavenging IC 50 values of 2.33 \u00b1 0.16, 0.37 \u00b1 0.04, 0.16 \u00b1 0.01, and 0.61 \u00b1 0.02, respectively.116 Yang et al .117 incubated human cells (OPC-1) with aqueous extracts of A. sinensis (AEAS) to study their effects on bone cells, and found that AEAS directly stimulates the proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), protein secretion and particularly type I collagen of OPC-1 dose-dependently. Finally, a ligustilide dimer named E-232 was isolated from an ethanol extract of A. sinensis by Hon et al. , which produced a significant inhibition on 3H-nitrendipine binding to the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel with an IC 50 value of 4x10-7 M in an in vitro 3H-nitrendipine radioreceptor assay.94 25 1.5.4.

IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT MATERIALS The identification of Angelica plant materials was carried out by comparison of their macroscopic and microscopic features, as well as HPTLC and HPLC fingerprint profiles with those of the reference material. 29 2.2.1. Macroscopic examination The inspection of macroscopic characte ristics such as odor, taste and color has been traditionally used as an appr oach for the identification of plant materials. In our experiments, these char acteristics of samples 1-4 were checked and compared with those of the reference material. 2.2.2. Microscopic identification The examination of microscopic charac teristics provides a rapid approach for the identification of plant materials, and is included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2000 edition). In our ex periments, powders of four different samples were processed with chloral hydr ate, and then sealed with glycerin to make sample slides. The slides were ex amined under a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse E 600 microscope with Nikon's CF 160 infinity optics, x 40), and microscopic features were photographed with a Nikon digital camera C x M 1200. 2.2.3. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) Each of the g) were macerated in PE and MeOH respectively for 48 hours at room temper ature to afford PE and MeOH extracts, which were evaporated in vacuo to dryness. PE and MeOH solutions of each sample were prepared (1 mg/ml), respectively. 10 \u00b5l of each solution was applied to silica gel 60 F 254 (Merck KGaA, Germany) TLC plates, and developed with four different kinds of solvent under UV 365 nm, or visualiz ed by spraying with 1% vanillin H 2SO4- EtOH(1:9) solution and heated at 2.2.4. High-performance soluti on of samples 1-4 (1 mg/mL) were injected into a Waters (Milford, MA, USA) Delta 600 HPLC system, and separation was carried out on an Alltima reversed phase C 18 column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m) protected with a Waters Alltima C 18 guard column at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Solvent gradient conditions used for each separation are listed in Table 2. The column effluent was directed to a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Absorbance at UV 254 nm was select ed as the detection wavelength. Table 2. Gradient solvent for system in HPLC fingerprints experiments Time (min) Flow (mL/min) % MeCN % Conditions. The human 5-HT 7-transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was generously provided by David Sibley (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD ) and cultured with Ham's F-12 medium gentamycin, and units/ml of penicillin /streptomycin. Membrane Preparation. Cells (human 5-HT 7 CHO) were plated into dishes (150 mm \u00d7 10 mm) and cultured to confluence in order to collect membranes as previously described.137 A hypotonic buffer (15 mM Tris, 1.25 mM MgCl 2, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) was added to the dishes and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min, the 31 cells were scraped from the dishes, and the lysate was centrifuged. The hypotonic buffer was removed and the membrane pellet resuspended in TEM buffer (75 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM MgCl 2, pH 7.4). The cell membranes were homogenized and centrifuged twice at 12000 g for 20 min. The pellets were dissolved in TEM buffer and were stored at -80 \u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 5-HT 7 Receptor Binding Assay. Initial radioligand binding studies were performed by Panlabs (Bothell, WA) as Subsequently, assays were performed in-house with minor modifications using human recombinant CHO cell membrane and [3H] LSD (5 nM) in an incubation buffer consisting 75 mM Tris-HCl, 1.25 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4.144 After a 1-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the mixture was filtered through 934-AH Whatman filters that had been presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine (PEI) and washed twice in ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) using a 96-well To mtec-Harmester (Orange, CT). Each filter was dried, suspended in Wallac microbet a plate scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer life Sciences, Boston, MA), and counte d with a Wallac 1450 Microbeta liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). 5- Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) (250 nM) was used to define nonspecific binding, which accounted for <10% of the total binding. The percent inhibition of [3H] ligand bound to each 5-HT receptor was determined as [1- (dpm sample - dpm blank) / (dpm DMSO-dpm blank )] \u00d7 100, and the extracts and fractions displaying inhibition percentage over 50% at a conc entration of 100 \u00b5g/mL were regarded as active, and subjected to further frac tionation in our experiment. The IC 50 values were determined for the isolates with pe rcent inhibition greater than 50% at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. The data represent the average \u00b1 SD of at least triplicate 32 determinations. All of 5-HT 7 data shown in this dissertation were from Ms. Ping Yao and Dr. Rachel Ruhlen in Dr . Bolton's group in project 2. 2.3.2. 5-HT 5A receptor binding assay 5 \u00b5L sample (for screening, a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL or 100 \u00b5M will be used), 9 \u00b5g human 5-HT 5A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membrane [3H]-LSD (1.64 nM) were added to an incu bation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) for a final volume of 200 \u00b5L in a 96-well plate. After a 1 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the plates were filtered over 934-AH Whatman filters pre-soaked in 0.5% PEI and washed twice in ice-cold 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) using a 96-well Tomtec-Harvester (Oran ge, CT). Each filter was dried, suspended in Wallac microbeta plate scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and counted with a Wallac 1450 MICROBETA Liquid Scintillation Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). 5-HT (500 \u00b5M) was used to define nonspecific binding, which accounts for 10% of total binding. The percent inhibition of [3H] ligand bound to each data were from Dr. Birgit Dietz in Dr. Judy L. Bolton's group in project 2. 2.3.3. GABAa receptor binding assay materials : [3H] Flunitrazepam was obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Diazepam, polyethylenimine (PEI) and bovine albumin were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Membrane preparation : Cerebral cortex was dissected from Sprague- Dawley rats. Brain tissue was washed with ice-cold PBS for three times, homogenized by Polytron at setting 6 for 2 min on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00baC. The pellet was collected and stored at -80 \u00baC. Before use, the membrane pellet was thawed and resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCl binding buffer 33 (pH 7.4). Protein concentration was de termined using Coomassie protein assay reagents (Pierce, Rockford , IL) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. GABAa receptor binding assay : The GABAa assay was performed according to the method described previously145,146 with minor modifications. Briefly, membranes were incubated with 0.2 nM [3H] FNZ in 50 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 \u00baC for 90 min (100 \u00b5g protein/reaction). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 \u00b5M diazepam. Reactions were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration wi th ice-cold PBS through GF/B filters presoaked with 0.2 % PEI. Filter-bound radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). Binding data, expressed in mean \u00b1 SD, were analyzed using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Diazepam was used as a positive control with its IC 50 values of 14.9 nM. All of GABAa data were from Mr. Ji an Lu in the laboratory of Dr. Zaijie Jim Wang in the Department of Biopharmaceutical Science. 2.3.4. ER and ER receptor binding assays ER and ER competitive receptor binding assays were performed according to the protocols described in literature.71 Briefly, 24 h prior to the assay, a 50% v/v hydroxyapatite slurry was prepar ed using 10 g of hydroxyapatite in 60 mL of TE buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA) and stored at 4 \u00b0C. The ER binding buffer consisted of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2 mM dithiothrietol, and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. The ER and ER wash buffers contained 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 40 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), respectively. The reaction mixture consisted of 5 \u00b5L of test sample in DMSO, 5 \u00b5L of pure human recombinant diluted ER or ER (0.5 pmol) in ER binding buffer, 5 \u00b5L of \"Hot Mix\" (400 nM, prepared fresh using 83 Ci/mmol [ 3H] estradiol diluted in ethanol-ER bind ing buffer (1:1), and 85 \u00b5L of ER binding buffer. The incubations were carried out at room temperature for 2 h, then 100 \u00b5L of 50% hydroxyapatite slurry were added, and the tubes were 34 incubated on ice for 15 min with vortexin g every 5 min. The appropriate ER wash buffer was added (900 \u00b5L), and the tubes were vortexed and then centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was di scarded, and this wash step was repeated three-times. The hydroxyapatite pellet containing the ligand -receptor complex was resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of ethanol and transferred to scintillation vials. An addition 200 \u00b5L of ethanol was used to rinse the centrifuge tube vials. Cytoscint (4 mL/vial) was added, and the tubes were counted using a Beckman (Schaumburg, IL) LS 5801 liquid scintillati on counter. The percent inhibition of [3H] estradiol binding to each ER was determined follows: [(dpm sample - dpm blank)/(dpm DMSO - dpm blank) - 1] x 100. The binding capability (percent) of the sample was calculated in comparison to that of estradiol (50 nM, 100%). The data represent the average \u00b1 SD of three determinations. All ER data were from Ms. Ping Yao in Dr. Judy L. Bolton's group in project 2. 2.4. EXTRACTION AN D PARTITIONING 2.4.1. Extraction 8.0 kg of the pulverized roots of Angelica sinensis (sample 1, BC 165) were macerated in 20 L of MeOH for 24 h, and percolated exhaustively with the same solvent (total 40 L). The MeOH percolate was collected and evaporated to a volume of ca. 2700 mL (E 0) under reduced pressure at 40 oC using a rotary evaporator. After 200 mL of the MeOH percolate were evaporated to dryness and set aside for the bioassays, 500 mL of water were added to the remaining 2500 mL, resulting in an ca. 85% aqueous methanol extract (Figure 5). In vitro biological activities of MeOH extract (E 0) are shown in Table 5. 35 2.4.2. Partitioning The methanol extract (E 0) was partitioned with petroleum ether (PE, 2000 mL x 3) in a separatory funnel (4 L, same as below). The PE partition (P 1) was evaporated in vacuo . The aqueous-methanol mother liquor was evaporated in vacuo to remove the MeOH, and the remaining aqueous extract was successively partitioned with CHCl 3 (2000 mL x 3) and BuOH (2000 mL x 3). The CHCl 3 and BuOH partitions (P 2 & P 3) were evaporated to dryness in vacuo , respectively. The aqueous mother liquor was lyophilized to afford an aqueous partition (P 4) (Figure 5). The MeOH extract (E 0) and its subsequent partitions (P 1-P4) were evaluated for their biological activities in the different in vitro assays (Table 5). 2.5. CHROMATOGRAPHIC FRAC TIONATION AND ISOLATION Fractionation and isolation of bioactive compounds were carried out in preparative quantities on the serotone rgic and GABAergic active PE and CHCl 3 partitions guided by the 5-HT 7 receptor binding assay. A series of chromatographic techniques including VL C, MPLC, TLC, DCCC, and HPLC with different types of packing materials (n ormal-phase and reverse-phase silica gel) and solvent systems were employed. 2.5.1. Solvents Chloroform (ACS grade) was obtained from Tab Chemical Co. (Chicago, IL) and distilled prior to use. Acetonitrile , methanol and water (HPLC grade) were obtained from Fischer Scientific Co. (P ittsburgh, PA) and used in DCCC, MPLC and PE) in VLC and TLC (ACS grade) were obtained from Fisher and distilled prior to use. 2.5.2. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC ) TLC was run at room erature on precoated normal or reverse phase glass TLC plates (250 \u00b5m thickness, silica gel 60 F254 and KGF RP-18 Si gel 60, 36 Merck). Preparative TLC was carried out on Merck TLC plates (1 mm thickness, silica gel 60 F254, 20 cm x 20 cm, Figure 18). All TLC plates were either visualized by by heating at 110 \u00b0C, or monitored under the UV light with wavelengths at 254 nm and 365 nm. The developing solvent systems were varied based on the individual case. 2.5.3. Vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) Open column with silica gel as a stationary phase is one of most popular approaches for the initial large-scale frac tionation of crude extract. However, the irreversible absorption of constituents on to the silica gel is unavoidable. This may result in the loss and decomposition of isolates. As a quick and convenient technique, vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) significantly reduces the retention time of constituents on the column, and minimizes the irreversible loss of isolates. In this project, VLC was employed in the first, second, and/or third level fractionations using different stationary phases (silica gel/C 18 at different particle size) (see Figure 7-14). TLC was used to a pplied for the preparative isolation of a wide range of natural products and becomes a powerful tool for fractionation.147,148 It has many advantages over other routine separation techniques. The liquid stationary phase of DCCC eliminates interaction between solutes and solid supports, avoids lo ss (100% recovery) and minimizes the alteration of samples (decomposition, artifa cts, etc.). DCCC can be used for either polar or non-polar crude fractions, and the amounts of samples can range from several milligrams to tens of grams. 37 The key step for DCCC is the search for the solvent system, a proper solvent system is critical for a successful separation. The ideal solvent system should have the following characteristics: Partition coefficient: K 1 Retention of stationary phase (SP) > 50 % Settling time <30 second Volume of stationary phase (SP) mobile phase (MP) Low boiling point solvents The partition coefficient (K value) is a critical parameter for the selection of the solvent system in DCCC, it may be determined by gravimetry, UV, TLC or HPLC based on the following formula: K=Cs/Cm (Cs-solute concentration in SP, Cm-solute concentration in MP) The range of K values should be between 0.5 and 2, with K 1 as ideal for the solute of interest. The two most popular solvent systems are ethyl acetate and chloroform-based solvent systems. For moderate polar compounds, chloroform systems such as chloroform/methanol/wate r (4:4:3) may be initially used as a template, and polarity adjusted if necessary. For the more hydrophobic constituents, an ethyl acetate-based system such as can be ea sily adjusted in polarity by changing the volume ratio of hexane and ethyl acetate to fit a specific sample requirement. Droplet countercurrent chromatography (DCCC) was employed at the third level of fractionation in our experiment, which was carried out by using an EYELA instrument (Model DCC-3000; Tokyo Ribakikai Co. Ltd, Japan) equipped with 300 glass columns (ID 3.4 x 400 mm), a Shimadzu LC-610 solvent pump, and an autocollector (flow rate at 0.4 mL/min, 35 min per fraction). In the experiment, an ethyl acetate solvent system (PE- EtOAc-MeOH-H 2O; 6:4:6:4) was employed in an ascending mode with upper phase of PE-EtOAc as the mobile phase, and the lower phase of MeOH-H 2O as a stationary phase. A 38 partition coefficient (K) value of 1.3 was determined by gravimetry. Totally 144 fractions were colleted in 84 h at a flow rate of 0.4 ml per min (Figure 15). TLC was used to analyze the result of DCCC fractionation. Medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) Medium-pressure liquid (MPLC) was applied at the third level of fractionation, and performe d using a Merck Lobar Lichroprep RP 18 column (40-63 \u00b5m), equipped with a fluid pump and an autocollector. The column was eluted with the MeOH-H 2O solvent system. RP C 18 analytical TLC was employed to monitor the LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (HPLC) Preparative HPLC was conducted on a Waters 600 system coupled with a photodiode array (PDA) detector, a Waters 717 plus autosampler, and Chromatography Manager (W aters Corp.) using a Watrex GROM- Sil 120 ODS-4 HE column (5 \u00b5m, 20 \u00d7 300 mm) at a flow rate of 6-7 mL/min, eluted with either an isocratic or a gradient system of MeOH-H 2O or MeCN-H 2O (Figures 19-26). 2.6. SPECTROSCOPIC E XAMINATION OF ISOLATES The isolates were chemically characterized by a variety of spectroscopic approaches including UV, IR, MS, 1D, and 2D NMR, as well as X-ray diffraction. The known compounds were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with the values in the literature reported previously after a search via related databases such as Beilstein, and Chemical Abstracts. For the new compounds, structures were elucidated by interpretation of their 1D NMR (such as spectrometry (HRMS or HRMS- MS) for the determination of the exact mass and functional groups via 39 fragmentation pathways. X-ray crystallo graphy was undertaken for a single crystal samples (compound 4). 2.6.1. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) The 1H and/or DPX-300 solvent and tetramethylsilane as an inte rnal standard. Chemical shifts ( ) were expressed in ppm with reference to the TMS signals. 2D experiments such as COSY, HSQC, HMQC, NOESY HMBC performed using standard Bruker pulse sequences. XwinNMR, Nuts, MestRe-C and Perch software packages were used for offline NMR data processing. 2.6.2. Mass spectrometry (MS) All MS experiments were supported by Dr. Dejan Nikolic in Dr. van Breemen's lab. High-resolution mass sp ectra (HRMS) and tandem mass spectra (MS-MS) were obtained on a Micromass (Manchester, UK) Q-Tof-2 Quadrupole/Time of Flight mass spectrome ter equipped with an electrospray ion source (ESI). The spectrometer was operated in either positive or negative ion mode. Tandem mass spectra were acquired at a collision energy of 20 eV using Ar as the collision gas at a pressure of 2.0 x 10-5 mbar. The spectra data were processed with Masslynx software version 3.4. 2.6.3. Ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV) UV max values were determined from the HPLC-PDA chromatograms illustrated in the preparative HPLC section. 40 2.6.4. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) Samples were prepared in solution with filmed on a Specac pellet. FT-IR-ATR ( FT/IR-410 spectrometer. 2.6.5. Optical Rotation ([ ]D) Optical rotations ([ ]D values) of the isolates were measured on a Perkin Elmer 241 automatic polarimeter (\u00dcberlingen, Germany) at 20 \u00b0C. The specific rotation ([ ]20 D ) at the sodium D line ( 589 \u00c5) is calculated as follows: []20 D = (100 x )/(l x c ) where = observed angle of rotation l = length of the path of the light th rough the solution in decimeters (dm) c = concentration of the solution in g/100 mL 41 3. RESULTS 3.1. IDENTIFICATION OF PLANT MATERIALS The four different samples (1-4) of th e dried Angelica roots were identified by a series of analytical approaches including macroscopic and microscopic examinations, and the comparison of chromatograms of TLC and HPLC. The results are summarized as follows. 3.1.1. Macroscopic examination The inspection of their macroscopic characteristics of samples 1-4 in terms of color, aroma and taste revealed that samples 1 and 2, together with reference material were yellowish white in color, with a strong aromatic smell, and sweet and pungent taste. Samples 3 and 4 exhibited yellowish brown colors with a slight smell and slightly bitter taste. (See Table 3). Sample 3: BC 080 Sample 4: BC 158 Figure 2.

Microscopic characteristics Table 4 summarizes the microscopic ch aracteristics of samples 1-4 and reference material observed under light microscopy. The following features were present in all of five samples: parenchymatous cells were in fusiform shape, with slightly thickened walls and very fine oblique crisscross striations; oil cavities were obvious with or without volatile oil droplets inside; and yellowish cork cells were also observed. In addition, the difference in characteristics of the samples 1- 4 was that the vessels in samples 1 and 2, as well as the reference material exhibited scalariform and/or reticulation; samples 3 and 4 showed spiral vessels. 43 Table 4.

HPTLC TLC fingerprints of PE and MeOH extracts of samples 1-4 were obtained according to the experimental protocol, and their profiles were compared with those of the reference material as shown in Figure 3. Developed with four different solvent systems, and visualized by spraying with vanillin-H 2SO4 reagent, HPTLC profiles of PE and MeOH extracts of samples 3-4 exhibited two unique spots (marked with the circles in Figure 3), one in blue and one in green, which were absent in samples 1 and 2, as well as the reference material. In addition, the marked large spot of ligustilide, a major constituent in the essential oil was observed under the UV 365 nm in the HPTLC profiles of samples 1, 2 and reference material. However, there were no or only faint spots at the corresponding Rf values in the HPTLC pr ofiles of samples 3 and 4, suggesting 44 that their contents of ligustilide was much reduced. In each of HPTLC fingerprint profiles, samples 1 and 2 showed very sim ilar HPTLC profiles to that of reference material, and the methanol extracts of samples 3 and 4 have same profiles as that of reference material of A. dahurica (obtained from professor Young-Gab Yun at Wonkwang University, Korea in 2003). 3 4 1 2 S 3 4 S 1 2 3 4 S 1 2 3 4 S 1 2 PE extract MeOH extract MeOH extract 3 4 1 2 S 3 4 S 1 2 3 4 S 1 2 3 4 S A, #1-4 represent samples 1-4, respectively; \"S\" means reference material Figure 3. Comparison of TLC fingerprints of different Angelica samples 45 3.1.4. HPLC HPLC fingerprint profiles of samples 1-4 allowed not only a qualitative comparison of the samples, but also se mi-quantitative characterization of the constituents as seen in Figure 4. The HPLC chromatograms of samples 1 and 2 exhibited the peaks at the same retention time ( tR = 25.2, 27.8, 30.8, 33.7, 34.6, 35.5, 36.3, and 38.1 min) and with similar intensity with those in the reference material. However, instead of the peaks at 27.8 min in samples 1 and 2, two peaks with retention time of 26.8 min and 28.6 min were observed in the HPLC chromatograms of samples 3 and 4. More over, the peak at 25.2 min in those profiles of samples 3 and 4 showed significan tly different intensity with that of the reference material, indicating more abunda nt content of constituents at Rt 25.2 min in samples 3 and 4. Therefore, it was concluded that samples 1 and 2 exhibited the identical HPLC fingerprint profiles with the reference material, and there had both quantitative and qualit ative differences of their constituents between samples 3, 4 and the reference material. 46 AU ints of different Angelica samples. 3.1.5. Summary of plant identification In summary, for botanical identifica tion purpose, the plant materials (samples 1-4) were analyzed by a se ries of analytical techniques involving macroscopic and microscopic examination, as well as comparison of HPTLC and HPLC fingerprint profiles with those of an authentic reference material. It was concluded that sample 1 (BC 165) and sample 2 (BC 167) were indeed Angelica sinensis . Given the different profiles with the reference materialof A. sinensis , samples 3 (BC 080) and 4 (BC 158) could not be confirmed to be this species. By checking their TLC profiles, samples 3 and 4 were finally identified as Angelica dahurica , and their in vitro biological activities were evaluated in GABAa and ER binding assays and summarized in Table 16 in Appendix H. 47 3.2. EXTRACTION AN D PARTITIONING 8 kg of A. sinensis (sample 1, BC 165) was percolated with MeOH to afford MeOH percolate, which was successively partitioned with PE, CHCl 3, and BuOH to give 268 g of PE, 57 g of CHCl 3, 39 g of BuOH, and 158 g of H 2O partitions. A flow chart of the extraction and partitioni ng procedure is shown in Figure 5. A. sinensis (8 kg, BC 165) Partitioning with PE Partitioning with \u00b5g/mL; GABAa assay was run at 50 \u00b5g/mL. Figure 5. Extraction and Partitioning of A. sinensis (Sample 1, BC 165) 3.3. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF EXTRACT AN D PARTITIONS A summary of biological activities of the methanol crude extract of A. sinensis and its subsequent partitions is listed in Table 5. All of biological data presented here are from Dr. Bolton's and Dr. Wang's groups in UIC/NIH Botanical Center, as well as the Institute of Tuberculosis Research (ITR) at UIC. The extracts and partitions with inhibiti on over 50% were regarded as active ones, and subjected to further fractionation. In the initial biological study, a me thanol extract of the dried roots of A. sinensis exhibited serotonergic activity with 59.0 \u00b1 4.0 LSD binding to the 5-HT 7 and 5-HT 5A receptors at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, the MeOH extract showed GABAergic activity with 97% inhibition on [3H] diazepam binding to the GABAa receptor at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. After partitioning, only the PE and CHCl 3 partitions exhibited serotonergic activities with 0 \u00b1 3.0 % inhibitory effects on [3H] LSD binding to the 5-HT 7 receptors, and 80.4 \u00b1 1.6 % and 72.1 \u00b1 19 % inhibition to the 5-HT 5A receptor (100 \u00b5g/mL), respectively. In addition, both partitions were active in the GABAa receptor binding assay with 92 % and 94 % inhibition at 50 \u00b5g/mL. BuOH and H 2O partitions were practically in active in both serotonin binding assays with inhibition below 30 % (Table 5). The MeOH extract was inactive in the ER , ER binding and Ishikawa assays, suggesting it to be non-estrogenic. Table 5. Biological activities of ex tracts and partitions of Angelica sinensis (sample 1) % Inhibition 0 1.6 46 ISOL ATION OF PURE COMPOUNDS The serotonergic activity was localized in the PE and CHCl 3 partitions after partitioning of a serotonergic methanol extract of A. sinensis . Therefore, the PE (P1) and the CHCl 3 partitions (P 2) were combined for further fractionation and isolation of active isolates. A brief fractionation and isolation flow chart is presented in Figure 6. The chromatographi c conditions for the isolation of each compound are illustrated in Figures 7-26. For example, the notation of \"PE and CHCl 3 extracts \u00c6 VLC (1) (Figure 7) \u00c6 F3\" represents that the fraction F3 was resulted from VLC fractionation of the continued PE and CHCl 3 extracts, and the detailed chromatographic conditions of VLC 1 are listed in Figure 7.

Fractionation and isolation of compounds 1-23 from A. sinensis. 50 The pooled P1 (211 g) and P2 (57 g) partitions were subjected to VLC (1) eluting with a stepwise (100:0 0:100) and EtOAc-MeOH (100:0 0:100) to afford thirteen primary pooled fractions (F1-F13) (Figure 7). Fraction F3 (43. 2 g) was further fractionated by VLC (6 x 30 cm) on silica gel (220-400 \u00b5m, 500 g), eluting with a gradient of PE-EtOAc starting from 100% PE to 50% PE in EtOAc to afford 13 secondary fractions (F3-1 to F3-13). Secondary fractions F3-7 and F3-8 were pooled and subjected to preparative VLC fractionation (3 x 25 cm, 80 g of RP C 18) eluted with a MeOH-H 2O (70% MeOH 98% MeOH) was purified by preparative HPLC and was (60:40 95:5) to give F3-7-10-5 and F3-7-10-6, which purified by preparative HPLC with isocratic 70% aqueous MeOH to afford compounds 1 (50.0 mg, tR = 44 min), and 2 (30.0 mg , tR = 48 min). Primary fraction F5 (6.6 g) was chroma tographed over silica gel (600 g, 65- 200 mesh, 9 x 30 cm) using the VLC technique eluting with a gradient of PE- EtOAc-MeOH (100:0:0 0:0:100) to give fourteen secondary fractions (F5-1 to F5-14). Secondary fraction F5-4 (0.8 g) wa s fractionated by VLC (70 g of silica gel, 230-400 mesh, 10 x 1.5 cm) eluting with a PE-EtOAc gradient (100:0 0:100) to give tertiary fractions F5-4-1 to F5-4-5. Compound 17 (20 mg) spontaneously precipitated from tertiary fraction F5-4 -3 at room temperature. The secondary fraction F5-5 (4.5 g) was further separated on a VLC column packed with silica gel (70 g, 230-400 mesh, 1.5 x 10 cm), eluting with a PE-EtOAc step gradient (100:0 0:100) to afford seven tertiary fractions F5-5-1 to F5-5-7. Further purification of F5-5-2 (500 mg) by reverse-phase preparative HPLC (75 % MeOH H at 0-90 min, 7 mL/min at 90-100 min) resulted in the isolation of 6 (3.0 mg, tR = 33 min), 7 (2.2 mg, tR = 55 min), 12 (1.9 mg, tR = 18.5 min), 19 (48.1 mg, tR = 73 min), 21 (1.4 mg, tR = 46 min), 22 (1.6 mg, tR = 91 min) and 23 (0.7 mg, tR = 94 min). Fraction F5-5-4 was also subjected to reverse-phase 51 preparative HPLC using an isocratic solvent system (78 % MeOH in H 2O, 6 mL/min) to afford compounds 4 (3.8 mg, tR = 59 min), 5 (1.6 mg, tR = 54 min), 14 (2.0 mg, tR = 31 min), 15 (1.3 mg, tR = 14 min) and 16 (2.0 mg, tR = 13 min). The primary fraction F7 (4.5 g) was chromatographed by VLC over a silica gel column (500 g, 100-230 mesh) with a stepwise gradient of hexane-CHCl 3- EtOAc (20:80:0 0:0:100) to give nine pooled secondary fractions (F7-1 to F7-9). Fraction F7-5 (1.8 g) was subjected to ascending DCCC at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, using the two-phase solvent system of PE-EtOAc-MeOH-H 2O (6:4:6:4). The tertiary fraction F7-5-8 (150 mg) was further purified by RP-C 18 HPLC using a MeCN-H 2O gradient (60% MeCN 95 % MeCN in H 2O) to afford compound 8 (1.0 mg; tR = 49 min) and 9 (1.0 mg; tR = 58 min). F7-7 and F7-8 were respectively 100% MeOH), which led to the tertiary fractions F7-7-5 and a combination of F7-8-5, F7 -8-6 and MeCN-H 2O (70:30) to give compound 10 (6.0 mg; tR = 42 min). The pooled fractions F7-8-5, F-7-8-6 and F- 7-8-7 were purified by MeCN in H 2O) to afford a mixture of compounds 12 and 13 (2.0 mg; tR = 44 min), as well as pure 10 (5.0 mg; tR = 52 min). F7-8-8 (38.0 mg) was purified by preparative TLC (silica gel, 1 mm, 20 cm x 20 cm) developed with CH 2Cl2-EtOAc (7:3) and monitored under UV 254 nm to yield compound 20 (8.7 mg, Rf = 0.6). Primary fraction F10 (5.6 g) was chro matographed over silica gel (500 g, 220-400 mesh, 7 x 31 cm) using the VLC technique eluting with a gradient of CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (100:0:0 0:0:100) to afford the secondary fraction of a combination of F10-10, F10-11 and F10-12 (325 mg), 120 mg of which was subjected to reverse-phase preparative HPLC (55% MeOH in H 2O, 6 mL/min) to yield compound 11 (10.0 mg, tR = 39 min) and 3 (3.0 mg, tR = 32 min). 52 Compound 18 crystallized spontaneously from the concentrated methanol percolate (E 0) at room temperature.

These pure compounds were structurally identified by a series of spectroscopic techniques, and then biologically evaluated in vitro . 3.5. CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ISOLATED COMPOUNDS 3.5.1. Identification of 1 (Z-ligustilide) O O134 3a5 6 77a89 1011 Compound 1 was obtained as a colorless oil. A preliminary analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum exhibited following signals (Figure 74): A methyl group [ 0.958 (3H, t, J = 7.4)] An olefinic proton (1.8, 9.9), dddt (1.5, 2.1, 4.3, H-9; DEPT-135 and HM QC NMR spectra of 1 indicated the presence of 12 carbon atom s, i.e., a carbonyl group at 167.7, three sp2 28.2, 22.5, 22.4 and 18.6, and one sp3 methyl at 13.8 (Figure 75 and Figure 77). Further analyses of coupling constants in the 1H spectrum of 1 established two units, i.e. CH 3-CH 2- CH2-CH- (butylidene) COSY and HMBC correlations as indicated in Figure 76 and Figure 78, the whole structure of 1 was established by the presence of long-range correlations Z- geometry of the butylidene side chain was determined by the relatively up-fielded chemical shifts of the olefinic proton conjugated enol- it should have experienced a mark ed deshielding effect from its vicinal oxygen atom (O-2) with the signal around 5.8.149 Accordingly, compound 1 was identified as Z-ligustilide. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 1 were consistent with literature values reported previously.150-153 72 3.5.2. Identification of 2 (Z-butylidenephthalide) O O133a4 5 6 77a89 1011 Similar to a butylidene side chain (CH 3-CH 2-CH 2-CH-) in compound 2 was determined by analysis of its 1H (Figure 79) and COSY spectra (Figure 81), and twelve carbons including one carbonyl group were observed in its 13C spectrum (Figure 80), suggesting 2 to be another phthalide. The difference in the 1H spectra of 1 and 2 was the presence of four aromatic protons in that of 2, instead of the two olefinic protons of a cyclohexene ring in 1. Therefore, 2 was indicated to be an aromatic phthalide. The linkage between aromatic ring and butylidene side chain was established by HMBC as indicated in Figure 82. By the above-mentioned analysis, and comparison of its spectra data with those in the literature, 150 compound 2 was unambiguously assigned as Z-butylidenephthalide. 73 3.5.3. Identification of 3 (senkyunolide-I) O OHO OH134 3a5 6 789 1011 7a Compound 3 exhibited very similar 1H and 13C spectra to 1, with the major difference of the signals due to H-6 and H-7, as well as C-6 and C-7 (Figure 74 vs Figure 83, and Figure 75 vs Figure 84). This indicated similar structures for 1 and 3. Instead of 1H signals at 6.294 and 6.009, and 13C signals at 129.9 and 117.2 found in 1, compound 3 showed a glycol group as part of a cyclohexane ring. The coupling constant between these two vicinal hydroxylmethine Hz, indicating the trans configuration. The 1H data agreed with the values previously reported in the literature.151,154 Therefore, 3 was elucidated as senkyunolide I. As 2D spectra of senkyunolide I ( 3) have not been reported before, COSY, HMQC and HMBC data are attached in Figure 85-87 for complete reference. 74 3.5.4. Identification The molecular formula of compound 4 was deduced as C 24H28O4 from a protonated molecule of m/z 381.2076 (calcd for 381.2066) in the HRESIMS spectrum. A single fragment ion of m/z 191 in the ESIMSMS fragmentation spectrum suggested that 4 is a dimeric derivative of two ligustilide moieties (Figure 88). By comparison of its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Table 11, Figure 89-90) with those values reported in the literature,152 compound 4 was unambiguously identified as riligustilide. In addition, the assignments of C-7 and C-8' in the 13C NMR spectrum reported previously152 were corrected based on the analysis of the 2D spectra. In the HMQC spectrum (Figure 92), the carbon signal at 34.9 was correlated to the proton signal at 3.475 [H-7, brd (7.7)], which in turn displayed a HMBC correlation with C- 1 (168.6). At the same time, H-10' at 1.137 exhibited a long range correlation with the carbon signal at 43.9 in the HMBC spectrum (Figure 27 and Figure 93). These findings led to the revision of previous assignment152 of the carbon signals at 34.9 and 43.9 to C-7 and C-8'. The fully reassigned NMR data is presented in Table 11 in APPENDIX B. The absolute stereochemistry of riligustilide ( 4) was established by X-ray crystal structure analysis (Figure 28). 75 X-ray crystal structure an alysis of riligustilide (4): formula C 24H28O4, M = 378.45, colorless plate 0.01 x 0.10 x 0.10 mm, a = 6.0766 (5), b = 12.6776 (9), c = 27.1207 (16) \u00c5, = 92.667 space group P21/c (No. 14), = 1.54178 \u00c5, T = 223 K, 10729 reflections co llected 2510 unique, averaged ( Rint = 0.091) 256 refined parameters, R = 0.110, GOF=1.083, max. residual electron density 0.14 (-0.16) 8' 10'1 4 OO Figure 27.

Its UV spectrum exhibited a maximum absorption at 278 nm, and the IR spectrum showed strong bands at 1761, 1680 and 1620 cm-1. These data suggested the presence of an ,- unsaturated lactone and an aromatic ring. The molecular formula of 5 was established as C 24H26O4 from a protonated molecule at m/z 379.1925 (calcd for 379.1909) in the HRESIMS spectrum, and twelve degrees of unsaturation in the structure were deduced. Two fragment ions of m/z 191 and 189 corresponding to two monomers of a ligustilide and a buty lidenephathalide were observed in the product ion spectrum (Figure 29), indicating 5 to be a dimeric phthalide. The 1H NMR spectrum of 5 exhibited the following signals (Figure 30): Two methyl groups [ 0.950 (3H, t, J = 7.4) and 0.762 (3H, = 7.4)] An olefinic protons Four aromatic protons [ 7.737 (1H, ddd, J = 7.6, 7.5, 1.0 Hz), 7.825 (1H, ddd, J = 7.6, 1.0, 1.0 Hz), 7.639 (1H, ddd, J = 7.6, 1.0, 1.0 Hz), and 7.529 (1H, ddd, J = 7.6, Three m)] Six methylenes between Analysis of the APT and HSQC NMR spectra (Figure 31 and Figure 33 ) of 5 demonstrated the presence of 24 carbon s, including two carbonyl groups ( six sp3 methylenes ( 28.2, 26.5, 22.6, 21.3, 20.9 and 20.0), two sp3 methyls ( 14.3 and 14.1). The 1H and APT NMR spectra of 5 were almost superimposable on the spectra recorded for 4, with the major difference being the presence of aromatic signals in 5. When comparing their 1H and APT NMR spectra, it was, however, readily observed that the two methylene groups ( 2.750, 2.572/19.6 and 2.612, 2.478/22.5) present in 4 were missing in 5, due to the emergence of an additional double bond ( 7.639/121.0 and 7.737/134.8) to form an aromatic ring in 5. This was consistent with the MS data (one more degree of unsaturation and two less protons in the formula of 5, as well as fragment ion of m/z 191 and 189). Therefore, it was concluded that 5 was composed of one ligust ilide and one butylidenephthalide unit, rather than two ligustilide units. The dimeric linkage between the two units the butylidene side chain in the ligustilide moiety was determined by the NOESY correlation between H-8 and H-4a. The relative configuration of 5 was established by the NOESY data through the presence of cross-peak correlations between H-6 and H-7, and among H-7, H- 4' and H-8' (Figure 35). On the basis of the foregoing evidences, the structure of 5 was elucidated as a novel spiroc yclic (C3') phthalide dimer of a Z-ligustilide and a Z-butylidenephthalide, which was given th e trivial name of gelispirolide.

ESIMSMS analysis resulted in m/z 189, which was consistent with that of butylphthalide.58 The 1H and APT NMR spectral data of 6 were observed to be similar to those of Z- butylidenephathalide (2) (Figure 79 and Figure 80). Thus, 6 had to be a phthalide. Its 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 37) Four aromatic protons at J = 7.6, 1.2 Hz), 7.685 (1H, ddd, J = 7.7, 7.6, 1.2 Hz), 7.542 (1H, ddd, J = 7.7, 7.6, 0.8 Hz), 7.427 (1H, dd, J = 7.6, 0.8 Hz, H-4), suggesting the presence of a 1,2-disubstituted aromatic ring. An oxygen-bearing methine signal at 5.490 (1H, dd, J = 7.2, 3.9 Hz) coupled with two methylene protons at 2.205/1.776, another one at 5.000 (1H, m) exhibited coupling with two methylene signals at 1.823/1.721, together with a methyl group at 1.265 (3H, d, J = 6.4 Hz) as observed in the COSY spectrum (Figure 39). 86 One vinylic proton at 6.055 (1H, qq, J = 7.3, 1.5) was observed to couple with two vinylic methyls at 1.975 (3H, dq, J = 7.3, 1.5) and 1.885 (3H, dq, J = 1.5, 1.5). The APT NMR spectrum (Figure 38) displayed 17 carbons, including two 128.3). The presence of an angelic acid unit was indicated by a spin system composed of proton signals at 6.055 (1H, qq, J = 7.3, 1.5), 1.975 (3H, dq, J = 7.3, 1.5) and 1.885 (3H, dq, J = 1.5, 1.5), 149 which was further confirmed by an ESIMSMS fragment ion of m/z 83 (Figure 36). The connectivity between the butylphalide and the angelic acid moieties was established by the HMBC correlation between the protons at 5.000 (1H, m, H-10) and the quaternary carbon signal at 167.9 (C-1') (Figure 40). Thus, compound 6 was elucidated as an angeloyl ester of butylphthalide, and given a trivial name of 10-angeloylbutylphthalide. 10-Angeloylbutylphthalide (6): pale yellow oil; [ ]20 D -16 \u00b0 (c 0.1, CH 2Cl2); ions m/z (% base peak) 189 (100), 171 (83), 153 (8), 145 (16), 133 (10), and 83 (6). 87 133a4 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430m/z 36100 %as5jan1209 19 (0.982) MS-MS of protonated 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240m/z 2100 %as5jan2602 19 (0.982) TOF MSMS 289.10ES+ 83171 133145 153 197 143Relative absorbanceRelative absorbance 100 Figure 36.

The strong bands at 1776 and 1700 cm-1 in IR spectrum indicated the existence of an ,-unsaturated lactone ring.94 The 1H NMR (Figure 42) and COSY spectrum (Figure 44) suggested the presence of following moieties: A saturate butyl [3.016 (1H, dd, J = 7.8, 7.8 Hz, H-8), 1.790 (1H, dddd, J = 14.1, 10.2, Hz, H-9a), 1.510 (1H, dddd, butylidene side chain Two olefinic attributable to an isolated double bond [ 6.113 (1H, ddd, J = 9.8, 6.4, 2.0 Hz, H-6') and 5.994 (1H, dd, J = 9.8, H-7')] 93 Four aromatic protons [ 7.901 = 7.4, 1.2 Hz, J = 7.6, 1.2 13C NMR spectrum of 7 exhibited the presence of 24 carbons with two ester carbonyl units [ 173.7 (C-1'), 168.3 (C-1)], and displayed a resonance pattern very similar to a combination of those of the phthalide monomers Z- ligustilide ( 1) and Z-butylidenephthalide ( 2) (Table 10), except that the vinyl carbons of the two double bonds in 1 and 2 were substituted with a tertiary and three quaternary carbons in 7 (13C: 145.8/109.5 88.3/52.8 and 147.1/124.0 54.1/48.3) 12). This suggested that 7 is a phthalide dimer composed of one ligustilide and one butylphthalide unit. This conclusion was further confirmed by the presence of two abundant fragment ions of m/z 191 and 189 in the product ion tandem mass spectrum (Figure 41). The 1H NMR of 7 displayed an olefinic proton of a butylidene side chain at 4.406 (1H, t, H-8'), and the upfield shift of this signal indicated that it was not affected by the deshielding effect of the neighboring oxygen, and demonstrated the butylidene side chain in the ligustilide moiety to have Z-configuration.149 The linkage of the HMBC (H-8 C-1' and H-8 C-7') summarized in Figure 46-47. Consequently, compound 7 was determined to be a dimeric phthalide connecting C-3 and C-8 of a C-3'a and C-7'a of a Z-ligustilide moiety to form a cyclobutane ring. The NOESY spectrum established the relative configuration of compound 7 as follows. The correlations between H-4'b and H-8' excluded the E-configuration of the butylidene side chain. The presence of cross-peaks between H-4 and H-4'a, H-8 H-7' estab lished that these protons are located in the same plane (Figure 48). Thus, 7 was determined to be a new dimeric phthalide of Z-butylidenephthalide and Z-ligustilide named to the spirocyclic partial C3'a.

Postulated biosynthet ic pathway of sinaspirolide ( 7) spectroscopic data (NMR, IR, and MS) of 8 were found to be very similar to those of 7. The HRESIMS spectrum of compound 8 showed a protonated molecule of m/z 379.1923 (calcd for 379.1909) which suggested the same molecular formula (C 24H26O4) as 7. Furthermore, the product ion tandem mass spectrum of 8 also contained abundant fragment ion peaks of m/z 191 and 189 that were also found in 7, which indicated 8 might be another dimeric phthalide of a ligustilide and a butyliden ephthalide unit (Figure 50). Both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 8 were very similar to those of 7 (Table 12), and the major difference between 7 and 8 was that the two vicinal olefinic protons 6.113 (1H, 103 ddd, 2.0 Hz, H-6') and 5.994 (1H, dd, J = 9.8, 2.8 Hz, H-7')] of 7 were not present in the 1H NMR spectrum of 8. Instead, a doublet of an proton coupling with a methine proton 3.246 (1H, dd, J = 6.6, 1.3 Hz, H-6')] was observed at 7.469 ( J = 6.6 Hz, H-7'). The 13C spectrum of 8 showed signals for an sp2 quaternary carbon at 133.9 and a conjugated lactone carbonyl carbon at 163.9, as compared to carbon at 131.4 and a non-conjugated lactone carbonyl carbon at 173.7 observed in 7. Further comparative analysis indicated that the double bond between C-6' and C-7' in 7 was shifted to C-7' and C-7'a in 8, which was confirmed correlations C-5' and C-7'; H-9 C-6') (Figure compound 8 was a dimeric phthalide possessing a 3-3a', 8-6' linkage , which most likely originated from a Diels-Alder reaction with the butylidene side chain of a butylidenephthalide molecule as the dienophile (Figure 57). In addition, the fact that the olefinic proton of H-8' resonated at a markedly higher field ( 3.214) compared to that of 1 ( 5.227) due to a shielding effect by its spatially close aromatic ring, supported the geometry of the butylidene side chain as Z-configured. The overall relative configuration was established on the basis of the following key NOESY correlations between well as H-9b an d H-6' (Figure 56).

The 1H and 13C spectra of 9 (Figure 59-60) were very similar to those of 3, initially suggesting that it represents a phthalide monomer with twelve carbons and fourteen hydrogens. However, the HRESIMS spectrum of 9 exhibited a protonated molecule of m/z 381.2079 (calcd for 381.2066) (3.3 ppm), corresponding to a molecular formula of C 24H28O4 with eleven degrees of unsaturation. The product ion tandem mass spectrum of 9 displayed one abundant fragment ion peak of 191, indicating 9 to be a phthalide dimer composed of two ligustilide units (Figure 58). One re asonable explanation why a dimer molecule would give rise to a \"monomer-like\" set of the 1H and 13C spectra was that two ligustilide moieties were li nked together in a symmetrical fashion. Therefore, there would be pairs of correspondi ng signals that are magnetically equivalent. This sy mmetrical linkage hypothesis al so justifies the presence at 2.984 (H-6,6')/ 35.3 (C-6,6') and the sites of linkage of two ligustilide units. In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 63), the pr onounced long-range co rrelations were observed between H-7/7' and C'6'/6, well as H-7/7' and C-6'/6, H-6/6' and C-7'/7. This established th e dimeric linkage of two ligustilide moieties, indicating the presence of a cyclobutane ring. Th ere are 12 possible 112 symmetrical structures (series A and B) for compound 9 as shown in Figure 64 and Figure 65. In structure A se ries, two ligustilid e monomers were mutually connected in a head-to-tail pattern, i.e., C6-C7' and C7-C6'. In structure B series, two ligustilide moieti es linked in a pattern of head-to-head, i.e., C6-C6' and C7-C7'. Four protons in the cyclobutane ring including H6 and H7, as well as H6' and H7' could be either in trans -geometry or cis- geometry in pairs. Therefore, 9 was determined as a phthalide dimer composed of two symmetric al ligustilide (6-7', 7-6'), and the trivial name of angediligustilide is proposed for 9. 5-3-10 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 340 360 380 400 420 440 460 480m/z 0100 %asnov110301 3834195-3-10 ms/ms of 191 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200m/z 0100 %asnov110304 1 (0.052) absrobanceBRelative absrobanceA Figure 58.

The 1H spectrum (Figure 94) showed the following units: A trans double bond [H-7: 7.598, d (15.9), 7.109, dd 2.0)] Two mutually coupled me thine [H-7': 4.361, t (7.1), and H-8': 2.934, t (7.1)] These signals, together with 13C data (Figure 95) showed typical patterns of a p-substituted phenethyl an d a feruloyl unit with a trans double bond between C-7 and C-8.156 By further comparing the 1H and 13C spectra of 10 with the literature,157,158 compound 10 was identified as p- hydroxyphenethyl trans -ferulate. While p-hydroxyphenethyl trans -ferulate , and Coriandum sativum previously, the first report of 10 from A. sinensis .

Identification of 11 (angeliferulate) OO OH 3'4'5'6' 7' 8'9' OCH 3 Compound 11 was obtained as a pale yello w oil. The IR spectrum of 11 exhibited characteristic absorption ban ds at 3385, 1701, 1600 and 1515 cm-1, suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl, an ,-unsaturated ester carbonyl, and aromatic moieties, respectively. deprotonated molecule of m/z 403.1380 (calcd for 403.1393), corresponding to a molecular formula of C 21H24O8 containing ten degrees of unsaturation. The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data of 11 (Table 13) were found to be similar to those of p-hydroxyphenethyl trans -ferulate (10). A fragment ion of m/z 193 (Figure 66) in the CID product ion spectrum suggested the presence of a feruloyl unit.159,160 The 1H NMR spectrum of 11 displayed signals at 7.588 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz) an d 6.322 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz), indicating the presence of two trans -coupled olefinic protons, and signals and 3.278 (3H, s) attributable to th ree methoxyl groups . In addition, two sets of 1,3,4-trisubstituted phenyl units (ABX spin systems) were revealed by a set of signals including 7.061 (1H, dd, J = 8.2, 2.0 Hz), 7.030 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.915 (1H, d, J = 8.2 Hz), as well as anothe r set of signals at 6.905 (1H, d, J = 8.6 Hz), 6.810 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz), and 6.806 (1H, dd, J = 8.6, 2.0 Hz), and confirmed by the COSY spectru m. The observed downfield chemical 121 shift of the methylene and methine protons 4.148 (m, H-9'b), 3. 983 and 4.116 (d, J = 11.8 Hz, H-7') indicated attachment to the oxygen-bearing carbons (C-9', C-8' and C-7', respectively). The presence of an este r carbonyl group was revealed by a 13C NMR signal at 167.4 (C-9). The linkage among the different moieties and the substitution patterns we re fully assigned by th e following HMBC correlations as indicated the af orementioned data, compound 11 was identified as a prev iously unreported neoligna n, for which the trivial name of angeliferula te is proposed.

Identification of 12 (N-butylbenzenesulphonamide) SO ON HH2 C C H2H2 C CH312 3 4 5 61' 2'3'4' Compound 12 was obtained as a colorless oil. The molecular formula of 12 was established as C 10H16NO2S based on a protonated molecule of m/z 214.0913 (calcd 214.0902)(5.3 HRESIMS spectrum. Two fragment ions of m/z 141 and 77 were observed in the product ion tandem mass spectrum (Figure 96). In the 1H spectrum (Figure 97), the presence of a butyl side chain was suggested by protons resonated at 2.966 [1H, dt (6.9, A mono- substituted (AA'MM'X spin system) benzene ring was revealed by the proton signals at 7.881 [2H, d (7.8, 2.0, 1.7), H-2 H-6]; (7.8), t (7.8), H-4]. In ad dition, the broad triplet peak at 4.318 corresponded to an NH proton. On the basis of discussion mentioned above, as well as comparison with literature values reported previously,161 compound 12 was elucidated as a sulphonamide, i.e., N-butylbenzenesulphonamide. N-butylbenzenesulphonamide ( 12) was previously isolated from a Pseudomonas strain, which was obtained from a greenhouse soil sample. It exhibited antifungal activities against phytopathogenic fungi such as P. ultimum capsici , R. solani , and B. cinerea with ED 50 values of 73, 41, 33 and 101 \u00b5g/ml, respectively.161 However, this is th e first report of a sulfonamide from a higher pl ant. To determine whether 12 is a natural constituent of A. sinensis , or an environmental contaminant sequestered during plant growth is in need of further investigation. 129 3.5.13. Identification of 12 and 13 (Z-6-hydroxyl-7-methoxyl- dihydroligustilide & N-butylbenzenesulphonamide) SO ON HCH312 3 4 O OCH 3HO O133a4 5 6 77a89 1011 12 13 A mixture was ident ified from MS and 1H spectra as an unresolved mixture of Z-butylbenzenesulphonamide ( 12) and Z-6-hydroxyl-7-methoxyl- dihydroligustilide ( 13) at a ratio of approximately 8:10 according to the signal intensities in its 1H spectrum. The presence of two [M+Na]+ ion peaks at m/z 236.0691 ( 13) and m/z 261.0974 ( 12) in the HRESIMS spectrum of the mixture suggested that it contained two compounds with molecular formulas of C 10H15NO2S (12) and C 13H18O4 (13) (Figure 98), respectively. By comparison of the 1H spectrum of the mi xture with that of 12 (Figure 97 vs Figure 99), signals numbering with A prefixed were consistent with those of 12, indicating the presence of Z-butylbenzenesulphonamide ( 12) in the mixture as a minor component. The slightly stronger signals numbering with B prefixed corresponded to major compound 13, consisting of a butylidene side chain [ 0.951, t (7.4), H-11; 1.502, tq 7.4), H-10; methoxyl ( 2.551 and 1.901-2.110, H-4 & H-5). By comparing these 1H spectral data with those of 3, as well taking into account the literature,58,151,152,154 compound 13 was identified as Z-6-hydroxyl- 7-methoxyl-dihydroligustilide. Theref ore, the mixture was ( 12) and Z-6-hydroxyl-7-methoxyl- dihydroligustilide ( 13) in of 10:8. 130 3.5.14. Identification of 14 (imperatorin) OOOO 1 2 3 4 5678 9 1011121'2'3' 4'5' presence of a (calcd for 271.0971) (1.4 ppm) in the HRESIMS spectrum of 14 enabled assignment of a molecular formula of C 16H14O4 with ten degrees of unsa turation (Figure 100). The 1H spectrum of 14 exhibited the singlet of a vinyl proton at 7.362 (H-5), 6.373 (d, 9.6), 7.693 (d, 2.2), and 6.816 (d, 2.2), which corresponde d to two cyclic double bonds (3 and 11, respectively), and a prenyl unit co nsisting of the proton signals at 5.614 (tqq, 7.3, 1.4, 1.4), 5.008 (dqq, 7. 3, 1.1, 1.1), 1.745 (dt, 1.4, 1.1) and 1.723 (dd, 1.4, 1.1). This was con firmed by the presence of an abundant fragment ion peak in ta ndem mass spectrum of 14 at m/z 203, representing the loss of a prenyl unit ([MH-68]+, Figure 100). These data are fully consistent with literature values pub lished for imperatorin.162,163 Therefore, 14 was identified as the prenylated furano coumarin molecule of imperatorin. Although it has been obtained fr om many other species in genus Angelica , such as A. archangelica , A. dahurica and A. sylvestris ,164 this is the first report of 14 from A. sinensis . 131 3.5.15. Identification of 15 (ferulic acid) HO OCH 3OHO 1 2 3456 7 89 Compound 15 was obtained as colorless crystals. The 1H spectrum of 15 indicated the presence of a methoxy l group (4-OH), a tri-substituted aromatic ring with thine groups (H-7, H-8), as indicated in Figure 102. The trans double bond between H-7 and H-8 was demonstrated by its coupling constant of J =15.8. Comparison of its 1H and 13C spectra with published data165-167 led to the identific ation of compound 15 was 3-methoxy- 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, common ly known as ferulic acid. Ferulic acid has been used as a marker compound for A. sinensis products in many countries. Given its ubiquitous distribution in plants and lack of pharmacological and chemotaxon omical distinctiveness, it deserves more discussion that ferulic ac id is used as a biomarker for A. sinensis and its products. 132 3.5.16. Identification of 16 (vanillin) HO HO1 23 4 5 67O The 1H spectrum of 16 exhibited a singlet at 9.834, which was attributable to an aldehyde group, and another singlet at 3.976 (3H) that corresponded to a methoxyl group. In addition, an AMX-trisubstituted aromatic ring system was indicated by protons at 7.432 (dd, 8.4, 1.7), 7.426 (d, 1.7) and 7.047 (d, 8.4). By comparison of the 1H and APT 13C spectral data of 16 (Figure 103) with those reported in the literature,116,168,169 compound 16 was identified as vanillin. 3.5.17. (stigmasterol) 15161718 2021 2223242526 27 28 2919 Compound 17 was identified as stigmasterol, a ubiquitous phytosterol occurring naturally in a wide variety of plants, by comparison of its 1H spectrum with that in the literature.170 133 3.5.18. Identification of 18 (sucrose) OHO HO H2O OHO OOHOH OHOH1 2 3 4 56 78910 11 12 Compound 18 was identified as sucrose as a result of consistency of its 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Figure 104) with those in the literature.171 3.5.19. Identification of 19 (falcarindiol) OH HO389 12 4567 10 1211 13 1415 1617 Compound 19 was obtained as a yellowish oil. The 1H spectrum exhibited an allylic alcohol moiety at 5.943 (ddd, 17.1, 10.2, 5.3), 5.466 (ddd, 17.1, 1.2, 1.0), 5.254 (dt, 10.2, 1.2) and 4.936 (ddd, 5.3, 1.0, 1.0), two vinyl protons at 5.606 (dt, 10.7, 7.4) and 5.521 (dt, 10.7, 8.3) corresponding to a cis double bonds at 9,10, a hydroxylmethine protons at 5.213 (dt, 8.3, 1.0 ), a triplet peak at 0.882 (t, 7.0) due to a methyl group (H- 17), and six methylene groups between 1.240-2.105 (Figure 105). The 13C and DEPT-135 spectra showed four sp carbons at 79.8, 78.3, 70.3 68.7, 63.4 58.5, one methyl carbon at 14.1, and six methylenes at 31.8, 29.3, 29.2, 29.1, 27.7 and 22.6 (Figure 1 06). By comparison of spectral data discussed he rein with those reporte d in the literature,172 compound 19 was assigned as falcarindiol. Falcarindiol ( 19) previously isolated from Oplopanax horridus and Aegopodium podagraria , and and anaesthetic activities.173-176 was te sted for anti-TB activity against two pathogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37R v and E RDMAN ) in vitro . The results showed that falcarindiol has potent in vitro anti-TB activity with MIC values of 6.0 \u00b5g/ml vs. Erdman strain, and 26.7 \u00b5g/ml vs. H37R v strain.177 It has been found that falcarindiol is very unstable after purification. A study on its stability showed that falc arindiol had totally disappeared after being stored in CDCl 3 at room temperature for 15 days. The mechanism of decomposition needs more investigation. 135 3.5.20. Identification of 20 (9Z,17-octadecadiene-12,14-diyne-1,11,16- triol, 1-acetate) O HOOH 179 12 1618108 2 456 7 13 1531'2' Compound 20 appeared as a colorless oil. Its molecular formula of C20H28O4 was determined based on the [M+Na]+ ion peak of m/z 355.1924 (calcd 255.1885) in spectru m (Figure 107). The 1H and 13C spectra of 20 were very similar to 19 (Figure 108-109), except for the absence of signals due to a methyl group ( 0.882, 14.1) and the addition of a carbonyl group ( 171.6), a methyl group ( 2.05, 21.1), and an oxygen- bearing methine group ( 4.06, 64.7). By comparison of its MS and NMR spectral data with literature values,174,178,179 20 was determined to be an analog of falcarindiol, i.e., 9 Z,17-octadecadiene-12,14-diyne-1,11,16-triol, 1- acetate. 9Z,17-Octadecadiene-12,14-diyne-1,11,16-triol, 1-acetate had been isolated previously from the Apiaceae and Araliaceae174 and displayed inhibitory activity on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) cyclooxygen ase (COX-1) values of 24 \u00b5M and 73 \u00b5M, respectively.179 It also showed potent activities against two pathogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37R v and Erdman) with MIC values of 1.4 \u00b5g/ml and 25.3 \u00b5g/ml, respectively, and no significant cytotoxicity against VERO cells (IC 50 > 120 \u00b5g/ml).177 This established its selectivity index (SI=IC 50/MIC) to be greater than 100, which means that further evaluation of this polyyne using in vivo models of tuberculosis infection in mice is warranted. 136 3.5.21. Identification of 21 (heptadeca-1-ene-9,10-epoxy-4,6-diyne-3,8- 1011 1213 1415 1617 The molecular formula of 21 was established as C 17H24O3 on the basis of a HRESIMS data with [M+Na]+ at m/z 299.1672 (calcd 299.1623) (Figure 110). Comparison of the 1H NMR data of 21 with that of 19 (Figure 111 vs 105) revealed that the two olefinic protons ( 5.521 and 5.606) in 19 corresponding to 9,10 disappeared in the 1H spectrum of 21. Instead, two additional oxygen-bearing methine signals [ 3.190, dd (7.4, 4.4), H-9; and 3.067, dt (5.5, 4.4), H-10] were observed in 21. The analysis of the HRMS data indicated that 21 and 19 contained same number of carbons and hydrogens, with an additional oxygen being present in 21. It was concluded that the double bond at 9,10 was substituted with an epoxide ring. The configuration of the epoxide ring in the structure of 21 was determined to be cis based on the coupling constant of J 4.4 Hz between H-9 and H-10. These data were in agreement with those repo rted in the literature,180 therefore, 21 was unambiguously assigned heptadeca-1-ene-9,10-epoxy-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol. It was originally isolated from Panax quinquefolius , and exhibited cytotoxic activity against L1210 leukemia cells. This is the first isolation of 21 from genus Angelica . 137 3.5.22. Identification of 22 (oplopandiol) 124561011121314151617 7OH HO38 9 The 1H spectrum of compound 22 resembled that of 19, except for the absence of an allylic alcohol moiety at 5.943 (ddd, 17.1, 10.2, 5.3), 5.466 (ddd, 17.1, 1.2, 1.0), 5. 254 (dt, 10.2, 1.2) and 4.936 (ddd, 5.3, 1.0, 1.0). Instead, an additional methyl peak at 1.017 (3H, t, 7.4) and a methine signal at 1.749 in 22 (Figure 112) indicated that this end of molecule was saturated. On the basis of the above an alysis, as well as comparison of its 1H spectral data with th ese values in the li terature, compound 22 was identified as the known polyyne oplopandiol, which was first obtained from Oplopanax horridus activity.174 138 3.5.23. OO124567 1011 1213 1415 23 could readily be identified as 8-hydroxy-1-methoxy-9- heptadecene-4,6-diyn-3-one by comparison of its 1H spectrum with that of 22 (Figure 113 vs Figure 112). The 1H spectra of 22 and 23 were very similar, except for the presence of a methoxyl signal at 3.348 (3H, s) and two mutually J=6.0) and 2.821 were attributable to two oxygen-bearing me thylene groups in the 1H spectrum of 23. Instead, a highfield methyl groups at 1.017 (3H, t, J=7.4), a hydroxylmethine signal at as well as an oxygen-bearing methylene peak at 1.749 were observed in the 1H spectrum of 22. The assignment was confirmed by its agreement with data reported in the literature.181,182 While 8-hydroxy-1-methoxy-, Z-9-heptadecene-4,6-diyn-3-one (23) has been synthesized,181,182 this is the first report of 23 as a natural product. 139 3.5.24. Summary of identification of pure compounds The chemical structures of the isolates 1-23 (Figure 72-73) were elucidated by a series of spectroscopic techniques, including UV, IR, MS, 1D and 2D NMR, as well as X-ray single crystal diffraction. Among these, six are new compounds (5-9, 11); angeliferulate ( 11), The dimeric phthalides sinaspirolide (7), and ansaspirolide (8), and angediligustilide( 9). In addition to the six new compounds, 17 known compounds ( 1-4, 10, 12- 23) were identified as Z-ligustilide ( hydroxy-1-methoxy-9-heptadecene-4,6-diyn-3-one ( 23). Compounds 12, 14, 20- 23 have not been described as being contained in A. sinensis or as natural products. The structures of isolates 1-23 are shown in Figures 72-73. 140 O OO O OO OH OCH 3HOOCH 3 OH OCH 312 O OOO OO O O3 4 OCH 3HOOOOH5O O 6O O 7O OHO OH 11 109b 12SO ONHO OOOOOO O 9a Figure 72.

BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ISOLATED COMPOUNDS 3.6.1. 5-HT 7 receptor binding activity In many in vitro studies, pure compounds from natural products were usually regarded as potent active or active if their IC 50 values are less than 10 \u00b5M, and moderate and weak active if tho se values are in the range of 10 and 200 \u00b5M.183,184 In our study, the isolates (1-23) were evaluated for serotonergic activity in an in vitro 5-HT 7 receptor binding assay. The results (Table 6) show that Z-butylidenephthalide ( 2), exhibited effects on [3H] LSD binding to the 5-HT 7 receptor with IC 50 values of 126.7 \u00b5M, 47.6 \u00b5M, 117 .5 riligustilide ( 4) and imperatorin ( 14) displayed 57 % and 69 % inhibition at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M, respec tively. This wide distribution of serotonergic activity of isolates from A. sinensis suggests that the serotonergic effect of A. sinensis extract is due to mu ltiple components or from a synergic action of different compounds. 143 Table 6.

Other isolates were inactive in the assay. These data showed that A. sinensis contains GABAa ligands. As described in the 5-HT 7 assay that compounds with IC 50 values less than 10 \u00b5M are considered potent, all the isolated compounds exhibited moderate or weak activities in the GABAa binding assay. 144 Table 7.

Anti-TB activity Prompted by literature reports and antimycobacterial activities, five isolated polyynes ( 19-23) from A. sinensis were evaluated for their in vitro anti-TB activity agains t two pathogenic strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37R v and E RDMAN ). Rifampin was used as positive control, and it exhibited MIC values of 0.05 and 0.06 \u00b5g/ml against ERDMAN and H37R v strains, respectively. Natura l products with MICs less than 1 \u00b5g/ml are regarded as very potent ac tive. Those with MIC values in the range of 1 to 16 \u00b5g/ml are considered potent, an d weak active if their MICs are between 16 to 64 \u00b5g/ml. F alcarindiol ( 19) and 9 Z,17-octadecadiene-12,14- diyne-1,11,16-triol, 1-acetate ( 20) exhibited potent in vitro anti-TB activities with MIC values of 6.0 \u00b5g/ml and 1.4 \u00b5g/ml vs. Erdman, and 26.7 \u00b5g/ml and 25.3 \u00b5g/ml vs. H37R v strains, respectively. Oplopandiol ( 22) displayed weak activity with an MIC value of 50 \u00b5g/m l against both strains. Heptadeca-1-ene- 9,10-epoxy-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol ( 4,6-diyn-3-one with MICs greater than 60 \u00b5g/ml. Interestingly, none of the five compounds exhibite d significant cytotoxicity 145 against VERO cells at highest test concentration (their IC 50 values > 120 \u00b5g/ml) Accordingly, their anti-TB selecti vity is high and a selectivity index (SI=IC 50/MIC) of greater than 100 was determined for 20. This warrants further evaluation of the polyyne 20 using in vivo models of tuberculosis infection in mice. These findings under line the role of polyynes as anti-TB active principles in ethnobotanical prepar ations, and establish an interesting new biological target for A. sinensis . Table 8.

Summary of biological activities of the active isolates OO O OOO OH OCH 3HOOCH 3 OH OCH 3 GABAaGABAa : IC: IC5050= ( 1) and falcarindiol ( 19) are two major components in Angelica sinensis . However, they are labile once isolated as pure compounds. After being stored for 15 days at room temperature, over 50% of Z-ligustilide (1) and all of falcarindiol ( 19) decomposed, indicating that they are quite sensitive to temperature, air and light. Accordingly, a cool and dry place is recommended for the storage. In addit ion, high temperature should be avoided during the extraction, partitioni ng, fractionation and purification. In this project, percolation was employ ed for extraction. The subsequent extracts, fractions and pure compounds should be kept in a cool place and away from lights in order to avoid decomposition. 3.7.2. Full assignments of 1H spectra of known compounds While the 1H NMR data of known compou nds have been previously reported in the literature , the majority of assign ments are incomplete, and more coupling patter ns have been labeled as mult iplets. In this dissertation, full spin-system analysis of falcarindiol ( 19) were completed. For this purpose, iteration and full spin simulation were performe d using PERCH NMR software and yielded complete NMR parameter sets from the experimental spectra of Z-ligustilide ( 1) and Z- butylidenephthalide ( 2). The results demonstrated that the iterated spectra for both compounds match exactly the expe rimental spectra. This led to the unambiguously assignment of the full spin systems of the compounds. In compound 1, the proton signals at H4 and H5 were found to be as a triplet 148 and a doublet of doublet of triplet, and showed a virtual coupling of J=1.8 Hz and J=1.5 Hz, respectively . Therefore, it has to be pointed out that the signals of H4 and H5 should not be labeled as dt and dddt peaks, respectively, owing to the fact that signal splitting is only the result of a distinct higher order effect, i.e., virtua l coupling (Figure 115). In compound 2, proton signals of H4 and H5 were unambiguously assigned as ddd (7.8, 0.9, 0.8) and ddd (7.8, 7.3, 1.0), aided by full spin analysis of PERCH simulation (Figure 116). 3.7.3. Major constituents of A. sinenesis Phthalide compound s are abundant in A. sinensis , and previously reported to show several pharmacologica l effects. Many ph thalide monomers have been isolated from A. sinensis , with Z-ligustilide ( 1) and butylidenephthalide ( 2) being the most abundant. Z-Ligustilide accounts for ca. 50% of the essential oil of A. sinensis . Recently, many dimeric phthalides have been isolated in A. sinensis , as well as from other plants. These dimers attract more attention in terms of both their chemical and biological significance. In addition to the five phthalide dimers is olated in this Table APPENDIX E lis ts a summary of phthalide dimers isolated or identified thus far from natural sources. Their structures are shown in Figure 114. So far a total of 19 ph thalide dimers are known in nature. All of them were isolated or identified from only seven species in the via followed by further ring cleavage and oxidation. Angelicide was observed as the 3 -enantiomer of riligustilide ( 4), and tokinolide B as an 8 -epimer of angeolide. Levistolide B and senkyunolide O are 8- or 8 -epimers of levistolide A, respectiv ely. Moreover, an gelicolide is the 8,8-epimer of Z,Z-3.3,8.8-diligustilide. In general, compounds are formed by Diels-Alder reactions, except for th ose compounds bear ing a cyclobutanol ring, which are generated by 2,2-cycloaddition.152,185,186 . In a photosynthetic study, Z-ligustilide was irradiated and forme d four phthalide dimers, including the naturally occurring riligustil none of other three photosynthetic artifacts were found in our experiments. This suggests that the new phthalide dimers isolated in this pr oject are likely to be biosynthesized under the (partial) control of plants. Polyacetylenes represent another important class of compounds in A. sinensis . Of the five polyyne s isolated in this project, four were new from this plant. In terms of chemotaxonomic distribution, polyynes occur antibacterial and anti-mycobacterial activities,176 and their significant anti-TB activity was recently established in a collaborative study.177 In addition to the interpretation of MS and NMR data for the six new compounds ( 5-9, 11) presented in the text , the analysis of the 1H and/or 13C data of known compounds wa s also conducted, and their fully assigned NMR spectra are included in Ap pendix C for reference. 150 3.7.4. Standardization Botanical standardization: The chemical consti tuents present in substitutes and adulterants are different from Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels. Even in samples of the same species, phyto-components can widely vary depending on the cultivation location (soil, water, light, etc.) and harvesting seasons. The purpose of botanical standardization is to unify the plant samples to be investigated. For most medicinal plants, ph armacological effects of extracts may arise from synergetic effects involving multiple constituents rather than one single compound. In this project, a series of analytical techniques involving macroscopic and microscopic examinations , as well as comparison of TLC and HPLC fingerprints were es tablished four different Angelica samples. These experiments provide the over all characteristics, whic h in combination will be helpful for the botanical id entification and standardization of plant materials of A. sinensis . Chemical standardization: A critical step in the chemical and biological standardization of the extract s and products of plants is screening of proper biomarker compounds. In most previous works on the standardization of A. sinensis , Z-ligustilide ( 1) and ferulic acid ( 15) have been used as marker compounds. However, ferulic acid ( 15) is not properly qualified as being a marker compound, since it is ubiquitous in foods, herbs, and many other plants.109. Although Z-ligustilide ( 1) represents a major constituent of A. sinensis and exhibits many pharmacological activities in vitro and in vivo , it did not show serotonergic and GABAergic activities in our in vitro assays. In additi on, ligustilide ( 1) is very unstable an d readily isomerizes to other phthalide derivatives. In th is project, six new isolates were characterized, includ ing gelispirolide 9), and angeliferulate 151 (11), together with the compounds showing activity in the 5-HT 7, GABAa and anti-TB assays could be used as mu lti-component markers for chemical standardization of A. sinensis , and could, thus, be helpful for quality control of extracts and products of A. sinensis . Biological standardization: The percentage inhibition (%) and/or IC 50 (\u00b5g/mL) values of the methanol extract in in vitro 5-HT 7 and GABAa binding bioassays could be used as reference data for biological evaluation of A. sinensis samples in the future. 152 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 4.1. CONCLUSIONS A series of analytical techniques involving the examination of macroscopic, microscopic features, as well as HPTLC and HPLC fingerprint profiles were established and validated for botanical identification of Angelica sinensis . In the four different plant material s, sample 1 (BC 165) and sample 2 (BC 167) were verified as Angelica sinensis on the basis of their identical characteristics as those of the refere nce material, whereas samples 3 and 4 were demonstrated to be from a different species. 5-HT 7 receptor binding assay-directed fractionation of a methanol extract of Angelica sinensis led to the isolation of 23 compounds. By using spectroscopic approac hes such and 2D NMR, as well as X-ray experiments, th ese isolates were identified as Z-ligustilide ( 1), Z-butylidenephthalide one neolignan ( 11) and ( 5-9) (Figure 72-73). Compounds 12, 14, 20-23 were isolated for the first time from A. sinensis or natural products. 153 The major compounds, Z-ligustilide ( 1) and falcarindiol ( 19), are unstable at room temperature after being isolated from A. sinensis , suggesting proper storage conditio ns are necessary for A. sinensis , including being kept at low temperature, and away from air and light. O OO O OO OH OCH 3HOOCH 3 OH OCH 3O OOO OO O O 5 6 7 8OO O O 11 9bO OOOOOO O 9a All of the isolates ( 1-23) were evaluated for comp etitive binding activity in the 5-HT 7 receptor and inhibitory effects on [3H] LSD binding to the 5-HT 7 receptor with IC of 126.7 \u00b5M, and imperatorin ( inhibition of [3H] LSD binding to the 5-HT 7 receptor at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M, respectively. In the GABAa assay, ( 14) exhibited an inhibitory effect on the binding of [3H] 154 diazepam to the GABAa receptor with IC 50 values of 24 \u00b5M, 29 \u00b5M, and 21 \u00b5M, respectively. Angeliferulate ( 11) and 10-angeloylbutylphthalide ( 6) also showed moderate or weak activity in the GABAa receptor bindin g assay with an IC 50 of 66 \u00b5M, and 208 \u00b5M, respectively. In addition, in an in vitro anti-TB assay, falcarindiol ( 19), 9Z,17-octadecadiene-12,14-diyne-1,11,16-triol,1-acetate ( 20) exhibited potent activities with MIC values of 6.0 \u00b5g/ml and 1.4 \u00b5g/ml vs Erdman strain, 26.7 \u00b5g/ml and 25.3 \u00b5g/ml vs H37R v strain, respectively. Six new compounds ( 5-9, 11), as well as six known compounds ( 12, 14, 20-23) isolated for the first time from A. sinensis or natural plants, have potential to serve as chemical marker compounds for the standardization of A. sinensis , and for photochemically monitoring the extract and its products of A. sinensis . The active compounds ( 2, 4-5, 10-11, 14, 19-20 and 23) contribute to the serotonergic and GABAergic effects of A. sinensis extracts, and can be used as markers for standardization of A. sinensis as well. Finally, establishment of fingerprint profiles of multi-components including both new compounds and serotonergic ally and GABAergic acti ve compounds will be helpful for quality control of cr ude extracts and products of A. sinensis . The fully interpreted and assigned NMR spectral data included in this dissertation provide refere nce spectra for the derep lication and identification of compounds in the same classes of structures, especially phthalides and polyynes, either from A. sinensis or other species. 155 4.2. FUTURE DIRECTIONS 4.2.1. Stability testing of major components and active isolates Two of the major components of A. sinensis , namely Z-ligustilide ( 1) and falcarindiol ( 19) are unstable after they are isolat ed from the natural plants in our experiments. Therefore, it will be helpful to study their stability and determine the kinetics an d conditions of their reactive products. Such experiments could be performed using (q )NMR technique, and samples kept at room temperature could be analyzed both in solution and dry state. 4.2.2. LC-MS fingerprint identification of constituents in the methanol extract So far, only the HPLC chemical fi ngerprint profile of the methanol extract has been established, which wi ll be helpful for qu ality control and standardization of A. sinensis extracts and products. For advanced fingerprint, which would al low the MS dereplication of single constituent, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the chemical constituents in the methanol extract could be conducted by LC-MS or LC-MS-MS using the pure isolated compounds as chemical standard s. The analysis could focus not only on the active components, but also on the major and characteristic constituents. 4.2.3. Fractionation of bioactive components from other active fractions In addition to the fractions analyzed in this project, fractions F4 (55.6 g), F6 (6.7 g) and F11 (20 g) exhibite d markedly inhibition in the 5-HT 7 receptor binding assay at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (100 %, 66 %, 68 %, respectively). In the future, fracti onation and isolation of bioactive constituents from these fractions could be undertaken and guided not only by 156 the 5-HT 7 assay, but also the 5-HT5a assay, since the crude extract turned out to be even more active in the latter test system. 4.2.4. Biological evaluation of the methanol extract in other in vitro assays Angelica sinensis has many pharmacologica l activities. In TCM, A. sinensis is most frequently used for gyn ecological disorders such as blood deficiency (a syndrome close to anemia) and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). In some biological studies, polysaccharides in A. sinensis were reported to stimulate hematopoiesis, and phthalides were reported to have antispasmodic activity. Since constituents of A. sinensis might have other pharmacologic activities, additional bioass ays, such as opioid assays, could be used to characterize active principles in A. sinensis for anemia and dysmenorrhea, since pain is on e of the symptoms in PMS. 4.2.5. The biological mechanism of the active isolates The ligands for 5-HT 7 and GABAa receptors iden tified in this project could be subjected to further biological study to determine their specific/non- specific binding, and agonis t/antagonist activities. 4.2.6. Toxicity Toxicity of the methanol crude extract and pure compounds (major compounds such as Z-ligustilide, falcarindiol, and active compounds listed in section 3.6) could be evaluated in vitro and/or in vivo in order to understand their safety. 157 LITERATURE CITED (1) Stearns, S.
