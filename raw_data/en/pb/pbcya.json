Pneumococcus is spread by airborne droplets and is a leading cause of serious illness, including bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia among children and adults worldwide(2,3). Approximately, 1 million children under 5 years of age die of pneumococcal disease annually (3). In 2005, WHO estimated that 1.6 million people die of pneumococcal disease every year; this estimate includes the deaths of 0.7-1 million children 3 aged <5 years, most of whom live in developing countries.

Active Bacterial Core Surveillance/EIP Network Study in India In India, the Invasive Bacterial Infection Surveillance (IBIS) network and South Asian Pneumococcal Alliance (SAPNA) have been involved in collection of important data regarding serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance of pneumococcal infections for more than 12 years. The program has been funded by INCLEN with financial assistance from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Pneumococcal vaccines Accelerated Developmental and Introduction Plan (Pneumo ADIP) of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI).

Diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumococci colonise the nasopharynx, evade host immunity and spread to the middle ear, sinus, lower respiratory tract, blood and meninges. Pneumococci cause otitis media in the middle ear, sinusitis in the sinus, pneumonia in the lower respiratory tract, bacteraemia in blood and meningitis in the meninges. The incidences of different types of pneumococcal infection are inversely related to the severity of disease: otitis media is the most common but the least severe.

Dis. 4, 144-154 Pneumococcal disease Pneumococcal disease is the term used to describe infections caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (also called Pneumococcus). S. pneumoniae is an encapsulated gram-positive coccus. The capsule is the most important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae; pneumococci that lack the capsule are normally not virulent. Over 90 different capsular types have been characterized. About 66% of the serious infections in adults and about 80% of invasive infections in children are caused by eight to ten capsular types (Health Protection Agency, 2003). Characteristics of S.pneumoniae S. pneumoniae has typical characteristics: 1. It has specific polysaccharide capsule which is demonstrated by quellung reaction. Capsular polysaccharides are the primary basis for basis 2. Bile solubility. 3. Optochin sensitivity. 4. Ferments inulin which is the differentiating feature from other streptococci. 5. Lancet-shaped, Gram positive diplococci, alpha-hemolytic 6.Catalase(-) : requires source of catalase to grow on agar plates e.g. blood, generate H2O2 Typing of pneumococcus Pneumococci are classified into types based on the antigenic nature of the capsular polysaccharide. Pneumococci isolated from lobar pneumonia were originally classified into three types I, II and III, and a heterogeneous group IV. Members of group IV were later classified into types, and now more than 90 different serotypes are recognized, named 1, 2, 3, and so on. Typing of pneumococcus Typing may be carried out by (1)Agglutination of the cocci with the type specific antiserum by Coagglutination (Co-A); test (2) Precipitation of the SSS with the specific serum by counter current immunoelectrophoresis(CIEP); or (3) By the capsule swelling reaction described by Neufeld (1902). More than 90 capsule types and serotypes are known in S. pneumoniae (Hausdorff et al., 2002). Out of which 23 serotypes cause human infection. Type-specific Ab to capsular polysaccharide is protective. These Abs & complement interact to opsonize pneumococci. Antibodies to some pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides may cross-react with related types Hausdorff, W. P., Bryant, J., Paradiso, P. R. & Siber, G. R. (2000).

MENINGITIS 13-19% of all up to among elderly Neurologic sequelae common among survivors 4. OTITIS MEDIA 28-55% of middle ear aspirates Childhood pneumonia is most commonly caused by serotypes 6, 14, 18,19,23. Pneumonia in adults is caused by serotypes 1,3,4,7,8 & 12. Growing resistance of S. pneumoniae to used antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) underlines the urgent need for vaccines to be used to control pneumococcal disease Policy decisions for use of pneumococcal vaccines The policy decisions for use of pneumococcal vaccines should be based on following key factors: (i) incidence of the pneumococcal disease in the country (ii) distribution of its serotypes in the country and (iii) the anti-microbial resistance pattern of the invasive isolates in that country Pneumococcal vaccine There are two types of pneumococcal vaccine: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) vaccine (PCV) common capsular types. These are conjugated to protein (CRM197) using similar manufacturing technology to that for Haemophilus meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. influenzae type b (Hib) and History of pneumococcal vaccine PNEUMOCOCCUS - First identified in 1881 by Pasteur & Sternberg (10). The first preventive strategy was introduced by Sir Almroth E. Wright in 1911, who suggested that inoculation of killed, whole pneumococci might induce a protective effect against pneumococcal infections (11). In 1926, Felton and Bailey (12) for the first time isolated pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides which directly led to the first capsular PS vaccine. Its effectiveness was proved by successfully aborting an outbreak of pneumonia at a state hospital in Worcester, MA in 1931 (13). (10)Austrian R.

History of pneumococcal vaccine Emergence of multidrug-resistant (resistant to penicillin & cephalosporins) clones with serotypes 6B, 9V, 14, 19A, 19F and 23F (14) have lead to renewed interest in vaccine strategies, resulting in the production of a 14-valent pneumococcal PS vaccine by Robert Austrian and coworkers in 1977 (15). This vaccine was expanded in 1983 to a 23-valent vaccine and had a theoretical coverage of 80% of the pneumococci causing infections in adults. This vaccine was less immunogenic in small children and immunocompromised patients (16). (14) Kroon FP, van Dissel JT, de Jong JC, Zwinderman K, van Furth R.

The IAP COI recommends offering both PCV and PPSV 23 to all high-risk children. The PCV vaccines provide robust immune response and immune memory while PPV 23 provides expanded serotype coverage. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV 23) 23-valent adult vaccine covered more than 80% of the serotypes identified in Indian adults. Protection offered in different age groups was 77% in 22-50 years,87% in 51-64 years & 86% in > 64 years age group. Problems with polysaccharide vaccine in children Not effective in children less than 2 years ( because of less mature immune system) No effect on nasal carriage No herd effect Absence of immunologic memory Antibody level to several serotypes decline to pre-vaccination values within 3-7 years corresponding to a decline of clinical protection (Immunization is not lifelong, so individuals must be re-vaccinated every 5-6 years (21).

Limitations of PPSV23 vaccine Antibody titers and efficacy appear to wane after 5 years (Shapiro, et al, NEJM, 1991) Effectiveness is very low in immunocompromised patients PPSV23 induces hyporesponsiveness to either another dose of Vaccine, 2003) PPSV23(Torling, et al or to a dose of conjugate (deRoux, et al IDSA, 2005). Re-vaccinations cause more severe adverse events (Jackson, et al JAMA, 1999, Vaccine, 2005) Therefore, PPSV23 is generally given only once, which provides only a narrow window of protection during a prolonged period of risk 1997) (ACIP recommendation: MMWR, IMMUNOGENICITY & VACCINE EFFICACY OF PPSV - >80% healthy adults develop Abs vs. vaccine-related serotypes - Within 2-3 weeks after vaccination - Poor Ab response in elderly, with chronic illness & <2yrs. - Elevated Ab levels persist for at least 5 yrs in healthy adults & decline more quickly in persons with chronic disease. Antibody levels are likely to decline rapidly in individuals with no spleen,splenic dysfunction or chronic renal disease (Giebink et al., 1981; Rytel et al., 1986) and therefore re-immunisation with 23-valent PPV is recommended every five years in these groups. Revaccination is well tolerated (Jackson et al.,1999). - 60-70% effective in preventing invasive disease. - No protection against pneumococcal pneumonia. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Conjugated vaccine: consists of capsular polysaccharides covalently bound to a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin and the protein CRM197 or protein D of noncapsulated Hib or DT and TT and finally Men OMP which is highly immunogenic but non-toxic (23). This combination provokes a significantly more robust immune response by recruiting CRM197-specific type 2 helper T cells, which allow for immunoglobulin type switching (to produce non-IgM immunoglobulin) and production of B (September 2008). \"Pneumococcal vaccines: mechanism of action, impact on epidemiology and adaption of the species\". Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents 32 (3): 199-206. Contd Conjugate vaccine results in mucosal immunity and eventual establishment of lifelong immunity after several exposures(23). Conjugate vaccine does not induce hypo responsiveness to subsequent PPSV23 or a 2nd dose 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (USA), and the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products (Europe) for the prevention of invasive diseases in children. These vaccines have a potential coverage of over 85% of the pneumococcal isolates for the USA, 60-70% for Europe and around 55% for Asia. PCV7 PCV7 was licensed in the USA in 2000, in Europe in 2001 & India August 2006. Remarkable results in USA & UK. A limited increase in IPD caused by non-PCV7 serotypes, particularly 19A serotype has been registered to date However it covered only 55% of the serotypes prevalent in India. Dose is 0.5 ml IM. PCV7 PCV7 was initially categorized in cat-3 meaning to be given after one to one discussion with parents in healthy children aged less than 2 years. It induces a T-cell dependent immune response characterized by immune memory as well as a booster antibody response on subsequent challenge with the pneumococcal polysaccharides included in the vaccine Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar13\u00aePCV13) In February 24th, 2010, a new 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in children. PCV13 contains the serotypes found in PCV7, plus an additional six serotypes: 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A individually conjugated to a nontoxic diphtheria cross-reactive material (CRM) carrier protein (CRM197) (25). PCV13 succeeds the 7-valent vaccine (PCV7) used in the routine childhood immunization schedule since 2000. Presently Indian Market has two options from Wyeth-Pfizer-- All children 2-23 months - Children >2-59months with cochlear implants - Children 24-59months with Sickle Cell disease, Asplenia, HIV, immunocompromising/chronic illnesses (26) CDC.

Side effects: mainly local According to most recent estimates, PCV-13 covers around 73% of the prevalent serotypes in India. Present IAPCOI recommendation do not have similar categorization for this as there was for PCV - 7. Cost benefit ratio can be discussed with parents and let them take decision on named child basis. Prevenar\u00aePCV13 as per ACIP Un-vaccinated infants and children: PCV13 is recommended for all children aged 2 through 59 months \"3 plus 1\" dosing schedule, with doses at 2, 4, and 6 months and a booster dose at 12 to 15 months. Children incompletely vaccinated with PCV7: Children aged 24 to 59 months who received 1 or more doses of PCV7 should complete their vaccine series with PCV13. Children completely vaccinated with PCV7: Children aged 14 to 59 months who have received all 4 doses of PCV7 should receive a single supplemental dose of PCV13. {Age may be extended to 71 months for high-risk children (e.g., sickle cell disease, HIV infection or other immunocompromising conditions, cochlear implant, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks}. Prevenar\u00aePCV13 as per ACIP High-risk children aged 6 years and older: This permissive recommendation for an off-label use states: \"[v]accination with a single dose of PCV13 may be appropriate for children 6 through 18 years of age who are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease\". Healthy older children should not receive the vaccine. Additional vaccine for children with underlying medical conditions: Children aged 2 years and older who are at increased risk for invasive pneumococcal disease should receive a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine after vaccination valent 23 valent Target population Healthy Children At risk population Minimum age of vaccination > 6 weeks > 2 years (High Risk) Immune response ---- at 6 weeks of age Strong ---- at 2 years of age, Absent to weak Moderate to Strong Duration of immunity Long term Short term Vaccine efficacy- children < 2 years Yes None Important reductions in nasopharyngeal carriage Yes No effect Indirect protection Reported Unlikely Important reductions in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant isolates Reported Not established (21) PCV for childhood immunization - WHO position paper Weekly Epidemiological Record. 2007, 12 (82): 93-104.
