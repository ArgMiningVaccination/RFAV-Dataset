STORY AT-A-GLANCE If you had COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 injection, you may have dangerous spike proteins circulating in your body Spike proteins can circulate in your body after infection or injection, causing damage to cells, tissues and organs The World Council for Health has released a spike protein detox guide, which provides straightforward steps you can take to potentially lessen the effects of toxic spike protein in your body Spike protein inhibitors and neutralizers include pine needles, ivermectin, neem, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione The top 10 spike protein detox essentials include vitamin D, vitamin C, nigella seed, quercetin, zinc, curcumin, milk thistle extract, NAC, ivermectin and magnesium Have you had COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 injecti on? Then you likely have dangerous spike proteins circulating in your body. While spike protein is naturally found in SARS-CoV-2, no matter the variant, it's also produced in your body when you receive a COVID-19 shot. In its native form in SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein is responsible for the pathologies of the viral infection. In its wild form it's known to open the blood-brain barrier, cause cell damage (cytotoxicity) and, as Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology, said in a commentary on News Voice, \"is active in manipulating the biology of the cells that coat the inside of your blood vessels\u2014vascular endothelial cells, in part through its interaction with ACE2, which controls contraction in the blood vessels, blood pressure, and other things.\" It's also been revealed that the spike protein on its own is enough to cause inflammation and damage to the vascular system, even independent of a virus. Now, the World Council for Health (WCH), a worldwide coalition of health-focused organizations and civil society groups that seek to broaden public health knowledge, has released a spike protein detox guide, which provides straightforward steps you can take to potentially lessen the effects of toxic spike protein. You can view their full guide of natural remedies, including dosages, at the end of this article.How to Detox Spike Protein After COVID or Vaccine htt ps://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-detox-spike-protein-after-... 1 of 11 3/26/2022, 10:10 PMWhy Should You Consider a Spike Protein Detox? Spike proteins can circulate in your body after infection or injection, causing damage to cells, tissues and organs. \"Spike protein is a deadly protein,\" Dr. Peter McCullough, an internist, cardiologist and trained epidemiologist, says in a video. It may cause inflammation and clotting in any tissue in which it accumulates. For instance, Pfizer's biodistribution study, which was used to determine where the injected substances end up in the body, showed the COVID spike protein from the shots accumulated in \"quite high concentrations\" in the ovaries. Further, a Japanese biodistribution study for Pfizer's jab found that vaccine particles move from the injection site to the blood, after which circulating spike proteins are free to travel throughout the body, including to the ovaries, liver, neurological tissues and other organs. WCH noted: \"The virus spike protein has been linked to adverse effects, such as: blood clots, brain fog, organizing pneumonia, and myocarditis. It is probably responsible for many of the Covid-19 [injection] side effects ... Even if you have not had any symptoms, tested positive for Covid-19, or experienced adverse side effects after a jab, there may still be lingering spike proteins inside your body. In order to clear these after the jab or an infection, doctors and holistic practitioners are suggesting a few simple actions. It is thought that cleansing the body of spike protein ... as soon as possible after an infection or jab may protect against damage from remaining or circulating spike proteins.\" Spike Protein Inhibitors and Neutralizers A group of international doctors and holistic practitioners who have experience helping people recover from COVID-19 and post-injection illness compiled natural options for helping to reduce your body's spike protein load. The following are spike protein inhibitors, which means they inhibit the binding of the spike protein to human cells: Prunella Dandelion for example, docks to the SARS-CoV-2 spi ke receptor-binding domain attached to ACE2, which may interfere with its ability to attach to the human cell membrane. They also compiled a list of spike protein neutralizers, which render it unable to cause further damage to cells. This includes: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) Glutathione Fennel tea Star anise teaHow to Detox Spike Protein After COVID or Vaccine https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-detox-spike-protein-after-... 2 of 11 3/26/2022, 10:10 PMPine needle tea St. John's wort Comfrey leaf Vitamin C The plant compounds in the table above contain shiki mic acid, which may counteract blood clot formation and reduce some of the spike protein's toxic effects. Nattokinase, a form of fermented soy, may also help to reduce the occurrence of blood clots. How to Protect Your ACE2 Receptors and Detox IL-6 protein impairing the receptors' normal functioning. This blockage may alter tissue functioning and could be responsible for triggering autoimmune disease or causing abnormal bleeding or clotting, including vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine (with zinc), quercetin (with zinc) and fisetin (a flavonoid) are examples of substances that may naturally protect your ACE2 receptors. Ivermectin works in this regard by binding to ACE2 receptors, preventing the spike protein from doing so. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is expressed post-injection and levels increase in those with COVID-19. It's for this reason that the World Health Organization recommends IL-6 inhibitors for people who are severely ill with COVID-19. Many natural IL-6 inhibitors, or anti-inflammatories, exist and may be useful for those seeking to detox from COVID-19 or COVID-19 injections: Boswellia serrata extract Luteolin Vitamin D3 (with vitamin K) Zinc Magnesium Jasmine tea Spices Bay leaves Black pepperHow to Detox Spike Protein After COVID or Vaccine https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-detox-spike-protein-after-... 3 of 11 3/26/2022, 10:10 PMNutmeg Sage How to Detox From Furin and Serine Protease To gain entry into your cells, SARS-CoV-2 must first bind to an ACE2 or CD147 receptor on the cell. Next, the spike protein subunit must be proteolytically cleaved (cut). Without this protein cleavage, the virus would simply attach to the receptor and not get any further. \"The furin site is why the virus is so transmissible, and why it invades the heart, the brain and the blood vessels,\" Dr. Steven Quay, a physician and scientist, explained at a GOP House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Select Coronavirus Crisis hearing. The existence of a novel furin cleavage site on SARS-CoV-2, while other coronaviruses do not contain a single example of a furin cleavage site, is a significant reason why many believe SARS-CoV-2 was created through gain- of-function (GOF) research in a laboratory. Natural furin inhibitors, which prevent cleavage of the spike protein, can proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, enabling host cell fusion of the virus.\" Inhibiting serine protease may therefore prevent spike protein activation and viral entry into cells. WCH compiled several natural serine protease inhibitors, which include: Green tea Potato tubers Blue green algae Soybeans N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) Boswellia Time-Restricted Eating and Healthy Diet for All In addition to the targeted substances mentioned abo ve, WCH was wise to note that a healthy diet is the first step to a healthy immune system. Reducing your consumption of processed foods and other proinflammatory foods, including vegetable (seed) oils, is essential for an optimal immune response. Time-restricted eating, which means condensing your meals into a six- to eight-hour window, is also beneficial. This will improve your health in a variety of ways, primarily by improving your mitochondrial health and metabolic flexibility. It can also increase autophagy, which helps your body clear out damaged cells. As noted by WCH: \"This method ... is used to induce autophagy, which is essentially a recycling process that takes place in humanHow to Detox Spike Protein After COVID or Vaccine htt ps://www.organicconsumers.org/news/how-detox-spike-protein-after-... 4 of 11 3/26/2022, 10:10 PMcells, where cells degrade and recycle components. Autophagy is used by the body to eliminate damaged cell proteins and can destroy harmful viruses and bacteria post-infection.\" Another strategy to boost your health and longevity, and possibly to help detox spike protein, is regular sauna usage. As your body is subjected to reasonable amounts of heat stress, it gradually becomes acclimated to the heat, prompting a number of beneficial changes to occur in your body. These adaptations include increased plasma volume and blood flow to your heart and muscles (which increase athletic endurance) along with increased muscle mass due to greater levels of heat-shock proteins and growth hormone. It's a powerful detoxification method due to the sweating it promotes.
