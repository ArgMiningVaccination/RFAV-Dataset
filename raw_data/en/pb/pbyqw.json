Reprint. 20,000 first printing. Donna Eden, a pioneer in the field of holistic healing, is among the world's most sought after, most joyous, and most authoritative spokespersons for energy medicine. Her abilities as a healer are legendary and her invigorating presentations are rich with audience participation and stunning demonstrations. Since childhood, Eden has been able to see the flow of the body's energies, and from this clairvoyant ability, she developed a system for teaching others to productively work with their own body's energies. Eden has taught some 50,000 people worldwide how to methodically and precisely direct energy for health and happiness, using methods akin to acupressure, therapeutic touch, and qigong. Eden is author (with her husband, David Feinstein) of the best-selling book, Energy Medicine, which has been translated into 12 languages, and is a classic in its field. According to Carolyn Myss, \"The contribution Donna Eden has made with Energy Medicine will stand as one of the backbone studies as we lay a sound foundation for the field of holistic medicine.\" We are not hardware. Our tissue needs electromagnetic energy fields, oxygen, blood, water, lymph, and cerebrospinalfluid. When I heard of \"energy healing\", I imagined requiring meditative states for results that would be invisible. I did not know civilizations mapped \"meridian centres\" and acupressure points thousands of years ago. \"Meridian lines\" support organ groups. Some people see energy running, which made schematics possible. The new consideration for me is that except for a physical injury, unwellness comes from congested energy or fluid inside. Donna Eden, who sees energy, provides the mapped coordinates. There is no need to \"clear our minds\". The steps of energy medicine are as straightforward as flicking a light switch. Today's dedicated, caring doctors are only taught to prescribe nutrition, exercise, surgery, or drugs for ailments that have already occurred. If those do not help, which is unlikely when internal flows need adjusting, illnesses are called \"incurable\". Why live with a pail under a dripping ceiling, when we can locate and fix a leaking shingle? I feel hopeful, knowing that allopathically easing symptoms is not the last word on vitality! I was stunned by a reversed view of health. Ancient Chinese doctors routinely conducted maintenance on energy. If patients got sick, they owed no money because the doctors had failed their job! Allopathic doctors must treat pain or illness that has gotten serious but isn't it heartening to know there is more we can do? \"Energy Medicine: How To Use Your Body's Energies For Optimum Health And Vitality\" shows us how! It weaves together and actually explains everything we have heard about health, including: \"Laughter is the best medicine\"! Start reading and see the logic. You will be engrossed from cover to cover. For those of us who do not see energy, every variety of steps is testable! I really wanted to like this book, but it was too far out there to be valuable to me. I have a hard time believing that you can cleanse your aura by bathing with a box of baking soda. I also have a hard time swallowing that an exorcised spirit destroyed a computer file on its way out through the attic. Throughout the book, Eden's anecdotal stories were all too pat to feel real. Given that I believe the foods we eat have a primary influence on health and well-being, I had a particularly hard time with Eden's repeated statement that fruits and vegetables make her gain weight and exacerbate her hypoglycemia. Surely, if energy is paramount, the energy of the foods we eat has a more significant effect than tapping on certain areas of the body. I don't know what Eden's diet consists of--although she mentioned protein on several occasions, along with drinking raw milk. If she relies heavily on animal food--which, it would seem, she must--then she is subsisting on \"energy\" that isn't on the vibration that I personally ascribe to. While I believe in the premise that energy is an important part of healing and well-being, and can be used and considered in ways that many of us are unaware of, this book wasn't for me. Taking into account that some of Donna Eden's energy school curriculum was/is 2to 4 years, this contains A LOT of information. For that reason, I would recommend to buy not borrow a copy. (For those interested in the concepts of energy, auras, chakras, meridians...) \"Energy is all there is....\" Donna Eden, a clairvoyant from early childhood, shares from her life as a healer and how her personal battles with illness (like most healers) paved her way. I am currently reading her Energy Medicine for Women which is a vital continuation of these concepts. Opens your mind to the greater possibilities. This book has meant a lot to me. I spent 15 years working with these techniques before going to acupuncture school. Donna Eden is a natural healer who has the gift of seeing the bodies energies since birth. She had MS and was told she was going to die and went exploring ways to heal herself and found many cultures and ways of healing including Touch for Health which was the foundation, in some ways, of this book. She has been free of MS for over 30 years now. This book gives grounded techniques for self healing. She has the basic daily energy routine which can do so much for self healing. She gives an overview of the bodies 9 energy systems she sees including: Meridians, chakras, aura, 5 elements, electrics, basic grid, celtic weave, triple warmer and another my brain lost. She gives plenty of life stories of how she found these, uses them and amazing stories where people healed. Her core belief is that her work is here to each person can be there own healer. It's beneficial to work with someone, but you can do something daily to help yourself. Her catch phrase is \"Energy is all there is\" There is a book on Women's energy medicine that is also amazing. I do not really feel qualified to review this one. (That's why there are no stars... it doesn't mean I hated it.) After a friend pressed me for more information: I dunno. Suppose someone wrote a book about ghosts, and this person had seen ghosts all of her life and was quite good friends with a lot of them. She's eventually come to realize that not everybody can see the ghosts and that lots of people don't believe in ghosts, but she's also figured out how to get the ghosts to help people even if they can't see that it's ghosts helping. So she writes a book about how to contact the ghosts and get them to help you. Now suppose you don't really believe in ghosts, even though you like the idea of ghosts, and maybe you do some of the ghost befriending exercises and find that you ARE feeling a little better, maybe. The lady in the book is rapturous about how great ghosts are and the level of her fervor is maybe a little off-putting, but her methods seem to work for a lot of people and her anecdotal evidence is interesting (even if her scientific evidence seems a little suspect). But what it comes down to, in the end, is you can't see the ghosts. You do some of the things and you feel a little better but you don't know if it's really ghosts or not and, not having the ability to see the invisible, and not having met the fervent lady, maybe it's best to withhold judgment for a while. This was recommend to me by my friend Carolyn, and proved to be just as interesting as she had said. More recently I have become interested in various approaches to medicine or health. I am very grateful for a number of pharmaceutical medications, ranging from IV antibiotics to treat various infections, insulin for diabetes and several other longterm medications which I don't want to name online, due to not wanting to overshare personal information online. This also applies to various surgeries. They have been and are very helpful, and I am in no way against receiving drugs or hospital based treatment that work, relieve pain, or save lives. But I also think many of us will be familiar with being prescribed something that causes a problem that requires another prescription to fix that problem, which causes another problem and then another. For some people this may still work for them, as medical treatment can be complicated. In the last few years I have met people who take an approach I myself feel drawn to, which is a sort of combination approach of holistic/traditional, as well as modern, sometimes very recently developed options. Medications are used, or cancer treatments or surgery, whatever it might be, but other aspects are included too, acupuncture or massage. I find it all fascinating, and I think anything that helps, especially when we are talking about particularly serious health issues, should be considered. This book covered a lot and took me about three months to read. Despite this slow pace, I didn't struggle through it or find it a slog. Actually it was very interesting. Some of it chimed with things I had already heard from people or read about elsewhere, some was new. I liked getting an overview of Chakras, as so many things I've read seem to assume the reader already knows that. In a long-term sense I can't give an experience yet, although there is plenty I am willing to try, and will perhaps update later if I remember. But short term I have had once very welcome improvement with sleep. Sleep is something I have struggled with for most of my life, even when very young I had a difficult time stopping myself getting into that spin of frantic thoughts that keep you awake, despite being exhausted. For a couple of years I have often listened to ASMR or singing bowls online, and they have helped with some of that, but I still found it hard to actually fall asleep.* I tried the exercises in this video, and fell asleep in less than 30 minutes. Which compared to my usual 3+ hours was practically immediate results! I have tried those guided things where they get you to relax each part of your body, and sleep meditation videos and they only ever make me impatient, sometimes drowsy but never actually nudge me into sleep. But this has worked. While I wasn't actually interested in this for sleep techniques, I have been grateful that this has proved helpful. Waking up is easier too, because I've actually had a decent rest. https://youtu.be/_uIJfGdaPGg There is a daily routine, probably the base that you are supposed to build upon, and I do find this energising. I haven't yet incorporated some other aspects, though I will do. I will admit to occasionally losing track of various acupressure points, though I'm sure sure eventually that will stick. I have found videos easier to follow than the diagrams in the book. This is not because the book is poorly presented but just because I appreciate having every second of the routine guided! As I said, I will probably update this when I have more details of progress to add, although this is tricky to do without sharing certain things that I don't really want on the Internet. Medical privacy and all that. However my energy levels (not a deliberate pun!) have definitely improved, and I am interested in seeing what other exercises might fit in well with my requirements. I think I will probably reread the later sections again once I have figured out what seems most beneficial, but for now what I have learned has given me a lot to start with. An empowering book to help you take more control of yourself and your health Bottom Line: Buy it This book is FANTASTIC. Why? Well, because it is written for those who want to take their health into a more alternative direction, but are at a loss maybe what to do. In a word, self empowerment. It explains kinesiology, and how you can muscle test with a partner to uncover what's going on in your body (and you don't need to go to medical school). Plus, it's loaded with energy exercises you can do. From working with magnets, to the chakras, to clearing out each organ's neurolymphatics, clearing and tracing the meridians, to spiritual exercises when you need help realigning your energy, to a dental chart and what tooth corresponds to what organ, and the list goes on. This has more exercises littered through the pages than any other book I've ever come across. I reference this book a lot, and highly recommend it. I also recommend other books, including \"Touch for Health\" by John Thie, \"The Healing Code\" by Loyd, \"The Emotion Code\" by Bradley Nelson. Happy healing! :) I only read part of this and thought it was very interesting. However, the more I study the Christian scriptures, the more convinced I am that this book is off a bit. My friend gave me this book. She is a yoga instructor, believes in the power of crystals and gemstones, is all about chakras, and now she has people come to her and she does energy healing. I did a quan.tm session with her. I could feel energy in the room and felt peaceful and tired afterwards, but yikes! Quantum physics and transcendental meditation, and auras, etc. Some people believe in this stuff plus Christianity at the same time. Well, if you believe in Christ as your Savior, why would you direct people towards these other ways to heal them instead of to him first? And why would you claim that you can heal people yourself using your mind and energy? I picked up this book hoping for simple advice on balancing energy along the chakras, instructions on how to self-administer acupressure along the meridians, and maybe a few yoga poses or massage techniques that help to soothe or awaken different areas of the body. And it has all of that, but I was disappointed to see a lot of nonsense about past lives, colorful auras, and pseudo-religious ideas attached to every aspect of health. Science and medicine have proven that there are energy centers throughout the body (that some people call chakras), and meridian lines that connect energy which are proven to be effective through acupuncture and acupressure. These are scientific facts. But there was a lot of other nonsense that made me question the veracity of the author. It sounds like she's using the truth of the body's energy and trying to attach it to her own false ideas and religious concepts. I did not enjoy reading her examples and accounts of clients who have been \"healed\" by her, because of the constant references to occult practices. Why can't authors just stick to the facts, instead of pushing their own political or religious agendas? Hm... That's a tough one to review. I suppose I'm not the ideal target group for such a reading, given my ingrained skepticism about anything that can't be scientifically examined and determined. On the other hand, the flow of energy within the human body is something quite logical and reasonable even for the non-believers. I'm still not convinced that the methods for replenishing the energies and fixing the problems in our bodies that the author describes are quite practical or realistic for a person who has never been able to get even the slightest hint of an aura and is absolutely out of touch with his or her spiritual self . But perhaps there's no harm in trying some of the less ridiculously sounding exercises she mentions (and no, self-testing will not be available for us, given that I cannot imagine how a person could be able to lift a weight while thinking happy thoughts, but not when thinking about an unpleasant subject). I cannot deny it, it still seems like a whole lot of mumbo-jumbo to me, but even the remote possibility that any of these insights might be helpful for us to obtain better knowledge of our bodies is worth trying. I'm reading this right now and watching the accompanying DVDs as I'm getting ready to teach a class. I have a first level certification as a Donna Eden Energy Healer, although it remains to be seen whether I will be able to afford to complete the training, which is horrifically expensive. Obviously, as I chose this out of all the various schools of energy medicine available, it knocks my socks off, and Donna, David, as well as Titanya and Dondi (daughters) are all such incredibly kind, generous and giving people, I feel honored to know them. Donna Eden explains the body`s energy system and how it works, which works effectively in a practical sense too. She describes all the exercises clearly in a step by step fashion. The reader can pick and choose what exercises are suitable for them, it is possible to table an individual plan to use. I have been using exercises to help heal my Hypersensitive Type 4 Reaction to Steroids and the same reaction to a Pneamonia vaccine. I have practiced these excersises twice a day for five months now and my health is improving a little so I think these exercises work, for definite in my case. The movements are gentle on the body and pleasant to carry out. What I really loved was the diagrams Donna used. She explained which energy points were worked on with each exercise and how she used these to explain all the various movements of each exercise lent a real educational source book feel to the book although very sensitively written by Donna. I highly recommend this book to any person interested in improving their health. I am Gabriel Woods author of The Golden Age Desolation This book had some interesting ideas, but it was too far out there for me to really enjoy. I'm currently taking an Energy Medicine class based on Donna Eden's techniques, and I do find that I feel better (more grounded, balanced, calm) after the class. But some of the stories from this book and the supporting explanations just seem too bizarre for me to wrap my head around. I'm going to continue doing some of the exercises (and I find her 10 minute daily exercise sequence very useful) but I think that's it for me. Has a lot of information, but will be hard for many people to relate to. One thing I can't get over is the author talking about how her amazing healing powers came through relocating to a tropical off-grid island and the \"blood of Cherokee ancestors\" running through her white veins. I get the point for anecdotes, but a lot of her physical advice is totally impossible unless you're wealthy - we can't all run off to Fiji. I took my Dad to a presentation with Donna and her husband, when she was on one of her early book tours. I bought her book. I read it. Although I never achieved any mastery, I did continue to incorporate a few moves into my weekly practice. Donna's welcoming approach flamed a fire I intuitively already tended, so that over the years I continue to seek out other forms of energy medicine to research and try-out. A few have become keepers. . I have used Donna Eden's 5 Minute Daily Energy Routine every day for about a year now and can't believe the positive effect on my immune system and energy level. Was glad to read this book and get more background on her healing techniques. Highly recommend Donna Eden! This is an incredibly enlightening book. I was introduced to Donna Eden's work through an online conference where she was a guest speaker. The phrase 'Energy Medicine' which was the title of her seminar, sounded strange, but when I listened to her I was instantly interested in knowing more about her work. I saw her videos online, visited her website and ordered her books. I've been amazed by the groundbreaking knowledge and healing practices shared by Donna Eden and her co-authors. My sister suffered from chronic health problems and had tired to taking course after course of antibiotics for apparently minor ailments like sore throat, nasal congestion, etc. She was always fatigued and gained weight due to hypothyroid. Simple exercises described in this book have helped her balance her bodies' energies. Her health has improved tremendously since. This book is refreshing also because it challenged many of my religious beliefs. I never believed there was any truth in the concept of past lives, but Donna Eden's experiences as a healer suggests otherwise. On the other hand, after reading this book I looked at Muslim rituals from a new perspective, which validated their efficacy as independent exercises. For instance, prostration on the ground is an exercise suggested by Donna Eden for activating all the radiant circuits. The daily Muslims prayers include 86 acts of prostration during the course of the day. It was an 'aha' moment. I've had this book since it came out, and it was really a forerunner of people trying to integrate other concepts of medicine into Western medicine. We're seeing a lot more people now give credence to things like acupuncture and Chinese meridians and even TCM herbs. The down side of this book is, like all of her works, honestly, it's MASSIVELY disorganized. If you're planning on using this as a reference book, you're going to need to buy tabs and mark them yourself, and get used to finding the explanation of how the technique works several pages away from the actual description of the technique itself. She would have been better off structuring it as more of a direct workbook, or at least a workbook of exercises appended to the prose. However, it's worth a read. She's changed the 5 minute energy routine a wee bit since then, but it's still a classic, easy to use. And it does make a difference you can feel. People might 'oh this is too woo woo for me' but...have they even tried it? There's nothing impossible here, unlike a yoga book that might have a posture beyond someone's physical capabilities. These are all things a normal person with normal mobility can do, and if so, why not try before you judge? Full of practical tips for alternative therapies. Covers meridians, touch-points, chakras, and energy paths. The stricture, however, is a bit choppy; referring the reader on page 21 to try the exercise on page 68. The author intended the reader the option to read straight-through or peruse random chapters. While a laudable goal, I find that as a front-over-to-back-cover person, the skipping around is disconcerting. I find that I need to add stickies to exercises and techniques for easier reference, but this is mild annoyance when weighed against the knowledge offered in this book. The information is presented clearly with many detailed charcoal illustrations which are quite useful. I've already put the exercises to use: most recently this week when my son tripped and torqued his pinkie toe. Within 45 seconds he went from bawling to asking in amazement \"Mommy, what did you just do?\" Chi, Little Grasshopper. I first met Donna Eden in 2009 after reading the 10th Anniversary Edition of her book. The one shown here looks like the first printing. Donna has been doing this healing work for about 3 decades now (2015). She has always been able to see energy. What makes her so wonderful is that she has taken what she knows and tied it in as it relates Traditional Chinese Medicine and Touch for Health techniques so that rest of us can learn how to work with energy to improve our health and the health of others. Yes, most of this stuff is available elsewhere but not combined in this way. I was personally affected by this as it helped me to recover from CFS. The only thing I did from the book is the Daily Energy Routine. I wanted to take it further since then, and recently finished the Foundations 1 training and plan to continue on to Foundations 2. In my massage practice, I have already been able to help people so much more than in the past 10 years I've been doing massage. This is an excellent source of knowledge and reference for all things energy in relation to mind/body/spirit. I read it once through, and fell strongly that this is something I want permanently on my shelf, so I can keep coming back to different parts of the it as needed. As it stands right now I once again come away with the need to incorporate some sort of energy routine into my daily life... but perhaps my inertia with this might have deeper, subtler, causes than just, say, laziness. I would love to have a session with Donna... chalk that one onto my wish list! :p I have been reading this book on and off for a few years now and finally committed to sitting down and finishing it. Over all it was not a book that truly moved me even though it had some good sections, especially The 5 Rhythms section and the one about the Chakra's. Perhaps it was the fact that I am in a different space then when I originally decided to read it? Book reviews no matter how many do not mean a thing considering we all are coming from a different place in life. Read it and see what you think.... This is a reread for me-- finding it so helpful and that I'm much more receptive to her message and instruction this time around. I have been implementing some of the suggested moves and they have been making a positive difference in how I feel. Am anxious to dive in further this summer when I have more time and explore the ideas in this book further. I highly recommend this to people curious to know more about how our physical bodies operate and how we can be healthier energy-wise. Became interested in this when my brother died from cancer and I saw other patients with the same cancer getting relief and longevity from using some of these techniques. Reads a bit like a text book, but I read every page. Don't believe in reincarnation or a few other interesting things in the book, but I've used many of the techniques with my kids - surprisingly they work. Six or Seven years ago my husband & I went to Omega institute in Rienbeck, NY. We attended a 2 day seminar by Donna Eden. It was very powerful & it was our introduction to Energy Medicine. I found it very helpful so I bought the book to help remember the info she gave us. She is a highly energetic, joyful & wonderful person. We are blessed to have her in our presence. "}
