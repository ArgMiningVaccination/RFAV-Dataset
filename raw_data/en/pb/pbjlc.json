These cell lines have been grown for many years and continue to exhibit neuronal characteristics. Some of these have been generated from neonatal and adult hipoocampus. In collaboration with researchers fm NIMHANS, Bangalore, we have transplanted these cells into the brains of ventral subicular-lesioned rats, which have specific spatial memory deficits and examined functional recovery. Our results indicate that the rats recover from their deficit substantially and the transplanted cells also migrate into specific areas of the lesioned brain. Further studies are underway to determine the mechanisms of recovery and cell migration.Collaborators: Bindu Kutty and T.R.

SANE sane@ncbs.res.in The spectacular evolutionary success of insects owes much to the evolution of flight. Insect flight is characterized by speed, control and manoeuvrability. Their wings flap at very rapid rates (typically on the order of 10-100 Hz) and hence their sensory system must acquire and process information at similar rates. How do the nervous systems of insects tackle the extraordinary challenges of acquiring, integrating and processing sensory information and generating rapid behavioral responses to ensure stable flight? A rigorous study of this question requires multi-disciplinary research in the areas of physics, biomechanics, neurobiology and behavior. Our work combines the input from these various sub-disciplines to address diverse flight-related phenomena. Sane, S. P . ( 2003). The aerodynamics of insect flight.

To address this question, we built a dynamically scaled robotic flapper (affectionately called Robofly) to study the basic fluid dynamical principles that make flapping flight of insects fundamentally distinct from fixed-wing flight of airplanes. From these studies, we were able to show that the high lift generated by flapping wings can be sustained over the entire duration of the wing stroke, unlike their fixed wing counterpart which tends to stall. This study resulted in a semi-empirical model that could predict the instantaneous forces generated by a flapping wing performing any arbitrary kinematic pattern. Currently, we are extending these techniques to study the effect of wing flexibility on aerodynamic force generation. With increase in size of the insect, their wings tend to show greater flexibility with direct consequences to their ability to generate aerodynamic forces. This study will also extend into the biomaterial aspects of wing flexibility to address how wing flexibility may influence longevity of the wing structure through the typical lifetime of an animal. In addition, we are also studying the gross flows around insect bodies during flight and trying to understand how these flows influence various aspects of insect physiology such as thermoregulation, odor detection etc. Apart from the obvious biological implications of these studies, these results will also help in development of optimally performing wings for micromechanical robotic insects. These aspects are being studied in close collaboration with roboticists and engineers, at the University of Delaware. 2 The neural basis of flight behavior On the neurobiological front, how do flying insects use various sensors distributed over their body to acquire information about their environment and how is this information used in stabilizing their flight? We have recently begun investigating this question with specific focus on the role of antennae in acquisition and processing of self-generated and externally-generated sensory cues that mediate flight control in hawk moths. Our behavioral studies revealed that antennae play a very crucial role in mediating flight control: insects lacking the distal segment of their antennae (i.e. flagella) are unable to fly in a coordinated manner. However, when the flagellar integrity is restored, their flight ability can be rescued. Our electrophysiological studies show that individual mechanosensory neurons at the base of the antennae are tuned to vibratory motion of the antennae and capable of transducing cues essential for flight control. Visualization of the underlying neural circuitry reveals that a bulk of the antennal mechanosensory information is relayed to an area of the brain called the AMMC (Antennal Motor and Mechanosensory Centre), before it is transmitted to the flight motor units. Thus, antennal mechanosensors are involved in mediating flight control in insects. Our studies will endeavour to throw light on the evolution of antennal diversity among insects in relation to their flight mechanics, as well as the specific roles of the antenna and the AMMC in flight control. Ongoing research from my laboratory also addresses flight under natural circumstances. We will study how the antennal mechanosensory modality combines with visual inputs to enable flight in moths and butterflies. We are keen to diversify this study into the area of flight energetics, thermoregulation and behavioral ecology of )NTRINSIC\u0000!NTENNAL\u0000-USCLES\u0000\"OHM\u00b4S\u0000\"RISTLES\u0000*OHNSTON\u00b4S\u0000/RGAN\u0000!NTENNAL\u0000.ERVE\u0000 !NTENNAL\u0000.ERVE\u0000Figure 2. SIDDIQI Olfactory behavior in Drosophila is partly inborn and partly acquired. Our group is studying ontogeny of olfactory behavior and odor learning ability in the fly. The report by Sarit Pati Goswami et al. shows that newly born larvae are attracted by low concentration of ethyl acetate within minutes of eclosion irrespective of the odor environment, but sensitivity to odorants increases with age. Aversion to high concentration takes several hours to develop. In the previous report, we had shown that the multiphasic learning retention curves, in the third instar larvae can be decomposed by a simple graphic procedure into three distinct phases; short term memory (STM), middle term memory (MTM) and long term memory (LTM). We now show that these phases correspond to exactly STM, MTM and LTM as revealed by study of learning mutants and effect of anesthetics and other memory ablating treatments. Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty et al. describe changes in the sensitivity of chemoreceptors that accompany imaginal conditioning. They find that odor imprinting increases the affinity of the chemoreceptor to several different ligands, all acting on the same receptor but as Jawaid Ahsan shows, there is no indication of transcriptional regulation. The first effect of odor imprinting is thus, an enhancement of peripheral sensitivity. Type III sensillae contain two receptors Or22a and Or85b. The A neuron projects to the glomerulus DM2. Recordings from the sensillum permit us to study the effect of conditioning on the olfactory pathway described in this report. Odorosiddiqi@ncbs.res.in Selected publications Chakraborty, T.S., Prabhakar, S., Kumar, S. and of imaginal conditioning in S.P ., and Siddiqi, O. (2007). Increased sensitivity of olfactory receptor neurons correlate to imaginal conditioning in Drosophila undergo distinctive changes after eclosion. When the flies are exposed to certain odorants, attraction towards these chemicals increase. This phenomenon called 'Imaginal conditioning' has been described in these reports. We are now studying the development of olfactory behavior in the larva. Larval response can be analyzed by tracking individual larvae in an odor gradient. Single larvae are placed at the centre of a petri dish and their movement towards an odor source is tracked videographically (Figure 1c). Analysis of these tracks provides information about several features of the response. Freshly eclosed larvae have an inborn attraction towards ethyl acetate (EA) (Figure 1a). Their movements are however, disoriented and wayward and sensitivity to the odorant is low. With age, the ability to orient towards the odor source improves and sensitivity increases (Figure 2a). Newly born larvae, cultured on cornmeal or a synthetic medium with or without EA, show the same attractive or aversive orientation to the odor source. 20 hour old larvae, exposed to 10 -4 dilution of EA however, tend to move away from concentrations of the odorant higher than 10-4 (Figure 2c). 2 Olfactory memory in the larvae of of aversive conditioning in Drosophila larvae. The learning retention curves obtained from repetitive electroshock training are polyphasic and can be analyzed by a simple graphic procedure, originally due to Scatchard, into three monophasic component each decaying exponentially at a fixed rate. The three component of memory curve, short term (STM), middle term (MTM) and long term (LTM) display distinct properties in kinetics of their formation and decline (Abu Baker et al, NCBS report 2005). One might ask whether the dissociation of polyphasic memory curve into distinct components STM, MTM and LTM is merely an algebraic manipulation or reveals something real about memory. We present evidence that STM, MTM and LTM obtained by our analysis correspond exactly to components of larval memory determined by independent experiments. OBAID SIDDIqIFigure 1. Movement of newly eclosed larvae towards 10-3 EA. Larva starts at S, the centre of the plate; E is the end of the track. The displacement vector SE represents individual responses. The odor source is placed along the x-axis. The average displacement 1/N (D x) towards the source is a measure of attraction. The divergence angle, , between the displacement vector and abscissa 1/N (), provides a measure of avoidance. (N=20) Figure 2. Development of attraction and aversion. Larvae were cultured on complete media (2a). Newly born larvae are less responsive to the odorant (EA) compared to 20 hr old larvae. Larvae are cultured on a synthetic medium (2b and 2c). Larvae conditioned with 10 -4 EA (CR) and unconditioned larvae (UCR) show attraction at birth (2b), but develop an avoidance response at concentrations higher than 10 -4 when 20 hr old (2c). dxE (degrees) Divergence (degrees)1.1 1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 -6 -5 -5020406080100 encodes pituitary adenylate cyclase is required for anesthesia sensitive intermediate term memory (Waddell et. al., 2000). The last mentioned mutant radish, is deficient in anesthesia resistant memory (Folkers et al., 1993). The analysis of learning retention curve in the four mutants shows the expected deficit in phases of memory revealed by Scatchard analysis (Figure 3). The advantage of this method of analysis lies in the fact that it allows us to follow the kinetics of memory formation and decay in the three phases separately. The memory curve can also be dissected by treatment with anesthetics or other agents, which block neural activity. Cooling eliminates anesthesia sensitive STM and MTM while depolarization with KCl blocks STM alone. Inhibitors of transcription and translation, novobiocin and cycloheximide respectively blocks LTM without affecting STM and MTM. Treatments with blockers in combination with Scatchard analysis provides us with a convenient method for a quantitative analysis of memory. These experiments also show that STM, MTM and LTM are not sequentially or serially related. 3 Effect of odor imprinting acetate (EA), Iso-amyl acetate (IAA) or Hexanol greatly increases attraction towards these chemicals. We have previously reported that attractive conditioning in the imago is accompanied with an increase in the amplitude of electroantennogram (EAG). We describe here, the effect of imaginal conditioning on responses of sensory neurons in sensilla basiconica. W.G. Thorpe (1937) first discovered that exposure of Drosophila larvae to Menthol alters the olfactory behavior of He named the phenomenon 'larval-imaginal' or 'pre-imaginal conditioning'. Subsequent investigators tended to interpret Thorpe's observation as habituation. Experiments in Figure 3.

It is unlikely to be simple habituation or desensitization. We examined the effect of odor conditioning on three selected Basiconic sensilla. The type I sensillum has four neurons A, B, C and D and the type II and III contain two neurons each. Action potentials from these neurons can be analyzed by extracellular recordings with capillary electrodes (Figure 4) and dose response curves in conditioned and unconditioned flies, can be compared. Figure 5 shows the responses of 4-day old flies grown under three different conditions; i) both larva and imago cultured on an odorless medium; ii) larva on cornmeal and imago on odor-free medium and iii) both stages on synthetic medium containing 10 -4 dilution of EA. Odor experience at both stages alters the response to five different acetate esters. The dose-response curves are shown in Figure 6. It may be seen that conditioning alters the Km of the response without affecting the maximal response. The underlying mechanism remains to be understood. 4 Effect of olfactory conditioning on transcription of odorant receptors Jawaid AhsanExposure to Ethyl acetate (EA) causes an increased attraction in conditioned flies to this odor and a correlated enhancement in the electrophysiological response of olfactory receptor neurons (See Rashid et al, NCBS Report 2005 and Chakraborty et al, this report). The adult flies (0 to 12 hours old) were conditioned by exposing them to 10 -4 Ethyl acetate in an odor free medium for four days in a 12/12 hours day night cycle. The flies were then tested for 10-5 Ethyl acetate in the T maze behavioral assay. The conditioned response was 0.80 and the unconditioned response 0.25 In order to see whether olfactory conditioning involves transcriptional regulation, I have carried out a quantitative Real Time RT-PCR analysis of two receptors Or83b, a non-canonical odorant receptor present in 70% of olfactory receptor neurons, synthetic and Or59b which responds to Ethyl acetate. The transcription levels of Or83b and Or59b were assessed by comparing them with a constitutive gene rpII140 (RNA polymerase II 140kD subunit) in conditioned and unconditioned flies. The results show that there is no significant increase in the transcript levels of either Or83b or Or59b due to conditioning by Ethyl acetate.

Effect of larval growth medium on the response of imago: (a) Both larvae and adult were cultured on odorless synthetic medium, (b) larvae were grown on cornmeal and adult were cultured on synthetic medium, (c) larvae and adult grown on synthetic medium containing 10 -4 EA. As can be seen, odor experience at both stages alters response towards odors. Test odors The flies were induced with EA at 10-4 for 3 days and tested with Ethyl Valerate (EV) and Iso amyl Valerate (IV). Conditioning reduces threshold and apparent Km for all chemicals.

He has been a regular visitor to NCBS, spending several weeks to months each year and bringing his students and postdocs with him. He interacts with the Mayor and Rao labs, amongst others. His recent collaborative work has been on the function of Myosin VI. This myosin has been studied in both a monomeric and a dimeric form in vitro. Since the functional characteristics of the motor are dramatically different for these two forms, it is important to understand whether myosin VI heavy chains are brought together on endocytic vesicles. The Mayor and Spudich groups have used fluorescence anisotropy measurements to detect fluorescence resonance energy transfer between identical fluorophores (homoFRET) resulting from myosin VI heavy chains being brought into close proximity. They observed that, when associated with clathrin-mediated endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are precisely positioned to bring their tail domains in close proximity. They show that on endocytic vesicles, myosin VI heavy chains are brought together in an orientation that previous in vitro studies have shown causes dimerization of the motor. Their results are therefore consistent with vesicle-associated myosin VI existing as a processive dimer, capable of its known trafficking function.

Council - in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. As a member of the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World (TWAS), and more recently as Adjunct Faculty, Prof. Barrantes has frequently visited NCBS and engaged in teaching in various local and international courses and conducted collaborative research with Prof. Satyajit Mayor and his group, also involving prolonged visits of his students to NCBS. The ongoing joint project involves the study of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor stability at the cell membrane and its internalization. This receptor is a key molecule involved in the propagation of signals in the central nervous system and peripheral synapses. It is involved in functions such as consciousness, attention, and memory; alteration of those functions gives rise to various invalidating pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, making this family of receptors very important drug targets. The collaborative research with Prof. Mayor has disclosed a hitherto unknown slow-down endocytic mechanism operative in the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor, distinct from the canonical caveolin- and clathrin-dependent pathways. A similar mechanism may be operative in the brain in the case of neuronal receptors, and constitute a modulatory process involved in synaptic plasticity. adjunct and visiting professorsNCBS is fortunate to have excellent interactions with colleagues whose primary appointment is at other institutions in India and abroad.
