All that is required is remembering to do the exercise! It's as simple as going over your day in reverse order, at the end of the day. It's a [Rudolf Steiner](http://www.rudolfsteinerweb.com) practice. I read it forever ago, and can't remember what he says about it. I don't even remember which book! I'm guessing either [Knowledge of the Higher Worlds](http://amzn.to/2m5VK2P) or [How to Know Higher Worlds](http://amzn.to/2m5NjEt). Maybe [Anthroposophy in Everyday Life](http://amzn.to/2m5Zotb), but I don't think so. This is something that I go through phases of doing. When I do do it, I wait until I'm in bed, relaxed. And then I run through my day, in reverse. I just visualize what I recall doing, but backwards, going for as much detail as I can. Sounds weird I know, but I find it's quite an eye-opening experience. I find that most of the time, I end up feeling much better about how my day went. You'll notice a lot more happened that day when you stop and really think! Usually connections and coincidences are picked up, that just slipped by the first time around. It gives a fresh appreciation for the day, and I find going to bed on that positive note is helpful for the next day as well. I think it's also good to get in the habit of recalling memories. So maybe you want to try it! At the end of the day, just relax and run through your mind, your day backwards. See what happens! Watching your own Instagram story backwards does not count. "}
