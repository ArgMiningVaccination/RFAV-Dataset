As consumers continue to be attracted to nutraceuticals, such as superfoods, vegetables, fruits, high-protein foods, eating healthy intertwines with finding the right balance. Nowadays, the nutraceutical industries are among the many that target to meet the growing and dynamic consumers' expectations. Adding to their increasing interest and general acceptability, consumers continue to be attracted to nutraceuticals. How nutraceuticals, especially functional foods, etc., help in tackling health challenges increase the interest among several researchers in this subject area, and given the ever-growing need across communities around the globe for healthy living, strengthens the need for continued synthesis of published information to supplement existing knowledge. This overview, therefore, discusses natural nutraceuticals, especially functional foods, their major bioactive components, formulation, health benefits for disease prevention. Current Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences 2020 Nutraceuticals are products used as medicines in addition to nutrition. Nutraceuticals can be defined as substances that have physiological benefits or provide protection against chronic disease. Nutraceuticals can be used to improve health, slow down the aging process, prevent chronic diseases, increase life expectancy or support body structure or function. Nutraceuticals are getting a lot of attention these days because of their potential nutritional, safety and therapeutic benefits. Recent studies have shown that these compounds have promising results in various complications. In this review, we have made a great effort in proposing new concepts for nutraceuticals based on disease indications. Highlights herbal remedies that are effective for harsh therapeutic conditions associated with oxidative stress, including allergies, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, eye, immunity, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease and obesity. These nutraceuticals... Research & Reviews: Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences 2016 Nutraceuticals have received considerable attention due to their speculative safety, potential nutritive and therapeutic effects. They are alternative to modern medicines and also provide healthy living. To avoid side effects associated with medicines, live longer expectancy and increase the health value of our diet, nutraceuticals are being preferred. They possess numerous therapeutic benefits like anti-obesity, immune enhancement, natural antioxidant, cardiovascular effects, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory effects, etc. Major constituents of nutraceuticals are nutrients, herbals and dietary supplements which help to maintain health, function against various diseases and ensure better quality of life. The aim of this article is to provide the current knowledge about the application of various nutraceuticals in different diseases. Food Research International 2002 International Journal for Research in Applied Science & Engineering Technology (IJRASET) 2023 Nutraceuticals are the pharmaceutically blended products that possess both nutritional as well as the medicinal value. Such aproduct is designed to improve the physicalhealth, fight against day-today challenges such as stress, increase longevity, etc. The food products used as nutraceuticals can be categorized as dietary fiber, prebiotics, probiotics, polyunsaturated Fatty acids, antioxidants and other different types of herbal natural foods. These nutraceuticals used in various diseases such as Obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis, diabetes, cholesterol etc.. In recent years there Is a growing interest in nutraceuticals which provide health benefits and are alternative to Modern medicine. By using nutraceuticals, it may be possible to reduce or eliminate the need for conventional medications, reducing the chances of any adverse effect. The Nutraceuticals are the best way to boost immunity. The nutraceuticals also plays an important role in economic growth of some developing countries including India. The term nutraceutical was originally defined by Dr. Stephen L. De Felice, founder and chairman of the Foundation of Innovation Medicine (FIM), Crawford, New Jersey. About 2000 years ago, Hippocrates correctly emphasized \" Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food\". Nutraceuticals are medicinal foods that play a role in maintaining well being, enhancing health, modulating immunity and thereby preventing as well as treating specific diseases. Thus the field of nutraceutical can be envisioned as one of the missing blocks in the health benefit of an individual. Probiotics are ingested for their purported positive advantages in the digestive tract and/or systemic area like the liver, brain, vagina or blood stream. Antioxidants are very essential in the treatment of almost all diseases because most chronic diseases carry with them a great pact of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is accelerated by the ageing process along with lack of dietary antioxidants. Flavonoids have anti-cancerous properties by acting as antioxidants. Phytochemicals have specific actions and can be used variously for e.g. as antioxidants and have a positive effect on health. Recently, much attention has been given to phytochemicals that possess cancer preventive properties. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to decrease the production of inflammatory eicosanoids, cytokines and reactive oxygen species, possess immunomodulatory effects and attenuate inflammatory diseases. With the evolution of \" Smart Nutraceuticals \" , a Futuristic \" Physician's Desk Reference \" would contain information on individual genetic profiles to be matched with specific nutritional interventions as well. This would be a vast improvement over current nutritional recommendations which being too generalized are reported to benefit only 60% of population. Pharmacological Research 2021 Journal of Basic and Clinical Pharmacy 2010 Using food products to promote health and cure disease is renowned. Currently, most of the drug molecules available in the formulations were anciently used in their crude form. Dr Stephen De Felice first coins the term nutraceutics in 1989 to provide medical or health benefits including the prevention and treatment of diseases. This review classified the large number of nutraceuticals available from various sources and its significance. Further, the regulatory status of nutraceuticals and latest trends in nutragenomics are discussed. Journal of Food Science and Technology-mysore Nutraceutical is the hybrid of 'nutrition' and 'pharmaceutical'. Nutraceuticals, in broad, are food or part of food playing a significant role in modifying and maintaining normal physiological function that maintains healthy human beings. The principal reasons for the growth of the nutraceutical market worldwide are the current population and the health trends. The food products used as nutraceuticals can be categorized as dietary fibre, prebiotics, probiotics, polyunsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants and other different types of herbal/ natural foods. These nutraceuticals help in combating some of the major health problems of the century such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis, diabetes, cholesterol etc. In whole, 'nutraceutical' has lead to the new era of medicine and health, in which the food industry has become a research oriented sector.
