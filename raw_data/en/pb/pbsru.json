Term Explanation Agency Environment Agency of England and Wales. Agri-environment scheme Land management schemes on farmland that are beneficial for example for the environment, natural resources, biodiversity, landscape. Alien species Non-native species. Many species of plants and animals have been introduced to this country since Roman times. Several of these non- native species are invasive and have been causing serious problems to the aquatic and riverine ecology and environment. Problems include detrimental effects on our native species, deoxygenation of water causing fish mortalities, blocking of rivers and drainage channels, predation and competition with our native species, and in some cases pose health risks to the public or livestock. Alternative objectives In certain circumstances (set out in Article 4.4 and 4.5 of the Water Framework Directive) Member States may deviate from achieving the default objectives (e.g. good status by 2015). Objectives which are different from the default objectives are referred to in this river basin management plan as alternative objectives. The types of alternative objective are: - an extended deadline, e.g. achieving good ecological status by 2027; - a less stringent objective, e.g. achieving moderate ecological status by 2015; - different objectives for heavily modified or artificial water bodies, e.g. good ecological potential. Angiosperms The flowering plants. In transitional and coastal waters they include sea grasses and the flowering plants found in salt marshes. Aquifer A subsurface layer or layers of rock or other geological strata of sufficient porosity and permeability to allow either a significant flow of Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 2 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 groundwater or the abstraction of significant quantities of groundwater. Artificial Water Body A man-made surface water body, rather than a modified natural water body, which supports important aquatic ecosystems. It includes canals, some docks and some man-made reservoirs. Asset Management Plan See Periodic Review. Bathing Waters Directive European Community legislation - (76/160/EEC) which requires Member States to take all necessary actions to ensure identified bathing waters meet certain quality standards prescribed for the protection of the environment and public health. The new Bathing Waters Directive (2006/7/EC) will repeal the original Bathing Water Directive by end of 2014 at the latest. Biodiversity Action Plan National, local and sector-specific plans established under the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, with the intention of securing the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Biological element A collective term for a particular characteristic group of animals or plants present in an aquatic ecosystem (for example phytoplankton; benthic invertebrates; A parameter that can be monitored to estimate the value of a biological quality element. Indicators may include the presence or absence of a particularly sensitive species. Biological quality element A characteristic or property of a biological element that is specifically listed in Annex V of the Water Framework Directive for the definition of the ecological status of a water body (for example composition of invertebrates; abundance of angiosperms; age structure of fish). Catchment The area from which precipitation contributes to the flow from a borehole spring, river or lake. For rivers and lakes this includes tributaries and the areas they drain. Catchment Abstraction Management Strategies These are developed for the management of water resources at a local level. They provide information on water resources and licensing practice to allow the needs of abstractors, other water users and the aquatic environment to be considered in consultation with the local community and interested parties. Catchment Flood Management Plans These are strategic planning tools through which the Environment Agency seeks to work with other important decision-makers within a river catchment to identify and agree policies for sustainable flood risk management. Catchment modelling techniques Methods used to describe and/or predict characteristics of a catchment. Traditionally, these have focused on natural processes or movement of pollutants but they can also include other factors such as demographic, social and economic characteristics. Characterisation (of water bodies) A two-stage assessment of water bodies under the Water Framework Directive. Stage 1 identifies water bodies and describes their natural characteristics. Stage 2 assesses the pressures and impacts from human activities on the water environment. The assessment identifies those water bodies that are at risk of not achieving the environmental objectives set out in the Water Framework Directive. The results are used to prioritise both environmental monitoring and further investigations to identify those water bodies where improvement action is required. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 3 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Chemical Status The classification status for the water body against the environmental standards for chemicals that are priority substances and priority hazardous substances. Chemical status is recorded as good or fail. The chemical status classification for the water body, and the confidence in this (high or low), is determined by the worst test result. Chemical Status (surface waters) The classification status for the surface water body. This is assessed by compliance with the environmental standards for chemicals that are listed in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008/105/EC, which include priority substances, priority hazardous substances and eight other pollutants carried over from the Dangerous Substance Daughter Directives. Chemical status is recorded as good or fail. The chemical status classification for the water body, and the confidence in this (high or low), is determined by the worst test result. Chemical Status (groundwater) An expression of the overall quality of the groundwater body. The classification status for a groundwater body against the environmental criteria set out in the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC), as set out in Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) guidance document No 18. All five of the component tests for chemical status must be assessed as good or poor and the overall chemical status and the confidence in this (high or low) is determined by the worst test result. Coastal Forums Organisations formed to look at the long-term issues facing coastal areas to promote a sustainable approach to the management, use and development of the coastal zone. Co-deliverer Agencies and institutions with statutory powers or who have it in their power to deliver actions needed to implement River Basin Management Plans. Common Agricultural Policy A policy that regulates farming activities across the European Union, providing direct subsidies to fa rmers and land managers. A small part of these funds support rural development actions that mainly relate to agricultural activities, as well as forestry and environmental improvements on farmland. Common Implementation Strategy (CIS) This strategy was agreed by the European Commission, Member States and Norway in 2001. The aim of the strategy is to provide support in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and its daughter directives, by developing a common understanding and guidance on key elements of the Directives. Competent Authority An authority or authorities identified under Article 3(2) or 3(3) of the Water Framework Directive. The Competent Authority will be responsible for the application of the rules of the Directive within each river basin district lying within its territory. Cost effective In the context of the Water Framework Directive, it describes the least cost option for meeting an objective. For example, where there are a number of potential actions that could be implemented to achieve Good Ecological Status for a water body, Cost Effectiveness Analysis is used to compare each of the options and identify which option delivers the objective for the least overall cost. Countryside Council for Wales The Countryside Council for Wales is the Welsh Assembly Government's statutory adviser on sustaining natural beauty, wildlife and the opportunity for outdoor enjoyment in Wales and its inshore waters. The Countryside Council for Wales is the national wildlife conservation authority for Wales. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 4 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Cross compliance A form of conditionality by which, farmers in receipt of public subsidies are required to comply with all legislation affecting their businesses, including European Union environmental legislation. The requirements of Cross compliance are: i) an obligation to maintain agricultural land in Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions and ii) an obligation to comply with specified Statutory Management Requirements according to European Union legislation, for example the Nitrates Directive, Groundwater Directive. Delineation (of water bodies) Identifying the type and defining the boundary of a water body for rivers, lakes, Transitional and Coastal waters and groundwater under the Water Framework Directive. Diffuse pollution Pollution resulting from scattering or dispersed sources that are collectively significant but to which effects are difficult to attribute individually. Disproportionate cost The determination of disproportionate cost requires a decision making procedure that assesses whether the benefits of meeting good status in a water body are outweighed by the costs. Drinking Water Protected Areas Bodies of water that are used or could be used in the future for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption. Ecological continuum The persistence of the ecological structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems over time and space. Ecological potential The status of a heavily modified or artificial water body measured against the maximum ecological quality it could achieve given the constraints imposed upon it by those heavily modified or artificial characteristics necessary for its use. There are five ecological potential classes for Heavily Modified Water Bodies/Artificial Water Bodies (maximum, good, moderate, poor and bad). Ecological status Ecological status applies to surface water bodies and is based on the following quality elements: biological quality, general chemical and physico-chemical quality, water quality with respect to specific pollutants (synthetic and non synthetic), and hydromorphological quality. There are five classes of ecological status (high, good, moderate, poor or bad). Ecological status and chemical status together define the overall surface water status of a water Economic Advisory Stakeholder Group A group to coordinate the work going forward in England and Wales in relation to the economic analysis required by the Water Framework Directive. Environment Agency Environment Agency of England and Wales. Estuarine For our purposes by estuarine we mean transitional (see definition). Eutrophication The enrichment of waters by inorganic plant nutrients that results in increased production of algae and/or other aquatic plants, which can affect the quality of the water and disturb the balance of organisms present within it. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 5 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Exemptions The environmental objectives of the Water Framework Directive are set out in Article 4. These include the general objective of aiming to achieve good status in all water bodies by 2015 and the principle of preventing any further deterioration in status. There are also a number of exemptions to the general objectives that allow for less stringent objectives, extension of deadline beyond 2015 or the implementation of new projects. Common to all these exemptions are strict conditions that must be met and a justification must be included in the river basin management plan. The conditions and process in which the exemptions can be applied are set out in Article 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 . Favourable Conservation Status \"Favourable Conservation Status (to protect and, where necessary, improve the water or water-dependent environment to the extent necessary to maintain at or restore to favourable conservation status the water-dependent habitats and species for which the Protected Area is designated\". Where this term is used in the River Basin Management Plans, the above definition applies. Fisheries Action Plans Fisheries Action Plans are local plans developed in partnership between the Environment Agency and local angling and fisheries groups, with input from conservation and other interest groups. Fisheries Action Plans cover canal and still water fisheries as well as rivers. They may cover a wide range of issues from fish habitat, through to angling promotion and land management. Each Fisheries Action Plan is different and reflects the concerns and priorities of local angling and fisheries interests. Floods Directive The purpose of the European Union Directive on flooding (2007/60/EC) is to establish a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks aiming at the reduction of the adverse consequences on human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity associated with floods in the Community. It requires member states to undertake flood risk assessments, flood risk mapping and produce flood risk management plans. The Directive was published in early November 2007 and must be transposed into United Kingdom law by 26 November 2009. Good chemical status (surface waters) Means that concentrations of chemicals in the water body do not exceed the environmental standards specified in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008/105/EC. These chemicals include Priority Substances, Priority Hazardous Substances and eight other pollutants carried over from the Dangerous Substance Daughter Directives. Good chemical status (groundwater) See chemical status (groundwater). Means the concentrations of pollutants in the groundwater body do not exceed the criteria set out in Article 3 of the Groundwater Daughter Directive (2006/118/EC). Good ecological potential Those surface waters which are identified as Heavily Modified Water Bodies and Artificial Water Bodies must achieve 'good ecological potential' (good potential is a recognition that changes to morphology may make good ecological status very difficult to meet). In the first cycle of river basin planning good potential may be defined in relation to the mitigation measures required to achieve it. Good ecological status The objective for a surface water body to have biological, structural and chemical characteristics similar to those expected under nearly undisturbed conditions. Good quantitative status See quantitative status (groundwater). Means the level of groundwater in the groundwater body meets the criteria set out in Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 6 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 (groundwater) Annex V (2.1.2) of the Water Framework Directive. Good status Is a term meaning the status achieved by a surface water body when both the ecological status and its chemical status are at least good or, for groundwater, when both its quantitat ive status and chemical status are at good status. Groundwater All water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil. Habitat Action Plans See \"Biodiversity Action Plans\" above. Hazardous substances Substances or groups of substances that are toxic, persistent and liable to bioaccumulate, and other substances or groups of substances which give rise to an equivalent level of concern. Heavily Modified Water Body A surface water body that does not achieve good ecological status because of substantial changes to its physical character resulting from physical alterations caused by human use, and which has been designated, in accordance with criteria specified in the Water Framework Directive, as 'heavily modified'. High ecological status Is a state, in a surface water body, where the values of the hydromorphological, physico-chemical, and biological quality elements correspond to conditions undisturbed by anthropogenic activities. Hydromorphology Describes the hydrological and geomorphological processes and attributes of surface water bodies. For example for rivers, hydromorphology describes the form and function of the channel as well as its connectivity (up and downstream and with groundwater) and flow regime, which defines its ability to allow migration of aquatic organisms and maintain natural cont inuity of sediment transport through the fluvial system. The Wate r Framework Directive requires surface waters to be managed in such a way as to safeguard their hydrology and geomorphology so t hat ecology is protected. Impact assessment A tool to enable the Environment Agency to weigh and present the evidence on the positive and negative effects of a plan. For example information on the estimated cost and benefit of proposing actual measures. Integrated Coastal Zone Management A voluntary system to manage the complex range of activities in the coastal zone with sustainability and stakeholder involvement at its core. It is a process that brings together all those involved in the development, management and use of the coast within a framework that helps the integration of their interests and responsibilities. The objective is to establish sustainable levels of economic and social activity in coastal areas while protecting the coastal environment. Integrated River Basin and Coastal Management A process whereby all pressures in a catchment are assessed and action undertaken in an integrated, proportionate and efficient way. A range of stakeholders are involved in the setting of priorities and their ultimate delivery. Liaison Panels A panel consisting of around15 representatives of strategic co- deliverers including bodies with statutory powers and others who will need to put measures into action for the River Basin District. The panel represents all key interests within the River Basin District and is the primary focus for engagement at the River Basin District level. Local Development Frameworks and Plans Under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, local plans and unitary development plans in England were replaced by Local Development Frameworks. These are made up of a number of Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 7 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 statutory and non-statutory local development documents. In Wales, they are called Local Development Plans. Macroalgae Multicellular algae such as seaweed. Macrophyte Larger plants, typically includi ng flowering plants, mosses and larger algae but not including single-celled phytoplankton or diatoms. Marine Bill A bill to ensure greater protection of marine resources and to deliver sustainable development in the ma rine and coastal environment by addressing both the use and protection of marine resources. Marine Pollution Monitoring Management Group Group comprising government departments, agencies and government research institutions. They co-ordinate a United Kingdom programme of estuarine and coastal monitoring designed to satisfy a number of requirements including trend monitoring for the Oslo and Paris Convention, compliance with European Commission Directives and international conventions, local needs and for research and development. Measure This term is used in the Water Framework Directive and domestic legislation. It means an action which will be taken on the ground to help achieve Water Framework Directive objectives. Mechanisms The policy, legal and financial tools which are used to bring about actions (measures). Mechanisms in clude for example: legislation, economic instruments; codes of good practice; negotiated agreements; promotion of water efficiency; educational projects; research; development and demonstration projects. Misconnections Misconnections of foul sewage into surface water drains are a significant source of urban diffuse pollution in those areas where a separate drainage system is used. Misconnections happen when domestic plumbing has been connected into surface water drains instead of the foul sewer. This means untreated dirty water goes directly into rivers/waterways without receiving treatment. Morphology Describes the physical form and condition of a surface water body, for example the width, depth and perimeter of a river channel, the structure and condition of the riverbed and bank. National This term refers, in this document, to England and Wales. The Environment Agency covers the whole of England and Wales and is the Competent Authority for the Water Framework Directive in both. National Assembly for Wales The National Assembly for Wales consists of 60 Members elected throughout Wales. The Assembly has delegated many of its powers to the First Minister, who leads the Welsh Assembly Government. The Assembly decides on its priorities and allocates the funds made available to it from the Treasury. Within its powers, the Assembly develops and implements policies that reflect the particular needs of the people of Wales. Natura 2000 sites Protected Areas established for the protection of habitats or species under the Birds Directive (79/409/European Economic Community) (Special Protection Areas) and the Habitats Directive (92/43/ European Economic Community) (Special Areas of Conservation). Natural England The government-funded body whose purpose is to promote the conservation of England's wildlife and natural features. The previously existing organisations English Nature, the Countryside Agency and Rural Development Service were merged to form Natural England. Nitrate Vulnerable Zone The land draining to waters that contain, or are likely to contain, 50 mg/l of nitrate, or waters that are eutrophic or likely to become so. Within these zones an action programme under the Nitrates Directive Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 8 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 is put in place which farmers have to observe to reduce nitrate pollution. No deterioration (in water body status) None of the quality elements used in the classification of water body status deteriorates to the extent that the overall status is reduced. Non-hazardous pollutant Any substance that is not a hazardous substance but is liable to cause pollution in significant quantities. Non-native species See Alien species. Objective (surface waters) Three different status objectives for each water body. These are: Overall status objective Ecological status or potential objective; and Chemical status objective These are always accompanied by a date by when the objective will be achieved. Ecological status (or potential) objectives will be derived from the predicted outcomes for the biological elements and physico-chemical elements, plus any reasons for not achieving good ecological status (or potential) by 2015. Chemical status objectives will be derived from the predicted outcomes for the chemical elements plus any reasons for not achieving good chemical status by 2015. Overall status objectives will be derived from the ecological status and chemical status objectives. Objective (groundwater) There are three status objectives for each groundwater body: Overall status objective; Quantitative status objective; and Chemical status objective. These are always accompanied by a date by when the objective will be achieved. Overall status objectives will be derived from the quantitative status and chemical status objectives In addition to status objectives there are also additional environmental objectives: to prevent deterioration of status, to prevent or limit the inputs of pollutants to groundwater and to reverse any significant and sustained upward trends in pollutant concentrations. Office of Water Services The economic regulator for the water and sewerage industry in England and Wales. Office of Water Services has been renamed the Water Services Regulation Authority. Oslo and Paris Convention The 1992 Oslo and Paris Convention is the current instrument guiding international cooperation on the protection of the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. It combined and up-dated the 1972 Oslo Convention on dumping waste at sea and the 1974 Paris Convention on land-based sources of marine pollution. The work under the convention is managed by the Oslo and Paris Commission , made up of representatives from the Governments of the 15 Contracting Parties and the European Commission. Periodic Review This is the process, carried out every five years by the Office of Water Services, to assess the strategic plans for water company spending and investment. The plans include environmental improvements. The investment will often affect water customer charges and incorporates company business plans (called Asset Management Plans). Phytobenthos Bottom-dwelling multi-cellular and unicellular aquatic plants such as some species of diatom. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 9 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Phytoplankton Unicellular algae and cyanobacteria, both solitary and colonial that live, at least for part of their lifecycle, in the water column. Planning Policy Statements Planning Policy Statements set out the Government's national policies on different aspects of land use planning in England and are produced by the Department for Communities and Local Government (formerly Office of the Deputy Prime Minister). Point source pollution Pollution arising from an identifiable and localised area, structure or facility, such as a discharge pipe or landfill. Pollutant Any substance liable to cause pollution. Pollution The direct or indirect introduction, as a result of human activity, of substances or heat into the air, water or land which: (i) may be harmful to human health or the quality of aquatic ecosystems or terrestrial ecosystems directly depending on aquatic ecosystems; (ii) result in damage to material property; or (iii) impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment. Predicted outcome The future status of a quality element or water body based on groups of practical and justified measures and the date when this status will be achieved. Pressures Human activities such as abstraction, effluent discharges or engineering works that have the potential to have adverse effects on the water environment. Priority substances A pollutant, or group of pollutants, presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic (surface water) environment that has been identified at Community level under Article 16 of the Water Framework Directive. They include 'priority hazardous substances'. Programme of Measures A Programme of Measures, as used in the Water Framework Directive, is a group of actions designed to improve the environment in a river basin district and meet the objectives of the Directive. Protected Areas Areas that have been designated as requiring special protection under Community legislation for the protection of their surface water and groundwater or for the protection of habitats and species directly depending on water. Quality element A feature of an aquatic (surface water) ecosystem that can be described as a number for the purposes of calculating an ecological quality ratio, such as the concentration of a pollutant; the number of species of a type of plant. Quantitative status (groundwater) An expression of the degree to which a body of groundwater is affected by direct and indirect abstractions. The classification status for a groundwater body against the environmental criteria set out in the Water Framework Directive and as set out in Common Implementation Strategy Guidance Document No 18. All four of the component tests for quantitative status must be assessed as good or poor and the overall quantitative status and the confidence in this (high or low) is determined by the worst test result. Ramsar site A wetland area designated for its conservation value under The 1971 Convention on Wetlands of Internat ional Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat. The Ramsar Convention seeks to promote the conservation of listed wetlands and their wise use. Reference conditions The benchmark against which the effects on surface water ecosystems of human activities can be measured and reported in the relevant classification scheme. For waters not designated as heavily modified or artificial, the reference conditions are synonymous with the high ecological status class. For waters designated as heavily modified or artificial, they are synonymous with the maximum Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 10 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 ecological potential class. Regional Spatial Strategies These are frameworks in England controlling development across an area or region (for example for tourism, planning, waste, minerals, energy). Risk The likelihood of an outcome (usually negative) to a water body or the environment, or the potential impact of a pressure on a water body. Risk assessment The analysis that predicts the likelihood that a water body is at significant risk of failing to achieve one or more of the Water Framework Directive objectives. Risk category The numerical or descriptive category assigned to water bodies that have been risk assessed, in order to make the risk-based prioritisation of water bodies for action under the Water Framework Directive more manageable. River basin A river basin is the area of land from which all surface run-off and spring water flows through a sequence of streams, lakes and rivers into the sea at a single river mouth, estuary or delta. It comprises one or more individual catchments. River Basin District A river basin or several river basins, together with associated coastal waters. River Basin Management The management and associated planning process that underpins implementation and operation of the Water Framework Directive. It is both an overarching process in terms of existing processes and also defines new sub-processes such as those for hydromorphology. The river basin management plans are plans for river basin management. River Basin Management Plan For each River Basin District, the Water Framework Directive requires a River Basin Management Plan to be published. These are plans that set out the environmental objectives for all the water bodies within the River Basin District and how they will be achieved. The plans will be based upon a detailed analysis of the pressures on the water bodies and an assessment of their impacts. The plans must be reviewed and updated every six years. River Quality Objective A River Quality Objective is an agreed strategic target, expressed in terms of River Ecosystem Standards, which is used as the planning base for all activities affecting the water quality of a stretch of water. A River Quality Objective is the level of water quality that a river should achieve in order to be suitable for its agreed uses. Rivers Trusts Charities and organisations set up to assist in the conservation, protection and improvement of ri vers and associated environments. Rural Development Programme The England Rural Development Programme and the Rural Development Plan for Wales are schemes in the Government's Public Incentive Programme. These programmes are of major significance for rural land management as they provide substantial funding to land managers conditional on the implementation of environmental (and other) actions. Safeguard zone A catchment or other defined zone around a point where the water is abstracted for potable use and where actions may be taken to protect raw water quality and prevent deterioration, so minimising the need for purification treatment. For groundwater they are likely to be based on source protection zones under the Environment Agency's Groundwater Protection Policy. Saturation zone Subsurface rock or other geological strata within which the pore spaces between the particles of rock or other strata, and the cracks in those strata are filled with water and for which a water table may be determined. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 11 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Significant and sustained upward trend A statistically significant trend in pollutant concentrations in groundwater that could lead to a future failure of one or more of the environmental objectives for groundwater unless it is reversed. Site of Special Scientific Interest An area of land notified under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 by the appropriate nature conservation body (Scottish Natural Heritage in Scotland) as being of special interest by virtue of its flora and fauna, geological or physiogeographical features. Source Protection Zone A zone around a well, borehole or spring where groundwater is abstracted for human consumption (for example drinking water or food production), as defined under the Agency's Groundwater Protection Policy (GP3). Zone 1 (SPZ1) is the area closest to the abstraction, representing the highest risk to the source. Zones 2 and 3 are progressively larger. Risk-based Policies to prevent pollution are applied within these zones. Spatial planning Spatial planning is wider ranging than land-use planning based on regulation and control of land, and aims to ensure the best use of land by assessing competing demands. Social, economic and environmental factors are taken into account in producing a decision that is more conducive to sustainable development. Special Area of Conservation Natura 2000 sites that are designated under the Habitats Directive. Special Protection Area Natura 2000 sites that are designated under the Birds Directive. Specific Pollutant A substance considered as being discharged to the aquatic environment in significant quantities at the national level and for which Environmental Quality Standards have been established. As part of the ecological classification criteria, and in places where these pollutants are monitored, these standards must be met, in order for a surface water body to be classified as good ecological status. Stakeholder Individuals or groups that are or could become interested in, involved in or affected by our policies and activities. Our stakeholders include regulators, statutory bodies, professional organisations, local organisations and members of the public. Stakeholder forum A group of interested parties to guide and advice on river basin planning and management. Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive (2001/42/EC) European environmental legislation which requires an 'environmental assessment' to be carried out for certain plans and programmes whose formal preparation began after 21 July 2004 (or are prepared but not adopted or submitted by a legislative procedure by 21 July 2006), and which are considered likely to have significant effects on the environment. The term \"Strategic Environmental Assessment\" is used in United Kingdom guidance to mean an environmental assessment under this Directive. Status The physical, chemical, biological, or ecological quality of a water body. Summary of Significant Water Management Issues This is a report on each River Basin District that highlights significant water management issues in that River Basin District which will need to be addressed to achieve environmental objectives under the Water Framework Directive. Supplementary Plans Plans additional to the River Basin Management Plan which contain additional detail to that within the River Basin Management Plan but which fits wholly within its strategic principles and policies. Supplementary Plans do not cover issues outside the remit of the Water Framework Directive. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 12 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Sustainable Drainage Systems A system of management practices and control structures designed to drain surface water in a more sustainable fashion than some conventional techniques. Technical feasibility Is determined through the assessment of whether the implementation of a measure or programme of measures, designed to achieve the Water Framework Directive objectives, is technically possible either at the national and local level and includes the consideration of uncertainty as well as environmental and socio economic feasibility. Technical feasibility depends upon the availability of a technical solution and information on the cause of the problem and hence the identification of the solution. Toolkit of Measures A variety of measures which consist of actions that when implemented can help deliver Water Framework Directive objectives. These may include basic measures (the minimum set of measures that must be available) and supplementary measures. Transitional water A Water Framework Directive term for waters that are intermediate between fresh and marine water. Transitional waters include estuaries and saline lagoons. Typology The means by which the Water Framework Directive requires surface water bodies to be differentiated according to their physical and physico-chemical characteristics. Water body A manageable unit of surface water, being the whole (or part) of a stream, river or canal, lake or reservoir, transitional water (estuary) or stretch of coastal water. A 'body of groundwater' is a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers. Water Framework Directive European Union legislation - Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) - establishing a framework for European Community action in the field of water policy. Water Framework Directive management catchment An amalgamation of a number of Water Framework Directive river water body catchments that provide a management unit at which level actions are applied. Water Framework Directive objectives The objectives set out in Article 4 of the Water Framework Directive together with objectives set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 7 of the Directive and which are required to be met. Water Level Management Plans Water Level Management Plans provide a means by which water level requirements for a range of activities including agriculture, flood defence and conservation can be balanced and integrated. Water Protection Zones Areas designated by the Secretary of State, within which activities polluting the water environment can be restricted or forbidden. Water Protection Zones can be designated at any scale (sub-catchment, catchment or a larger area) and restrictions are enforced to combat point and/or diffuse sources of water pollution, over and above other existing statutory powers. Water Services All services which provide, for households, public institutions or any economic activity: (a) abstraction, impoundment, storage, treatment and distribution of surface water or groundwater; and (b) waste water collection and treatment facilities which subsequently discharge into surface water. Water table The upper limit of the saturation zone. Environment Agency River Basin Management Plan, Angli an River Basin District 13 Annex N: Glossary December 2009 Water use Water Services together with any other human activity identified as having a significant impact upon the status of water. Weight of evidence A weight of evidence approach integrates results or evidence from several data sources, weighted appropriately, to make risk based decisions. Welsh Assembly Government The devolved government in Wales. Welsh Technical Advice Notes Planning Policy Wales (2002) sets out the land use planning policies of the Welsh Assembly Government (the Assembly Government). It is supplemented by a series of topic based Technical Advice Notes (Wales).
