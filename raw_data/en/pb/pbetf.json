Enjoy your sweet baby I have read that stimming is actually normal & even necessary for development as they discover their hands, feet, etc. don't fall into the rabbit hole.. it's hard to distinguish between that gut feeling & anxiety- trust me I am the queen of that line being blurred. If ur baby is meeting milestones, he should be fine. Remember one set thing doesn't determine autism, it's a pattern of behaviors- and signs. Stimming alone does not mean autism .. I think as parents we will always worry, but just remember ur baby boy is healthy happy and loved .. he is ok Does it run in your family? I honestly wouldn't be concerned so soon unless it was something that was noted often in your family. But of course trust your mom gut if you continue to feel concerned months later! my LO \"stims\" too and it worries me. Google is definitely not my friend. I wish we could turn on blockers so we don't go down the rabbit holes. It has definitely interfered with my joy of having a new baby. I'm sure our boys are just fine Stimming is extremely normal in infants and toddlers, it's how they learn to self soothe and not always rely on others to help them. I thought my son had autism, but I was just expecting him to be hitting certain milestones by certain times and assuming that things he was doing weren't normal, but they were. It usually isn't diagnosed until 2-3 because of some of the similarities b My baby who is 7 months old \"stims\"all the time too with her wrists and ankles. Has never had typical eye contact that I've seen other babies make. It seems to make her uncomfortable sometimes. Not to say she never makes it and interacts because she will... idk it's so hard to explain! I've been worried for months and the anxiety has really put a damper on watching her grow. I wish I could stop obsessing over her every move but I can't I still worry about the eye contact. I just feel it's not right. He does everything he's supposed to be doing though. He scored average to above average in everything so I guess that's why they didn't seem concerned about it? Idk.. If you don't mind me asking, what made your LO qualify? I'm curious how different each state screens them well thanks good news in a way! Unless you're still seeing concerns. How old is he? My girl is 9.5 and she qualified. We haven't started services yet though and she literally just started babbling overnight I called EI and he doesn't qualify. The did a screening and asked tons of questions and came to evaluate him. hey! Any update?! any update? Been going through similar will do! And yes I agree!! this is all normal, but to aid with your anxiety you could always reach out to child development in your state for an assessment. I'm in WA and we did one at 10 months and will do another at 16 months. It's a great free service and is recommended for Everyone! Not just those with concerns. It's a great tool to use just like a pediatrician for health. Here's a link for my states website so you can look into it. Edited to include a link to find assessment resources in your state [https://www.nationalparenthelpline.org/find-support/state-resources](//www.nationalparenthelpline.org/find-support/state-resources) keep me updated! It's nice to have someone to talk to about it and relate to my son doesn't have the typical eye contact either. He will make it but like you said.. not like I've seen other babies! I'm trying not to worry too. Autism runs in my family, so I get really nervous when my LO does stimming action too. But, I am hearing that it is a natural part of growth and that worrying about it right now is early. There are usually other symptoms that accompany autism, but those aren't noticeable until at least 18 months if not closer to 2-3 years. A lot of autistic behaviour is considered normal before a certain age. The research I've read suggests that the earliest you can potentially tell an autistic kid isn't neurotypical is about 14 months, and the earliest you can tell autism from other developmental disabilities is around 18 months. And that's with the easier-to-diagnose kids, there's some kids on the milder end who are not distinguishable as autistic until they're around 4-5 years old. Anyway, autism isn't a bad thing. It's a different way of thinking and learning, but with the right support you can have a good life regardless.
