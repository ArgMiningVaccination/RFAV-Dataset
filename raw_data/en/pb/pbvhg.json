Associated Press Associated Press News Desk News Desk Leave your feedback The White House COVID task force held a news briefing Tuesday morning, days after the nation's campaign to roll out new omicron-specific boosters began. Watch the briefing in the player above. Last Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed updated COVID-19 boosters, opening the way for a fall vaccination campaign that could blunt a winter surge if enough Americans roll up their sleeves. \"Now, we have been working over the weekend to get these vaccines out to tens of thousands of convenient, trusted locations around the country,\" said White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha. The new boosters targeting today's most common omicron strains should begin arriving in pharmacies and clinics within days. They're combination or \"bivalent\" shots that contain half the original vaccine that's been used since December 2020 and half protection against today's dominant omicron versions, BA.4 and BA.5. It's the first update to COVID-19 vaccines ever cleared by the Food and Drug Administration. WATCH: Updated COVID boosters approved ahead of potential fall surge Updated shots made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are authorized for anyone 12 and older, and rival Moderna's version is for adults. They're to be used as a booster for anyone who's already had their primary vaccination series \u2014 using shots from any U.S.-cleared company \u2014 and regardless of how many boosters they've already gotten. \"It is becoming increasingly clear that, looking forward with the COVID-19 pandemic, in the absence of a dramatically different variant, we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual, updated COVID-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci. The FDA set the minimum wait time at two months. But advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it's better to wait longer. Some advise at least three months, another said someone who's not at high risk might wait as long as six months. It's still important to get vaccinated even if you've already been infected \u2014 but timing matters here, too. The CDC has long told people to defer vaccination until they've recovered but also that people may consider waiting for three months after recovering to get a vaccination. And several CDC advisers say waiting the three months is important, both for potentially more benefit from the shot and to reduce chances of a rare side effect, heart inflammation, that sometimes affects teen boys and young men.
