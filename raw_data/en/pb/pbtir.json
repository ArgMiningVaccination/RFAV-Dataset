Are certain innate immune pathways dispensable forefficacy ? Are there responses thatcanbeassociated withcommon and rare (severe) side effects? 3) Understand the molecular mechanisms by which mRNA and iLNPs are sensed Development of less reactogenic and more effective vaccine candidates Which vaccine components /features contribute toinnate immune activation (understand combined -and potential synergistic effects of these responses) Multiple possible paths todevelop mRNA vaccines thathit thesweet spot of immune activation LNP designs)The path tonext generation mRNA-iLNP & contractors by the European Medicines Agency${If.End} Research directions for the underlying cause of myocarditis Pharmacokinetics of mRNA -LNP "}
