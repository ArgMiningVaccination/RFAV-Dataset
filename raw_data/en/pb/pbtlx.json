In some cases, fever reducers and extra fluid intake can weaken the body's response to infection. Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination is rare, and the risk is much smaller than the risks of cardiac injury linked to COVID-19 itself. The circulation of misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine poses the danger of hampering the government's efforts to control the pandemic. What do you need to weigh up when working out whether to get the AstraZeneca vaccine? Here's what the evidence says. Our brains cannot easily understand tiny risks so we tend to overestimate them. That's when we need a little extra help to make the best decisions about our health. As vaccine eligibility is expanded to adolescents and young adults, understanding who might be more likely to be vaccine hesitant, and why, can help inform public health strategies The CDC first paused, then unpaused, the administration of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns about blood clots. But what are those clots, and how do they form? The AstraZeneca COVID vaccine is now available to Australians over 50. Here's what you need to know before you roll up your sleeve. It's normal for different people to mount stronger or weaker immune responses to a vaccine, but post-shot side effects won't tell you which you are. If one adenoviral vaccine is linked with blood clots, it doesn't mean all vaccines in this family will have that same effect. But it's definitely worth health authorities assessing the data. The one-dose vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson is temporarily halted because of potentially serious blood clots seen in six women. An immunologist explains what this means for you. Pausing COVID-19 vaccine rollouts can backfire. There are better ways to manage safety issues while they're being investigated. We already track potential vaccine side-effects in Australia. So we'll be using, and building on, years of experience in monitoring any long-term effects of COVID-19 vaccines. The arrival of COVID-19 vaccines has raised hope for an end to the pandemic. Hopefully that's true, but there are variables. Here are some factors that could affect the success of the vaccine rollout. By prioritising vaccination for the elderly, Indonesia may optimally reduce the hospital burden and COVID-19 deaths amid a limited vaccine supply during the first vaccination phase. Now that two COVID vaccines have been authorized by the FDA, questions arise. Today, a physician from Indiana University School of Medicine answers five reader questions. A serious allergic reaction was reported in a health care worker in Alaska after she received the COVID-19 vaccine. Does this mean that people with allergies need to be concerned? An expert answers.
