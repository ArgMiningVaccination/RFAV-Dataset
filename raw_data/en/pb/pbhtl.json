CrippenDirector January 15, 2002OVERVIEW Each year, the Congressional Budget Offi ce (CBO) is required to report to the Congress on unauthorized appropr iations and expiring author izations. That require- ment comes from the Balanced Budget a nd Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, which amended the Congressional Budg et and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Section 221(b) of the Deficit Control Act added the followi ng requirement to section 202(e)(3) of the Congressional Budget Act, as amended: On or before January 15 of each year, the Director [of CBO], after con- sultation with the appropriate committ ees of the House and the Senate, shall submit to the Congress a report listing (A) all programs and activitiesfunded during the fiscal year ending September 30 of that calendar year for which authorizations for appropria tions have not been enacted for that fiscal year, and (B) all programs and activities for which no authorizationsfor appropriations have been enacted for the fiscal year beginning Octo- ber 1 of that calendar year. According to the conference report on the Deficit Control Act, the purpose of that amendment was \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adoptauthorizing legislation that must be in place before the thirteen regular appropriationbills can be considered.\" THE ROLE OF AUTHORIZATIONS Authorization laws are an outgrowth of the long-standing legislative practice of distinguishing between the laws that set forth federal policies and the laws that fundthem. In general, authorization laws esta blish, continue, or modi fy federal programs. Funding for those programs is then provi ded separately in a nnual appropriation acts. Some authorization laws merge policy a nd funding decisions\u2014in effect, combining an authorization and appropria tion in the same act. They are referred to as direct, or mandatory, spending laws. There are two kinds of authorization laws . The first type is the \"organic,\" or \"enabling,\" statute, which makes broad grants of authority, establishes federal offices or duties, creates federal programs, or permits various activities to be carried out.The second type is a provision that specifi cally authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the various authorities or du ties established under an organic statute or2 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 1. A point of order is an objection raised by a Member of Congress against a piece of legislation or a procedure on the grounds that it violates the rules of the House or Senate. The Presiding Officer decides whether to sustain or overrule the point of order on the basis of the specific rule and precedents under that rule. The decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to appeal to the full House or Senate. 2. A special rule is a simple resolution, reported by the House Rules Committee, that sets the terms and conditions for the House's consideration of legislation.to achieve other purposes. That kind of authorization may appear in the enabling statute or be enacted in a separate law. This report focuses on the second type of authorization law. In general, those laws are intended to offer guidance to the appropriations committees on the level ofprogram funding to be provide d in annual appropriation acts. That guidance is typi- cally expressed as an authorization of a ppropriations. Such authorizations are pro- vided either for specific dollar amounts (defin ite authorizations) or for \"such sums as are necessary\" (indefinite authorizations). Authorizations of appropr iations may be permanent, or they may cover only particular fiscal years. Authorizations th at have a stated dura tion may be annual (per- taining to one fiscal year) or multiyear (pertaining to two, five, or any specific numberof fiscal years). When such an author ization expires, the Congress may choose to extend the life of a program by reauthor izing the activity. The Congress may also extend a program simply by providing new appropriations for it. However, appropri- ations made available for a program afte r its authorization of appropriations has expired are considered \" unauthorized\" appropriations. House and Senate rules\u2014dating from th e 19th century\u2014generally preclude the Congress from considering appr opriations that are not authorized by law. Rule 21 of the House of Representatives prohibits a ppropriations in a gene ral appropriation bill or in an amendment to a bill that have not been previously authorized. For generalappropriation bills, Rule 16 of the Senate restricts amendments that increase anappropriation or add a new item of appropriati on unless it has been authorized by existing law. Both rules subject the legi slation containing the unauthorized appro- priation to a point of order upon its c onsideration by the House or Senate. 1 However, House and Senate rules are not self-enforcing. A point of order must be raised by an individual Member for the rules to be enfor ced. In the House, a point of order under Rule 21 may be avoided by a waiver granted under the special rule governing consid- eration of the general appr opriation bill or amendments.2 In the Senate, a point of order under Rule 16 cannot be waived in th e same manner, but th e Senate rule in- cludes several exceptions. If no point of or der is raised, an una uthorized appropria- tion may proceed through the legislative process.UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 More than half of all fe deral spending now goes to programs for which the authorizing legislation provides budget author ity. Such direct spending includes fund- ing for most major entitlement programs. (Some entitlements ar e funded in annual appropriation acts, but the amounts provided are controlled by the authorization law that established the entitlement.) The authorization laws that provide direct spendingare typically permanent, but some major di rect-spending programs, such as the Food Stamp program, require periodic renewal. LISTINGS OF UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS This report covers all appropriated programs that at one time had an explicit auth- orization of appropriations that has expired or will expire this year. Appendix A lists unauthorized appropriations\u2014programs that have received an appropriation for fiscalyear 2002 but whose applicable authorization has expired. Appendix B lists programsfor which authorizations expire at or befo re the end of fiscal year 2002. The appen- dixes show the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year that the authorization was in effect, and the amount authorized in that year. If the authorization was provided fo r \"such sums as are necessary,\" the report shows the amount authorized as \"indefinite.\" The listings of public laws in the appen- dixes are issued in three separate versions\u2014by House authorizing committee, Senateauthorizing committee, and appropriations subcommittee. The information in this report is drawn from CBO's Legislative Classification System, a database reflecting all public la ws that contain nonpermanent authorizations of appropriations\u2014up to and including legislation that cleared the House and Senate during the first session of the 107th Congress and was signed into law by January 11, 2002 (that is, through Public Law 107-118). In general, House and Senate rules require the appropriations committees, in their reports on general appropriation bills, to identify any programs f unded in the bills that lack an authorization\u2014including prog rams for which explicit authorizations of appropriations have never been enacted. This CBO report, in contrast, covers only programs that at one time had an explicit authorization th at either has expired or will expire. Also, as mentioned earlier, many la ws establish programs with authorizations of appropriations that do not expire. Bo th the reports of the appropriations commit- tees and this CBO report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent.4 UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3. See Congressional Budget Office, Unauthorized Appropriations and Expiring Authorizations (January 12, 2001). 4. See section 102 of P.L. 107-77. In previous year s, authorities under the 1980 Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act (P.L. 96-132) were extended one year at a time in annual appropriation acts. 5. Staff of the veterans' affairs committees and the Department of Veterans Affairs characterize the relevant authorization\u2014in section 105 of P.L. 104-262\u2014 as intended to be a cap on spending for veterans' medical care for 1997 and 1998 only. However, it is treated in this report as any other expired authori-zation of appropriations.PROGRAMS FUNDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2002 WITH EXPIRED AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS Appendix A lists programs a nd activities funded by an a ppropriation for fiscal year 2002 whose authorization of appropriations has expire d. If the applicable 2002 appropriation act (or its legisl ative history) provides an ex plicit level of funding for the program, that amount is shown unde r \"Unauthorized FY 2002 Appropriations.\" If no specific amount is provided (as in the case of a small program that is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account), CBO contacts the agency's budget office to determine whether the prog ram is still being f unded and, if so, the amount allocated for it. If that amount ca nnot be determined, th e appendix notes that a specific dollar amount of unauthorized 2002 appropriations is not available. The Congress has appropria ted about $91 billion for fiscal year 2002 for pro- grams and activities whose authorizations of appropriations have expired (see Tables1, 2, and 3). That amount is about $20 billion lower than the comparable figurereported by CBO for 2001. 3 The difference arises mainly because certain expired authorizations of appropriations covering the Department of Justice were permanently extended under the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appr opriations Act for 2002.4 The largest single unauthorized appropr iation for 2002 is for veterans' medical care ($21.3 billion); the appropriati on was last authorized for 1998.5 Other relatively sizable programs with expired authorizations of appropriations include many housingand community development programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which were la st authorized for 1994 but ha ve funding for fiscal year 2002 of $7.8 billion; certain programs of the National Institutes of Health (last authorized for 1996; 2002 funding of $8.2 b illion); the Coast Guard (1999 authoriza- tion; 2002 funding of $5.2 billion); and the National Science Foundation (2000 authorization; 2002 funding of $4.8 billion). Certain appropriations for the Department of Stat e (about $6.5 billion) and international economic and development assistance pr ograms (about $4 billion) areUNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 5 TABLE 1.

The appendix indicates (by public law) the amounts authorized to be appropriated in 2002 for ex piring programs and activities, rather than the amounts actually appropriated in that year. About $370 billion worth of definite author izations in laws under the jurisdiction of 15 House and 15 Senate authorizing committees will expire by the end of this fiscalyear (see Tables 4, 5, and 6). However, most of that amount (about $340 billion) is authorized in a single law, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-107), which also includes th e Maritime Administr ation and atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy. Typically, authorizations fordefense funding are renewed annually. Another annual reau thorization is the Intelli- gence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-108). Most of the authori- zations for intelligence activities are indefinite and classified. Other major definite authorizations that expire at the end of 2002 include the National Aeronautic s and Space Administration Au thorization Act of 2000 ($14.6 billion), the Security Assistance Act of 2000 ($3.9 billion), and various programs under the Agricultural Research, Extensi on, and Education Reform Act of 1998 and the Federal Agriculture Improvement a nd Reform Act of 1996 (nearly $4 billion). Thus, as in other recent years, the tota l amount of expiring definite authoriza- tions of appropriations is concentrated in a handful of laws. Of the 58 laws with authorizations that expire this year, five account for nearly 98 percent of the year's expiring definite authorizati ons. Conversely, 30 laws (jus t over half of the total num- ber due to expire) include definite author izations that sum to $50 million or less for each law and that together make up less than 0.5 percent of the total amount of expir- ing definite authorizations. Some laws with expiring indefinite aut horizations (for \"such sums as are neces- sary\") also involve relatively large amounts of funding. For example, the indefinite authorization for the Food Stamp progra m\u2014a mandatory spending program with estimated outlays of $23 billion in 2002\u2014expires this year. Classified spending for intelligence activities, which as noted above is reauthorized annually, is probably substantial as well. Other major indefinite authorizations expiring this year include allagricultural research, extension, and educa tion activities of the De partment of Agri- culture authorized under the Federal Ag riculture Improvement and Reform Act (appropriations for fiscal year 2002 of about $2 billion); certain programs authorized under the Health Professions Education Partnership Act of 1998 (appropriations of about $0.7 billion); and refugee and entrant assistance programs of the Department of Health and Human Services authoriz ed under the Immigrati on and Nationality Act (appropriations of about $0.5 billion).UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 9 TABLE 4.
