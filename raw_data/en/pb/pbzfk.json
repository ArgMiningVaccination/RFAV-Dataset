While modern medicine can do wonders for the human body, we must remember the blueprint behind science's biggest discoveries: Herbs. More often than not, our everyday diets are not enough to sustain our immune systems - That's where herbal teas and supplements come into play! Here are 5 herbs that can boost the immune system: - Blackthorn - White Willow Bark (Salix alba) The immune system is made up of the cells, organs and tissues that keep our bodies from getting ill. It plays a vital role in fighting off sickness by attacking any toxins that enter the body. Common issues like catching the flu are resolved by the immune system. When we consume supplements that aim to address weakness(es) in our immune system, we are giving our bodies a fighting chance against these toxins. Let's start off with the easiest to locate on this list: Blackthorn Fruit. Blackthorn Fruit For Immune Health Whether you know these berries as blackthorn fruit or sloes, the Prunus spinosa plant is incredibly common to find. They have been spotted in various parts of Europe, Asia, New Zealand and Tasmania, as well as the northern parts of America and the African continent. Due to their small, blue appearance, they are easily mistaken for blueberries. However, it's important to note the differences between the two. For one, blueberries are incredibly sweet fruits, while blackthorn berries taste more bitter and sour. If you like that taste, then you can consume blackthorn berries without much preparation. Otherwise, it's recommended that the berries be cooked: This can then be made into jams, jellies or sauces. Whatever your preference is, you should still consider adding sloes to your diet. Their benefits are just that potent! Blackthorn fruit helps support your immune system by lowering the risk of chronic disease -- Chronic diseases, for eg: cancer and diabetes, can prove fatal when our immune systems are weak. Fortunately, the nutrients found in blackthorn berries have compounds called tannins. Tannins are known for their antioxidant properties, which significantly reduces the chance of developing chronic disease(s). Some other health benefits of blackthorn fruit include: - Relieves upset stomach; - Addresses kidney and bladder problems; - Acts as both a laxative and a diuretic; and - Treats coughs, colds and breathing conditions. Elderberries For Immune Support Known for their sweet taste, elderberries (or Sambucus nigra) are found in most parts of the United States. They are so common, in fact, that you may even have some in your very own backyard. Elderberries are loaded with vitamins and minerals, including dietary fibre, vitamin C, phenolic acids and anthocyanins. Together, these vitamins and minerals give the elderberry plant its anti-inflammatory effects. According to some sources, elderberries also have a significant effect against viral infections. During this 2004 study, patients who were sick with influenza were given 15ml of elderberry syrup four times per day. After about 2-4 days, their symptoms showed major signs of improvement, confirming that elderberries can boost the body's defense against disease when consumed. Another study used capsules instead of syrup, but it yielded similar results. After receiving elderberry capsules three times per day, patients did not have severe symptoms. They also recovered from the illness quicker than those who did not take elderberry extract. Apart from reducing symptoms and fighting off infections, some other benefits of elderberries include: - Induces sweating (diaphoretic); - Protects cells against damage; - Reduces cholesterol levels; and - Moderates the digestive process. If you'd like to create your very own elderberry syrup, or prefer to eat the berries whole, then the [Biokoma Elderberries (Sambucus nigra) Organic Dried Fruits](https://erx93v9lxx93r7co-12369898.shopifypreview.com/products/elderberries-sambucus-nigra-100g-3-33oz-dried-fruits?_pos=1&_sid=6d1efe3d4&_ss=r) is perfect for you.

More research is needed to confirm the effects that yarrow tea may have on the human immune system. However, recent studies on rats have highlighted numerous benefits. In one study, the use of yarrow prevented memory loss and physical impairments associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
