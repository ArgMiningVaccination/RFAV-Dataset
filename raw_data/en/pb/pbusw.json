Participants in the online consultation 38iv Foreword The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently implementing its Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019-2023 to support countries in reaching all the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. The Programme is structured around three interconnected strategic priorities: achieving universal health coverage, addressing health emergencies and promoting healthier populations. These strategic priorities are supported by three strategic shifts: stepping up leadership, driving public health impacts in every country and focusing global public goods on impact. Traditional medicine has always played a role in WHO's collective work. The Declaration of Astana, the renewed commitment to the Declaration of Alma-Ata on universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals reaffirm the role of traditional medicine in strengthening primary health care, a cornerstone of health systems, in pursuit of health for all. This is also reflected in the WHO global report on traditional and complementary medicine in 2019, in which 88% of WHO Member States reported use of traditional and complementary medicine in health care. In view of the growing importance of traditional medicine in health care nationally and globally, WHO and its Member States are exploring ways to integrate, as appropriate, safe, evidence-based traditional and complementary medical services into national or subnational health systems, to meet its commitment to the Political Declaration of the High-level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage. WHO provides policy and technical guidance to Member States and promotes safe, effective use of traditional and complementary medicine through appropriate regulation of products, practices and practitioners. It further supports Member States in including traditional and complementary medicine in people-centred health care to implement the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023. WHO's core function is to set norms and standards. The normative work is driven by need and may be translated into a real impact in countries through appropriate policies. The aim of this series of benchmarks for various systems and interventions of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine is to provide a reference point for evaluating actual practice and practitioners. I am very pleased to introduce this series to policy-makers, health workers and the general public. I firmly believe that it will serve its purpose. Anshu Banerjee Assistant Director-General a.i. Division of Universal Health Coverage / Life Course (UHL) World Health Organization v Preface Integrated health services are essential for implementation of the WHO Thirteenth General Programme of Work, to support countries in achieving universal health coverage and the health- related Sustainable Development Goals. The mission of the Department of Integrated Health Services is to accelerate equitable access to high-quality, integrated, people-centred health services that can be monitored and evaluated. WHO is mandated to provide independent normative guidance. Its normative products cover a wide range of global public health goods, including norms and standards. The primary role of the Department of Integrated Health Services is therefore to generate and produce relevant global goods. that are driven by country needs and have a tangible impact at country level. Since 2018, when 88% of WHO Member States reported use of traditional and complementary medicine, WHO's support in evaluating their safety, quality and effectiveness has continuously been ranked as important, as reported in the WHO global report on traditional and complementary medicine in 2019. WHO prioritizes normative products after an assessment of demand. To address increasing needs and to ensure impact in countries, this series of benchmarks covers the main systems and interventions in traditional, complementary and integrative medicine according to norms and standards for training and practice. WHO is not only assessing the quality of these normative products but is also streamlining systems and plans for monitoring and evaluation. I am pleased to present this series of benchmarks and invite you to join us in measuring and documenting their impact.

It is one of the four formative forces of the human being . Etheric organization: The system of formative life forces that form the physical body and maintain the integration of material substances into living organisms, such as in plants, animals or humans. The etheric organization is considered responsible for growth and regeneration and is central to restoring health. It is one of the four formative forces of the human being . Formative forces of the human being: Four force systems involved in the shape, form, structure, function and organization of minerals, plants, animals and humans, existing in addition to physicochemical interactions. The dynamic composition of the four systems of formative forces ( Wesensglieder in German) constitute the human being: physical organization (formative physical forces), etheric organization (formative life forces), astral organization (formative soul forces) and \"I\"-organization (formative forces of the human spirit). Goethean science and observation method: Scientific, phenomenological observation approach based on the work of the German writer and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, further developed by Rudolf Steiner. By letting phenomena speak for themselves through various observation methods, functional relationships become visible, so that complex phenomena can be understood in terms of a simpler, ultimately irreducible archetypal phenomenon. \"I\"-organization: The system of forces of the human spirit, the \"I\" (or ego), that provides the capacity for uprightness, thinking, insight, self-reflection, freedom, morality and the development of art and culture, as well as its expression and integrating capacity in the human warmth organization and other bodily functions. It is one of the four formative forces of the human being . Living body: State of the body when the etheric organization is acting within the physical organization of a plant, an animal or human being. Neurosensory system: Refers to the dynamic that prevails in the nervous and sensory system but is also found in all processes related to form, structure, catabolic activity, consciousness and thinking. It is a systemic part of the threefold nature of the human organism . Physical organization: The physical body in its distinct human form, made up of physical matter and physicochemical interactions. The form and functions of the physical body are organized by formative forces, primarily by the etheric organization . The physical organization is one of the four formative forces of the human being . Rhythmic system : Refers to all rhythmical processes and functions of human life, in particular the circulatory and respiratory system, and is also linked to feeling. Rhythmical processes allow mediation between the polarities of the neurosensory system and the system of metabolism and limbs . It is a systemic part of the threefold nature of the human organism . Seven life processes: Life in the anthroposophic view can be differentiated into seven processes: breathing, warming, nourishing, secreting, maintaining, growing and reproducing. Soul (in anthroposophic understanding): Refers to the dimension by which the human being links things to his or her own being and inner space, through which he or she experiences pleasure viii and displeasure, desire and aversion, joy and sorrow and other feelings and thoughts. The soul, in anthroposophic understanding, is closely related to and derived from the astral organization. Spirit (in anthroposophic understanding): Refers to the dimension that manifests in the human being when he or she looks at the spiritual nature of things. The spirit of the human being is his or her imperishable core. System of metabolism and limbs: Refers to the digestive system in its widest sense, internal abdominal organs and the musculoskeletal system in the limbs, as well processes related to movement, metabolism, regeneration, reproduction and volition (will). It is part of the threefold nature of the human organism . Threefold nature of the human organism: Functional polarity between catabolic processes necessary for the emergence of consciousness ( neurosensory system ) and anabolic, regenerative processes (system of metabolism and limbs) , held in balance through rhythmical processes ( rhythmic system) . Tria principia: Latin expression for the ancient concept of three principles - salt, sulfur and mercury - described by Paracelsus (1493-1541). Tria principia reflect processes rather than substances: salt process (structure), sulfur process (dissolution) and mercury process (harmonic flow). This concept is further developed in anthroposophic medicine. Twelve senses: In the anthroposophic view, sensorial perception is categorized into 12 main sense modalities: of touch, life, movement, balance, smell, taste, sight/vision, temperature/warmth, hearing, speech/language, thought, and sense of the inner individuality (\"I\") of the other human being. Warmth organization: Summarizes the different aspects of heat and warmth in the human being as a self-regulating whole: heat and heat distribution within the body, thermosensation and the feeling of physical and emotional warmth. Considered closely related to and controlled by \"I\"-organization.ix Introduction Why this benchmark? Anthroposophic medicine (AM) is a form of traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCI) that originated in Europe and is gaining increasing international popularity. It is integrated into conventional medicine in outpatient practices and hospitals. As more countries have begun to set policies and regulatory frameworks for the practice of TCI, policy-makers require information to make informed decisions, including evaluations of the quality of practices, difficulties and ways in which they can be addressed. Benchmarks for training in several TCI disciplines and therapies have been issued by WHO, including in acupuncture, ayurveda, naturopathy, osteopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, tuina and Unani medicine. These are the first benchmarks for training in AM. They reflect what the AM community considers to be minimum training for health workers to practise any of the AM disciplines in order to ensure consumer protection and patient safety, including quality assurance and proper use, to ensure the effectiveness of AM. The benchmarks will contribute to establishing a reference toolkit on AM for countries. How was this benchmark prepared? This document followed the established methodology of WHO to develop benchmarks in traditional, complementary and integrative medicine. The WHO secretariat proposed a plan and the scope of the work. A review of existing training benchmarks and publications on training in AM was conducted to identify knowledge gaps. First, the international professional organizations for each of the AM disciplines were requested in 2017 to share international training documents. 17 international training documents were obtained, covering seven out of the nine AM disciplines (for midwifes and dentists only national training documents were available). 12 documents were included for review and five were excluded. Documents were assessed for covering 11 items needed for the preparation of this document: definition of the AM discipline; entrance requirements; training components; learning outcomes concerning knowledge, concepts, theories; learning outcomes concerning clinical competence and practice; graduation criteria; training duration; teaching methodology; training on professionalism, collaboration, patient rights, research; safety; curricula/ distribution of training hours. For four of the disciplines, documents covered at least nine items; for the other three disciplines, documents covered six or less items. Documents were assessed for clarity. Second, a scoping review was conducted using the databases Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane SAGE journals, Wiley Online, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Anthromedics/ Der Merkurstab for publications between January 2012 and April 2022. The search terms categories (specified for the different databases) were: anthroposophic (medicine), disciplines, education/ training. Languages included English, German and Dutch. Study selection was carried out by two researchers independently. Results: 1080 publications were identified, 452 duplicates were removed, 619 were screened out and 9 included (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) . The quality of the publications was not assessed. Eight different training programs were described. All of the described programs were for physicians, one program was designed to start during medical school, one included training of other AM disciplines as well. x The included publications describe, at least partially, ten of the eleven items needed for the document preparation for physicians. Three items had not been previously identified through the review of international training documents. To prepare the benchmark document, WHO and the drafting experts contacted the international professional organizations of each AM discipline with requests for clarification, further information and modifications in their respective training documents, where appropriate, to ensure clarity and completeness of the required items. After an iterative process between WHO, the drafting experts and the representatives of the AM disciplines, a training text and sample curriculum was agreed for each AM discipline for inclusion in the first draft of the document. The first draft of the document was presented to a working group meeting for discussion. A total of 24 experts from 13 countries across the 6 WHO regions joined the working group meeting, representing expertise including in policy-making, regulation, health worker education, international training and clinical practice. After three days of discussion on the scope, structure and content of the document, the meeting reached consensus and provided advice for the second draft. The second draft was shared with a wider group of global experts for peer review and was revised based on the feedback of 28 experts. A second global peer review was conducted and the draft was revised again based on the feedback from 60 experts. The updated draft was then put through a consultation attended by seven experts, who reviewed the progress made since the working group meeting and peer reviews. Findings and recommendations from the scoping review were included and addressed, as appropriate, for the final draft. WHO's work on global health issues requires the assistance of external parties whose expertise may entail specific interests. To ensure the highest standards of integrity and public confidence, Declaration of Interest forms were collected from all the external contributors. Declared interests of the external contributors were reviewed and assessed for the relevance and significance of the interest and only those experts who did not have relevant or significant interest, were invited to participate in the meeting or activity, as per the Declaration of Interest policy of WHO. What does this benchmark cover? This document is structured in three parts: \u0082background: an overview of the development and fundamental concepts of AM; \u0082training in anthroposophic medicine: the learning outcomes required for each component of each AM discipline; and \u0082safety issues: the general precautions and contraindications related to use of anthroposophic medicinal products (AMP) and anthroposophic therapeutic practice. These three parts constitute a complete set of benchmarks for training in AM. xi Who is this benchmark for? By setting norms and standards, this document provides the minimum training requirements for health workers to practise any of the AM disciplines. It is a useful reference point with which actual practice can be compared and evaluated, which will benefit policy-makers, health workers, education providers and the public in general. Kim Sungchol Head, Unit of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine Department of Integrated Health Services World Health Organization 1 1 Background Definition AM is an integrative, whole medical system that extends conventional medicine with the cognitive methods and results of anthroposophy. AM regulates the interactions of the living body, soul and spirit, according to each person's biography and social and environmental context. It includes treatments and therapies to activate self-healing with medications, nursing, counselling, psychotherapy and anthroposophic arts, movement and body therapies. History The principles of AM were established by the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) and the Dutch physician Ita Wegman (1876-1943) (10,11) . The development of AM is summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Timeline of anthroposophic medicine 1920-1925 Founding of anthroposophic medicine 1920 - First of several anthroposophic courses for physicians 1921 - Establishment of small anthroposophic hospitals in Germany and Switzerland 1921 - Development of anthroposophic nursing practices and rhythmical massage 1921 - Production of first medicines according to anthroposophic principles 1921 - Eurythmy therapy initiated 1924 - Anthroposophic \"curative education\" and social therapy for individuals with developmental disabilities initiated 1925 - First AM textbook, \"Fundamentals of therapy\" (11) , published by Steiner & Wegman 1925-2000 Further development and expansionFurther development of AM therapies. Range of AMP extended. Basic and clinical research developed 1939 - Camphill movement for individuals with developmental disabilities founded in Scotland, which later spread to 65 countries 1960s-1990s - Founding of hospitals in which AM is integrated with conventional medicine in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom 1976 - German Medicine Act 1976 ( Arzneimittelgesetz ) recognizes \"special therapy systems\", including AM, and begins regulating AMPs 1983 - University of Witten/Herdecke (Germany) founded from the anthroposophic integrative hospital Herdecke 2000-present Academization and integration into health systemsExtension of AM training throughout Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australasia and Eastern Europe International coordination and consensus statements on best practice, training and research Professorships in AM in Brazil, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland; inclusion of AM training in various universities worldwide Increasing numbers of studies and scientific publications on AM Countries include AM into their national health systems; e.g. Brazil and Switzerland2 AM is practised today in primary, secondary and tertiary care settings ranging from single and multidisciplinary group practices, rehabilitation centres, nursing homes, community nursing services and sanatoriums to anthroposophic hospitals, public hospitals and university medical centres (12,13) . The AM approach is practised in integration with conventional Western medicine and used in conjunction with nearly all medical specialties, including internal medicine, family medicine, oncology, paediatrics, psychiatry, gynaecology and obstetrics and dermatology. Anthroposophic understanding of the human being and nature Anthroposophy describes how abilities can be developed from a simple sensorial stage to higher levels of perception through empirical observation of the physical and spiritual characteristics of human beings and nature. Steiner saw anthroposophic spiritual science as application of scientific methods in the realm of non-sensory reality and a consequential development of western thought, particularly the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle and German idealism as represented by Goethe, Schiller, Fichte, Hegel and Schelling (13,14) . Fundamental concepts in understanding the human being Understanding of the human being in anthroposophy is based on the principles of fourfold formative forces and the threefold nature of the human being. The four formative forces of the human being In addition to the molecular, biochemical mechanisms active in nature, anthroposophy describes higher-order forces that constitute the so-called formative forces or organizational members of the human being ( Wesensglieder in German) (13,14) . These formative forces are discovered through insight and practice. The concepts are applied according to Steiner's observations and suggestions and have been further developed by others (14,15) . Four formative forces are observed in the human being (Table 2). The terms used here are the classic ones used by Steiner and should be considered in their historical context (for a thorough description, see Bibliography): 1. Physical organization: the physical human body, consisting of physical matter and physicochemical interactions 2. Etheric organization (formative life forces): a higher-level force system that forms the physical body and maintains the integration of material substances into living organisms, such as plants, animals or humans. The etheric organization is responsible for growth and regeneration and is central to restoring health. 3. Astral organization (formative soul forces): a higher level of organization and system of forces above etheric organization that brings about the emergence of consciousness, feelings, instincts as well as movement, respiration and other body functions in animals and humans. These functions emerge as the astral organization imprints itself into the etheric organization and from there into the physical organization. 4. \"I\"-organization (formative forces of the human spirit): the \"I\" provides the capacity for thinking, self-consciousness, introspection, freedom and development of art and culture. In addition to the conscious \"I\", \"I\"-organization acts as a higher-level system in the human organism, in particular through warmth organization, physical and emotional uprightness and close interconnections with the blood system. These functions emerge as the \"I\"-organization imprints itself into the astral organization and from there into the etheric and physical organizations.3 Table 2. Formative forces in nature and human beings Mineral Plant Animal Human Internalized formative forces Spirit \"I\"-organization Soul Soul Astral organization Life Life Life Etheric organization Matter Matter Matter Matter Physical organization Adapted from reference (14) Threefold nature of the human organism The interactions of the four formative forces lead to a functional polarity in the human organism between the catabolic processes necessary for the emergence of consciousness and more anabolic, regenerative processes. This functional polarity is held in balance through rhythmical processes (17,18) (Table 3): 1. Neurosensory system: the dynamic that prevails in the nervous and sensory system but is also found in all processes related to form, structure, catabolic activity, consciousness and thinking 2. System of metabolism and limbs: the dynamic that prevails in the digestive system and the limbs to processes related to movement, metabolism, regeneration, anabolic activity, reproduction and volition (will) 3. Rhythmic system: the dynamic that prevails in the circulatory and respiratory system and all rhythmical processes of human life and feeling. Rhythmical processes such as sleep and waking, breathing and cardiovascular rhythms and many others allow mediation between the polarities of the two other systems. The rhythmic system mediates between catabolic and anabolic processes. Table 3.

Imbalances and disorders in the formative forces and the threefold nature lead to disease. The equilibrium of the four formative forces undergoes characteristic changes during a lifetime. The immortality of the human spirit (\"I\") provides a perspective of development beginning before birth and extending beyond the moment of death. Practice of anthroposophic medicine The practice of AM comprises the following assessments: conventional medical assessment and diagnosis, determination of imbalances and disorders of the four formative forces and threefold nature of the individual and how the disease reflects the context of the individual's biographical experience. Treatment plans are individualized or according to the pathology to restore balance in the four formative forces and the threefold nature and to support salutogenesis and activate 4 the individual's innate self-healing capacity. A multimodal treatment strategy is established, which includes providing AM in combination with conventional western medicine as indicated and sometimes other TCI methods (18) . It also includes voluntary vaccination to prevent life-threatening diseases (19) . The idea that the experience of disease may be a turning point for inner and biographical development is an important aspect of support to the individual (16) . Individual autonomy, dignity and self- determined inner development and establishing a trusting therapeutic relationship are core values of AM. Anthroposophic treatment modalities include counselling, use of medications, nursing care, psychotherapy, arts therapy, eurythmy therapy and body therapies. Various health workers collaborate and work with the individual, family and caregivers. One physician usually coordinates treatment. The collaboration includes deciding which AM (or other TCI) therapies are the most relevant, based on the medical condition and individual preferences. The physician also ensures that both conventional and AM treatments are provided as indicated. Anthroposophic medicinal products are medicinal products that are conceived, developed and produced in accordance with the anthroposophic knowledge of the human being, nature, substance and pharmaceutical processing. Starting materials may be prepared from mineral, botanical, zoological or chemical substances. AMPs are prepared from mineral, plant, animal or chemical sources by specific anthroposophic and standard homeopathic manufacturing methods, as described in official pharmacopoeias1 and in the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex (20) . Regulations applied to anthroposophic medicinal products may vary from country to country and by the types of products. 1 The Swiss Pharmacopoeia defines anthroposophic preparations and their manufacturing methods. The European Pharmacopoeia and the German Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia describe manufacturing methods and substances used in anthroposophic preparations. The Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex describes manufacturing methods and substances used traditionally in AM and is recognized by the Australian and Brazilian medicines agencies.5 2 Training in anthroposophic medicine 2.1 Overview of training in anthroposophic medicine AM training programmes are specific for each discipline (i.e. physicians, nurses, pharmacists etc.). The three entrance categories are (Table 4): Category 1 - no prior health-care training . People with no prior training in health care must first receive training in conventional health care before being eligible for AM training, or they may undertake a training programme that integrates conventional and AM. This does not apply to eurythmy therapy or anthroposophic arts therapy, which are taught independently. Category 2 - prior training in conventional health care . People with prior training in health care can begin AM training specific to their discipline. Category 3 - prior training in TCI . Depending on the TCI profession and the extent of training, candidates may enter AM training or receive credits for their prior training. Table 4.

Anthroposophic training of physicians, pharmacists, dentists, nurses, midwives and pharmacists includes the safety of AMPs for internal and external use according to knowledge of botany and phytopharmacology. Anthroposophic body therapists are trained in the safety of AMPs for external use. Training also includes inquiry into the individual's use of conventional, AM and other TCI treatments for consideration of potential interactions and side-effects. The training includes understanding of the effects, dosage, types of therapy, possible side-effects, precautions, drug interactions and contraindications of AMPs. AM practitioners are expected to take a medication history, including hypersensitivity, previous adverse drug reactions and use of other medications, as appropriate, know where to obtain up-to-date information on AMP safety, know how to engage patients and their families (24) , know how to deal with side-effects and know how to report adverse drug reactions as part of pharmacovigilance in accordance with the regulations applied to the anthroposophic medicinal products in the country (21,25,26) or patient safety incident reporting and learning systems. Examples of sources of information on the safety of AMPs are mandated safety information (such as manufacturers' packet inserts) and the Vademecum of anthroposophic medicines , which describes AMPs and their use based on systematic collection of therapeutic experiences from physicians with specialised training in AM worldwide and is available in several languages (27) . The safety of medicines for external applications by nurses is available online ( www.vademecum.org ). All the appropriate sources available should be consulted for safety information, including reports of studies in phytomedicine. AM practitioners should be aware of known side-effects and monitor the individual for possible adverse reactions, which are rare potentially known or unknown side-effects of AMPs (12,21,22) . The quality of finished AMPs is assured by appropriate adherence of AMP manufacturers to the recognized pharmacopoeias (20) and to the requirements of good manufacturing practice (28,29) . Pharmacists with specialised training in anthroposophic pharmacy should observe the quality requirements applicable to compounding in their country when preparing of AMPs for an individual client, and other practitioners licensed to compound medications (depending on legislation) should observe the same requirements.24 3.2 Patient safety, general precautions and contraindications to anthroposophic therapeutic practice All AM training programmes include patient safety as applicable to anthroposophic therapeutic practice, building on the basic patient safety concepts and principles, including safety culture, hand hygiene, medication safety, patient safety incident reporting and learning systems, risk management, effective teamwork and communication, among others (30,31) . Practitioners of anthroposophic nursing, midwifery and anthroposophic body therapy should be aware of and observe the indications, precautions and contraindications of external applications in certain risk groups, including pregnant women and in people with skin conditions such as open wounds, skin infections and reduced skin sensitivity (32,33) . In addition, practitioners of anthroposophic body therapy that includes hydrotherapy (e.g. oil dispersion bath therapy) should be aware of and observe general precautions and contraindications to hydrotherapy such as safety screening for infections, physiological effects of immersion, risks related to fear of water (34).25 References 1.
