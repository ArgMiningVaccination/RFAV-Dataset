Today, we are pleased to share that UHealth, the University of Miami Health System, will be receiving a limited quantity of vaccines for distribution to University students beginning Monday, April 12. Below are specific details and helpful resources so you know what to expect. Please read this email carefully and in its entirety. YOU MUST SIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE VACCINE Students interested in receiving the vaccine through UHealth must opt in through CaneLink and should do so as soon as possible. The opt-in process is now live on the left-hand side of [CaneLink's full site ](https://click.connect.miami.edu/?qs=a7f7376194e8f85ff1eef2a65452fc883d5c14f0da2a77f54f352e8bca9137ac57252160c90a58e700bb926e97bc5be141168fd172b46ebf) (not within CaneLink's Student Center). Students who have opted in will be assigned a phase. Once vaccines are available for the assigned phase, students will receive text and/or email messages inviting them to schedule an appointment. Once you have opted in, no further action is needed until you receive the notification to schedule an appointment; you do not need to call or email us to check on your eligibility status. It is important to note that UHealth's vaccine supply is limited and not all students who opt in are guaranteed to receive an appointment. Please be patient through this process. UHealth receives vaccines from the state only sporadically and must take a phased approach to scheduling vaccines based on that supply. We strongly encourage students interested in receiving a vaccine to also utilize community resources. Additional information about those resources appears below. WHICH VACCINE WILL I RECEIVE? Students will receive the vaccine available at the time of their appointment. The specific vaccine available will depend upon the supply provided by the state. When you make your vaccine appointment you will be asked to confirm that you will be in South Florida to receive your second dose at the appropriate time\u2014for the Pfizer vaccine that is 21 days after the first dose, for the Moderna vaccine that is 28 days after the first dose. Only one vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, is a single-dose vaccine. STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT FLORIDA RESIDENTS University of Miami students who are not Florida residents do qualify to receive the vaccine as \"seasonal residents.\" All students, regardless of residence, will need to bring a government-issued ID, 'Cane Card, and smartphone with daily symptom checker completed. REMOTE LEARNING STUDENTS Remote learning students who opt in to receive the vaccine will be required to test for COVID-19 prior to their appointment. Remote learning students who opt in will receive a separate communication with details about the testing requirement. Remote learning students who currently reside outside of Florida should utilize community resources in their home state to receive the vaccine. LOCATIONS FOR VACCINES All students on the Coral Gables, Marine, and Medical campuses will be scheduled to receive their COVID-19 vaccine at the Herbert Wellness Center (1241 Dickinson Drive, Coral Gables). Please do not come to this location for this purpose until you have been emailed an invitation and been scheduled to receive your vaccination. WHAT TO BRING On the day of your vaccine, bring your government-issued ID, your 'Cane Card, and a smartphone with proof of completed symptom checker. If you are coming for your second dose, bring your CDC vaccination record card, your government-issued ID, your 'Cane Card, and a smartphone with proof of completed symptom checker. You will receive your second dose at the same location where you received your first vaccine. AVAILABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCES Because we do not know how many vaccines and the timeline when they will be available at UHealth, we strongly encourage students to utilize community resources, such as Walgreens, Publix, CVS, and other local pharmacies where you may be able to get vaccinated much sooner.

TESTING STILL REQUIRED Students who are vaccinated must still comply with mandatory University COVID-19 testing. CONTINUED PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES Fully vaccinated individuals should still wear masks, physically distance in public, and avoid crowds. Use of the Daily Symptom Checker is still required and masks must be worn on all University of Miami campuses.
