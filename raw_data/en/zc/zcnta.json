While Renewable Materials embraces the broad scope of raw material resources studied under the degree program, it has been found to be ambiguous/nonspecific and extremely difficult to communicate to prospective students (i.e., high school juniors and seniors) and their parents; a very common response to the name of Renewable Materials is \"what is that?\" Furthermore, the degree name Renewable Materials created a significant divergence from the primary industry served by the program -forest products -and conflicts with how the industry is identified by other state entities (e.g., Idaho Forest Products Commission, Idaho Department of Commerce, Idaho Department of Labor). Another rational given for the name change to Renewable Materials was that it would increase enrollment by attracting students not otherwise attracted to a program named Forest Products. Enrollment growth did not result from the name change; in fact, it declined. Name Change: The proposed change to Forest and Sustainable Products returns the degree name back to its roots and makes it consistent with the primary industry it serves. The inclusion of sustainable products captures elements of the program that investigate the use and commercialization of other streams of raw materials (e.g., bamboo, hemp, recycled wood and paper). The name is much more identifiable to orosoective students and their parents.

April 18, 2019 The Board approved the second reading of proposed amendments to Board Policy III.G. August 29, 2019 The Board was presented with a first reading of proposed amendments to Board Policy III.G. Policy was referred back to Instruction, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) for additional discussion. October 17, 2019 The Board approved the first reading of proposed amendments, which adds baccalaureate degree programs to the list of programs reviewed by the Board and changes requirements for new academic program proposals that consists of new state appropriations. December 2019 The Board approved the second reading of proposed amendm ents to Board Policy III.G. APPLICABLE POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section III.G Postsecondary Program Approval and Discontinuance BACKGROUND /DISCUSSION Board Policy III. G., Postsecondary Program Approval and Discontinuance , provides Idaho's public institutions with procedures for the development, approval, and discontinuation of academic and career technical programs , includ ing instructional and administrative units . Currently, Board po licy requires completion of a proposal form and approval of modifications to existing academic programs, career technical program s, and instructional and administrative units . These include , but are not limited to, the following program modifications : Expansion of an existing program outside a designated service region Converting one program option into a stand -alone program Consolidating an existing program to create one or more new programs Adding a degree or certificate program not already approved b y the Board INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 IRSA TAB 3 Page 2 Adding courses that represent a significant departure from existing program offerings or method of delivery from those already evaluated and approved by the Board. Transitioning existing programs to an online format. Changes from clock hours to credit hours or vice versa, or substantial increase or decrease in the length of a program or number of clock or credit hours awarded for successful completion of program. Modification of existing programs as provided above resulting from Program Prioriti zation . Reorganizing, merging , and bifurcating existing instructional and administrative units , including moving programs and resources. Due to current unprecedented conditions and Program Prioritization processes occurring on some campuses, institutions need more streamlined procedures to implement these types of modifications. Staff evaluated Board Policy III.G and identified that procedures could be clarified and proposal requirements for modifications could be simplified . Upon further review of policy III.G., staff noted other areas will also require revision. Rather than modify only portions of Boa rd policy , staff believes that an entire review and revision will be necessary . Additionally, any potential changes will require further discussion with the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs and the Committee on Instruction, Research and Student Affairs before moving forward with amendments . While those discussions take place and to provide institutions with some immediate assistance , Board approval is requested to temporarily waive the proposal requirement in policy III. G.3.d and 4.d for modifications to academic programs, career technical program s, and instructional and administrative unit s through June 30, 2021 . The exception to this waiver will be the e xpansion of existing program offerings outside an institution's designated service region, as defined in Board Policy III.Z. Those types of modif ications will continue to require a full program proposal and will be subject to the review and approval process per III.G. In place of full proposals for the other types of modifications , institutions will supply a letter of request for app roval by the Executive Director, provided that the fiscal impact is below $250,000 per fiscal year consistent with policy. The Executive Director will retain the right to request full proposals for modifications as he deems necessary. New programs, discontinuation of programs, and inactivation of programs w ill continue to require a program proposal or letter of request , as per policy, and will follow the regular process. IMPACT Approval of the waiver will allow staff to implement temporary procedures for modifications , and alleviate some burdensome processes for institutions and staff . The waiver will also provide the opportunity to ga uge if current procedures and practices could be more streamlined in the long-term. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 IRSA TAB 3 Page 3 ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Board Policy III.Z, Planning and Delivery of Postsecondary Education STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Staff is conducting an audit of Board Policy III.G . and has identified several policy requirements that warrant further discussion with the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs (CAAP) and the Instruction, Research and Student Affairs Committee . Implementin g this temporary waiver will provide time for staff to conduct a thorough review of the policy and will provide institutions with flexibility in implementing progr ammatic or structural modifications in light of current unprecedented conditions and budget challenges . Staff will work with CAAP to develop a process for sharing program modifications with institutions as part of this waiver . The proposed temporary waiver was discussed with the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs on May 14, 2020 and with the Instruction, Research, and Student Affairs Committee on May 28 , 2020 . Board staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION I move to waive the requirement for a full proposal in Board Policy III.G.3.d and 4.d for modifications to academic programs, career technical programs, and instructional and administrative units until June 30, 2021 . In lieu of a full program proposal requirement, institutions will use the letter of notification process during this time period.

Admission Standards - Waiver of College Entrance Exam Admission Requirement REFERENCE December 2008 Information item presented to Board on the formation of a Task Force to examine alternative approaches for placement of students into first-year writing courses (English 90, 101, and 102) . December 2010 Waiver of Board Policy III.Q.4.C., for placement in entry -level college English courses to permit pilots to establish alternative placement mechanisms for English. February 2013 The Board approved a waiver of Board Policy III.Q.4.c to permit alternative placement mechanisms that are in alignment with the Complete College Idaho plan until the beginning of Fall 2014. February 2014 The Board approved a waiver of Board Policy III.Q.4.c until the beginning of Fall 2015 to permit the continued development of alternative placement mechanisms. October 2015 The Board extended the waiver of the criteri a in Board policy III.Q.4.c for placement in entry -level college courses one final time to allow for the creation and adoption of alternative placement mechanisms until the end of the Fall semester 2016. March 2020 The Board waived the college entrance exam as graduation requirement for students graduating in 2020 as a response to the coronavirus pandemic. APPLICABLE POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section III.Q, BACKGROUND /DISCUSSION Board Policy III.Q. Admission Standards provides the minimum requirements for admission to Idaho's public colleges and universities. Institutions have established policies that meet the minimum admission standards; however, institutions may establish standards that exceed Board approved minimum standards . The College of Eastern Idaho, College of Southern Idaho, College of Western Idaho and North Idaho College are exempted from certain provisions of the policy when established by their local boards of trustees. None of these two -year colleges currently require a college entrance exam sco re for admissions decisions. At the Board's March 27, 2020 meeting, the Board approved a waiver of the college entrance exam graduation requirement in IDAPA 08.02.03.105 for students INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10 , 2020 IRSA TAB 4 Page 2 graduating in 2020 . Currently, Board Policy III.Q.4.a, requires all students to submit a college entrance exam score as a requirement for regular admission to the four - year institutions . Acceptable college entrance exams include the American College Test (ACT) , the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) , and/or other standardized diagnostic tests as determined by the institution. In light of the national pandemic crisis and the resulting cancelation of the national test days by College Board and ACT(?) , a waiver of the college entrance exam admissions requirement for students seeking admission to Idaho institutions for the 2020 -2021 academic year is necessary to provide immediate assistance to impacted Idaho students . IMPACT Approval of the wa iver will allow institutions flexibility to determine whether to require college entrance exam scores or not, as the policy allows institutions to implement admissions standards that exceed minimum s tandards. This action by the Board will allow institutions to provide prospective Idaho students with clear expectations regarding admission requirements for the 2020 -2021 academic year . ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Board Policy III.Q. Admissions Standards STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The proposed waiver was discussed with the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs and was supported at their May 14, 2020 meeting. If the Board approves the waiver, some Idaho institutions may choose to not require college entrance exam scores from students seeking admission in the 2020 -2021 academic year. These s tudents will still be required to meet other college entrance require ments as set forth by Board and institutional policies , including the requirement to submit college entrance exam scores if so required by an institution . The proposed temporary waiver was presented to the Instruction, Research and Student Affairs Committee on May 28 , 2020 . Staff recommends approval.

BACKGROUND /DISCUSSION The purpose of Board Policy III.Z . is to ensure all of Idaho's public postsecondary institutions meet the educational and wo rkforce needs of the state through program planning, alignment, collaboration and coordination , and to meet the statutory requirement to \"as far as practicable prevent wasteful duplication of effort\" by the institutions. Board Policy III.Z . outlines the process and procedures for planning and delivery of Statewide and Regional Programs . As part of this process, institutions are required to submit to the Board office plans for the proposed delivery of Statewide and Regional Programs over a three -year perio d. The three -year plan is updated and approved by the Board annually at its August Board meeting. This is accomplished according to a schedule developed by Board staff. Updated plans were in progress and scheduled for submission in March of 2020 . In light of the COVID -19 pandemic and recent impacts to institution budgets and state funding, institutions have identified a need to reevaluate program plans to align with budget realities . To meet a request for flexibility by the institutions during this unpreced ented time , Board approval is requested to waive the requirement that INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10 , 2020 IRSA TAB 5 Page 2 three year plans be reviewed and approved at the August Board meeting this year , as provided i n Board Policy II I.Z. IMPACT Approval of the waiver will provide institutions the additional time necessary to reevaluate projected programs and make adjustments based on current funding and needs . ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Board Policy III.Z., Planning and Delivery of Postsecondary Programs and Courses STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The three-year plan is intended to serve as the foundation for advis ing and inform ing the Board in their efforts to coordinate educational programs throughout the state. This waiver w ill postpone the requirement for institutions to update their plans in 2020 with proposed new programs. The updated plan would have added projections for the 2024 -25 academic year and updated plans for the 2022 -23 and 2023 -24 academic years. If the Board appr oves the waiver, t he current three-year plans approved by the Board at their August 2019 meeting will remain in effect and provide projected programs for the 2020 -21 academic year at each institution . The Council on Academic Affairs and Programs intends to continue discussion regarding program planning, in particular for the statewide cybersecurity initiative, with the goal of resuming three -year planning for the next academic year. Even with this waiver in place, institutions will continue active program planning and adaptation in their response to the pandemic. Additionally, staff notes that a work group of the Council on A cademic Affairs and Programs is evaluating Board Policy I II.Z. holistically as a directive from the Presidents Leadership Council, to determine if amendments or clarification are necessary to promote and encourage collaboration of programs among institutions . Potential amendments may generate modifications to the foundation of program planning moving forward . The proposed temporary waiver was discussed with the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs on May 14, 2020 ; and with the Instruction, Research and Student Affairs Committee on May 28 , 2020 . Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION I move to waive the requirement in Board Policy III.Z.2.a. i. that the three year plan be reviewed and approved by the Board at the August 2020 Board meeting.

Higher Education Research BACKGROUND /DISCUSSION Board Policy III.W . Higher Education Research recognizes the significant role research plays in innovation, economic development and enhanced quality of educational programs . By developing and leveraging the state's unique research expertise and strengths, Idaho's universities and college s serve as catalyst s to spur the creation of new knowledge, technologies, products , and industries. This in turn lead s to new advances and opportunities for economic growth. The Board's Higher Education Research Council (HERC) provides recommendations to the Board regarding statewide collaborative effort s and initiatives to accomplish these goals and objectives. In addition, HERC provides direction for and oversees the use of the limited resources allocated by the Board for higher education research by promoting research acti vities that will have the greatest beneficial effect on the quality of education and the economy of the state. The Statewide S trategic Plan for R esearch assist s in the identification of research areas that will enhance the economy of Idaho through the col labora tion of academia, industry, and government and ensures efforts are in alignment with identified areas of strength at our public universities . The most recent changes to the strategic plan were approved by the Board in December 2016. The plan represents the role Idaho's research universities play in driving innovation, economic development, and enhancing the quality of educational programs in strategic areas. The plan identifies areas of strength among Idaho's INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 IRSA TAB 6 Page 2 research universities, research ch allenges and barriers facing the universities , research opportunities Idaho should capi talize upon to further build its research base , goals to build the research pipeline through engaging undergraduate students , and steps for achieving the research vision for Idaho's universities. Additional responsibilities of HERC include the management of the Incubation Fund and HERC Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM) Fund programs, disbursement of Infrastructure Funds , and the oversight of matching funds for our Idaho Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR ) Track 1 project (Managing Idaho's Landscapes for Ecosystem Services) . Additional responsibilities include re ceiving annual reporting on the institutions ' activities in relation to the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) . Incubation Fund projects are single -year projects that are at the proof -of-concept stage. Through a competitive process, HERC awards funds to those projects where the principal investigator can rapidly move their proje ct into the development stage. IGEM Fund projects are those that are designed to develop spin -off companies. While these awards may be for up to three years, the funding is contingent upon successful progress as determined by HERC at an annual r eview of the project. CAES is a research and education consortium between the three Idaho public research institutions (Boise State University, Idaho State University, University of Idaho), the Idaho National Laboratory, and the University of Wyoming. IMPACT Taking a strategic approach to i nvest in the state's unique research expertise and strengths will lead to new advances and opportunities for economic growth and enhance Idaho's reputation as a national and international leader in excellence and innova tion. This update will provide the Board with t he opportunity to provide input to the Higher Education Research Council on areas of focus and strategic direction.

The universities and colleges of Idaho's system of higher education understand the need for greater collaboration in order to be competitive in today's global environment. Recognizing the need to focus on and emphasize existing strengths and opportunities in Idaho's research community, the vice presidents for research and economic development developed the following statewide strategic plan for research to ensure the greatest potential for achieving a vital and sustainable research base for Idaho. The strategic plan identifies the key research areas (basic, translational and clinical) that will become the focal points for research and economic development through partnering among academia, industry and government in science , technology , and creative activity . Research is fundamental to the mission of a university due to its role in knowledge discovery and in providing new ideas for technology commercialization via patents, copyright, licenses and startup companies. University faculty who engage in research and creative activity are at the leading edge of their respective fields. Research also enhances the national rep utation of the faculty and the universities. These faculty and their vibrant research programs attract the best graduate and undergraduate students by providing unique cutting - edge learning experiences in their research laboratories, studios, field sites and classrooms. On the most basic level, and also bolstered through collaborative, interdisciplinary and interprofessional research, such activities strengthen a university's primary product \u2014 innovative, well - educated students ready to enter a competitive workforce. Research is the foundation of a university's economic development role. The influx of research dollars from external grants and contracts creates new jobs at the university, along with the attendant purchases of supplies, services, materials and equipment. The results of the research are new knowledge, INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 2new ideas, and new pro cesses, which lead to patents, startup companies , more efficient businesses as well as a highly trained workforce prepared to tackle 21st century challenges. Idah o's research universities have strengths and opportunities for economic development in 1) Energy Systems , 2) Natural Resource Utilization and Conservation, 3) Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences, 4) Novel Materials and 5) Systems Engineering and Cybersecurity . By focusing collaborative efforts in these areas, the research universities will expand research success by: Helping Idaho institutions focus on their research strengths; Strengthening collaboration among Idaho institutions; Creating research and development opportunities that build relationship s between universities and the private sector; Contributing to the economic development of the State of Idaho; Enhancing learning and professional development through research and scholarly activity - also by promoting interdisciplinary and inter -professional research; and Build ing and improv ing the research infrastructure of Idaho universities to meet curren t and future research needs. This statewide Strategic Research Plan for Idaho Higher Education is a tool for identifying and attaining quantifiable goals for research and economic growth and success in Idaho. The plan will be reviewed and updated annually as needed amid the fast- changing pace of research discovery.

INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 6RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES Idaho's research universities have developed statewide strengths in strategic research areas that have great potential to drive future economic growth and success. The criteria used to select these areas include: number of faculty and qualifications; peer - reviewed publications and impact; infrastructure (facilities, equipment, information technology, staff); external grant and contract funding; academic programs; student involvement; potential benefit to the State o f Idaho; and technology transfer activity, including patents, licenses, and startup companies. By focusing collective research efforts and resources in these areas, the universities will be on the most efficient and effective route to research success and state- wide economic development. These high impact areas include 1) Energy Systems , 2) Natural Resource Utilization and Conservation, 3) Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences, 4) Novel Materials, and 5) Systems Engineering and Cybersecurity. Energy Systems: Energy is a critical driver of any economy. The projected increases in the population of the world and increases in the standard of living will produce severe strains on the ability to meet the demands of the next few decades. In additi on, finite reserves of fossil fuels and pollution from their combustion requires that alternative sources of energy production be developed. The combination of natural resources in Idaho and presence of the Idaho National Laboratory makes energy a natural area of emphasis. Indeed, the three universities with research capabilities already have extensive research projects in this area. The Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) is an example of the significant investment the three Idaho universities , the University of W yoming, and the Idaho National Laboratory have made to develop expertise in nuclear science and engineering , materials science and engineering , energy systems design and analysis, fossil carbon conversion, geological systems and applications, energy policy and cybersecurity, and environmental and resource sustainability . Further growth in these areas not only takes advantage of the strong base but strongly supports a positive economic impact through new markets for new product development Natural Resource Utilization and C onservation: In the broad field of natural resource utilization and conservation, Idaho's universities have expertise in water resources, wildfire management and restoration, agriculture, forestry, recreation, and geophysics and geochemical detection , geog raphical information systems, and monitoring of groundwater pollutants. For example, university geologists, ecologists, and policy experts are collaborating on broad- ranging research projects that examine and predict the impact of climate change on Idaho's water resources. As water is essential to agriculture, recreation, the ecosystem, and human health, the universities have research strength in an area of tremendous societal and economic impact. Agriculture remains an important part of the economy of Idaho. Development of new biomic varieties with improved resistance to disease and climate change remain an area of importance as does the development of new feeds for domestic fish production. The often competing demands for preservation and exploitation put on the environment require understanding of the various ecosystems in the state and region as well as societal , human health, and INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 7economic impact s of policy decisions. Recent national research imperatives, as particularly captured in National Science Foundation's Innovation at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) foundation- wide program and the Department of Energy's report Water -Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities increasingly require multi- sectoral, multi -disciplinary approaches to problems in natural resource utilization and conservation. The depth and breadth of relevant research expertise in the biophysical, rural health and social science fields within Idaho's universities underscores an opportunity that a national emphasis on food, energy, and water security provides. Provided that enhanced coordination and collaboration between Idaho's universities can be successfully executed, we are particularly well -placed to exhibit national and international leadership at the nexus of food, energy, water system research. The future economic success of the state will rely on a deep understanding of these processes. Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences : Idaho's universities have well -established research programs in selected areas of bi ological and biomedical sciences . University microbiologists and informatics experts, for example, study real -time change in pathogenic microorganisms that enable them to become resistant to drugs and chemical toxins thus resulting in worsening human disease and mortality rates. These effects are not restricted to humans, domestic and wild animals as well as food plants and trees are experiencing the same phenomena. Also, weeds are becoming resistant to herbicides. These phenomena are having a significant negative impact on Idaho's agriculture and forests. Further stress is being put on these important commercial sectors through climate variability. Research in these areas is critical for preserving important economic sectors of Idaho's economy while addressing future global needs. The public health infrastructure in rural Idaho is not well understood but is potentially the most fragile aspect of the state's health care system. The rural environment, especially typical in Idaho where agriculture, manufacturing, and fishing are important or dominant parts of the economy, presents extraordinary threats to health. Agriculture brings the use of pesticides and herbicides as well as heavy and potentially dangerous machinery. Manufacturing - depending on the type - is a consistently hazardous industry, and employees involved in fishing and forestry are at much higher risks of trauma. Healthcare and in particular a focus on rural health, provides significant opportunit ies for economic development in Idaho. Partnerships with private entities in th e healthcare industry, funding though the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies utilize the natural laboratory of Idaho's rural population. Idaho's universities' contributions towards this emerging area of scholarship will add to the global competitiveness of the United States and the State. Novel Materials: The global materials industry is worth an estimated $550 billion, conservatively. Materials revolutionize our lives by offering advanced performance and new possibilities for design and usage. For example, the market for biocompatible materials has grown from a few to $60B in the past decade. Market size is growing for materials in emerging areas such photonic materials, electronic and dielectric materials, functional coatings, and g reen materials. Materials research in Idaho is conducted by a wide range of scientists in diverse fields. Across the state, faculty members in Biology, Chemistry, Geosciences, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering , INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 8Nuclear Engineeri ng and Materials Science and Engineering conduct research on improving and developing new materials. Current materials researchers in Idaho cover a broad spectrum of specializations, including semiconductor device reliability, microelectronic packaging, shape memory alloys, DNA machinery, environmental degradation, materials for extreme environments, biomaterials and bio- machinery, materials characterization, and materials modeling. Nanoscale materials and devices, functional materials and their uses and materials for energy applications are a focus of research throughout the state. These areas of research are highly synergistic with local industries and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Access to materials characterization equipment and processing laboratories has resulted in collaborations with small businesses and start -up companies. Systems Engineering and Cybersecurity : Device control , information management , and cybersecurity are an essential part of 21 st century life and, therefore, are an important part of educational requirements. For instance, large amounts of sensitive data are collected, processed, and stored electronically but must be accessed and moved in order to have any impact. In fact, many systems are computer controlled through networks. These include such things as the electric transmission grid and transportation in major cities. The universities are beginning to develop research expertise in software development and data management lifecycle design and operations and secure and dependable system design and operations. This area provides a significant area of opportunity for positive economic impact in Idaho , partnerships with the Idaho National Laboratory, and in improving the global competitiveness of the United States. There are already a significant number of firms in Idaho whose interests are in software development for device control, information management and processing. In addition, many of the major research projects being undertaken in the region by various state and federal agencies as well as the universities require the handling of significant amounts of data in a secure and dependable fashion. Currently, research funding in the universities from private and governmental sources is limited by the number of qualified personnel. In addition, within Idaho there is a high demand for graduates at all levels in computer science, hence workforc e development i n these areas should be a matter of urgency . EXTERNAL FACTORS: IDAHO RESEARCH ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES There are unique advantages and challenges to research in Idaho. This document seeks to provide guidance on building upon the advantages present in Idaho and address the challenges through the goals in this strategic plan. Research Advantages The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the Center for Advanced Energy Studies: Idaho is fortunate to be home to the Idaho National Laboratory, one of only 17 U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories in the U.S. The INL's unique history and expertise in nuclear energy, environmental sciences and engineering, alternative for ms INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 9of energy, and biolog ical and geological sciences and related fields provides an excellent opportunity for research collaboration with Idaho's university faculty in the sciences, engineering, business and other fields. The Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES), established at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy, is a public -private partnership that includes Idaho's research universities (Boise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Idaho ), the University of Wyom ing, and the Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), which manages the INL. The CAES partners work together to create unique educational and research opportunities that blend the talents and capabilities of Idaho's universities and the INL. A 55,000 square- foot re search facility in Idaho Falls supports the CAES energy mission with laboratory space and equipment for students, faculty, and INL staff in collaborative research projects. The State of Idaho invest s $3M per year in direct support of the three Idaho research universities . Natural Re sources: Idaho's beautiful natural resources are well known to fishermen, hunters, skiers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Through its rivers, forests, wildlife, geological formations, and rangelands, Idaho itself is a unique natural laboratory for geological, ecological, and forestry studies. Idaho is home to some of the largest tracts of remote wilderness in the lower 48 states. In addition, the proximity of Yellowstone National Park and the Great Salt Lake provide additional one of a kind opportunities for ecology and geology research. Small Population: Idaho's relatively small population of 1. 6 million people enables every group in the state to be included in research surveys, providing more accurate information than a sampling of only some groups. Intrastate Networks: The existing networks within the state, including agricultural extension services and rural health networks, provide a foundation for collecting research data from across the state, and rapidly implementing new policies and practices as a result of research discoveries. Research Challenges The goals set forth in this strategic plan are specifically designed to address challenges in Idaho. These challenges are identified below and include a description of the challenge and the goal from this strategic plan that addresses that specific challenge. Lack of Coordination Among Universities In Advancing Research and Economic Development (technology transfer): By and large the research universities have not coordinated and shared their technology transfer and economic development activities among themselves. This not only decreases each university's competitiveness at the national and state level but also increases the costs for achieving a particular goal. There is some redundancy in programs, services and infrastructure between the universities. This duplication both limits the success that any one university can achieve and increases the cost. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 10 Historical C ompetition Between Universities: One of the greatest problems with growing the research and economic development enterprise within the Idaho university arena has been the competitiveness between research universities. This problem existed at all levels within the universities themselves, extended through university administration to the state level, and was even prevalent in the press. While competition between the universities is to be expected when all are competing for a finite pot of money within the state and is even healthy at some level, the level of competition was counterproductive. The real competition that Idaho universities face is other universities in the United States when it comes to research dollars and attracting faculty and students. Economic development is also not a competition between the state universities but rather a competition with other states. Goal 1 is designed to remedy these two challenges by \"increas(ing) research at, and collaboration among Idaho universities and colleges to advance research strengths and opportunities pertaining to critical issues in Idaho, while also providing a vision for national and global impact.\" Competition from Other Universities: In research, university faculty competes nationally for grant funds from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and the Depart ment of Health and Human Services. Many other states' universities are well ahead of Idaho's universities in terms of state funding per student, patent roy alty income, endowments, etc., and are able to move ahead at a faster pace, leaving Idaho universities further behind as time goes on. Goals 1 and 2 are designed to make Idaho's research universities more competitive nationally and globally through collaboration with each other and by \"(strengthening) the relationship between state universities and the private sector.\" University Culture: Each of Idaho's research universities aspires to greater levels of achievement in research and creative activity, yet many faculty at each of the universities are not fully engaged on a national level in their respective fields. This is changing for the better under new leadership and with new research -active faculty hires at each institution, but these cultural differences remain, resulting in discomfort with change aimed at making the universities more nationally competitive. While Goal 1 urges the researchers at Idaho's universities to keep a national and global vision for their research, Goal 4 aims to enhance t he research capabilities of faculty by \"(enhancing) learning and professional development.\" Private Sector Support: Idaho has very little high- technology industry within its borders. This reduces the potential for developing an applied research initiat ive within the universities that, in many states, provides one important arm of economic development and technology transfer. This also means that it is much harder to develop those private/public partnerships that provide the universities with additional capital to construct research are technology transfer facilities. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 1 IRSA TAB 6 Page 11 The private sec tor plays a critical role in research. Goal 2 states that we will \"create research and development opportunities that strengthen the relationship between state universities and the private sector.\" Fragmented Economic Development Initiatives: There are seemingly too many economic development initiatives in Idaho and they are not well coordinated. It is imperative that state, university, and community initiatives work together toward common and agreed to goals. As it is, little progress is being made towards developing an economic strategy for the state that includes the research universities and little money has been secured to drive the economic development process. In fact, it is not uncommon to find that different entities in Idaho are competing against each other. Positive economic impact is the result of well -organized and collaborative research. It requires strategic planning and execution. Goal 3 indicates that Idaho's research universities focus on \"(contributing) to the positive economic impact of the State of Idaho.\" Conclusion This statewide Strategic Research Plan for Idaho Higher Education provides a framework to mitigate these external challenges and help Idaho institutions continue to focus on their research strengths. Overcoming the challenges discussed in this document will require enhanced cooperation between the functional groups at each Idaho university, fueled by a desire to work together towards the common goal of improving Idaho's economy for future generations.

In particular, the bias found in the Word2Vec and the GloVe word embeddings were explored. The Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings are commonly-used and their gender bias has been previously demonstrated to exist. Gender bias was argued to have been found in these embeddings by studying the cosi ne similarities of the vector word representations. Removing harmful word associations, while keeping desired word associations, from the word embeddings would eliminate gender bias. After loading the Word2Vec and GloVe data, the gender direction was defin ed, and a dataset of occupation words were projected onto that direction. The gender direction consisted of the words he and she (he-she) due the lack of multi-meaning associated with those specific gendered words. Given the gender direction and the projection of the occupation words, stereotypicality estimates were derived using word correlations. Using these techniques, gender bias was found to be present in both the Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings. Linda Choi Faculty Mentor: Dr. Zhanxian Deng, Department of Mechanical & Biomedical Engineering Research Title: Flexible Piezoelectric Force Sensor Monitoring Pianist P erformance Piano beginners need to spend their first few months on properly pressing the keyboard. Proper fingering and correct hand position e nsure that notes are played with the same rhythm, flow and power. Without a professional teacher, this practice can be challenging. In this research project, a smart glove with a flexible and in -situ Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) sensor was designed to track the force on the piano students' finger tips in real time. Compared with existing resistive, capacitive, and semiconductor force sensors, PVDF sensors are superior in accuracy, sensitivity, mechanical robustness, lightweight, and corrosion resistance. The measurement range and frequency bandwidth of the new PVDF sensor were first calibrated by using a commercial piezoelectric force sensor. The calibrated PVDF sensor was then glued on a rubber glove and tested during actual piano playing. Due to the help of this smart glove, piano students can evaluate their own INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 4performance by comparing the force measurement with the suggested data without a professional teacher. The same force sensing concept can be implemented as artificial skin of future robots. Nico le Clizzie Faculty Mentor: Dr. Lee Liberty, Department of Geosciences Research Title: Shear -wave Velocity and Seismic Response Estimates From the Southern Isoseismal Region of the 1886 Charleston Earthquake: Results From a Seismic Land Streamer System The 1886 M~7 earthquake damaged Charleston's infrastructure and killed more than 100 people. Today, ground amplification from a similar earthquake would devastate the region. For this fault mapping and site response study, we acquired 14 km of seismic data ove r five field days using a 72- channel, 90 m land streamer/accelerated weight drop system along city streets. The data collection was located within the southern isoseismal zone of the 1886 earthquake. We acquired shots every 2.5 m to obtain more than 5,000 dispersion curves and 360,000 first arrival picks. We estimate shear wave velocity (Vs) from phase velocity -frequency picks for the fundamental mode using a range of inversion approaches. We estimate p -wave velocity (Vp) by inverting first arrival picks. F or our site response analysis, we assume a two -layer velocity model that represents Holocene sediments over older strata. Because Vp results are sensitive to water saturation that crosses lithologic boundaries, we rely on Vs to map Holocene layer thickness, to estimate resonant frequencies, and to estimate ground surface amplification. We compare our Vs results to mapped geology, layer thickness derived from auger holes, and to coincident seismic reflection results that we generated from the same dataset. W e estimate Vs for Holocene sediments, late Pleistocene Wando Formation, middle Pleistocene Ten Mile Formation, and Tertiary Ashley Formation. We find the thickness of Holocene strata lies mostly at depths less than 30 m below the land surface. We suggest t hat this shallow boundary controls site amplification and that the seismic land streamer approach provides a rapid and effective high frequency site response tool for urban areas. Thomas Conrad Faculty Mentor: Dr. Don Warner, Department of Biological Scie nces Research Title: Synthesis of Small Molecule Inhibitors for Metastatic Breast Cancer Pathways As of 2019, it is predicted that 268,600 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States and of those diagnosed, 41,760 will lose their lives. More specifically, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Database (SEER) measured the 5 -year survival rate of localized breast cancer to be 99% compared to a dismal 27% for distant breast cancer. It has been studied that inflammatory cytokines (IC) activate several pathways that have been found to play an active part in promoting the metastasis of breast cancer. This prompted the creation and evaluation of small molecule inhibitors (SMI) for the target IC. Previous work using enzyme- linked immun osorbent assays (ELISA) concluded the small molecule IC- SMI-10 inhibited one of the culpable pathways. The focus of this research is to design and synthesize second generation IC -SMI- 10 analogs with greater proclivity for inhibiting the metastatic breast cancer pathway. The goal is to continue creating analogs of specifically IC -SMI-10B with a focus on determining to what degree hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are responsible for binding in the IC's active site. These developments are sought to be highly advantageous in preventing metastatic breast cancer. Kim Farrar Faculty Mentor: Dr. Michael P. Callahan , Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Research Title: Trace Analysis of Wine from 6000 BC INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 5 The Neolithic (10,000- 3,500 BC) was the age of achievement and expansion. This period represented a transition where food-collecting cultures shifted to food-producing ones, which allowed people to establish year round settlements. Many plants were domesticated including the Eurasian grape, which is be lieved to be the first grape used to ferment wine. There is an ongoing archeological dig in the Republic of Georgia to investigate the earliest winemaking and the emergence of wine culture as part of the Gadachrili Gora Regional Archaeological Project Excavations ( G.R.A.P.E.) . Sherds of pottery jars excavated from the dig site, along with corresponding soil samples, were analyzed for the presence of four characteristic grape/wine acids (tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, and by high perf ormance liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry. All four acids were detected in trace amounts in every sample; however, there was no significant difference in the amount of acids found in the sherd samples versus the soil samples. As a result, we could not verify the presence of wine in these particular archaeological sherds. Nathan Imonigie Faculty Mentor: Dr. Henry A. Charlier, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Research Title: A Potential Role for Methionine-234 in Human Carbonyl Reductase Coenzyme Binding Anthracyclines are among the most commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic agents; however, treatment is limited by cumulative -dose Carbonyl of anthracyclines to alcohol metabolites that are thought to contribute to the cardiotoxicity. For this reason, HCBR1 is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for lowering the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. A methionine in the active- site of the enzyme, M234, was identified as having the potential to interact with the anthracyclines in a manner that limits the catalytic efficiency for them. To test this hypothesis, M234 was mutated to alanine (M234A). Earlier fluorescence quenching studies revealed M234 may actually impact NADPH binding as the M234A mutant showed lowered binding affinity for NADPH. This observation led to the hypothesis that the NADP + product may also have reduced binding affinity of M234A mutant. As expected, fluorescence quenching studies confirmed that the NADP + binding affinity of M234A was significantly lower than that of the native enzyme. This finding suggests that M234 might play a role in coenzyme binding by HCBR1 and have less direct impact on anthracycline binding and orientation than originally believed. Devan Karsann Faculty Mentor: Dr. Sole Pera, Department of Computer Science Research Title : Featureless Approaches for Text Simplification Evaluation Text simplification, which involves replacing or rephrasing (section of) a document while minimizing meaning loss in order to generate simplified, i.e., easier to understand, versions of said document, has attracted researchers from both natural language processing and information retrieval domains of study. Text simplification has a direct connection to a wide range of applications, from those that demand specific reading comprehension ease, e.g., ensuring legal or medical documents are easy to read and u nderstand, to those focused on making reading materials further accessible for K -12 audiences or English language learners. Evaluating outcomes from existing text simplification techniques, in terms of pairwise correctness of label ranking predictions, is a difficult task because these techniques tend to depend upon domain specific indicators such as INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 6lexical, syntactic, morpho- syntactic, and psycholinguistic features. Our hypothesis is that we can perform pair- wise text simplification ranking in a feature less fashion by relying on state-of- the-art learning architectures. . To answer our research question and manage scope, we will use sentences (not full documents) as a case study. Thereafter, we will explore diverse techniques from baselines like Na\u00efve Bay es to well -known, state-of- the-art counterparts based on deep learning. We then will conduct an exhaustive empirical analysis on multiple datasets on feature -based and featureless strategies, in order to demonstrate the validity of our proposed approach. Lola Klamm Faculty Mentor: Dr. Marie -Anne de Graaff , Department of Biological Sciences Research Title: The Effects of Bioenergy Crop Species on Microbial Functioning With the threat of climate change, there is a growing incentive to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Soil is the largest sink of terrestrial carbon (C), and the natural processes of soil carbon sequestration could be harnessed to reduce atmospheric CO2. ardii) have the potential to sequester C since they have extensive root systems, and their cultivation involves little disturbance to the soil. Research in our lab has shown that soil C accumulation differs among cultivars of switchgrass and big bluestem. Additionally, studies have indicated that the microbial community structure and functioning can affect soil C accumulation. However, whether variation among the microbial communities of big bluestem and switchgrass cultivars could be responsible for the observed differences in soil C accumulation is still unknown. This study seeks to understand how cultivars of switchgrass and big bluestem affect microbial functional diversity across a soil depth profile. We collected 30 cm soil cores split into 3 increments from a long- term field experiment in the Fermilab National Environmental Research Park, IL. Microbial functional diversity was analyzed for samples from cultivar monocultures by exposing them to different carbon substrates, incubating, and determining respired CO2. Danielle Marquette Faculty Mentor: Dr. Jim Browning of Mechanical & Biomedical Engineering Research Title: ENVI Classification of Multispectral Images to Track Alfalfa Bloom; Comparing Two Vegetation Indices Alfalfa seed crop managers must coordinate the release of the crop's pollinators with peak alfalfa bloom to maximize seed yield. High resolution blue, green, and near infrared (NIR) imagery may provide useful information to track alfalfa blooms and better predict the optima l time to release the pollinators. This study used ENVI image analysis software classification methods to quantify blooms in NIR imagery. Two vegetation indices were applied to the images to increase the spectral separability of the flowers and to compare their accuracy. The vegetation indices are GNVI= (Green - NIR)/(Green+NIR) and FVI= (Blue/Green)*(NIR/Green). After applying the vegetation indices, regions of interest (ROI's) were selected and used as training data for ENVI's classification algorithms. Three ENVI classifications performed well at identifying and quantifying the blooms from the imagery. The classification methods are Constrained Energy Minimization, Maximum Likelihood, and Support Vector Machine. Constrained Energy Minimization with the FVI vegetation index had the highest accuracy of 98.35%. Kelly Mazur Faculty Mentor: Dr. David Pilliod , Department of Biological Sciences INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 7Research Title: Examining Standard Environmental DNA Sample Extraction and Archival Methods Use of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for detecting rare and secretive species has become an important tool for biological research and monitoring. Given the recent development of the field and the novelty of the methods employed, however, empirical testing of methods is needed. The goal of our research was to evaluate the handling of filters (used to concentrate DNA during field filtration) prior to and during the DNA extraction process. A common DNA extraction procedure involves splitting a filter sample into equal halves, with on e half processed and the other half archived by freezing (at - 20C or - 80C) in 200-proof molecular grade ethanol. Our first objective was to assess the assumption that eDNA is evenly distributed across both halves of a sample filter. This could have important implications for studies involving quantitative eDNA data. Our second objective assessed the effects freezing and storing the unextracted half of the filter on DNA yield. We tested both objectives using samples collected annually as part of another study dating back to 2012. Preliminary results of this study will be presented, including quantitative, statistical differences in DNA yield from the two halves of each filter within a year, as well as rates of degradation of DNA on stored filters across time (from 0 to 6 years). R esults of this study could help improve eDNA laboratory methods and provide insight into proper sample archival procedures, helping to safeguard eDNA archives for future use. Elena Paz Munoz Faculty Mentor: Dr. Ken Cornell , Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Research Title: MTN Knockout Attenuates Vitamin Synthesis and Global the adenine ring and ribose sugar. MTN plays an essential part of methionine and purine salvage pathways, the activated methyl cycle, autoinducer -2 production, and radical S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent reactions that are integral to vitamin synthesis. In this study, the impact of MTN activity on vitamin production and vitamin dependent metabolism were studied in E. coli strain O157:H7 wild type (WT) a nd MTN knock- out (KO) cells. Vitamins serve as cofactors for multiple pathways involved in bacterial metabolism. Proteomic studies comparing WT and KO strains have shown that the MTN KO strain expresses altered levels of enzymes involved in vitamin synthes is (thiamine, lipoate, biotin, etc.) and downstream enzymes that depend on these vitamins for activity. The results of our studies show that the activity of the biotin-containing enzyme acetyl -coA carboxylase (ACC) is reduced in the MTN KO strain. ACC is required for fatty acid biosynthesis. By biotin ELISA and western blot, we see a dramatic decrease in native biotinylation of ACC. Similarly, the activity of thiamine and lipoate dependent enzymes were also found to be reduced. We propose that loss of MTN a ctivity leads to an accumulation of 5'dADO that in turn leads to product inhibition of radical SAM reactions, thus altering global metabolism through decreases in activity of vitamin dependent enzyme steps. Since MTN is only present in microbes, not humans, and central to metabolism, it may be a good target for antibiotic development. Our studies are useful in demonstrating potential mechanisms of action for such antibiotics.

However, nature reserves are experiencing increasing amounts of human visitation each year, and it is critical to investigate how this influx in disturbance is influencing the space use, abundance, and richness of wildlife species in those reserves. We used camera trap data collected at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, to understand how the presence of humans and other environmental factors are influencing the presence and distribution of various wildlife species. We deployed 9 cameras, in three blocks, on 9 different trails and accumulated 208 active camera nights in 2018. A total of 9,692 photos were obtained of 17 different animal species. We hypothesize that the occupancy rate of species will be primarily influenced by human presence on trails within the reserve. The most commonly detected species were Collared Peccaries ( Pecari tajacu Dasyprocta 0.173 average detections pe r day across all camera sites. I will use the package \"unmarked\" in the program R to determine the influence of humans on species occupancy and richness. Alex Schweitzer Faculty Mentor: Dr. Dorsey Wanless , Department of Geosciences Research Title: Format ion of Lava Samples Collected by Three Alvin Submersible Dives at 14\u00b0N on the Mid -Atlantic Ridge In 2018, a research cruise investigated the Mid -Atlantic Ridge at 14\u00b0N. During this expedition the seafloor was mapped using the AUV Sentry and basaltic lavas were collected using the HOV Alvin . To better understand the origin of these lavas, major element compositions of 40 basaltic glasses from three Alvin dives were measured using the BSU SXFive Electron Microprobe and trace element contents were measured on 33 samples using solution ICP- MS. Trace element ratios and patterns are important tools for investigating magmatic processes because they can be used to evaluate different magmatic processes; such as the amount of melting of the Earth's mantle that produces the magma and the extents of crystallization prior to eruption. Lavas collected on dives AL4953 and AL4954 have similar Rare Earth Element patterns, but variable elemental abundances, suggesting fractional crystallization was an important process in their formation. By contrast, lavas collected on dive AL4955 have variable trace element patterns and ratios, indicating a change in the extents of mantle melting. To further investigate the differences in these compositions, we will use numerical models to quantify the percent of mantle melting and extents of crystallization that led to the formation of lavas erupted in this region. Joey Tuccinardi Facul ty Mentor: Dr. Don Warner , Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry Research Title: Synthesis of Substituted Heterocycles to Inhibit a Pro- Metastatic Cytokine While there have been significant advances in treatments for pre -metastatic breast cancer, the five- year survival rate post -metastasis remains an abysmal 27%. Systemic therapy continues to be the recommended course of treatment for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, but treatments that prevent distant metastases have yet to be discovered. Inflammatory cytokines (ICs) are small proteins involved in cell signaling that regulate inflammation and other important cellular processes. A certain IC binds to its main receptor to activate cell signaling pathways that are capable INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 9of promoting the invasive potential of cancer cells during the preliminary stages of the metastatic cascade. This has led to an interest in the development of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) that bind to and inhibit the IC responsible. Previously, an enzyme- linked immun osorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that IC -SMI-10 inhibited the expression of pSTAT3 to a significant extent, indicative of competitive inhibition of the IC binding to its main receptor. Structurally, IC- SMI-10 contains a furan core appended with two benzodioxole groups at positions 4 and 5, a nitro group at position 3, and a phenyl hydrazone moiety at position 2. The aim of this research is to optimize inhibitory activity by systematically investigating the role of each component. Thus far, the furan core has been converted to a thiophene, an N-H pyrrole, an N-Me pyrrole, and an N- PMB pyrrole to assess the importance of the heterocycle. Also, to investigate the aryl groups, Suzuki coupling reactions have been used to incorporate 3,4-alkoxy or phenol, indole, benzodioxane, and other heteroaromatic groups. carboxylic acid, , -unsaturated acids, amides, amines, and other groups has sought to explore the importance of substitution at this site. Preliminary ELISA and ITC experiments confirm molecular docking experiments that suggested the nitro group was not an important contributor to inhibition, while the length of the side chain at position 2 is significantly important, as shorter, non-conjugated chai ns exhibit little to no binding to the IC. Similarly, CSP -NMR experiments suggest IC -SMI-10 analogs bind to the IC appreciably. These and other results will be reported. Malyk Walker Faculty Mentor: Dr. Daniel Fologea , Department of Physics Research Title : Influence of Voltage Rate on the Diffusion of Organic Ions through Bilayer Lipid Membranes Tetraphenylphosphonium chloride(TPP) and Sodium Tetraphenylborate(TPB) are organic ions that are able to passively move across the membrane down the electrochemic al gradient. To further investigate the transport of organic ions through the lipid partition of a membrane, we employed artificial planar bilayer membrane bathed by electrolyte solutions. The bilayer membrane integrity was assessed from capacitance and conductance measurements. Changes in membrane permeability upon organic ion addition were monitored by recording the ionic currents in response to variable voltage ramps. Besides expected changes in membrane permeability we observed that the linearity of the I-V plots is strongly influenced by the rate of the voltage change. This is a good indication that the transmembrane transport is a diffusion limited process. In conclusion, these ions are good experimental models for helping us understand similar ionic transport processes through biological membranes. Ariel Weltner Faculty Mentor: Dr. Paul Simmonds , Department of Physics, and Micron School of Materials Science and Engineering Research Title: Analyzing the Effect of Gold Reflective Coatings on GaAs Quantu m Dot Photoluminescence Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is a method for making high purity, tensile-strained GaAs quantum dots (QDs) embedded in solid- state semiconductors. QDs, excited by electricity or lasers, emit photons characteristic of the QDs size an d composition, which may be used in tunable optoelectronic devices such as LEDs, lasers and solar cells. Understanding the light emission properties of these QDs is essential for these applications, as well as for continued QD research. Photoluminescence ( PL) is a laser -excitation technique used to determine these properties. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 10Occasionally, the PL signals from our samples are too low in intensity to be accurately detected. We will investigate whether the addition of gold coatings on the back of QD samples im proves PL emission by reflecting additional photons into the detector. To apply these reflective coatings, we first prepare the samples using a chemical wet etch process and then deposit thin gold films via physical vapor deposition. We will analyze the di fference in PL intensity between coated and noncoated samples and gauge the influence of gold deposition thickness. Donovan Wright Faculty Mentor: Dr. Clare Fitzpatrick, Department of Mechanical & Biomedical Engineering Research Title: Using a Convolutional Neural Network to Segment the Knee For this project, I will develop an algorithm to segment the knee which consists of the femur, tibia, and patella bones and their respective connected cartilage. The algorithm is based a convolutional neura l network (CNN) which will be fed two different data sets. The first data set consists of 26 MRI images of patients who had reoccurring patellar dislocation. The second data set is from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset which consists of 20 more patients. This combined total of 46 patient's MRI images will be segmented into sagittal slices with each MRI consisting of around 130 sagittal slices giving a total of 5980 sagittal slices. This number of sagittal slices will fluctuate depending on the resolution of the MR images and the type of scanner used. Once a working model is developed, I will validate and test it on more of the Osteoarthritis Initiative data set which consists of 4,796 patients. The overall objective of this project was to efficien tly segment subject -specific knee structures, and then to later develop a way of transforming these CNN generated segmentations into a 3D model. These models will ultimately be used for subject- specific finite element simulations to evaluate joint mechanic s.

These funds were used for four purposes: (1) We supported five students from the College of Western Idaho to have a research experience, (2) Three Boise State students were offered research opportunities, (3) We funded travel for two Boise State students to attend professional res earch conferences, and (4) We brought Dr. Carrie Cameron from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to the Boise State Campus. For the CWI research opportunities, Associate Professor of Biology Dusty Perkins, and Physics Instructor Stephanie S evigny at the College of Western Idaho (CWI) created an application form. All STEM department chairs and faculty at CWI were notified of the HERC Research Fellowship application, and the application was also shared directly with CWI students through email and the Math and Science Hub (MASH), a cross -disciplinary student and mentor community at CWI that supports academic engagement and success among CWI students through sharing resources and experiences in science, research and collaboration . Thirty -three students applied for the fellowship, from which five were selected for funding. All five of these HERC fellows from CWI presented at the Idaho Conference of Undergraduate Research at Boise State University in July. For the Boise State research and travel opportunities, we used the same process as reported on in our standard HERC Undergraduate Research final report. Dr. Cameron visited with Boise State faculty, students, and administrators on February 26 th, 2019. She held a one hour Science Communication Strategies Discussion with students. She also hosted a two-hour Science Communication Workshop for Faculty. Her workshops, and informal meetings provided Boise State students and faculty, a suite of tools and strategies for helping strengthen student's science communication skills. Here were just a few statements from Dr. Cameron's survey evaluations: \"Carrie was an excellent facilitator, allowing the audience to engage.\" \"This was so wonderful (& necessary!) Thank you for bringing her to Boise State.\" \" I gained a lot of resources and knowledge of where to find other resources in the future for promoting student's science communication skills.\" On behalf of the Institute for STEM and Diversity Initiatives, we thank the Higher Education Research Council for their generous support in helping build meaningful learning experiences for Idaho students and supporting faculty professional development. HERC F unding: The Higher Education Research Council provided $32,000 in supplemental funding for STEM undergraduate research this year.

Habitat loss and fragmentation in wintering, migratory, and breeding areas are considered key causes. Since monarchs depend on milkweeds ( Asclepias sp.) for reproduction, there is increased interest among conservationists to plant milkweeds as habitat restoration. Showy milkweed ( Aslceipias speciosa) is the most common and abundant milkweed species in the Western US. Successful habitat restoration will require germplasm that is adapted for target restoration environments and seasonal phenology. Phenological traits are adaptive, easily observable, and shaped by climate; making them helpful in genecological applications for determining seed transfer zones. W e evaluated phenological variation among 35 showy milkweed populations from across the Intermountain West to determine geographic patterns of adaptive traits and their relationships to local climates using a common garden approach. We used remotely sensed climate data in conjunction with growth and reproductive phenology data to identify variation in adaptive traits and correlate them to elevation and climate variation. Here we present the results of our analyses and their implications for defining seed transfer zones for showy milkweed in the context of monarch butterfly conservation. David Maldonado Faculty Mentor: Dr. Kristen Mitchell, Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University Research Title: RNA -seq Reveals Extracellular Matrix Remodeling Processes Mediated by AhR Activation Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to the accumulation of liver fat in the absence of alcohol consumption. NAFLD risk factors include obesity, type II diabetes, and hypertension. In about 30% of NAFLD patients, disease progression includes inflammation and advanced fibrosis, which necessitate liver transplantation. Liver fibrosis occurs when activated hepatic stellate cells deposit collagen throughout the liver. We previously established a role for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling in regulating stellate cell activation. In this study, we determined how AhR activation impacts NAFLD development and its risk factors. C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 1.0 mg/kg carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) twice a week for 5 weeks. During the final week, 100 \u00b5g/kg of 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo- p-dioxin (TCDD) was administered to elicit AhR activation. Histological analysis revealed that CCl 4/TCDD co -treatment produced advanced NAFLD, based on the presence of hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. CCl 4/TCDD co -treatment also modulated the hepatic expression of genes related to type II diabetes. Treatment with CCl 4 or TCDD alone failed to elicit NAFLD and had no impact on diabetes- related gene expression. We conclude that AhR activation may advance NAFLD progression by exacerbating liver injury and/or by increasing the development of risk factors (e.g. type II diabetes) associated with NAFLD progression. Casey Robinson INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 17Faculty Mentor: Dusty Perkins MS, Department of Biology, College of Western Idaho Research Title: Variation in Adaptive Traits and Seed Zone Evaluation of populations are imperiled and in review for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Among many contributors to the decline is the loss of breeding, migratory, and overwintering habitat. milkweeds are essential for monarch reproduction and have thus been cornerstones of monarch habitat restoration efforts in the Intermountain West. However, many potential restoration areas lack convenient seed sources to supply prospective efforts. Furthermore, because certain populations may be better adapted to specific local climates and selective pressures, the introduction of non-native, poorly adaptive genotypes may have negative consequences for restoration efforts and milkweed -dependent species. We used a genecological approach to identify adaptive traits among 35 showy milkweed populations from the Intermountain West to inform seed transfer zones for A. speciosa. We used morphological measures and plant growth data in conjunction with remotely sensed climate data to identify putative adaptive traits and determine how they relate to lo cal climate variation. Here we present the results of our analyses and their implications for classifying showy milkweed seed transfer zones and maximizing restoration and conservation benefit for monarch butterflies. Zack Szymczycha Faculty Mentor: Dr. Sara Schulwitz, Director of the American Kestrel Partnership, The Peregrine Fund Research Title: A Methodology for Systematic Mapping in Raptor Biology Knowledge from peer- reviewed research in raptor biology is based primarily on a small handful of raptor species, while a large portion are virtually unstudied or understudied. With over 500 raptor species globally, this limited knowledge base is a chief imp ediment to conservation efforts. Here we introduce a systematic mapping protocol for raptor species that expedites the literature review process to better inform stakeholders of the current species- specific research. Using the RepOrting standards for Syste matic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) protocol guidelines, we constructed a methodology for systematic information mapping for raptor conservation that encompasses: stakeholder engagement; objective eria; critical appraisal; data extraction; data synthesis and presentation; and declarations. This method provides a comprehensive synthesis of objective evidence that features repeatable standards for information extraction that will ultimately contribute to a centralized raptor conservation database. Initial efforts involving the California condor ( Gymnogyps californianus ) as a conceptual model to demonstrate the methodology has identified 255 literature items of which 165 were extracted as PDFs, while th e screening process remains ongoing.

HERC Fellow Boise State Student Abstracts: Kyle Kramer Faculty Mentor: Dr. Harish Subbaraman, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boise State University Research Title: Understanding the Effects of Plasma Parameters on Plasma- Jet Printed Material Films The demand for consistent additive manufacturing processes for biosensors that make use of flexible substrates is increasingly desired. Recent work has demonstrated a strong candidate for such processing is a plasma jet printing process. Optimization of the plasma jet printing process requires investigating the effects of different plasma conditions and flow rates, nanomaterial inks, and substrates on print quality and material properties. In this work, we examine the effects of using argon and nitrogen plasma sources on the conductivity and adhesion of four-point structures printed on polyamide substrates. The plasma source is a parallel plate discharge with a 0.5 -1mm gap using two embedded metal electrodes. The source operates at 20 kHz and 2- 3.5 kV. A new plasma source enclosure and mounting fixtures have been combined with an XY stage to print the inks. Print quality is verified through imaging the samples via scanning electron microscopy and examining the atomic spectra. Our future work involves the characterization of other nanoparticle inks and further demonstrating plasma jet printing as a cost effective, time efficient, and viable process. These results will be presented. *This research is supported by a seed grant from the NASA Idaho Space Grant Consortium (ISGC). Jessica Mueller Faculty Mentor: Dr. Vicken Hillis, Department of Human Environment Systems, Boise State University Research Title: Implications of Grazing Usage over Time and Space in the Thunder Basin Ecoregion National grasslands are public lands that have diverse and critical uses. They serve as wildlife habitat, contain mineral resources, and are used recreationally. The Thunder Basin National Grassland, located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, spans more than 500,000 acres and local ranchers rely on that acreage to feed their cattle. Effective management of these grazing lands is challenging because agency managers have to balance multiple private and public objectives. Advancing rangeland policy requires an accurate understanding of previous grazing history. Even so, few long- term, quantitative records of grazing intensity on this land exist. To address this gap, we digitized physical records of four decades of grazing usage. We analyzed this data to exam ine variation in grazing intensity over time and space. We found that there was a steady increase in grazing intensity over time, but it fell dramatically in the early 2000s. This is an important observation that can help government agencies understand how various social and environmental factors impact grazing intensity. Application of this understanding can help create sustainable grassland policies.

A virtual environment can provide students and faculty with more flexibility in meeting times and locations, content delivery, and types of interaction. This type of student- faculty interaction can be easily hosted from a faculty computer/mobile device/tablet. With an invitation, students can login to the online session and join their instructor and peers in a virtual space. Using mobile technologies, students can join virtual office hours from a variety of locations including, the library, outdoors, on the commute ride home, while caring for children, eating dinner, and even while grocery shopping. Virtual office hours allow for more flexibility of student- faculty interaction. They are an alternative to traditional office hours. This type of student- faculty interaction helps increase students' tr ust in their teacher's care of their learning. This presentation describes the design and implementation of virtual office hours for courses in the thermal-fluid sciences (Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer). It also reports on students' learning experiences.

At the University of Idaho, it is practiced throughout all units on campus and it is centrally placed in the institution's strategic plan. The Office of Undergraduate Research is tasked with taking the lead in enabling research opportunities for undergraduates at the U of I. Among its roles, it manages various competitive student grant programs that directly support student research. During FY2019, generous funding from t he State Board of Education permitted the U of I to continue its Summer Undergra duate Researc h Fellowship (SURF) Program. This intensive 10- week summer researc h experience actively e udent is provide d with a $4,000 s tipend in the form of a fellowshi p wh ich allows them t o devote full time effort t o their projects. Each s tudent is also provide d with $1,000 to help offs et materials and supplies a nd other project-related expe nses. Selecti on of s tudent participants is a competiti ve process i n which students submit research proposals to the Office of Undergraduate Research. State Board of Education funding supported 16 SURF awards during the summer of 2019. Funding provided by the State Board of Education also allowed the Office of Undergraduate Research to support a number of undergraduate researchers during the academic year. This was accomplished through competitive Undergraduate Research Grants awarded to students during the spring semester of 2019. These grants supported semester-long research projects under the guidance of faculty mentors. These grants were in the amount of $1,000 each for materials and supplies and other project-related expenses. State Board of Education funding supported 7 Undergraduate Research Grants during the spring semester of 2019. Almost all of the U of I students supported by State Board of Education funds atte nded and presen ted the results of their projects at t he Idaho Conf erence on Undergra duate Researc h (ICUR) held in Boise in July of 2019. Several of our students also presented posters of their work at the U of I Undergraduate Research Symposium in April 2019. Additionally, some presented their work at national conferences. A fe w of students were unable t o atte nd this year's ICUR c onference. In lieu of this, these students will be required to present their results at the U of I Undergraduate Research Symposium in April 20 20. The funding provided by the Idaho State Board of Education was in the form of two separate awards to the University of Idaho. These awards were managed by the U of I Office of Undergraduate Research and the awards were used together to help fund its competitive student grants program. This final project report combines all of the student project reports funded by both SBoE awards into a single document. Collectively, the awards provided by the State Board of Education helped fund 23 student research projects. In a few cases, individual projects ended up coming in slightly under the $1,000 amount allotted for project-related expenses. Additionally, one student's summer project played out differently than planned and although he was able to complete the work, his project-related expenses will not come into effect unt il later in the fall of 2019 . Consequently, he spent very little of the project money awarded to him. Taken together, these outcomes left INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 24 5 us with a small amount unexpended funds at the close of FY2019. These funds were returned to the State Board of Education. End of project feedback from st udents a nd their mentors was overwhelmingly positive. Significantly, none of the undergra duate research projects describe d here would have been possible without the support provided by t he State Board of Education. We sincerely thank the Higher Education Research Council and the Idaho State Board of Education for making these experiences possible for our students.

The goal of my research was to assist the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) in determining the number of active burrow sites in the sampling area, collecting fecal samples, and performing genetic analyses on the samples. This research is a continuation of the recovery program overseen by WDFW and will provide insight into population estimation methods using burrow numbers. My research seeks to answer the following questions: How many burrows are detected in the focal sampling area? How many pygmy rabbits are identified from fecal pellets collected in this area? What is the ratio between the number of rabbits detected and the number of active burrows detected? We performed transect searches to locate active burrows and collected fecal samples for genetic analysis across a 3.4 km2 region of the reintroduction area. Individual identification was determined using genotypes from 6-10 microsatellite loci. We collected samples from 103 new wild born individuals, representing 150 unique locations. Overall, we identified individuals from 150 active burrow sites. This resulted in an average of 0.687 rabbits per burrow in the ECRP site. Project Accomplishments 1. Determined the number of burrows in the sampling areas Result: With the help of many volunteers, I was able to determine the number of burrows in my primary East Conservation Reserve Program Field (ECRP)study site in central Washington. We walked along belt transects for thorough burrow detection. We collected 271 fecal samples at burrows for genetic monitoring and positively identified 204 of those samples as pygmy rabbit samples. I was also able to compare these results with results from previous work in another study site in the Chester Butte area. The Chester Butte sample was smaller, with 14 burrows and 6 pygmy rabbit individuals detected, but it provided a potentially useful baseline for my study. 2. Identified individual pygmy rabbits from the sampling areas using genetic analysis Result: After collecting fecal samples from all the detected burrow sites and eliminating samples that were identified as other rabbit species using mitochondrial DNA, pellets underwent further genetic analysis utilizing 19 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci including one sex ID marker. Of the 204 pygmy rabbit fecal samples, 153 passed the M2 multiplex requirements. From those samples, we identified 103 new wild born individuals. 3. Determined a possible ratio between number of burrows and number of pygmy rabbits in the sampling area Result: Of the 103 individuals identified, 80 were identified at only a single location. The remaining 23 were detected at 70 locations collectively. Based on these data, it seems that there is an average ratio of 0.687 rabbits per burrow. Furthermore, the data from the Chester Butte site INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 26 7 resulted in an average of 0.429 rabbits per burrow. However, given the number of rabbits that were detected at only one location, this average likely has a large amount of variance.

These nematodes can cause up to 80% yield loss and with soil fumigants becoming more restricted new strategies must be devised to deal with the infestation of this pest. Mechanical damage caused by pests resulting in a rapid oxidative burst and an upregulation of the peroxidase genes strongly implicate peroxidases in plant defense and immune response. Research conducted in Solanum sisymbriifolium (a plant resistant to PCN and a wild Solanum relative to potato) showed eleven peroxidase candidate genes are differentially expressed in infected versus uninfected roots, ten peroxidases were upregulated, and one was suppressed. In this project eight of these peroxidase gene candidates were amplified and the open reading frames for these genes cloned into a vector. The clones were submitted for sequencing and the resulting DNA sequences were analyzed. With the sequences for the open reading frames determined, the cloned peroxidases are ready to be placed into a suitable plant expression vector. Future research will be conducted to transform these peroxidase genes into susceptible potatoes to see if they confer resistance to PCN. Project Summary and Acco mplishments: The goal of this project was to confirm peroxidase open reading frames, ORFs, that were differentially expressed in litchi tomato plants that were infected with potato cyst nematodes versus uninfected litchi tomato plants at the bench. RNA seq data showed 10 peroxidase candidate genes that could be linked with potato cyst nematode infection. Using these candidate open reading frames, primers were designed to amplify the fragments from cDNA. Once amplified, the fragments were cloned into the vector PENTR D- TOPO. From this vector, the plasmids were extracted and sent for sequencing. Using the sequencing results, the data was aligned to the reference sequences from the RNA seq data and analyzed for discrepancies. Due to some unforeseen complications, the confirmed sequence could not be directly integrated into PearleyGate 100 and introduced into agrobacterium. The construct was ligated into PearleyGate100 and transformed into JM109 cells. Using this construct, the plasmid was confirmed using sequencing. Once sequence conformation was complete, the plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent agrobacterium using electroporation. A significant portion of this project was accomplished during the period of this grant. Starting with 10 predicted peroxidase open reading frames, 9 of them were able to be amplified using PCR and were of the correct size. One open reading frame, c10137/f1p4/96 , did not match the predicted size of the fragment and did not proceed in the experiment. Next the amplified open reading frames were cloned into a PENTR vector. 8 of the ORFs were successfully cloned into the vector. One ORF, c90433/f240p109/1282, did not successfully clone and was therefore dropped at this stage. Once cloned, the plasmids were sent for sequencing. 6 of the ORFs had matching sequences to the reference sequence. c7557/f1p0/1301 and c6814/f2p4/1378 had 3 and 1 base pair changes respectively. All of these sequences are stored as glycerol stocks awaiting ligation into the PearleyGate 100 vector and then transformation into Agrobacterium. Some trouble was encountered with the ligation and transformation into agrobacterium process. The vector could not be confirmed in agrobacterium. To circumvent this process, INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 28 9 the construct is now confirmed in JM109 cells and then extracted, sequence confirmed and transformed into agrobacterium. Only one peroxidase open reading frame, c16456/f1p3/1223, has been successfully ligated into PearleyGate 100 and transformed into agrobacterium. The next step of this project will be to get the remaining 7 peroxidase ORFs into PearleyGate100 and transformed into Agrobacterium. After this, the construct will need to be introduced into potato plants and genotypic and phenotypic analysis conducted. For the budget, the money was dispersed amongst portions of my project. The first item purchased was NotI-Hf enzyme for $72.00. This enzyme was purchased to use during restriction digestions for conformation in the pENTR vector. $327.00 went towards purchasing a 100bp and ultra-low DNA ladder for use in gel electrophoresis when running the PRC and digested products. A total of $354.64 was used for sequencing of samples by Genewiz. This amount can be broken down by two rounds of sequencing for $174.00 and $162.00 along with shipping which was $9.32 each time. $180.00 was spent on Timentin, a compound needed to grow the transformed agrobacterium. Finally, the poster for the poster presentation was purchased for $48.00. TOTAL: $1,000.28 Conference Presentation: This research was presented at the 2019 UI Undergraduate Research Symposium and at the 2019 Idaho Conference on Undergraduate Research in Boise, ID.

A detailed understanding of visual system organization is a limiting factor in developing treatments for such disorders. Genetic blinding diseases are studied to understand visual system organization and diseases. Stationary night blindness, is caused by mutation in the Dscaml1 gene. Dscaml1 encodes for the protein, Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule-like 1 (DSCAML1), which plays a role in organization of cells critical for night vision. In a previous study we used electron micrographs to visualize the cellular organization of rod bipolar cells (RBC) in the synaptic pathway within the mouse retina, an accessible model for human diseases. We found an increased number of dendrite terminals that do not contact rod photoreceptors in the absence of DSCAML1. This project focuses on using immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques to compare the development of the synaptic pathway at multiple post-natal time points in three genotypes. It is predicted that the loss of DSCAML1 results in termination of the pathway between the RBC and dendrites instead of a delay in formation. This study is intended to guide clinicians seeking interventions for people with similar disorders. Project Description: The aim of this project was to optimize and utilize an IHC staining protocol to stain cryostat sectioned retinas and rods. First optimal concentrations and staining times were determined with the antibodies used. After obtaining an optimized protocol the ratio of puncta to RBCs was calculated using florescent imaging to determine if there is a delay in synaptic formation as the mouse ages throughout different timepoints. Three genotypes are being used Optimal staining concentrations, times, and temperatures were determined in order to derive an optimized protocol for this study. All age points that were taken for study, within the three different genotypes, were successfully stained, counted and analyzed. Limitations were presented at the end of the summer due to working with specific timepoints of mice, but all mice that were taken for this study were analyzed up until this point.

That limits the capabilities of the alloys as they are largely dependent on the base element instead of utilizing the abilities of all the elements in the alloy. High entropy alloys (HEAs) are an advancement of traditional alloys as they have a larger percentage of multiple elements. In this proposal, we will work on the effect of friction stir welding (FSW) to determine how it affects the microstructures and the correlating mechanical properties. Project Overview: In this project, the High Entropy Alloy (HEA), known as Fe 42Mn 18Co10Cr15Si5, was looked at under various microscopes to see how Friction Stir Welding (FSW) affects the mechanical properties of the material. FSW is when a rotating tool heats and joins two side by side plates. It is important to know how the material is affected by this process to understand how the material changes as it undergoes this process. Project Accomplishments: 1. Learned how to prepare samples for various forms of testing and microscopy To prepare samples for the optical microscope, a small section was cut off of the main block. It was placed into a mold to create a cylindrical object with a 1in diameter and a thickness of .5in. The sample was then grinded with sandpaper from 120 grit to 1200 grit before it was polished with a diamond slurry. In order to see the microstructures it was lightly etched with a hydrochloric/nitric acid solution. After the samples were looked at with the optical microscope, they were also used on the Vickers Hardness machine. For the scanning electron microscope (SEM), the sample was prepared in much of the same manner, but the alloy had to be extracted from the mold. This is to allow the electrons to properly bounce off of the alloy which is what provides the images. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) samples are prepared slightly different. Rather than being placed in a mold, a thin sliver of the material is glued onto a metal disc. Once one side has been polished, the sample is removed and reattached on the other side. As the second side is being polished, it is also measured to ensure that the sample is less than 100 micrometers thick. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 32 13 The Instron testing machine requires samples to be cylindrical, so the material was machined to the proper size. 2. Used the optical microscope, the scanning electron microscope (SEM), Vickers Hardness machine, and the Instron testing machine The optical microscope is used to see basic microstructures. Typically, images are taken at magnifications from 50x to 100x, but can go as high as 500x. Multiple images were taken across the weld zone, so in the future a single image of the weld zone will be available. SEM is used to look more in depth at the microstructures. The magnifications go up above 2000x. To use the SEM, the sample was loaded into a vacuum chamber. Cameras were used to position the sample under the electron beam. The Vickers Hardness machine is used to determine the hardness of the material. This is done by pressing a diamond tip into the material and measuring the imprint. For this material, measurements were taken across the weld zone to see how the weld affects the hardness. The Instron testing machine has many functions, for this project, compression tests were performed. From the compression test, mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and ultimate yield strength could be determined. Compression tests were chosen over tensile tests do the amount of material that was saved by doing compression, along with the fact that the microstructures can be analyzed after compression tests but not tensile tests.

Accordingly, new vaccines, therapeutics, and strategies for vector control are needed to support these efforts. Anopheles stephensi is an aggressive malaria vector mosquito that has invaded and become established in Sri Lanka, Djibouti and Ethiopia, with significant risk for range expansion into Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan. In Djibouti, A. stephensi has been linked to a resurgence of severe infection with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria control directed at reducing mosquito reproduction or fecundity is an important strategy, particularly for A. stephensi that is adapted to oviposition in artificial water sources in urban habitats. Mosquitoes consume blood to produce eggs. Following blood consumption, the protein Vitellogenin (Vg) is synthesized in the fat body of the female mosquito and transferred to developing eggs. Vg synthesis is stimulated following the blood meal by increasing titers of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). We have discovered that abscisic acid (ABA), a natural compound, can reduce mosquito fecundity. Based on studies in the flesh fly that showed that ABA can reduce Vg levels in this insect, we hypothesized that ABA reduces A. stephensi fecundity by reducing levels of Vg in the mosquito. Project Description In 2016, there were 216 million reported cases of malaria worldwide and about half a million deaths occurred due to the devasting effects of the malaria parasite. Malaria is a vector-borne disease that is caused by a parasite, most commonly Plasmodium falciparum, transmitted through the bite of an Anopheles mosquito. There has been progression towards eliminating malaria in some areas of the world. However, there are still many challenges to overcome before eliminating malaria. Obstacles such as parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs and mosquito resistance to insecticides are just a few examples of obstacles that have yet to be tackled. Project Accomplishments 1. Previous work in the Luckhart lab demonstrated that supplementation of adult female A. stephensi with ABA had no effect on egg production in the first reproductive or gonotrophic cycle. Given that female mosquitoes with access to blood can lay eggs approximately every 3-4 days and, thereby, complete multiple gonotrophic cycles during a complete lifespan, I determined whether supplementation of ABA to adult female mosquitoes could alter fecundity beyond the first gonotrophic cycle. Result: In the first set of experiments, adult female A. stephensi were supplemented with ABA and clutch size (number of eggs laid per female during one reproductive or gonotrophic cycle) was evaluated. I observed that ABA does not affect clutch size when supplemented to adult female mosquitoes. 2. Current research in the Luckhart lab has demonstrated that supplementation of ABA in water to mosquito larvae shortened time to pupation and body size of adult mosquitoes. Therefore, I tested INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 34 15 whether supplementation of ABA to mosquito larvae could alter reproduction of adult females derived from supplemented and control larvae. Results: I observed that female A. stephensi derived from ABA treated larvae exhibited a significant reduction in clutch size relative to adult females derived from untreated larvae. These data indicate that ABA treatment of larvae results in physiological changes that persist into the adult stage and that are durable over time. It was also notable that ABA supplementation of A. stephensi larvae significantly reduced the lifespan of adult female mosquitoes derived from treated larvae relative to adult females derived from untreated larvae. 3. Based on our data, we hypothesized that ABA reduces A. stephensi fecundity by reducing levels of Vg in the mosquito. Results: 20E and Vg levels were evaluated post blood meal. Adult female A. stephensi in the control group exhibited the expected pattern of increasing 20E titer following a blood meal. Female mosquitoes derived from larvae treated with 1M ABA and 100M ABA group did not show the typical peak of 20E at 24 hr, indicating they did not properly respond to the blood meal. Further, adult female A. stephensi derived from larvae treated with 1M ABA and 100M ABA had increased Vg mRNA levels at 12 hr post blood meal relative to control, but reduced levels in the following 36 hr. This early increase in Vg mRNA expression followed by reduced Vg expression could explain why egg production was reduced but not blocked in adult females derived from larvae treated with ABA.

Collegiate athletes are prone to developing LEA due to insufficient energy intake, and LEA is associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in competitive athletes. However, little is known about the occurrence of LEA or its relation to BMD in non-athlete populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of LEA and its relation to BMD in non-athlete males at the University of Idaho. Non-athlete males (n=21) ages 18-26 took part in this study. EA was assessed using measurements of dietary energy intake (DI), exercise energy expenditure (ExEE), and body composition. BMD was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Five participants (23.8%) identified with LEA based on an EA of < 30 kcal/kg of LBM/day. There was no correlation between EA and total BMD (p = 0.951), spine BMD (p = 0.641), or hip BMD (p = 0.786). However, total BMD was significantly correlated with body weight (p < 0.001). These findings differ from previous research among competitive athletes which found associations between LEA and BMD. Project Accomplishments: 1. Assess the prevalence of low energy availability among non-NCAA athlete male students at the University of Idaho. I was successful in assessing the prevalence of low energy availability among this population. I was able to measure this prevalence by monitoring participants' physical activity and dietary intake over a period of three days. Participants wore accelerometers to monitor their physical activity and tracked their diet using ASA 24, on online dietary assessment tool. 21 non-NCAA athlete males at the University of Idaho successfully completed this study. Among these participants, 71% (n=20) were found to have reduced energy availability while 23% (n=5) were found to have low energy availability. 2. Study the relationship between low energy availability and bone density in non-NCAA athlete males. By using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) technology, I was able to assess bone mineral density in participants. A comparison between bone mineral density z-scores and energy availability using Spearman correlations revealed there was no correlation between low energy availability and bone density (p = 0.951). However, a strong correlation was found between bone mineral density and body weight (p = 0.001). 3. Study the relationship between low energy availability and testosterone levels in non-athlete males. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 36 17 A goal of this study was to test the following hypothesis: Testosterone levels in non-NCAA athlete college males with low energy availability will be significantly lower than males without low energy availability. Salivary testosterone samples were successfully obtained from participants who completed the study. These samples were sent to Salimetrics\u00ae to be analyzed. However, I have not yet received these results back from the company. Once these are received, I will be able to study the relationship between energy availability and testosterone in non-NCAA athlete males and test this hypothesis. Summary of Budget Expenditures: Supplies Cost Salimetrics\u00ae Testosterone Sampling Kits $900 Participant Incentive $100 Total: $1000 Additional Information: This project was originally titled, \"Low Energy Availability and its Relation to Testosterone Levels in Non-Athlete Males.\" However, because the results of the testosterone sampling were not ready in time to present at the University of Idaho Undergraduate Research Symposium in April, I included the study of bone density in my project. Due to delays in the processing of testosterone samples, I have not yet received these results. When these results are analyzed, I plan to update this report with my new findings.

It is a convenient material for use in consumer grade additive manufacturing, and its cost is relatively low. This makes it popular for use as a filament in 3D printers like the Makerbot. However, parts printed out of ABS do not behave the same way as parts produced using traditional methods, like injection molding. Preliminary research done previously on the project shows that the failure patterns of ASTM dogbone testing samples are radically different when comparing layered prints and injection moldings. During tensile tests, printed samples fail suddenly, with little to no necking at the failure point. Injection molded samples follow a typical stress/strain curve. It would seem that there is something happening at a microstructural level to explain this phenomenon. The purpose of this research was to pinpoint this microstructural difference by extruding custom filament from the exact same ABS stock that was used to injection mold the sister samples. By eliminating any material differences between stock suppliers, the microstructural differences, it was hoped, would become apparent. Project Accomplishments 1. First, the old research had to be compiled and organized. The project had been worked on by two students previously, and the records were both old and slightly disorganized. Some samples had been tested, but test sample lengths after tensile testing were never recorded. 1.1. I measured the remains of the tested samples from over the past several years, recording all of their lengths, and matching them with the conditions of their test environment in a large spreadsheet. 1.2. After doing this it was realized that many of the old samples were the wrong size and shape and did not match any ASTM standard dogbone. Not only that, but some had been vapor annealed, and some simply had no notes on them. I compiled the lengths for all of them, but as it worked out there were never more than a few of any one distinct sample, so trying to compare them to the injection molds was going to be difficult. 2. After compiling the old tests, it was decided that new filament would be extruded, and some more tests should be conducted using standardized sample geometries. Upon requesting that some more filament be extruded, Dr. Armando McDonald politely declined, citing that he was already far too pressed for time to get the extruder running again. 2.1. At this point I approached the individual in the Buchanan Engineering Lab who helped 3D print the previous samples. Upon discussing the project with him and asking whether there was any leftover filament from the custom stock that was made before I joined the project, he replied that it had never been used and that the samples had been printed with brand name filament. In other words, our non-standard samples were not made out of the same ABS plastic, probably due to a slight breakdown in communication several years ago. 3. It was at this juncture that it seemed prudent of us to pursue microtomy of the old 3D printed samples, simply to at least get an idea of where to go with the research. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 38 19 3.1. I began by asking around McClure, only to find that the microtome we thought was there had been surplussed several years ago. I reached out to the biology department, but turned attention toward WSU's Electron Microscopy Lab. 3.2. We knew that the ABS samples would need to be stained with Osmium Tetroxide, but when we tried to find anyone with a working knowledge of Osmium Tetroxide staining, we came up empty handed, including at WSU. It was proposed that I could go and pay for the training to use the SEM at WSU, but that would require a semester long course for which there simply was not time. In the end, the conclusion of the Spring semester rolled around and Dr. Roll and I had hit nothing but dead ends in the course of the project. I express my sincerest apologies, as I had high hopes of being successful with this research. However, Dr. Roll has informed me that this is not unheard of.

They drive our cars, deliver our packages, fly drones, and maintain our economy. These robots need to learn at both an individual scale but also learn how all the robots need to work together at a management scale. Evolutionary AI techniques could solve the problems that come with maintaining and teaching these robots. Starcraft provides a testbed for AI behavior analysis. Starcraft requires the player to create a military infrastructure, manage an army at both the micro and macro level, and collect and administer resources. Using Starcraft we examine the best method for evolving two algorithms a macro algorithm and a micro algorithm. For our results we examined: running the micro algorithm by itself, the macro algorithm by itself, running them both in parallel, running the macro algorithm for a short time then having the micro come in, and finally running them both separately and then combining them after a set amount of generations. Our results indicate that parallel evolutionary algorithms with interdependent goals learn best when infrastructure is learned solo, and then unit behavior is defined. Project Design: The evolutionary algorithm is two-fold. One algorithm is in charge of developing the overall strategy that this bot takes (The Macro Algorithm). The second algorithm is in charge of developing strategy for the individual unit groups that the first algorithm produces (The Micro Algorithm). The Macro Algorithm is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) in which each individual is 100 integers long. Each integer ranging from 0-32 represents a building or unit that it wishes to produce. Once the game is started, the GA starts at the first gene in the selected individual and takes the number there and translates it to a corresponding unit/building. If it can build it, the game then produces that unit. If it can't (due to tech tree issues or possibly missing resources) then a fitness penalty is administered. Since the ultimate goal of the Macro Algorithm is to produce an army, every unit that is produced adds to the fitness of the individual. The Micro Algorithm is also a GA in which each individual is (149*18) = 2682, float values long ranging between -1.0 and 1.0. These values are weights inputted in a neural network that are trained through evolutionary methods to determine the behavior of every type of unit in the game. Since the bot is protoss there are 18 unique army units that are in the game that need to have their behavior trained hence the 18. The neural network itself is 2 hidden layers with 11 inputs and 5 outputs. Information input into the neural network is: INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 40 21 The output information is encoded as such: Project Results: The method that produced the best results was when the Macro trained alone for 30 generations and then started training with the Micro algorithm. This indicates that autonomous AI programs that need to train with other algorithms will do best if the algorithm that creates infrastructure is trained alone first and the individual behavior algorithms are then attached. It reached a 50% win loss ratio against the HARD bot at 55 generations which is 15 generations before the next method did. This potentially happens because the micro algorithm is more heavily dependent upon the macro algorithm to work. If there are no units produced by the macro algorithm, then for the first set of generations the micro algorithm might learn the wrong things. Thus, the macro-algorithm training by itself would create an environment so that when the micro does come it, it has units and behaviors to improve and train upon.

METHODS: 12 adults (mean \u00b1SD: age: 56 \u00b19.5 y; 83% women) visited the laboratory on two occasions where anthropometrics, body composition, and blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and lipids were measured. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), total skeletal muscle, lean, and fat mass, as well as segmental lean and fat mass were estimated with a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Sedentary behavior (SB) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were objectively measured for 7 days using a triaxial accelerometer worn on the right hip. Simple correlations were used to examine the associations between SB and variables related to lean body mass. RESULTS: On average, participants were classified as overweight with a body mass index of 29.1\u00b15.1 kg/m2 and body fat percentage of 36.6 \u00b18.4%. Participants had adequate skeletal muscle in the arms and legs indexed to height, as indicated by a SMI of 7.62 \u00b11.02 kg/m2. On average, muscle mass (r=0.35), SMI (r=0.51), and lean mass in the left leg (r=0.25), right leg (r=0.27), and trunk (r=0.40); however, these associations were not statistically significant ( p>0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Although our data show SB had low-to-moderate positive correlations with lean mass, these were not statistically significant and were in the opposite direction of our hypotheses. A larger sample size is necessary to draw conclusions regarding these preliminary findings. Project description : It is known that increased sedentary behavior has been positively related to many negative health outcomes. The effects of sedentary behavior have been shown to have negative outcomes on health even if an individual meets the recommended guidelines of 150 min per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Although several studies have investigated the associations between sedentary behavior and body composition, a majority of these studies only examine body fat and fail to consider lean mass. Lean mass is composed of skeletal muscle, bone, and water. Sarcopenia, defined as gradual muscle loss with age, is related to the inability to perform activities of daily living with ease and loss of independence. Few studies have examined the relationship between sedentary behavior and risk factors for sarcopenia, and those that have are limited because of the use of self-reported levels of sedentary behavior. The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between total sedentary behavior and bouts of sedentary behavior with markers of muscle health, while controlling for risk factors, such as age, physical activity, diet, and self-reported diagnosis of chronic disease in middle-aged to older adults. The term \"bouts\" refers to the total number of times when a participant sits for an extended period of time. In this study we specify how many 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60-minute sedentary bouts over the course of a week. Results of this study may help fill a gap in the literature by determining whether sedentary behavior and muscle mass are associated. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 42 23 Summary of project accomplishments: Although our study start date was delayed, we have been successful recruiting participants. To date we have recruited 18 participants total: 12 out of the proposed 30 participants have completed the study, and 6 additional participants are currently in the study. Based on the success level of recruiting we believe that we will be collecting data for a few more months. A preliminary analysis of the data using the 12 participants with complete data showed that sedentary behavior was positively correlated with skeletal muscle mass (r=0.35), skeletal muscle index (r=0.51), lean mass in the left and right leg (r=0.26 and r=0.27 respectively), and lean mass in the trunk (r=0.40). However, these correlations are not statistically significant, likely due to our small sample size. Additionally, we have not yet accounted for covariates in the model due to this small sample size. We hypothesize these correlations will decrease and possibly become negative as we gain more data. We will continue to collect data for this study until at least 35 participants are completed as that should be enough data for statistical analyses. Through this project I've also had some personal accomplishments. I have gained valuable leadership experience conducting this study and have become very proficient in health-related data collection procedures and working with human subjects. I have learned how to effectively communicate with participants to explain consent forms and testing procedures, conduct body composition assessments using multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, obtain blood samples via finger stick for testing of blood sugar and fats, and collect and process activity monitor data. I have learned firsthand what the research process entails from the work that goes into developing a research question and methodology, organizing data, and analyzing and communicating results. I have also learned how much dedication working with a close-knit team takes and how to communicate with each other to have the study run smoothly. Although, I have been with Dr. Vella's lab for about a year now, I have learned the most during these last 2 months where I have had the opportunity to take the lead on every aspect of this study. Summary of budget: Of the $1,000 project budget, $700 of our budget went to participant gift cards as incentive to complete the study. The rest of the budget ($300) was used to pay for costs associated with the blood draws. The poster printing costs for the U of I Undergraduate Research Symposium will be paid out of my mentor's lab account as we don't anticipant printing the poster until spring semester. TOTAL EXPENDITURES: $1,000 project budget + $4,000 fellowship = $5,000. Poster presentation at ICUR 2019: Dr. Pfeiffer, Director of the Office of Undergraduate Research, gave me permission to miss the Idaho Undergraduate Research Conference in Boise for extenuating circumstances; however, I will present a poster at the UI Undergraduate Research Symposium in April of 2020 detailing the results of my study. Acknowledgment: I truly appreciate the generous support provided by the State Board of Education in the form of a SURF award from the UI Office of Undergraduate Research. Without this support from the SBOE/HERC, I would not have been able to participate in this research.

A student-professor team is developing an electronically advanced nose clip attached to livestock eliciting electrical stimulus when animals' cross virtual boundaries. My research advances our design by examining visual cues to facilitate animal learning. I conducted research to address two questions: 1) Will cows avoid visual barriers after receiving electrical shock to the nose? 2) Will animals recognize and stop at unconnected objects of varying distances as visual cues for a barrier? We found that after 3 days of training, where animals received a shocked after crossing a line on the ground, 89-91% of cows, depending on circumstances, would stop at that line. It was also discovered that in experiments with unconnected posts in various locations, animals were still able to avoid a visual barrier with 91% and higher success rate. Overall, we can conclude that cows are able to use differing visual cues to perceive a virtual barrier between unconnected objects. Results will be used by the UI Virtual Fence team to advance our design for ranchers to use on grazing lands. A manuscript is being prepared for a publication in a refereed journal and guidelines will be developed to help ranchers use visual cues to train animals for virtual fences. Project Description Since livestock were domesticated 10,000 years ago, humans have engaged in animal husbandry to provide materials and food to humans. In the late 1800's, ranchers began using a new technology called, \"barbed wire\" to keep animals enclosed and graze in certain areas. Electrical fencing was introduced in the 1930 as an alternative to heavy wire fences. Fast forward to the 2000's, we see the agriculture industry using more electronically integrated technologies. Precision technology is also being developed for ranchers to manage livestock movement by using what is known as \"virtual fence\" which is designed to keep cattle out of or inside an area with a device worn by the animal that receives a signal when animal breaches a designated boundary and administers an electrical shock. My research examined if cattle can perceive a line on the ground, or unconnected points, as a barrier in a virtual fence. Experimental Procedures and Accomplishments: Animals used for this research were the University of Idaho's Charolais beef cows (n=29) whose age ranged from 2 to 10-years-old and weighed 650 to 850 kg. Protocols were approved by IACUC (Protocol #IACUC-2018-25) in February 2019. We used a Sport Dog YardTrainer 350 training dog collar connected to a nose clip by wire leads to emit an electrical shock at 4.7 kv, no resistance. Before the experiments, we introduced cattle to molasses COB (i.e., corn, oats, barley) grain and observed and recorded cows' individual responses to distractions, nervousness, and motivation to eat grain. From these data we selected 18 animals most suited for the experiments. In all experiments, we haltered cattle and applied a nose clip to deliver an electrical stimulus. Cows were released from the working pen and moved to a treatment zone where they were observed and encouraged to cross a boundary line into an exclusion zone marked by a visual line or barrier with posts. In in experiments 1-4 INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 44 25 there were grain pans in the exclusion zone to encourage cows to cross the barrier and enter the zone. In experiment 5, the grain pans were not present, but 10 other cows from the herd were held beyond the exclusion zone to draw cattle into the zone. Each day, cows were tested 4 times and places in a reset zone between runs. After trials, cows had halters and nose clip removed and were released to pasture. Experiment 1: We examined if cattle stop at a line in an alley after receiving an electrical shock and how long it would take them to learn this behavior. We tested 18 cows 4 times each day (30 sec/run) until >85% of them didn't cross the line. During the experiment we found that more cows stopped at the visual line on the ground each day (P<0.05) until day 3 when 89% of animals stopped (Figure 1). These results indicate that cows were able to learn to stop at a line in only a few days Experiment 2: Like experiment 1, cows were encouraged to cross a line receiving a shock if they crossed that line. However, in this experiment we wanted to know if animals would still stop at a line in a larger area (corral) rather than a narrow alley. Each cow (n=16) was tested 4 times per day. We observed that cattle did quickly learn even in a larger area. By day 3 cattle stopped at the line >90% of the time. (Fig 2). Experiment 3: In this experiment we examined if cattle would stop at unconnected posts instead of a line on the ground. Cattle were encouraged to cross a line posts spaced 1.5-meters apart in a corral. Each cow (n=16) had 4 runs/day (30 sec./run). We found that the cows throughout this trial stopped at the unconnected posts >90% of the time (Figure 3), indicating that cows perceive a virtual boundary. Experiment 4: In this experiment we increased the distance between posts to examine if animals perceive this as a boundary . Posts were spaced 6, 12 and 24 meters apart in a pasture . Cows started at a set distance and progressed a greater distance after not crossing the line 18 out of 20 times per group of five cows . Cattle were placed into 3 groups: 1) 6 12 24 meters, 2) 12 24 meters, and 3) 24 meters . Cows had 4 runs/day (2 min./run) . We found that animals take about 3 days to learn to stop at a distance of 24 INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 45 26 meters between posts (Figure 4) . Previous experience at shorter distances doesn't decrease the time it took to perceive a barrier at 24 meters . There was concern that feed pans placed directly behind the line of posts indicated a virtual boundary to the cows. Experiment 5: In the final trial, we removed feed pans from the exclusion zone to ensure they were not acting as visual cues for the boundary. Cows (n=15) were encouraged to cross posts spaced at 3, 6, and 12 meters apart in a pasture. To ensure cows in the trial cross into the exclusion zone we placed 10 other cows in the herd beyond the exclusion zone. As above, cows started at set distance and advanced to greater distance. Cows were in groups: 1) 3 6 12 meters, 2) 6 12 meters, and 3) 12 meters. Cows had 5 runs/day (2 min./run). Cows individually moved up to a greater distance when they didn't cross the line 4 or more times out of 5 runs. Animals took about 3 days to not cross the line at >91% (Figure 5). Previous experience with different distance smaller than 12-meters didn't decrease the days it took to stop at 12 meters. In summary, I found that cattle learn very quickly with simple designs and they have the knowledge to remember what they learned to apply it to other situations. I will continue this research with my fellow teammates through the fall to discover more to help better the Virtual Fence Project.

This technology has the potential to improve management practices for grazing livestock. It could allow producers to use grazing areas that are otherwise unusable because they would be difficult or too expensive to fence. My research focused on audio cues applied before an electrical stimulus to signal a pending shock and facilitate avoidance behavior. The specific aims were to determine: (1) If sound, paired with an electric shock was an effective associative cue for cattle; (2) Does the tone and duration of the sound cue change its effectiveness; (3) Does the direction/location of sound affect associative learning in cattle. In experiment 1, 57% of cattle paused for at least two seconds after hearing a sound, 38% paused at the shock, and 5 % didn't pause at all. In Experiment 2, 91% of cattle paused when they heard a 2,000 Hz beep, 78% paused to the sound of an air horn, 77% paused to a 300 Hz beep, and 66% paused a tolling bell. In experiment 3, 97% of animals paused if the sound came from in font vs 86% paused when the sound came from behind the animal. Animals were no more likely to pause if the sound came from near one ear (78% paused) compare to sound from near both ear (66% of animals paused). Project Description and Accomplishments: In early times, people used wood and stones to build fences to keep animals out of crop areas and contain them within pastures. Once westward expansion started, barbed wire fences became popular due to the lack of wood and stones in the plains. Fences are known to cause issues with wildlife by disrupting natural migration routes, inhibiting access to natural habitats, and entangling animals resulting in their death. These fence issues have contributed to population decreases in some wildlife species (Hanophy, 2009). Fences are also expensive to build and maintain. This has led researchers from across the globe to search for a way to manage livestock without physical fence. The idea of virtual fence gave is a potential solution though there are still concerns to be addressed. For example, several animal welfare concerns have prohibited the use of shock collars for training dogs in several countries and may limit use of virtual fences where electrical stimulus is used (Umstatter, 2011). Specific concerns include animals getting repeated electric stimulus due to faulty devices, inadequate training of animals, and the amount of distress animals may face when the electric stimuli are random (Umstatter, 2011). 1. Training animals to stop at a sound that is associated with a shock. Animals were enticed down an alley with grain and peers. Once they crossed a designated boundary, a sound was emitted. The distance to the boundary changed each time cattle walked down the alley. We recorded whether the animal paused at the sound, shock received after the sound, or didn't pause at all. Each animal repeated this, four times per day for four days. A Chi-Square analysis of pausing showed that day had no effect on whether the animals paused or didn't pause at the sound (P=0.90). This indicates that animals didn't learn to stop at a sound. 2. Will changing the tone or sound change the response to an associated sound and shock? As above, animals were enticed down an alley and a sound was emitted. We recorded whether or not the animal paused at the sound or shock. This was repeated four times each day for four days. A Chi-Square analysis of pausing vs not pausing showed a difference between sounds whether the animal paused or not INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 47 28 (P=0.013). When a 2,000 Hz beep was played, 70% of cattle paused, 63% paused to the sound of an air horn, 55% paused to a 300 Hz beep, and 46% paused a tolling bell. 3. Will the direction from where the animals hear a sound, change the response to an associated sound and shock? As above animals were enticed down an ally, and a sound was emitted. This was repeated for each animal four times per day for four days. In this experiment, sounds varied by the location from which they were emitted. When a sound was emitted from behind or in front of the animal, 97% of animals paused if the sound came from in front of versus 86% that paused when the sound came from behind the animal (P=0.03). It appears that animals were no more likely to pause if the sound came from near one ear (78% paused) compare to sound from near both ears (66% of animals pause: P=0.12) though based on the small sample size this may be prone to type 2 error. Based on experiments conducted this summer, I believe future research can further evaluate effective use of sound in the most efficient way by using tones close to 2,000 Hz and have them emitted from the front of the animal. However, I also learned that cows don't inherently, nor do they quickly develop an association between the sound and the shock. This makes me question the types of virtual fence that are becoming commercially available that are based just on sound. Our team will look further into animal behavior and the best way to train them to make that association. Conference Presentation: This study was presented as a poster at ICUR in July 2019.

Davis, Animal and Veterinary Science, University of Idaho Faculty Mentor: Dr. Brenda Murdoch, Dept. Animal & Veterinary Science Project Title: Understanding how genetic variation in PRDM9 affects meiotic recombination Project Description: Meiotic recombination is an important process that contributes to genetic variation and produces viable gametes. Errors due to abnormal or improper recombination can result in reproductive consequences such as aneuploidy, developmental issues, fetal loss, and infertility (Baudat et al. 2013). The driving force behind this project is that very little is known about the influencing factors of meiotic recombination in mammals. Improving our knowledge regarding the effect of genetic variation on the meiotic recombination gene PR/SET domain 9 (PRDM9), the gene thought to be responsible for the positioning of recombination hotspots, can provide valuable insight regarding male infertility in both livestock and humans. A recent study characterized and quantified the recombination protein mutL homologue 1 (MLH1), which is thought to be indicative of crossover (CO) events (Davenport et al. 2018). Davenport et al compared the number of COs per spermatocyte from three different breeds of sheep (Suffolk, Icelandic, and Targhee). The results of their study indicated that the number and location of MLH1 foci varied amongst the three different breeds. Suffolk rams exhibited the lowest number of MLH1 foci, followed by Icelandic rams, and lastly Targhee rams exhibited the highest number of MLH1 foci. The objective of this study is to expand on previous work by utilizing immunofluorescence to identify and characterize the histone Suffolk and Targhee breeds of sheep. H3K4me3 is thought to catalyzed by PRDM9 during meiotic prophase, (Davenport et al. 2018). We hypothesized that different breeds of sheep would express different H3K4me3 intensities, and that those breeds of sheep that exhibit higher MLH1 numbers also exhibit higher H3K4me3 intensities. Testicular tissue samples of sexually mature Suffolk and Targhee rams were collected postmortem. The samples underwent surface spread preparation and were either frozen for later use or were immediately stained. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to identify three proteins: synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3), H3K4me3, and chromatin. Imaging of the meiotic prophase cells was done through the use of a Leica DM6 B fluorescence microscope and an Andor Zyla sCMOS camera. Throughout this study we imaged cells in the pachytene stage of prophase where MLH1 is thought to be initiating double strand break repairs through CO pathways (Baudat et al. 2013). The average intensity of the H3K4me3 signal was calculated per spermatocyte for each of four Suffolk and four Targhee rams using ImageJ version 1.51 software. Out of the four Suffolk and four Targhee rams utilized, approximately 50 spermatocytes per individual were examined, totaling 205 spermatocytes per breed. Using R Studio version 3.3.3, three statistical analysis were performed to determine if a significant (p<0.05) difference in H3K4me3 intensities were present. The first test was a Shapiro Wilk Normality test to determine if the data set was of a normal distribution. Following this test, a Kruskal-Wallis test and a post-hoc Tukey- Kramer test were performed to identify any significance within the data. This data was then compared to previously reported MLH1 data that underwent the same statistical analysis (Davenport et al. 2018). To INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 49 30 identify any correlation between MLH1 and H3K4me3 data, a Spearman's Rank Correlation was also performed. The mean H3K4me3 intensity for Suffolk and Targhee spermatocytes were 17,552.15 and 17,678.44, respectively. The average difference of intensity measures for each breed were 15,593.19 for Suffolk and 18,362.32 for Targhee. The Shapiro Wilk Normality test indicated that the data did not show a normal distribution. The Kruskal-Wallis test and the post-hoc Tuckey- Kramer test indicated that a significant difference of H3K4me3 signal was present amongst individuals. Reference Figure 1 for a visual representation of the significant differences found. The Spearman's Rank Correlation resulted in a p-value of p=0.4198, showing no significant (p>0.05) correlation between previously reported MLH1 numbers and locations and H3K4me3 intensities. Figure 1. H3K4me3 intensity averag es in individual rams. The dots represent the intensity average of each spermatocyte per individual. The black lines represent the mean intensity per individual. A, B, and C indicate significant (p<0.05) differences. Accomplishments: Through this research, we were able to conclude that significant differences of H3K4me3 intensities were observed amongst individuals of both Suffolk and Targhee sheep. However, no significant correlation to the previously reported MLH1 data was present. A better understanding of the relationship between H3K4me3 and MLH1 was developed, but it is still unclear how variations among these proteins control or influence PRDM9. This study contributes to the overall understanding of PRDM9 as well as sets a precedence for future work. As a student, I gained a more in-depth knowledge of the process of meiotic recombination and the many factors that contribute to it. I also had the opportunity to improve my bench work skills as well as obtain one on one training in advanced cytogenetic techniques and fluorescence microscopy. This was a summer of growth, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from such great mentors. I am thankful to have gotten the opportunity to participate in this research project. I sincerely thank the ID SBoE for providing the funding that made this possible!

Animal and Veterinary Science Project Title: Nutritional characteristics of a modified lignin product Abstract The objective of this preliminary study was to evaluate feeding behavior of Holstein dairy heifers when offered a lignin product as a component of pelleted feed. Five feed pellets were prepared: a positive control containing molasses, a negative control containing neither molasses nor the product, and three pellets containing the product in varying levels - low, medium, high - plus molasses. Growing Holstein heifers (16 months of age, average BW = 399 \u00b1 9 kg) were placed into individual pens (3 x 5 meters) with one pelleted feed offered at a time to test the acceptability of each feed. Feeding behaviors were recorded for each animal in a specified amount of time (60 min). A total of 129 observations were statistically analyzed. Preliminary data show the animals accepted the pelleted feed containing the high inclusion lignin product more than the other feeds: heifers consumed more feed within 60 minutes (P < 0.0001) and per approach (P < 0.0001). Heifers spent less time ruminating (P < 0.0006) and eating (P < 0.0001) when the negative control was offered compared with that of other feeds except the low inclusion. We are currently evaluating rumen fermentation characteristics of pelleted feeds containing the modified lignin product. Project Description All plant material is made of cellulose, lignin, and hemicellulose. Cellulose and hemicellulose are made of glucose molecules bound by -linkages. Most mammals lack the enzymes to break the bonds between the glucose molecules. Cattle contain microbes in there stomach that ferment cellulose and hemicellulose and convert them to volatile fatty acids that the animal can convert to glucose and ATP. However, there are always losses as the microbes cannot remove all the cellulose from the lignin. These losses can be detrimental, especially in dairy cattle. High-producing dairy cows struggle to eat enough nutrients to supply their maintenance requirements and produce milk. The cows need as much readily available food as possible. As such, many companies have worked and developed products that remove the cellulose from the lignin. One company has created a process to thermally and chemically modify products high in lignin - such as wood chips and wheat straw - and make them more degradable. The process creates a liquid mixture that could be used as a binding agent to replace molasses in pelleted feed. This project used the modified lignin from the above process to make a feed pellet, observing how well the pellet binds. An acceptability test was performed on the pellet; heifers were observed on how they respond to this new feed. The pellets will be analyzed in vitro for digestibility and fermentability. Finally, a palatability test will be performed: heifers will be observed on how they respond to a feed while the negative control is present. Project Accomplishments Five feed pellets were developed using the heifer ration. The negative control did not contain the product or molasses. The positive control contained molasses. Three test pellets containing various levels of the product - high, medium, and low - as well as molasses. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 52 33 An acceptability trial was performed using eight growing Holstein heifers 16 months of age and 30 days pregnant. The animals were removed from feed at least 30 minutes prior to each feeding. Each animal was individually placed in a pen (3.4 x 3.7 meters) with a feed. The order of animals and feeds were randomized. The feeds were weighed before and after each trial and then converted to dry matter intake. The animals were left with the feed for 45-60 minutes and recorded via camcorder. The video was analyzed for the time the animals spent eating, ruminating, wandering, drinking, and the number of approaches to the feed. The preliminary data show that the animals accepted the new product. They ate more of the high inclusion lignin product than the others (P < 0.0001). The animals spent more time eating (P < 0.0001) when in the pen with the high inclusion lignin product. The animals approached and ate the high inclusion lignin product more than the other feeds ( P < 0.0001). Two cannulated beef heifers were fed a Holstein heifer ration for one week. Then rumen fluid was collected to perform in vitro analysis. The samples were placed in the rumen fluid for varying amounts of time - 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours - and then analyzed for fiber degradation and organic matter degradation. They were compared to the original sample degradation values. In vitro data is still preliminary and has not been statistically analyzed. More replications are required and will be performed over the next few weeks. The volatile fatty acids have not been analyzed yet as the GC machine was being used for another project. The palatability trial will begin August 9, 2019. The feeding portion of the trial should be complete by August 30, 2019. All the videos should then be analyzed by the end of September. The project is still ongoing under the supervision of Dr. Rezamand and three of his students.

Environmental modulation of this reflexive response may underpin defensive maneuvers in prey species. Though this phenomenon is found in many mammals, the nature of anatomical connectivity between auditory and locomotor neurons remains unclear in desert kangaroo rats . Identifying the neuroanatomical nature of this auditory-locomotor pathway is a major step towards understanding how species-specific anatomical and functional properties of this pathway may underpin success rate of kangaroo rats in the wild. To evaluate the anatomical connectivity, a trans-synaptic retrograde pseudorabies virus was injected into the right gastrocnemius muscle and induces the expression of green fluorescent protein in all presynaptic neurons that are synaptically connected to the afferent motor neuron of the muscle, whether they be motor or not. Following 5-7 days of recovery after viral injection, kangaroo rats were euthanized, and their brains removed, frozen and sectioned coronally. Tissue sections containing all central auditory nuclei were then mounted directly onto slides or immunohistochemically labeled to amplify visibility of GFP expression. Sections were imaged through a microscope where GFP expression was observed in motor nuclei within the brainstem and midbrain along with the cochlear nucleus, a key site for mediating the acoustic startle response. Slices from the auditory pathway were also taken to observe if there is further involvement of higher order auditory brain regions that may contribute to the acoustic startle in k- rats. Project Description and Accomplishments: Desert kangaroo rats (dipodomys deserti) are a desert adapted species that thrive off their ability to escape predators through evasive techniques. Evolutionary changes suggest that the kangaroo rat developed strong bipedal hops in relation to heightened auditory response when startled by predators. In this project, we hypothesize that a direct connection between the auditory system and motor neurons controlling the escape jump is what enables kangaroo rats to react at a faster rate than other small mammals under similar conditions. The goal of this project is to identify the neuroanatomical nature of a potential connection between the auditory and locomotor systems. Live desert kangaroo rats collected by Craig McGowan and his research team from the Mojave Desert for their experiments were used. Samples were injected with a PRV-152 virus strain that infected nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction that were connected to distal regions of the spine. The virus traveled up into the cervical region of the spine, onto the brain stem, where it then infected presynaptic neurons and subsequently motor and auditory cortices.

Serial sections of the brains were sliced using a cryostat and stained using an immunohistochemistry protocol that expressed Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in brain slice samples. The main takeaways from this project showed that using PRV-152, a trans-synaptic pseudorabies virus, allows labeling of any neural circuit. In our experiment, this viral tracer can label auditory brain stem neurons suggesting they are linked to motor neurons.

Evidence from data supports anatomical connectivity that would underpin acoustic startle response in kangaroo rats. Expression was found in KRAT 1 sample at specific locations throughout the brain. Strong expression was found in reticular motor nuclei in posterior components of the brain that initially connected the brainstem and spine. Expression associated with movement was found in Nucleus raphe ragnus (RM), Parvicellular reticular nucleus (PARN). Additionally, expression was also presented in other portions such as Facial motor nucleus (VII), Dorsal cochlear nucleus ventral cochlear nucleus were one of the main components associated with auditory neurons and were a main component of startle circuit response.

Jaeger, Biological Sciences University of Idaho Faculty Mentor: Douglas G. Cole, Professor, Department of Biological Sciences Project Title: Optimizing Fatty Acid Production in Strains of Euglena gracilis Abstract A promising candidate for biofuel and nutritional supplements is the photosynthetic protist, Euglena gracilis. In addition to producing essential -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids E. gracilis, under certain conditions, produces high yield of waxy esters that can be used without modification as biofuel. E. gracilis also produces a range of fatty acids including those with methyl branching. Previous studies that focused on industrial lipid production examined the effect of autotrophic (photosynthesis only) and heterotrophic conditions. Our preliminary studies examined changes in fatty acid profile as a result of changing nutritional factors. In the current study, we compared these nutritional factors with different strains of E. gracilis, and the effects of environmental factors common to farming. E. gracilis can be grown under constant light, but to mimic outdoor farming they were grown in a 14:10 light:dark cycle. E. gracilis were also cultured at different temperatures to reflect different climes. Preliminary results show that artificial constant light negatively effects fatty acid production, and that temperature and strain choice critically effect growth rate. Project Accomplishments 1. Compared the relative amounts of various lipid groups in different strains of E. graci lis We harvested two strains of E. gracilis grown in identical conditions for comparison of the relative amounts of different lipid groups. This will be sent to Microbial ID for FAME analysis. The results will be used to determine the importance of strain choice on E. gracilis farming. 2. Compared the effect of a light:dark cycle on E. gracilis relative lipid production The relative amounts of different lipid groups were compared in cells that grew under 24 hr of light and cells that grew in a 14:10 light:da rk cycle. The relative amounts were tested in duplicates. We found that the relative amounts of key fatty acid groups (odd -chain, essential, and methyl -branched) were lower in the E. gracilis grown in 24 hr of light than the amounts in the light:dark cycle . 3. Compared the effect of temperature on E. gracilis relative lipid production Two strains of E. gracilis were grown in 16.5\u00b0C and 26.5\u00b0C. They were harvested at stationary phase and will be sent of Microbial ID for FAME analysis and the results compared between the two strains. Another strain of E. gracilis from the Yukon is being isolated for comparison in the study. 4. Compared the impact of nitrogen starvation on different strains of E. gracilis Two strains of E. gracilis were grown in four different nitrogen treatment groups: with nitrogen, without nitrogen, with only isoleucine, and with only alanine. These were harvested and will be sent to Microbial ID for FAME analysis. We will then compare the impact on different key lipid groups.

An effective treatment strategy for TCE contamination is bioremediation using reductively dechlorinating bacteria. However, during bioremediation changing pH levels can harm these degrading microbes. By incorporating the microbes into a polymer matrix, pH is buffered, and the microbes are protected. This study assessed the viability of model microorganisms (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus) in various compositions and molecular weights of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate (SA) hydrogels. A method to measure viability of bacteria cells in biobeads was developed. Viability was characterized using plate counts and optical density measurements. Preliminary data indicates increased viability in beads composed of higher molecular weight PVA. A second goal of the project was to determine if polymer modifications impact diffusion rates. Similarly sized ionic (methylene blue, metanil yellow) and neutral (caffeine) model compounds were used to investigate the effect of charge on diffusion. Diffusion of caffeine through hydrogel membranes was determined to be 40% slower in hydrogels containing bacterial cells than without biomass. Determination of encapsulated microbe viability assists in optimization of polymer formulations to better protect microbial consortia and improve degradation of contaminants. Project Accomplishments 1. One of my goals was to create an effective method for encapsulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei. I was successful in creating and refining a method for aseptically inoculating the PVA and SA polymers with bacteria and forming beads by chemically cross linking the inoculated polymer for 10 minutes in a crosslinker of 5.5% CaCl 2 for SA beads and 2% CaCl 2 and saturated boric acid for beads comprised of both SA and PVA. These beads were successfully stored in MRS broth and PBS buffer, with no short term impact on viability. 2. To determine comparative cellular viability of different polymer blends and molecular weights. I was able to determine that in both 10% PVA 2% SA and 5% PVA 2% SA hydrogel beads that higher molecular weight PVA produced increased viability after 2 days in MRS broth compared to lower weights. I noticed the highest viability and number of cells in 4% SA beads. 3. To explore alternative methods of crosslinking the hydrogels. I successfully made small batches of beads crosslinked by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. This was done with 5% PVA, 10% PVA, and 5% PVA 2% SA. 10% PVA beads form more quickly than the other two polymers, requiring fewer cycles. Forming beads is most successful on copper plates in a -20 \u00b0C freezer. The inclusion of polyoxometalates in low concentrations increases crosslinking ability of freeze/thaw cycles despite minimal dissolution.

However, 5-20% of the annua l corn yield i s lost to stalk lodging. Stalk lodging is a phenomenon in which forces from wind or rain break crops, and tall, top-heavy crops are e specially susceptible. In the past, researchers and plant breeders have examined this problem from an agronomic or biolog ical standpoint. However, little progre ss has been made. One of the main impediments to this proble m is the lack of a quantitative br eeding metric for stalk strength. My summer research proposed a solution to this proble m by investigating a ne w way to approximate the strength of each stalk by fir st examining the morphology of each stalk, using ba sic engin eering theorie s. I accomplished this b y performing punc ture te sts on a large sa mple of 1000 naturally-dried corn stalks. Each puncture test genera tes a force displacement graph, which can be analyzed to retrieve information such as diameter and rind thickne ss. This data was then analy zed by cu stomizing a MATLAB algorithm. In particular, thi s algorithm created several values which combined the morpholog ical values derived from the punc ture te sts (i.e. the moment of inertia and the s ection modulus) with the puncture re sistance forces measured during testin g. The results of this experiment showed that the puncture re sistance- weighted values had a very strong correlation with stalk strength, and further testing and investigation would be of value. Project D escrip tion: Stalk lodging is a proble m tha t affec ts some of the most important crops in the world. Lodging occurs whe n for ces from wind or rain irreparably damage a crop, causing financ ial and food losses. One of the most essential crops affected by this phenomenon is maize, with 5-20% of the annual yield being lost due to lodging. This has long since prompted researchers to inve stigate methods of strengthening corn stalks, but severa l impediments stil l exist that prevent much progress from being made. One major proble m is the lack of a quantitative breeding metric for breeders to assess lodging re sistance. My summer research involved developing a novel technique to determine stalk strength that I believe could provide a solution for this issue. This research e mploy s puncture tests to evaluate maize stalks from a morpholog ical standpoint inst ead of a biolog ical or agronomi cal one, as has bee n done in the pa st. To beg in, I performed puncture tests on a sample of 1000 dr ied cornstalk s. To perform the te sts, e ach stalk was loaded into a universa l testing machine which had been fitted with custom att achments, including one to support each sta lk and on e which acted as a puncture probe. This probe had a 2- mm diame ter and a 45 degree cha mfer a t the tip. The stalks were loaded in the same manner each ti me, with the minor dia meter ax is paralle l to the vertical. Nex t, a puncture test was performed on each internode of each stalk. Af ter each puncture test, a force displ acement graph was produced which gave information about the diame ter and rind thickness of the stalk when examined properly. One such graph is displayed in figure 1. This information was used to calculate other valuable information about the morphology of each stalk, such a s the moment of inertia and the section modulus, both of which give insight into the strength of a stalk. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 60 41 Moment (N-mm) These values (the moment of inertia and section modulus) were also weighted with the puncture resistance forces seen in the force displ acement graph. This m eant that the outside of each stalk, which has a strong, hard rind, would count more towards the se values than the inside pith, which is soft and fu ll of voids. Af ter each value had been calcula ted using a customized MATLAB algorithm, correlations were made be tween the newly calculated values and the approximated strength of each stalk, which had been calculated in previous experiments. Project A ccomp lishments: This project accomplished many things. First, a table of da ta from the 1000 stalks wa s created, leaving a valuable wealth of information that can be examined for trends for years to come. Already, other ways of optimizing maize stalks are being examined using this data. In a ddition to thi s, I was able to customize a MATLAB algorithm specifically for maize puncture tests. This should ensure that anyone wanting to process future da ta will be able to do so quickly and easily using the sa me setup. This is e specially important because during my projec t, I had a chance to trave l to the Univer sity of Kentucky and train other students in performing punc ture tests. This collaboration will allow additional data to be coll ected and examined for further studie s and confirmation of result s. The most significant resu lt of this project was the strong correlation found be tween the for ce- weighted values tha t were calculated and the approximated strength values found in previous studies. Correlations wer e created for each value calculated from the MATLAB algorithm. These values are shown in table 1.

As can be s een in Table 1, the force-weighted values have a much better correlation with strength than the plain values. This information i s extremely important. Puncture tests are much quicker and much less destructive to perfor m than other measurements of stalk strength, making them a more optimal option. Additionally, it might be possible to create a hand-he ld device to evaluate puncture re sistance in the fie ld inst ead of in a lab, which would make da ta coll ection quick, easy, and inexpensive.

Forest, Rangeland, and Fire Sciences Project Title: Wearable Technology for Cows: Applications for Virtual Fencing Project Overview: Managing the distribution of grazing animals is necessary for animal husbandry, effective land stewardship, and protecting sensitive and riparian lands. Virtual fencing is the idea where the negative reinforcement is worn by the animal rather than by restricting movement by wire and posts. Virtual fencing pairs location-based communication technology with wireless fencing, such as that used in dog collars and invisible fencing, to control the distribution, location, and movement of livestock. Virtual fencing has the potential to significantly improve livestock management on open range and reduce the costs and impacts of physical fencing. Virtual fencing can be deployed in an inclusion mode where animals are kept within a defined area for instance to graze residual crops or for rotational grazing within smaller pastures. Virtual fencing can also be used to exclude animals from riparian and other sensitive areas or achieve remote rotational grazing of pastures and ranges Virtual fencing will require a device that stays on the animal and does not negatively affect health and productivity. Objectives: 1) Relationship between age, weight, and nose size of individual animals; 2) Best anatomical fit and least irritation to the animal by testing three shapes and sizes of nose pads; 3) Maximum weight to allow the device to remain in place on the animal for 1 month in a natural grazing setting. This research facilitates designing technologies to study the application of virtual fencing and how it affects livestock which will ultimately contribute to a revolution in the way rangelands and riparian areas are managed and grazed. Results: Our results show that within the two age groups of cattle, primiparous yearling heifers and multiparous cows, there is little difference in nose size and shape among animals in the same age group. In addition, a spherical shape is a good starting point for a contact for the device and 40 grams of weight on the nose of a yearling heifer is too much for long term wear, while 110 grams appears to be less irritating to the mucosal tissues. Of the 20 yearling heifers that were used in the two (2) week device wearing study, seven (7) devices fell off; four (4) were 140 grams and three (3) were 110 grams. We know that we must create a finished working device of less than 110 grams.

The adsorption properties of high surface area materials are well known and used in gold mining to get higher yields. However, using porous materials as nanoreactors is a current source of discovery. This project seeks to make mesoporous materials from organo-trialkoxy-silanes (RTOS) in order to make highly structured nanoreactors that can aide in forming highly aligned polymer fibers. The making of highly aligned polymer fibers can be done, but the mesoporous materials used in previous experiments are hard to replicate. Using RTOS in enhancing the surfactants used to create the mesoporous material has not yet be done. By creating a highly structured nanoreactors that can be more easily replicated will greatly assist future catalyst research. Project Accomplishments 1. Determine method of easily synthesizing mesoporous silica material from tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) with two to create MCM-41 using ionic surfactants and TEOS. (CTAB) the ionic surfactant. The first method called for TEOS to be added to a basic solution of surfactant along with expanding agents. The total time for this method takes about 26 hours. The second method adds TEOS to an acidic solution of surfactant and takes a total time of about one hour. Results: The second method proved to be the quicker reaction and had a yield of 76%. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) also was shown to be more similar to MCM-41 when using the second method. Based upon both those factors I decided to move forward using the second method as a base for creating MCM-41. 2. Optimize surfactant removal via calcination and dissolution with ethanol. Using the method decided upon above I then attempted to remove the surfactant from the MCM -41 after the solid p roduct had formed and been filtered out. Calcination at 550\u00b0C removes all the surfactant by oxidation. However, by oxidizing the surfactant, it all is destroyed. This would make any large -scale application potentially costly. Surfactant removal via dissolu tion with ethanol was used as the surfactant can then be recovered. Results: By using dissolution with ethanol to remove the surfactant 72% of the surfactant added to the reaction was recovered. 3. Analyze XRD and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) of silic a products. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 5 IRSA TAB 6 Page 6546 XRD was used to determine the ordering of the mesoporous silica products. TGA was used to determine mass reduction surfactant removal via calcination. Results: XRD of MCM -41 products made by the method suggested in 1 proved that it was MCM -41 material. However, XRD of the MCM -41 after surfactant removal by either calcination or dissolution showed a breakdown in the MCM -41 structure. TGA data showed that the solid product before surfactant removal was about 58% silica oxide. 4. Explore hydrothermal treatment as a method to prevent MCM -41 structure decomposition during Surfactant removal. The breakdown of the MCM -41 structure during surfactant removal showed that the method being used to create the material was not adequate. By introducing hydrothermal treatment, we hope to prevent the breakdown. Currently, experiments with hydrothermal treatments with varying temperature and time are being conducted to determine which is best for the preservation of the MCM- 41 structure after the removal of the surfactant. 5. Synthesize ionic surfactants for future use in Nano -ordering mesoporous silica. For future research it is important that many types of surfactants are experimented with. By combining and alkyl halide with an alkyl chain of 16 carbons to a tertiary amine a quaternary ammonium salt can be made. These types of surfactants like CTAB are ionic. Currently products are made, but still need to be purified and analyzed. More still need to be synthesized.

An effective treatment strategy for TCE contamination is bioremediation using reductively dechlorinating bacteria. However, during bioremediation changing pH levels can harm these degrading microbes. By incorporating the microbes into a polymer matrix, local pH gradients can be controlled, and the microbes are protected. This study assessed the viability of model microorganisms (Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus) in various compositions and molecular weights of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate (SA) hydrogels. A method to measure viability of bacteria cells in biobeads was developed and evaluated. Viability was characterized using plate counts and optical density measurements. Preliminary data indicates increased viability in beads composed of higher molecular weight PVA. A second goal of the project was to determine if polymer modifications influence diffusion rates. Similarly sized ionic (methylene blue, metanil yellow) and neutral (caffeine) model compounds were used to investigate the effect of charge on diffusion. Diffusion of caffeine through hydrogel membranes was determined to be 40% slower in hydrogels containing bacterial cells than without biomass. Determination of encapsulated microbe viability assists in optimization of polymer formulations to better protect microbial consortia and improve degradation of contaminants. Project Accomplishments: The initial goal of this project was to assess the viability of microorganisms within hydrogels of various polymer compositions and molecular weights. This project developed methodology for conducting viability tests with biobeads. Several procedures were proposed, tested, and modified to optimize bacteria survival rates and to most accurately depict the viability of the microorganisms during the polymer formation step. The best procedure developed (detailed in Figure 1) was used to characterize the viability of bacteria in 10% PVA (of three different molecular weights)/2% SA beads and the viability of the cells in 4% SA biobeads. The results indicate that the bead composition most Figure 1. The procedure to determine the viability of L. casei in polymer hydrogel biobeads.

Though the procedure worked sufficiently, future work will include further modifications to the viability testing process as well as testing of more polymer combinations. Characterizing the viability of microorganisms within the polymer hydrogels is a critical first step towards implementing this technology to improve bioremediation processes for TCE contaminated sites. The second goal of this project was to investigate the diffusion properties of the polymer hydrogel, and this was accomplished by investigating the diffusion of three similarly sized neutral (caffeine) and ionic (metanil yellow and methylene blue) compounds through polymer pucks. These compounds were selected to quantify different electrostatic versus size filtering interactions with the polymers. Caffeine diffused the fastest, while diffusion of the charged compounds was substantially slowed, presumably due to electrostatic interactions with the polymers (Figure 2). Understanding reactions and interactions of molecules with the polymer hydrogels helps in optimization of the biobead size and polymer combinations to best accommodate the microorganisms and most efficiently degrade contaminants.

With the rapid development of nanotechnology in the recent decade, novel gene delivery in T cells is being studied to replace the expensive viral vectors in immunotherapy. In this study, calcium-alginate nanoparticles were synthesized with water -in-oil emulsion method using a tip-sonicator. The obtained size and morphology of the nanoparticles were observed to be varied with volume and concentration of sodium alginate, and surfactant used. To examine the potency of Caalginate nanoparticles as carriers for gene delivery in human cells, GFPencoding plasmids were encapsulated in these nanoparticles. The transfection rate was then investigated in A549 cells, Mesenchymal stem cells and Jurkat T cells. Our results showed that Caalginate nanoparticles with an average size of 200 nm in diameter were capable for delivering gene in A549 cells and Mesenchymal Stem cells. We have not observed any gene delivery in T cells. Project Accomplishments 1. One of my goals was to synthesize the nanoparticle with the average size of 150 nm Alginate nanoparticles in this study were developed with water in oil emulsion method using a tip sonicator. The nanoparticles were formed by calcium crosslinking of guluronic acid units of alginate polymer where dichloromethane was used as the oil phase. To get an accurate size of around 150 nm, the nanoparticles were synthesized using different volume and concentration of sodium alginate and surfactant. The alginate nanoparticles were collected by ultracentrifugation and then characterized by measuring its size and charge by a zeta potentiometer. Result - The average size of nanoparticle characterized by zeta potentiometer was 200 nm. As expected, the size of Ca-alginate nanoparticles decreased with the decrease in the volume and concentration of sodium alginate and surfactant used. 2. To investigate the transfection rate of synthesized calcium alginate nanoparticles in A549 cells, mesenchymal stem cells and cells the nanoparticles were capsulated with GFP-encoding plasmids. In a 2-well cell culture plates A549 cells, MSC and Jurkat T cells were allowed to adhere at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The alginate nanocarriers were suspended in DMEM and was added directly to the cells. Alginate nanoparticles were incubated with the cells for 12 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Transfection efficacy in these cells were evaluated by measuring the percentage of cells expressing the exogenously delivered GFP in fluorescence microscope. Result -The gene delivery in A549 cells and MSC were more efficient than T cells, because MSC and A549 cells grow as a monolayer, attaching to the culture flask T cells are suspension cells; that grow by floating in the cell culture medium.

The aim of our research was to explore the feasibility of the fixation of nitrogen into NO3- and NO2- ions using a novel electrical discharge process (EDP) for producing a green fertilizer out of the air, water and electricity as input. At the discharge point in the EDP reactor, nitrogen and oxygen molecules dissociate into various reactive radicals and recombine into stable oxidative ions of NO3- and NO2- as the plasma discharge takes place. With a fixed air flow rate of 0.8 L/min, the concentration of NO3- and NO2- were profiled at different applied power levels for a batch of 300 ml water circulating through the EDP reactor for treatment. It was found that the concentration of NO3- increased with the increase in power and time of treatment. However, the NO2- concentration stably increased at lower power levels and decreased significantly at higher power. At 235 watts (W), the concentration of NO2- increased from 0.571 mg/l to 19.1 mg/l within 32 min. Similarly, the concentration of NO3- increased from 0.031mg/l to 84.6mg/l at the same operational conditions. When the power was increased to 358W, the concentration of NO2- increased from 0.005 mg/l to 17.8 mg/l in 16 minutes then it decreased to 0.019 mg/l by the end of 32 minutes, with NO3- increased from 0.114 mg/l to 266mg/l. At 417W, the concentration of NO2- fluctuated at a low level but the NO3- elevated from 0.354mg/l to 241 mg/l in the 32-minute period. This technology could be potentially developed for large scale production of nitrate fertilizer. Project Accomplishments: Objective 1: Study the effect of air flow rate on NOx production In our previous preliminary experiments, we used 1-slpm as our input. So, one of the objectives of this research was to experiment with different air flow and understand its effect. For this experiment we added mass flow meter to our experimental setup to achieve consistent air flow. Result: We found out that the production of NOx ions increases with the increase in air flow rate. But at high flow rate, if water circulation is not enough then burning occurs. The highest concentration we achieved at 100slpm water flow rate is 815gm/liter. Objective 2: Study the effect of water flow rate on NOx production To understand the effect of water circulation we are still conducting more experiment with multiple liquid flow rate. Since our system design did not withstand higher liquid pressure, necessary changes are recommended and are being made. As of now we are inconclusive of the effect of the liquid flow rate of NOx production. Result: I will volunteer to complete experiments regarding effect of liquid flow rate during fall and I expect that with increasing flow rate the production increases. Finally, after the completion of second objective, I will determine the optimum flow rate for production of NOx using plasma reactor.

This has been extensively studied in female athletes and is known as the Female Athlete Triad. Studies have shown a link between low energy availability and a low resting metabolic rate. Low energy availability is scarcely studied among the male demographic and minutely studied in sedentary populations. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between LEA and resting metabolic rate in college-aged non-athlete males. 19 participants completed this portion of the study and we've found no correlation between resting metabolic rate and energy availability (r s= .184, p=.450). However, we did find a correlation between lean body mass and RMR (r s=.570, p<0.001). Project Objectives and Accomplishments: 1. To establish and confirm a correlation between body mass and resting metabolic rate. Upon doing our research we found a correlation between lean body mass and resting metabolic rate. Resting metabolic rate was taken with a \"Body Gem\" indirect calorimeter right after waking, with zero food or drink 8 hours prior to the test. This machine measures your resting metabolic rate, which is how many calories your body burns in a day completely at rest. It does this to obtain and continue equilibrium and regular physiological functioning. Muscle tissue requires a lot more energy to obtain and continue to have. Muscle cells are very active physiologically. So when we found that the males with more lean body mass (muscle), had a higher RMR- (r s=.570, p<0.001), it confirmed my hypothesis. 2. Determine the relationship between Energy Availability and Resting Metabolic rate. My hypothesis was that if an individual had low energy availability, it would mean their body would have to operate at a lower RMR (lower caloric intake= lower energy surplus). Although this was determined and confirmed true in female populations with the female athlete triad, it was not true for the males in our study. We found no correlation between the two - (r s= .184, p=.450).

This funding has enabled us to increase our Undergraduate Research activity and enhance our undergraduate researc h mentoring program. Students were required to complete an application that outlined their academic goals and how the y expected to benefit f rom the funds. In addition, the Office for Research saw this as an opportunity to LISTEN to our undergraduate students and learn what they thought about research . We included a page with the application with questions about mentoring and research. We will use the answers to help us improve our Undergraduate mentoring program. Our Undergraduate research students have continually showed their appreciation for the opportunity to participate in Undergraduate research and have told us how the ir research experience has changed their lives. This enhanced terms and conditions allowed us to distribute these funds a bit differently. We were able to support our Department of Biology by awarding them $17,000 for their Undergraduate Research faculty and students. The $17,000 supported 15 faculty in undergraduate research projects, 1 8 Undergraduate students that are pursuing a degree in Biological Sciences. One student utilized $1,000 of these funds to assist in hosting the first Psi Chi Psychology conference here at Idaho State University. These funds were a huge benefit to our Undergraduate students who would not have the funding to travel to a regional conference in a neighboring state. While bringing a diversity of attendees for our Undergraduate students to have the opportunity to network with, it also puts ISU and our Undergraduate research in Psychology program in the spotlight. Undergraduate students from other universities have been able to see and experience our university , our Undergraduate research students, faculty, and Psychology program s. With these funds, we also awarded six undergraduate research students funding to attend and present at a conference and funded another five Undergraduate research projects. The stude nts' reports and copies of posters are available on Box in a file that will be shared with Dr. Cathleen McHugh.

Project Overview In 2016, the digital universe produced 16 ZB (1 ZB = 1 trillion GB) of data. In 2025 it will create 163 ZB. These data, once generated, cascade through the information lifecycle \u2014 from primary storage media in the form of hard disks and solid-state drives to archival media such as tape. While the semiconductor industry maximizes the density, stability, and energy efficiency of electronic and magnetic memory, both are fast approaching their physical and economic finish lines. As envisioned by the new Semiconductor Synthetic Biology Roadmap, DNA-based massive information storage is a fresh start for memory manufacturing in the United States. According to our study with Micron, Harvard, and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), DNA has a retention time that ranges from thousands to millions of years, 1 kg of DNA can store the projected digital universe in 2040, and DNA's energy of operation is 100 million times less than current electronic memory. As a result, nucleic acid memory has become a global conversation, a national investment, an industrial opportunity, and a local strength in Idaho. Our vision is to pioneer a digital data storage paradigm in Idaho by designing, building, and testing accessible, editable, and non-volatile nucleic acid memory (NAM) technologies that are inspired by DNA circuits and made possible by our innovations in DNA nanotechnology. With support from IGEM-HERC, we are creating a Nucleic Acid Memory Institute to meet critical innovation, economic, and workforce development needs in Idaho. To expedite our vision of Idaho becoming a global leader in NAM, five tasks are being addressed over the life of the IGEM-HERC: Task 1 - Create efficient algorithms for coding information into data strands. Error correction strategies will account for DNA insertions, deletions, and substitutions, as well as screen for biological sequences to ensure that the data has no genetic function . Task 2 - Create a high-throughput, integrated analytical engine to design and select data strands using quantitative metrics based on an in-house, algorithm. Task 3 - Create synthetic biological factories for manufacturing DNA scaffolds using rapid design-build-test cycles of genomes. Genome size and structure will be engineered . Task 4 - Design and fabricate NAM storage platforms using the DNA scaffolds, and validate the functionality of genome scaffolds using atomic force microscopy . Task 5 - Read arbitrary data files into NAM storage nodes using super-resolution microscopy. Realize sub- nanometer imaging resolution to enable high areal density data storage. This progress report spans July 1, 2019 to January 1, 2020. Listed below is a technical summary of our accomplishments during this time period. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 3 4 III. Summary of project accomplishments The support provided by IGEM-HERC during year 1 of this project provided the infrastructure and team to create the first digital Nucleic Acid Memory (dNAM) proof-of-concept. Building on this foundation, which was described in the July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 Annual Report, we conducted a series of experiments to validate dNAM, which provides key insights into the future of a DNA-based information storage roadmap. This work has led to a manuscript to be submitted next reporting period to either Nature Materials or Nature Communications. The content of the manuscript is highlighted below and represents the project tasks during this reporting period. The work is transdisciplinary by nature and highlights collaboration between materials science, computer science, biomolecular sciences, and electrical engineering at Boise State University. Encoding and recovery of 'Data is in our DNA!\\n' using dNAM We designed an information encoding/decoding algorithm that combines fountain codes with a custom error detection scheme for dNAM. Fountain codes are intended for transmission of data over noisy channels and have great potential to generate a limitless sequence of encoding packets (called \"droplets\") from a single source message. Droplets can be received in any order and still be decoded to retrieve a message, regardless of the exact distribution of the droplets collected. With our error correction scheme, decoding of individual origami (each origami encodes a single droplet, plus indexing and error-correction information) is robustly achieved even in the presence of high noise by determining the minimum number of operations required to resolve the errors detected by the error detecting code (i.e. minimum edit distance). Combined with the redundancy provided by the fountain code, this leads to recovery of the entire data file with high reliability. To test our dNAM data storage protocol, we synthesized fifteen unique 6 x 8 grid DNA-origami structures with the encoded random-access message ' Data is in our DNA!\\n '. Each of the memory blocks contained a 4-bit binary index (0000 - 1110), a 16-bit data droplet, 20 bits for parity checks, 4 bits for checksums, and 4 bits acting as orientation markers (Fig. 1A). To rapidly recover the message encoded in the blocks, we used DNA-PAINT to optically image a mixture of the dNAM blocks\u2014below the diffraction limit of light\u2014in a single recording (Fig. 1B, DNA-PAINT). Once DNA-PAINT had been used to identify the positions of all data strands in the 512 x 512 pixel field of view, a custom image processing algorithm was used to rotate and fit the data strands to a 6 x 8 grid and translate the signal detected at each grid location to a 48 bit binary string (Fig. 1B, Processing) for error correction, data recovery, and message reconstruction (Fig. 1B, Error Correction and Decode). We were able to identify all data strands in every origami (Fig. 2) from a single DNA-PAINT recording of 4 \u00b5l of a 5 nM mixture of DNA-origami (approximately 4,500 individual DNA-origami). By doing so, all fifteen origami were decoded to successfully retrieve the message ' Data is in our DNA!\\n '. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 4 5 Figure 1. (A) Write: dNAM data packets can be written, stored, and read using DNA-origami and DNA-PAINT imaging. To 'Write' our test message ('Data is in our DNA!\\n') fifteen DNA-origami were synthesized based on designs generated by the encoding algorithm in three steps depicted vertically in ( A). For clarity the writing process is only shown for three of the fifteen structures (0, 1 and 14), however, the same process was carried out for all origami synthesized. First, the test message was partitioned into 16 bit non- overlapping segments and droplets formed by combining the segments via binary XOR ( ) operations ( A. Droplet Creation ). The data droplets were assigned binary indexes (0000-1110), had parity and checksum bits calculated and were mapped to a 6 x 8 array, along with 4 orientation maker bits. The colors of the index (red), droplet (green), parity (blue), checksum (yellow) and orientation (magenta) bits correspond to their mapped positions in the array ( A. Encoding ). Finally, 2D DNA-origami with 46 addressable data- staples situated at ~10 nm intervals in a 95 x 70 nm hexagonal lattice were synthesized. Data-strands including binding domains for M1 imager probes represented binary '1' data points (black), while data-strands representing '0' (light grey) did not have a binding site extension ( A. Synthesis ). Following synthesis, the origami were gel purified, combined in equal amounts (~0.33 nM final concentration of each origami) and stored at 4 \u00baC. (B) Read: The four 'Read' steps used to recover the test message from the DNA- origami suspension are shown in ( B). 4 ul of the DNA-origami mixture (containing all 15 origami) was diluted to 0.05 nM total origami DNA (0.5 TBE, 18 mM MgCl 2), deposited onto a glass coverslip using Glow discharge and imaged using DNA-PAINT with Cy3b-labelled imager probes complementary to the binding domains of the data-strands. A rendered image of the full-chip recording (~ 54 x 54 \u00b5m) is shown ( top left) with a zoomed-in view of several individual DNA-origami ( top right ), one of which is a triangular structure used to aid drift correction ( D. DNA-PAINT ). The origami in the rendered image were identified using cluster analysis, individually fit to a 6 x 8 grid and thresholded to obtain binary outputs for each position of the array ( B. Processing ). Once the origami images were converted to 48 bit binary strings the decode algorithm used the parity, checksum and orientation bits to correct errors where possible. In the three representative origami structures, both false negative (red squares) and false positive (blue squares) are observable ( B. Error Correction ). When there were 7 total errors in a binary string with at least 13 data droplets and indexes recovered, the decode algorithm corrected errors and successfully retrieved the entire message ( B. Decode ). At the concentration of DNA deposited, all of the data droplets and indexes, and thus the entire message, were correctly decoded from a single 40,000 frame DNA-PAINT recording.

'Averaged' images of 4560 randomly selected DNA origami, grouped by index, are depicted right ( SRM). Scale bar, 10 nm. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 6 7 Input / Output Variability Comparing the decode algorithm output with each of the 15 input origami designs (each having a total of 223-338 structures within the 5 nM mixture mixture) indicate varying numbers of each origami were successfully recovered. For example, while on average only ~6 copies of origami design 2 were correctly decoded per experiment, ~147 copies of origami design 6 were successfully decoded (Fig. 3A, B). These differences in recovery can partially be explained by the variability in the numbers of errors seen in each structure (Fig. 3C). Specifically, the decode algorithm was only able to error-correct origami with 7 or fewer total errors, and only up to two false positive errors. The mean errors of the best recovered origami designs (1, 5, 6, 12 and 14) are all lower than these thresholds. A plot of the origami decoded against the mean error rate indicates that there is a strong relationship between both the total number of errors and the number of false negative errors and the ability of the algorithm to decode an individual origami's data (Fig. 3D). False positives errors, however, are randomly distributed around a mean of 2, but with a wide Figure 3. After image processing the origami were assigned an index based on their similarity to the origami designs. The left histogram ( A) indicates the numbers of individual origami identified from a single full-chip DNA-PAINT recording (512 x 512 pixel sensor) based on similarity to the designs (mean counts shown as black bars, percentage of total origami in red). These origami were also decoded using the decode algorithm. ( B) Depicts the percent of origami passed to the decode algorithm that had both their indexes and data strings correctly identified. ( C) The variability in the mean number of false positive (top) and negative (below) error for each structure is shown. In graph ( D) the percentage of each origami decoded are plotted against the mean number of errors for each structure. Mean values for three experiments are shown throughout, error bars indicate \u00b1SD. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10111213140150300 origami indexmean # detected 01234567 % of total origami 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 101112131402550origami decoded (%) origami index 0510mean # errors 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 140510 false positives0510total errors false negatives origami index6 8 10 1202550 0 5 1002550% origami decoded mean # of errorsfalse positives false negativesA B C D INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 7 8 spread of decoded origami (~1-49%) \u2014 suggesting that the location of a false positive error within a structure plays an important role in determining whether the origami designs can be successfully decoded. Source of Errors By categorizing the errors of origami with 15 or less errors by their positions within an array (outer edge, mid and inner region) and normalizing (dividing the position error by the mean error of all of the sites), it is possible to pool all fifteen different origami designs to see if there are consistent differences between regions. Plots of the mean normalized errors indicate that the outer edges and interior of the array are differentially prone to false negative and false positive errors (Fig. 4). Our results indicate differences in successful strand incorporation between the inner and outer regions that could explain the differences in the numbers of errors observed. However, an alternative explanation could be that data-strands on the outer edge of an array are less likely to be affected by contaminating signals from neighboring sites (which would increase the chances of false positives) and vice-versa for interior sites. To further investigate sources of potential sources of error in our array designs, we performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging on individual DNA-origami deposited on mica. From the averaged SRM images in Fig. 1, it can be seen that every data strand was recorded at least once for all expected positions in all arrays. This suggests that there were no systematic failures in strand incorporation or data-strand binding domains. This is further substantiated by the AFM images, in which origami were typically both well formed (lacking holes and having the expected dimensions) and appeared to have incorporated the majority of their data-strands. Although it was possible to resolve the majority of data strands positions (Fig. 5), a strict analysis on missing data strands using AFM would not be completely reliable since tip-sample interactions could easily promote strand compression and displacement. Figure 4. The outer edges and inner regions of origami are differentially error prone. The array positions of origami with 15 or less errors (as identified by pattern matching) were classified as either 'outer', 'mid' or 'inner' depending on their position in the array (A). The mean error for each classification was calculated and normalized by dividing by the overall mean error for that zone. Plots of the mean normalized false negative ( B) and false positive values ( C) for each zone are shown. Mean values for three experiments are shown, Error bars indicate SD. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 8 9 We also used AFM to examine DNA-origami deposited onto a glass coverslip immediately following SRM imaging. We were not able to resolve individual binding sites in these images (most likely due to the increased roughness of glass, as compared to mica), however it was possible to count the total number of origami in a field of view for comparison with structures visualized by SRM. The densities of origami estimated from the images were 2.4 and 1.4 origami/\u00b5m2 for AFM and SRM respectively, suggesting that ~60% of the total origami deposited have their binding sites facing away from the coverslip and available for imager strand binding. Figure 5. AFM images of DNA origami data nodes. Representative AFM images of all 15 dNAM \"Data is in our DNA!/n\" data node origami, where most of dockings sites are visible. (An inverse FFT analysis with a band rejected filter has been applied to highlight the dockings positions in right-hand panels). Every image is 90 x 110 nm and the color scale ranges over 250 pm. Implications We have created\u2014through a systems-engineering approach\u2014a new technology where digital data is encoded into multiple DNA origami structures and can be retrieved optically below the diffraction limit of light via super-resolution microscopy. By encoding our data using Fountain codes, combined with bi-level error detection/correction, the amount of redundancy required for successful data recovery is minimized (with 100% data retrieval ensured with sufficient node creation). While we have encoded the short message ' Data is in our DNA!/n ' as a proof-of- principal, dNAM platform is scalable and thus has potential for competing with current data storage technologies. For comparisons, our dNAM prototype currently allows for a data storage density 480 Gbit/cm2, a more than ten-fold improvement relative to state-of-the-art magnetic tape capacity of 31 Gbit/cm\u00b2.

Demonstration of economic development and impact External Funding During this reporting period, we did not pursue external funding opportunities. Instead, we devoted ourselves to our current funding from IGEM/HERC, the National Science Foundation, and the Semiconductor Research Corporation. In doing so, we established dNAM as a new memory technology that is both information dense and has the promise of being stable for neo-archival applications. When published, this work will further position our team as a pioneer in DNA memory. Moving forward, the research team is on track to submit one proposal to an external funding agency before the end of the next reporting period. Engagement With the backing of the NSF Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities, Hughes hosted the 2019 Germination Meeting at Boise State University on August 15-16, 2019. The meeting focused on new approaches in cultivating risk-taking and impact-driven research culture. As noted in the Year 1 Annual Report, the National Science Foundation (NSF) in collaboration with the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) jointly awarded the research team $1,500,000 to address the scientific challenges facing NAM technologies. The funding mechanism was called Semiconductor Synthetic Biology for Information Processing and Storage Technologies . As part of this funding, the SRC holds an annual conference to showcase \" the quality and breadth of the SRC research portfolio, the excellence of SRC students and faculty, and the magnitude of the collaborative research investment made by industry through SRC .\" Hughes and two PhD students (now graduated) on the NAM team, Chris Green and Mike Tobiason, attended the conference, which was held in Austin, Texas from September 8-10. \"The conference features student presentations and posters and gives SRC member companies multiple formal and Demonstration of Economic Development and Impact Year 1 Reporting Period 07/01/2018-06/30/2019 Current Reporting Period 07/01/2019-01/01/2020 External Funding $ 1,549,995 0, because we are doing the work Number of External Grants 3 0, because we are doing the work Private Sector Engagement 14 companies 2 companies , 1 VC group University Engagement 11 universities ~20 universities Federal Agency Engagement 5 agencies 4 (NSF, SRC , NRL, NIST ) Industry Involvement 2 companies 2 companies (Micron, SRC) Patents 0 0 Copyrights 0 0 Plant Variety Protection Certificates 0 0 Technology Licenses Signed 0 0 News Releases 3 articles 0 Start-up Businesses Started 0 1 Jobs Created outside of BSU 0 6 INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 10 11informal occasions to network with SRC students.

These networking occasions with SRC member companies give student opportunities to open the door to future full-time employment. \" Hughes was also among a select group of scholars, industry stakeholders, and program managers to participate in a workshop on Nucleic Acid Nanotechnology. The workshop, held in Boston, Massachusetts on Dec. 7, 2019, was co-sponsored by the Materials Research Society and the prestigious Kavli Foundation. The goals of the workshop were to establish \"priority research areas for next-generation applications of nucleic acid nanotechnology across diverse domains spanning computation, sensing, fabrication, therapeutics, and other areas.\" Through this process, Hughes reinforced relationships with Harvard University (George Church, William Shih), MIT (Mark Bathe), NIST (James Liddle), NRL (Igor Medintz), John's Hopkins (Rebecca Schulman), as well as established new relationships with the editors of Nature and Nature Materials. Based on ideas shared, George Church opened his lab to members of the NAM Institute at Boise State. Business Development Steven Burden, who successfully completed his PhD in Biomolecular Sciences, graduated December 2019 as a member of the NAM Institute. Burden's dissertation topic was on the development of nucleic acid biosensors with allosteric fluorescence signals. For the NAM team, Burden played a lead role in our Vertically Integrated Project (VIP), where he trained undergraduate students to produce, purify, and ensure the quality control of single-stranded DNA scaffolds. Prior to graduating from Boise State, Burden co-founded a biotechnology startup (FACible BioDiagnostics \u2014 https://www.facible.com/ ). Based in Boise, Idaho, FACible BioDiagnostics is focused on developing rapid, low-cost, diagnostics. Burden began full time employment as the company's CEO on January 1, 2020. In addition, one of the co-founders, Clementine Gibard Bohachek, was a postdoctoral research scientist at Boise State University and was part of the NAM team during the spring of 2019, where she developed VIP training materials and trained VIP and NAM graduate students on practical laboratory approaches to synthetic biology. In all, FACible BioDiagnostics employs 6 people \u2014 three full time and three part time. The financial, scientific and professional support that Burden received during his PhD was critical for his ability to secure venture capital needed to start his company. The success of Burden highlights the entrepreneurial environment that is being cultivated by the NAM Institute and team. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 11 12V. Numbers of student, staff, and faculty participation From a professional development perspective, the goal of the NAM Institute is to ensure the success of the people that make up the team, from students and postdoctoral research scientists to the faculty and staff that enable open innovation, ideation, and collaboration. And with any academic environment, matriculation to graduation is expected, supported, and applauded. Thus, we are happy to report that during this reporting period three PhD students on the NAM project successfully defended their PhD dissertation and graduated: Steven Burden , PhD in Biomolecular Sciences, Dissertation \u2014 The Development of Nucleic Acid Biosensors with Allosteric Fluorescence Signals Chris Green , PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, Dissertation \u2014 Nanoscale Optical and Correlative Microscopies for Quantitative Characterization of DNA Nanostructures . Mike Tobiason, PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, Dissertation \u2014 Engineering Kinetically Uniform DNA Devices In addition, Reza Zadegan has started a tenure track faculty position at North Carolina A&T this past August. His professional development included but was not restricted to: grant writing support by Watson and Hughes; germination of research directions and intellectual risk management by Hughes; helping create his faculty package by Hughes, Andersen, and Hayden; mock interviews by Hughes; national and international networking opportunities by Hughes; technical training by Andersen, Hayden, Kuang, and Hughes; and professional training from Hughes and Watson. We also would like to acknowledge that one of the project principle investigators, Elton Graungnard, has transitioned from the team to focus his efforts on developing atomically-thin semiconducting materials for high performance, energy-efficient electronic devices. While Graungard's absence will be missed, we have hired a new postdoctoral research scientist, Luca Piantanida, who started on August 5, 2019. Piantandia's complementary expertise enables the team to move forward without needing to make course adjustments. Piantanida has a PhD in Nanotechnology from University of Trieste, where his dissertation was on developing DNA origami nanoactuators functionalized with gold nanoparticles for plasmon resonance tuning. Piantanida recently concluded a postdoctoral position at Durham University, UK under the supervision of Prof. Kislon Vo\u00eftchovsky, where he developed a novel atomic force microscopy approach for imaging Classification Number Tenured or Tenure Track Faculty 4 (2 full professors, 2 associate professors ) Research Faculty 1 (started a tenure -track faculty position ) Project Manager 1 (also focused on business development ) Senior Lab Research Associate 1 (manages the laboratory & supports team ) Postdoctoral Fellows 3 (performing at a research faculty level ) Graduate Students 5 (3 of the 5 graduated in December ) Undergraduate Students 10 (5 female and 5 male ) INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 12 13biological interfaces in fluid. His expertise with DNA origami and high-resolution imaging, coupled with the scientific expertise and productivity of postdoctoral research scientists Drs. Will Clay and George Dickinson, position the NAM Institute to accelerate our development rate. Vertically Integrated Project The Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) model integrates teaching and learning into one framework in support of work-force development of students that can work at the interface of semiconductor manufacturing and synthetic biology. These students are engaging in research activities aimed toward the production, purification, and quality control of new single-stranded DNA origami scaffolds. The students range from sophomore to seniors and span four different majors: biology, chemistry, health sciences, and psychology. Specifically, the VIP students synthesized and purified several large DNA scaffolds. They used E. coli cultures to express single stranded DNA ~8,000 and 10,000 bp in length. Currently, the bacteriophage M13mp18 is used to make the DNA scaffolds, but it limited to 7249 nucleotides. In addition to being longer than M13mp18, each of these scaffolds has a different sequence, potentially enabling orthogonal origami synthesis.

Description of future plans Team Management - Integration and graduation Manage the financial risk of the anticipated higher education budget cuts in Idaho that have the potential to impact the NAM Institute. Target the next round of grant opportunities and start working towards their submission. Leverage the grant writing process as an opportunity for professional development of the postdoctoral fellows. Help the postdoctoral fellows identify the intellectual space they want to lead in the future; periodically meeting with them to establish their professional development plans. Seek collaborations with key internationally recognized research groups; with an eye for cross-training our laboratories. Support our project manager to visit federally funded research centers to solicit effective practices in how to mobilize, pitch, and manage a large federally-funded effort. Task 1 - Create improved algorithms for coding information into data strands. Explore the integration of Tasks 1 and 2 together to expand DevPro and SeqEvo to include machine learning so that our experimental results help inform future sequence design. Submit the initial manuscript describing and encoding/decoding algorithm into DNA to DNA 26, as well as a review article on encoding information into DNA to IEEE or equivalent. Task 2 - Create a high-throughput, integrated analytical engine to design select data strands using quantitative metrics based on an in-house, algorithm. Resubmit the initial manuscript describing SeqEvo and DevPro to Nucleic Acid Research . Initial reviews from the journal reinforced the value of the research, as well as the need to communicate it more clearly because of our attempt/need to bridge multiple disciplines. The first version of our evolutionary sequence-generation tool ( SeqEvo) and our sequence- analysis tool ( DevPro) have been released to select research groups at Boise State University, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Naval Research Laboratory to solicit their technical feedback in preparation for releasing both tools publicly. Based on their feedback, finish and then make publicly available DevPro and SeqEvo versions 2.0. Scale the adoption and adaption of SeqEvo and DevPro in support of Tasks 3 and 4. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 14 15Task 3 - Create a synthetic biological factory for manufacturing DNA scaffolds using a rapid design, build, and test cycle of genomes. With the successful development of software to optimize sequences (Task 2), we will next set out to design and synthesize large scaffolds with sequences optimized for our specific origami designs. Several designs will be synthesized and compared. The super resolution microscopy advancements will aid in this comparison. This will require Tasks 2, 3, and 4 to further integrate. Develop quality control metrics for scaffolds. Each scaffold synthesis will need external quality control metrics to ensure batch to batch consistency in order to enable comparison. Task 4 - Design and fabricate NAM storage nodes using the DNA scaffolds. Submit the initial manuscript describing dNAM to Nature Communications or Nature Materials . Explore the application of short Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) and other DNA analogues in dNAM to increase the resolution of the super-resolution microscope during DNA-PAINT, as well as explore if sequence Nucleic Acid Memory (seqNAM) is as viable as dNAM. Task 5 - Read arbitrary files into NAM storage nodes using super-resolution microscopy. Test methods to improve resolution on existing microscope, including reducing drift, improving drift correction, and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Use knowledge gained from optimizing existing microscope to design and test components for custom built super-resolution microscopy system while working toward a full prototype. Use simulation to better understand optimal imaging and sample design parameters to maximize data reading rate.

Summary of Budget Expenditures The below table summarizes expenditures associated with the project from July 1, 2019 to December 20, 2019. In establishing dNAM as a new memory technology, Salary and Fringe supported five graduate students, three postdoctoral research scientists, an undergraduate student, an assistant research professor, and a project manager. Other Expenses were used to purchase modified and unmodified DNA oligos, supplies to process modified and unmodified DNA oligos into dNAM, super-resolution microscopy supplies, atomic force microscopy supplies, computers, and an upgrade to a liquid handling system (epMotion). The oligos are used to assemble NAM blocks and to perform super-resolution microscopy studies. The atomic force microscopy supplies complement the super-resolution studies by confirming the design and structural stability of the dNAM. The computers were purchased in support of our algorithm development and newest postdoctoral research scientist. The epMotion system enables us automate the mixing of solutions to synthesize DNA origami in both an accurate and efficient manner. The system was malfunctioning and was approaching its end-of-life. The upgrade ensures vendor support throughout the life of this project. The encumbered Capital is allocated to the purchase of a server to significantly improve our image processing efficiency and infrastructure. As part of analyzing dNAM, we compile over 60,000 high resolution images (~40 GB) per experiment. Post-processing of each series of experiments, and the 60,000+ images, are computationally intensive. When performed on a desktop computer, processing requires hours to days of processing time per experiment. The server will enhance productivity.

There is more demand fo r emergency training of the first responders than the current facilities can support. Recently, r esearchers at Idaho State University were awarded funding from the State of Idaho under HERC-IGEM grant. The focus of the project is the development of a Disaster Response Complex (DRC) for research, certification, and training of first responders in collaboration with t he Directorate of National & Homeland Security at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and the Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES). The DRC has three pillars: 1) research, 2) curriculum and certification, 3) training. The res earch pillar includes the development of new training lanes/simulations/Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives (CBRNE) surrogates and markers, the use of robots/small Unmanne d Aerial Vehicle (sUAV), virtual reality, augmented reality, and Geographic Information System ( GIS) in the training of first responders. The curriculum pillar includes offering courses in topics such as emergency response and gamma/chem spectroscopy. In the final pillar of training, the facility can be used to host events for clients such as the Department of Defense (DoD) CBRNE Response Enterprise (CRE) cus tomers, military personnel, Idaho National Guard and law enforcement agencies/fire departments fr om Idaho and the region. It is expected that the DRC will be a comprehensive facility that will incorpo rate natural (earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding) and man-made hazards in training of first responders. 3.0 Summary of Project Accomplishments This is the first progress report for the project. First year b udget for the project is $525,100. The formal project award letter from Idaho State Board of Education (SBOE) was received on August 7, 2019. The Principal Investigator (PI) and the project personnel at Idaho State University (ISU) have had progress on all three pillars of the DRC project which is detailed below. A. Research Pillar Efforts in the research pillar have focused on the use of robotics and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives (CBRNE) markers/surrogates i n a collapsed structure for the training of first responders. On the robotics side, ISU resear chers have discussed ideas with collaborators from Idaho National Laboratory (INL). INL has good capabilities, facilities and exp erts in robotics. Through the discussions, an ISU graduate student was identified and assigned to work with the INL group. The student is focusing on the research aspect of the DRC and will be jointly supervised by senior researchers from ISU and INL. The graduate student (PhD level), collaborators from INL, academic advisor and supervisor from ISU have been identified. The student's paperwork is currently being processed for access to labs and facilities at INL. The student will be working on adding capabilities to an existing INL's robot (e.g. enhancement for end of arm too ling, attachment of sensors, detectors, and ground penetrati ng radar) to enhance its perform ance for disaster response. On the CBRNE side, several meetings were held at the CAES betwe en ISU and INL researchers. The meetings were focused on the development of chemical and bi ological markers. Collaborators from INL are well-established in the radiological and nuclear d etection areas. Available opportunities for research in development of markers/surrogates from agencies such as the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) were discussed. This effort is c ontinuing. Other technologies such as the use of sUAV and GIS have also be en considered for applications in disaster response. INL has good capabilities in sUAV. In additi on, the project personnel have discussed collaboration with the C ollege of Technology at ISU w hich has several sUAVs, some with Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) capabilities.

A Disaster Response Complex for Training of First Responders in Idaho, 9th Annual Energy Policy Research Conference, Boise, ID, United States. B. Curriculum and Certification Pillar On the curriculum side, the project personnel had several meeti ngs with instructors/researchers from INL. This included tours of facilities and capabilities at ISU. The instructors have shown interest in organizing short courses (e.g. 4-days) with hands-o n components with topics such as gamma spectroscopy and chemical spectroscopy. Courses will be d eveloped at different levels (e.g. basic to advance) and targeting clients such as Civil Support T eams (CST), members of the Homeland Response Force (HRF) and local responders. The plan is that ISU will provide all the necessary facilities for these classes, including a website for registration and payment. ISU will also help INL in developing tabletop exercises for the advertisement of the class. The project personnel have reached out to ISU's Continuing Education/Workforce Training in the College of Technology who already have a mech anism for advertising, regist ration and fee payment. Instructors from ISU and INL held discussions on identifying to pics and developing modules for short classes. Technical Resources Group, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in radiological training, reached out to ISU regarding the Transpor tation Emergency Preparedness Program (TEPP) Training - Modular Emergency Response Radiological Transportation Training (MERRTT) and other topics. The Idaho Office of Emergency Man agement has shared the Technic al Rescue Team Skill Sheets with the project personnel. The researchers at ISU are currentl y examining these sheets to identify the type of resources needed for certification of first responders in Idaho. C. Training and Exercise Pillar This pillar includes the design a nd construction of an outdoor collapsed structure. The original footprint of the collapsed structure was 200 ft x 200 ft, the t otal area of the outdoor training and exercise facility was about 1-acre. The collapsed structure wou ld house several training lanes such as subterranean, car-rescue, and shoring with possibilities for future expansion. ISU held several meetings with potential users from Idaho National Guard, Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Office of Emergency Response, Snake River Search, and Idaho Falls Fire Department to gather their input/feedback for the outdoor facility and the training lanes. The Pocatello Fire Department is also interested to use the facility fo r training exercises. Based on the feedback of the potential users, the Idaho National Guard indicated to enlarge the size of the overa ll facility to about 3-acres to accommodate the HRF training sessions which typically can have between 500-800 responders training at once. The CST units are smaller (e.g. 22 responders ) compared to HRF, but they hold more frequent training sessions (e.g. 12 times per year). The Idaho National Guard also indicated a desire for adding another training lane for high-angle rope r escue. It should be noted that the outdoor facility will be utilized toward all three pillars of t he DRC. The aforementioned stakeholders shared their needs for a training complex such as the DRC. They also provided ISU with information on the upcoming major training and exercise su ch as the Cascadia Rising 2022 in Idaho and the Wasatch Quake 2021 exercise in Utah. The contact at the I daho National Guard, who is the Director of Joint Plans and Training, has shared the inf ormation about the ISU's DRC with the National Guard units in the states surrounding Idaho. He st ated that the DRC at ISU \"is a unique INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 22 5 opportunity that, with some thought and input, the National Gua rd can leverage and fill a gap in available high-quality training sites in the western US without expending DoD funding\". The project personnel worked with ISU's facilities to find a su itable location on the campus for the development of the outdoor fac ility. The unoccupied land behind the Idaho Accelerator Center in Pocatello (Figure 1) was deemed suitable for the outdoor facili ty. Currently, the site has uneven slopes with a pile of garden waste in the center. Soil composition is mostly silty sand with potential for erosion. A full engineering investigation of the site had to be carried out prior to starting earth work. Figure 1. Location of the outdoor traini ng facility for the DRC project The project personnel carried out the following tasks: o Surveyed the site (Figure 2). o Collected soil samples (Figure 3) from four test pits. o Performed lab tests on the soil samples to determine mechanical properties for cut and fill. o Developed cut and fill drawings and data (Figure 4). o Worked with ISU's Facilities to obtain the required work permits and identify the contractor (Starr Corp) for the earth work. o Developed the scope of work for Phase I of the construction tha t included obtaining DBS/erosion permits, obtaining estimates for construction, sele cting the contractor, relocating all existing soil materials on site, moving, sprayin g, and compacting the existing bark and brush pile to help cover the exposed soil. o Held conversations and visited Te ton Prestress Concrete in Idah o Falls (Figure 5), Oldcastle Infrastructure in Idaho Falls and Ogden, and Forterra Structural Precast in Salt INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 23 6 Lake City (Figure 6) to obtain rubble and concrete sections for construction of the collapsed structure and the training lanes. o Visited several suppliers of hea vy equipment in Montana and Uta h to identify appropriate heavy equipment for purchase. o Purchased heavy equipment that included a telehandler and backh oe (Figure 7).

Start of the earth work on December 30, 2019 In addition to the outdoor training facility, the efforts are underway to identify an appropriate indoor space for year-round training. Several options were considered for the indoor space, including the Armory Building (Figure 10), research space in the Eames Comple x or renting a warehouse type structure in Pocatello. Based on the feedback from INL, Idaho N ational Guard, and other clients, the Armory Building will be an ideal place for smaller-scale tr aining and offering special focused courses. The building has a high-bay area as well as classrooms and vaults. The Armory Building is owned by ISU and currently houses ISU's College of Technolog y Diesel Technology program. There are plans to vacate the building in June 2020, with the D iesel Technology program moving to the Eames Complex. The project personnel have been working w ith ISU's Facilities to use the Armory Building for the DRC project. The building is suitable f or the expected activities without any major improvements.

INTRODUCTION The project objective is to identify the methodology, process, and materials necessary to three - dimensional cold print (3D print) building assemblies utilizing, to some maximum extent, wood products. Moving a significant portion of construction into a factory setting where labor and work is organized and executed more efficiently will have the following benefits: 1) increase the quality and energy efficiency of buildings; 2) lower overall construction costs; 3) provide appropriate compensation for a more skilled labor force and , 4) assist in mitigating the current construction skilled labor shortage challenge in Idaho. i The outcome of this research is the development of a reliable and cost- effective process for printing panels (i.e., wall, floor, and roof assemblies) on a horizontal plane using a 3D printing process to produce a structural insulated panel. The proposal end goal is to build panels that are 10 feet wide by 16 to 20 feet in length that can be loaded onto a flatbed truck required to transfer it to the constructio n site for assembly. Tasks for Year 1: 1) Research and identify the printing mix of wood/natural fibers, binders and adhesives; 2) Develop the technical description design for a 3D fibrous wood wall printing process, including prototype printer design specifications; 3) Develop the business case for private industry investment. 2. SUMMARY OF PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR T HE REPORTING PERIOD JUST COMPLETED Research and identify the printing mix of wood/natural fibers, binders and adhesives. Prepared by: Armando McDonald, Ph.D Year 1, mid -year reporting Dr. McDonald staffing: 1 M.S. student in Chemical Engineering. 1 woman. Salary expenditures and student tuition in the McDonald lab have focused on supporting the research efforts of one M.S. student. Capital and operational expenses are in line with ongoing and projected research activities on wood -resin curing research. Appropriated funds will be expended by the end of year 1. Initial work was looking as fast setting adhesives, a phenol- resor cinol -formaldehyde (PRF) resin (20%), to mix with screened (10 and 40 mesh) sawmill residues (80%). We blended the resin/wood mix and cold pressed into discs at temperature of 50\u00b0C at varying times. This provided some test specimens for initial evaluation (Figure 1). INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 40 We p urchased a DHR2 rheometer from TA instruments (Figure 2) and was installed early November 2019. The rheometer will be used to determine the cure characteristics of the resins/adhesives and resin/wood blends. The original PRF resin was analyzed for its setting behavior. We have contacted the supplier to provide a faster curing resin and, we are currently evaluating its properties. We are making good progress.

Prepared by: Michael R. Maughan, Ph.D, PE The University of Idaho (UI) Mechanical Engineering (ME) team has the responsibility of developing a 3D printing process and printer for depositing a wood waste composite mixture developed by other researchers in the UI College of Natural Resources (CNR). The goal is to make bespoke composite bu ilding panels. UI ME is also responsible for thermal modeling and optimization of the 3D printed composite building panels. The UI ME team has worked closely with CNR while they have begun developing the composite mixture. In the first period of the project UI ME has accomplished the following tasks: 1) purchasing and setup of key equipment, 2) hiring and training key personnel, 3) conducting a literature search, 4) identifying a suitable approach for depositing the composite mixture, 5) conducting initial experiments of depositing the composite mixture. Purchasing and setup of key equipment - A multi -core processor computer was purchased for conducting computational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD). The system was ordered in September 2019 when the grant was issued, and became functional for use in early December 2019. The system is available for remote login for any project team members. A copy of ANSYS Multiphysics CFD software has been installed and tested. Hiring and training key personnel - Upon initiat ion of the project, a UI ME graduate student was selected. Throughout the fall semester. The student has been undergoing training on existing 3D printing equipment to become familiar with their structure and control. The graduate student has also completed three courses toward a master of science degree. Courses selected provide knowledge benefitting the project and satisfying requirements for M.S. degree. Literature search and preliminary approach - Collectively 18 relevant references have been identified and reviewed. Specifically , four highly relevant papers regarding printing of biomaterials were reviewed in detail, confirming the novelty of our material system and final product. Based on the mechanical properties of preliminary composite material samples, we selected a screw auger approach as a preliminary test for extruding and depositing the composite mixture. Initial tests with a manual extruder showed some promise leading to testing with a powered extruder. See Fig. 1a and 1b. 1a) 1b) INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 42Figur e 1 - a) Manual screw -extrusion of wood fibers and water mixture. b) Power extruder used to conduct initial experiments. Preliminary experiments - Initial experiments indicate a high level of torque required to extrude wood and w ater. There seems to be a relationship to the level of moisture in the wood and the ability to extrude. Higher torque supplied by the electric powered extruder enabled successful extrusion of the mixture. Further experiments will elucidate performance usin g resin instead of water. Other deposition techniques are being explored in parallel. Develop the business case for private industry investment. Prepared by: Ken Baker, M. Arch and Lyndsay Watkins, Research Assistant During year one of the grant, a business case is being prepared to show the value of the printing process in producing modular construction panels out of wood. This focused document will provide a research -based explanation of the benefits of the product for purposes of solicitating privat e investment into development of a production facility that will bring the product to market.

The manufacture of these products generated about 84 million tons of wood residue (about 40% fine residue, including sawdust, and about 60% coarse residues), with more than 98 percent used by the wood products industries for fuel, pulpwood and feedstock for products such as particleboard (Smith and others 2009, Table 1). INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 45 Its principal sources are municipal solid waste (MSW) and C&D waste. In 2010, the EPA estimated that about 15.9 million tons of MSW wood waste were generated, with a recovery rate of only 15 percent (not counting recovery for energy combustion). In 2010, 70.6 million tons of urban wood was te were generated (MSW (48%) and C&D waste (52%)) Residues from primary timber processing mills are not included because essentially all are currently being recovered. 1. https://www.biocycle.net/2012/08/15/generation-and- recovery -of-solid -wood -waste -in-the-u- s/ *Identified urban wood waste and Integrated operations as most ideal availabilities. 1. https://www1.eere.energy.gov/bioenergy/pdfs/btu_f orest_biomass.pdf - numbers for all of US INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 46Embodied Energy Table (under development ) The table below is being developed as a way to compare the total embedded energy costs of six differing construction methods (including our 3D method).

The results imply that reducing the amount of raw materials used in production by replacing a large volume object with a post -consumer good that requires little to no processing will dramatically decrease the environmental impact associated with the end product. This indicates that distributed manufacturing is technically viable and environmentally beneficial because of both reduced energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

Summary of project accomplishments for reporting period and plans for remainder of Yr AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 551) Summary of project accomplishments for reporting period and Plans for remainder of Yr 2: The accomplishments and plans for the four primary tasks identified in the original proposal are summarized here (Tasks A -D). A summary of accomplishments for the overall project management and coordinated stakeholder engagement activi ties are also summarized below, listed as Task E. The team would like to stress that our partnerships with producers, processors, municipal treatment personnel and water mana gement entities (private and public) are fundamental to all of our tasks and our project as a whole. Our Yr 2 activities have been influenced and enhanced by interactions with our Stakeholder Advisory Board (described in more detail under Task E below) and interactions with other stakeholders as well. Task A) Recovery of energy, nutrients, water and bioproducts from waste streams: bench to place - based pilot projects Team: Erik Coats (UI, environmental engineering/molecular biology; emphasis on resource rec overy from waste streams); McDonald (UI, biomass conversion and bioproducts); Kevin Feris (BSU, algae -based resource recovery and microbial ecology)) Team background and overall goals: This team collaborated for 10+ years and has the required multi disciplinary experience to integrate biological, chemical, physical and thermal approaches to the recovery of energy, bioproducts and nutrients from multiple waste streams. The team is leveraging investments made by the INL, CAES, HERC, and the IGEM incuba tion fund. Over the last 10 years our efforts have resulted in multi ple extramurally funded awards, student training opportunities, scientific publications and a pending patent. We have worked across bench and pilot scales. Recent support from SBOE HERC al lowed us to build a pilot scale system to convert dairy waste to val ue added products (biogas, bio -plastic, algal biomass); previous HERC funding supported construction of two pilot systems at UI by Dr. Coats -one located at the Moscow WWTP, designed for mu nicipal wastewater and one mobile system (24 ft. trailer) designed f or dairy manure resource recovery. We are engaged in testing, validating, and extending these systems to evaluate opportunities to recover high -value products (bioplastics, algae, biofuels ) from industrial/municipal wastewater while achieving treatment. Re search is focused on further understanding/optimizing our integrated system to maximize utility across input streams and demonstrate \"real -world\" applicability. Research objectives will fu rther technology interrogations and advance wastewater as an economi c resource. Ultimately, research will advance solutions that can be applied in Idaho agricultural and food processing sectors; producing economic value from waste will enhance Idaho -based industries by diversifying product portfolios. Accomplishments this reporting period : The following provide s detail of progress in the first half of Year 2, building from Year 1 successes, towards the aims described in the original proposal . INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 56i. Bench scale: Assess and evaluate nutrient recovery, energy reduction, bioplastics production, and algal production strategies to inform pilot scale operations. a) Assess ment of optimal process sequences (biological, chemical, physical, thermal) to recover energy, biop roducts (biofuels; bioplastics) and nutrients from mixed waste. - (Coats) Bench -scale bioreactor operations continue to be operated and evaluated . One current focus is analysis of process \"success\" vs. \"failure.\" Stable operations of any resource recovery s ystem at full scale demands intrinsic knowledge on what constitutes stable operation, and how unstable, or \"failed,\" operations might be recovered. Investiga tions are being conducted using macro - and molecular -level methods. - (Coats) Phosphorus recovery fro m w astewater is most sustainably and reliably achieved through a process known as enhanced biological phosphorus removal, EBPR. Bench -scale EBPR operations a re ongoing, with a focus on ascertaining the effects of key process operational criteria on maximal P recovery. Building from past research efforts, current investigations are focused on two operational scenarios that integrate a new operational strategy. One operational scenario feeds all wastewater to the bioreactor at one time (beginning of the cycle ), while the 2nd strategy feeds a more targeted, controlled wastewater (VFA -rich fermenter liquor) at the beginning of the cycle and then the raw wastewater stream at the end of the anaerobic period. The former operational strategy is i dentified as the A/O process, while the latter is known as the Westbank process. The central question relates to understanding the effect of adding VFAs outside of the anaerobic period. The new operational strategy employed involve s oxidation -reduction (re dox) control of the anaerobic period. Research suggests that \"deep anaerobic\" conditions can enhance and stabilize EBPR; we are utilizing real -time redox process control to furt her evaluate this operational strategy and its impact on operational \"success\" vs. \"failure.\" Resul ts will ultimately inform pilot (2020) and full scale operations. - (Coats) Another current focus is on achieving stable nitritation in an activated sludge wastewater treatment system achieving carbon, ammonia -N, nitrite -N, nitrate -N, and phosphorus removal. Nitritation is a biological process whereby ammonia -N is oxidized only to nitrite. Process success will result in significant energy savings in wastewater t reatment. Process success was realized at both bench and pilot scale in 2019; r esults are being reviewed to inform 2020 pilot operations. - Complementing the nitritation research are efforts to understand and better characterize denitritation, with the aim t o further optimize the EBPR process for energy efficient nutrient recovery. Nit rate is a contaminan t of concern in drinking water, and often must be removed from wastewater prior to discharge to the water environment. A primary concern with conventional EB PR processes that integrate nitrite/nitrate reduction is the potential producti on of nitrous oxide, which is a very potent greenhouse gas (300X CO 2). Bacteria exhibit variable metabolic pathways to reduce nitrate vs. nitrite; some bacteria cannot reduce ni trate to nitrite, which requires a more complex microbial culture to successful ly eliminate nitrate from the wastewater. Ongoing efforts by one of Coats' PhD students is centered on better understanding the metabolic capabilities of bacteria and how they reduce nitrate vs. nitrite. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 57- One of Coats' PhD students conducted intense evaluat ions of the dairy -based PHA pilot in Y1/Y2, with very successful results. Ongoing efforts are focused on finalizing and submitting a peer -reviewed journal manuscript that detail s the results from these investigations. The manuscript includes numerous team members, including M cDonald's research team. Coupled with results from a graduating MS student (funded through other means), plans will be developed in the 2nd half of year 2 to i) execute new bench -scale investigations, and ii) develop plans for summer 20 20 pilot scale opera tions. - Algal cultivars continue to be used for routine experimental deployment. On-going experiments are focused on cultivation at both bench and pilot scal es employing wastewaters from multiple sources (e.g. currently dairy and munici pal provided by the Coats lab and the City of Boise ) to maximize nutrient capture and algal biomass production. Bench scale experiments are identifying which strains produce op timal levels of biomass under various cultivation conditions. Current bench scale experiments are assessing the utility of munici pal sourced struvite to cultivate high value algal biomass under controlled conditions, while simultaneously capturing struvit e sourced nutrients (e.g. nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)). Specifically, we are testing three alg al strains known to produce hig h concentrations of omega -3 fatty acids under the proper cultivation conditions (i.e. suggest that certain modifications to the cu ltivation conditions are requir ed to obtain significant levels of growth when using struvite as the primary nutrient source. These experiments not only dire ct future work for optimization of algal cultivation on municipal struvite , but are also potentiall y applicable to struvite produc ed from agricultural resource recovery systems. As we hone our understanding of what cultivation media factors and growth con ditions are required to maximize growth and high value biomass production we will then scaled these experiments up to pilot scales to evaluate high -value algae production at these large r scales . Separate cultivation experiments are planned for Fall 2019/ Spring 2020 that will pursue mixed -culture approaches for the capture of nutrients from liquid wast ewaters. Biomass from these ex periments will subsequently provide algae biomass for HTL processing by the McDonald lab. Nutrients captured from the HTL pro cessing of algal biomass will then be tested as inputs to a struvite production system (either via modeling or bench scale struvit e production). Struvite produced in this way will then either be tested similar to the municipal struvite experiments describ ed above or analyzed for mineral content to allow accurate estimate of the utility of the algae -capture nutrients purified by stru vite production. Based on th is suite of experiments we will determine the most appropriate mechanism for algal cultivation and nutrient source in our integrated system . Additional experiments in year 2 and 3 will continue t esting of individual or consort ia of algal strains previously selected based on their ability to grow in the selected wastewater streams and based on their g rowth rates , yields , and nutrient capture rates. As noted above these experiments will also be informed by the biomass characteri stics and subsequent estimates of e conomic potential of algae cultivated in struvite that we are currently working towards acq uiring. We expect to have some biomass characteristics data acquired during the second half of yea r 2. However, this effort will continue into year 3. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 58ii. Pilot scale assessments: Conduct pilot scale evaluations from mixed waste streams; implement/evaluate treatment resource recovery processes. - Both Coats' pilot systems were made fully operational in Y1 , with operations extended into Y2. Coats' research team was fully trained on systems operation . - Completed hypothetical re -configuration of the Twin Falls wa stewater treatment plant to integrate proximate waste streams and achieve resource recovery. Analys es were conducted using SUMO pr ocess modeling software by Dynamita. Results will inform Coats' 2020 scale model operations (dairy PHA system; municipal EBPR/ nitritation system) . - Compl eted 2019 operations of Coats' pilot operations at the UI dairy (PHA pilo t) and at the city of Moscow, Idaho (EBPR/nitritation pilot). Former efforts were intensively focused on collecting data to facilitate ultimate transition to a full scale system; ongoing data interrogation is informing and being integrated into a journal m anuscript. Moreover, PHA pilot data greatly informed potential future scale -up to commercial operations, and the team is evaluating potential new funding opp ortunities to make the transition to commercialization. Latter efforts focused on preliminary asses sment of integrate d EBPR - nitritation, with an emphasis on integrating ammonia -based aeration control to enhance nitritation over nitrification . Succes sful nitritation was achieved for th e entire month of August 2019 (early Y2); d ata evaluation is on going, with the aim to inform 2020 pilot operations. - The initial pilot scale greenhouse systems have been constructed at the Boise State research greenhouse and are being tested for suitability for cultivation of multiple strains. New equipment required f or initiation of the greenhouse scale experiments (i.e. a 20L flow through centrifuge) ha s been purchased and installed in the Boise State greenhouse. Insta llation and safety checking of the c entrifuge has taken longer than expected and has affected the r ate of optimization of operational conditions. However, we expect final installation and testing of the centrifuge to be completed by December 2019 and we w ill initiate greenhouse scale experi ments soon thereafter. We expect the proposed greenhouse scale experiments for year 2 to still be completable, however the data collection and analysis may be delayed until the start of year 3. We will do our best to a ccelerate the rate of these experime nts to facilitate our ability to inform decisions about which t ypes of algal cultivation systems to couple with the AD/PHA aspects of our integrated system . Currently, laboratory scale experiments are being utilized to further refine which algal cultivars /species to employ in our greenhouse and pilot -scale tests. We will continue to operate t he pilot scale algal cultivation systems through 2020 in collaboration with the Coats and McDonald labs at UI. iii. Produce prototype p roducts (bioplastic mulch film, bioc har, biofuel) for evaluation. - One PhD student has been working on extracting and isolating pure PHA bioplastic generated from eight trials on the pilot plant over 84 days of operation . Each batch of PHA was produced unde r slightly different operating condi tions (see section ii). The eight batches of the purified PHA b ioplastic are being characterized for their thermal and rheological properties in order to determine their suitability for producing bioplastic films. - With t he on -ramping of the greenhouse scal e experiments in Fall 2019/Spring 2020 in the Feris lab we will begin to produce suitable quantities of algal biomass for use in HTL INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 59experiments by the McDonald lab. Primary outputs of HTL processing of algal biomass wi ll include biofuel (i.e. biooil), bi ochar, and aqueous phase nutrients. The aqueous phase will be recycled to the algal cultivation system to enhance algal biomass production . iv. Partnerships with producers, processors and municipal treatment personnel are fundamental to all of these tasks. T eam will build on existing relationships with Twin Falls wastew ater treatment facility, Food Northwest, Chobani, Amalgamated Sugar, J.R. Simplot, Idaho Dairymen's Association, and Glanbia, and expand to new partners thro ughout this project We held our init ial Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG) meeting on May 3rd at the University of Idaho Water Center in Boise, Idaho. A primary component of the SAG feedback for the Task A team was to focus on demonstration of commercialize -able product production. We also h ad a deep conversation regarding the complexities of bringing n ew systems to market in complex regulatory environments. All of the stakeholders were strongly supportive of the proposed integrated goals of waste treatmen t and commodity production and pledg ed to help seek opportunities for the project team to introduce our proposed systems to key commercial partners and operators in the region. Research plan adjustments in response to our Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG): During year 1 of our project we had our first stakeholder advisory group (SAG) meeting in May 201 9 and our second meeting Dec 2019 . These meeting s have been very valuable to help fine-tune the trajectory of some of our research tasks and for providing new opportunities to engage with a broad er group of potential constituents in the agricultural industr y. For example, based on feedback from our SAG the Feris lab adjusted the trajectory of our algal cultivation experiments to encompass studies that address the utility of struvite as a nutrient source for algal cultivation with the idea that these experim ents have potential to more quickly develop a process that could become market ready. Additionally, our SAG engagement resulted in leadership from the Idaho Dairymen's Association inviting two members of our team (Feris, Coats) to the joint Idaho/Utah Dai rymen's association meeting in Salt Lake City, UT in July 2019. This meeting provided an opportunity to further develop relationships with regional dairy producers and to introduce them to the potential outcomes of our project. Additionally, the Idaho Da irymen's Association networked Coats/Feris with Newtrient LLC (Steve Rowe, CEO). Newtrient is advancing an integrated set of technologies focused on achieving 'net zero' emissions from dairies. Discussions will continue with Newt rient to i) potentially asc ertain how the PHA technology might be integrated, and ii) potentially collaborate on future commercialization funding. One of our goals for year 2 of this project is to continue to build on t hese budding relationship with the hopes that they will blosso m into partnerships for seeking pre - commercialization funding in year 3. In addition, Dr. Feris will be taking a sabbatical leave during the second half of year 2 and will be dedicating a por tion of his sabbatical time to the help forward the Task A tea m developments towards commercialization. Specific goals will include working to develop INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 60relationships with the agricultural industry and local municipalities targeted towards future deployment of our pilot scale systems at pote ntial partner locations in Idaho. Part of this work will include building upon the relationship building initiated during the July 2019 meeting. Task B) Decision -support tools for industry and community leaders to quantify and visualize trade -offs among water, energy, land use and municipal growth Team: Jae Ryu, UI, systems dynamics nexus , geospatial analysis Overall Goals: The goal of this task is to integrate energy comp onents into an updated version of a pre -existing syste m dynamics model for water supply, use and flows in the region of the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer .

The tool will quantify and provide users with visuals on the linkages between water, energy, land use and municipal growth, to b e used for planning and decision -making by producers, w ater users, businesses, utilities, state agencies and communities. Accomplishments this period : Improved the existing model of water sup ply/use to better incorporate the specific data needs and what options we can use for conservation scenarios given the existing data types. We developed a new graphical user interface based on the newly added Stella Architect modeling platform developed in Yr 1 . Held a meeting with IDWR regarding their newest ESPAM model version and updated data needs. Began exploring management options to inco rporate into the model, such as managed aquifer recharge (MAR) option which is the most active management option led by IDWR. Evaluated the feedback from IDWR and Surface Wate r User's Association a t the stakeholder meeting s in May 2019 and De c 2019 and ho w the model could be more useful for stakeholders.

Accomplishments this period: Goal 1: Current /near -term workforce development needs o Engaged with a stakeholder (IDEQ) that approached us about workforce development needs and added a representative to our Stakeholder Advisory Board INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 63o Discuss ion and initial planning for training sessions we could hold in coordination with the rural water treatment association meetings later in Yr 2 and in Yr 3. Goal 2: o Hosted a hands -on education program known as \"Idaho Drone League (iDrone)\" to promote STEM pipelines in the Tr easure Valley and skills important to the Idaho food industry in the future. Plans for latter half of Yr 2: Training session to be held i n May 2019 in con junction with the Rural Water Treatment assoc iation me etings Idaho Drone League event to be held in Twin Falls in June 2020. Event will include a table highlighting how drones can be used in food production (from Task C of this research) Continue to engage with our Stakeholder Advisory Board and professional organizations such as Food Northwest to identify and implement professional development needs in food, wat er, energy and waste and how the universities can catalyze and facilitate these. Continue to engage with other stakeholders such as the IDEQ on needs and opportunities in professional development on pollution control and management. Task E) Project Management /Stakeholder Engagement Background: An important element of our project management was to put together and meet regularly with an advisory board comprised of stakeho lders in the food produc tion and processing ind ustries, water user groups and state agencies. I n Year 1 w e formed this adv isory and had a very successful 1st meeting in person in Boise in early May 2019. As noted in the technical progress reports (earlier sections of this report), the board feedback in fluence d our research plans in Year 2, as planned. The board agreed to meet in it 's entirety once/yr in person (Apr/May ), once/yr via videoconference (Nov/Dec) and have specialized meetings bet ween specific sub -groups of team and advisory board members in betwee n. Accomplishments this period: We hel d a 2nd meeting of our full Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) on Dec 17, 2019. As planned and discussed at our May meeting, the meeting was held by vid eo, with 4 -5 attendees in one conf erence room in The fol lowing SAB members attended and those listed with a (*) were invited and had h oped to attend but were not able to do so: o Jeff Bohlscheid, Senior Principal Scientist, J.R. Simplot Company o Shawn Moffitt, Regional Business Mana ger, Jacobs Engineering (contractor for City of Twin Falls and Chobani water treatment plants) o Bob Naerebout , Government Affairs and former Ex ec Director, Idaho Dairyman's Association and and Me gan Satter white, Environmental Programs Director, IDA o Ben Nydegger, Biosolids Program Manager, City of Boise o Sean Vincent, Hydrology Section Manager, Idaho Dept of Wat er Resources INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 8 IRSA TAB 6 Page 64o Ben Jarvis, Pollution Pr evention Projects Coordinator, Idaho Department of Environmental Quality o Brian Olmstead *, President, Surface Water Appropriators and General Manager, Twin Falls Canal Company o Brandon Vinin g*, ProGro Consulting The primary goal of this second meet ing of our SAB was to update the SAB on our previous 6 months activities, particularly those things that had been prioritized or tweaked as a resul t of their feedback in May , and to gain more insight f rom them as to how we could make our research as useful t o them as possible. PI Karen Humes and Co -I Erik Coats met individually with Ben Jarvis in Oct 2019 to discuss workforce training opportunities that coul d \"piggyback \" along with existing I DEQ events and/or professional meeti ngs such as the Idaho Rural Water Association As described in some detail under our \"Task A\" Technical progress section above, two of our Co - Is (Coats and Feris) have done considerabl e out reach to the dairy ind ustry in both Idaho and Utah, including presentations at the Utah Dair yman 's Association in July 2019. We also established a cloud file storage space for our project (and shared it with the SAB) in which a ll presentations and notes from our SAB meetings are stored, along with our pro gress reports to the SBOE/HERC. In the way of other team management a nd organization among Co -Is at the multiple institutions , we have continue d our monthly team meetings via videoconferencing. Plans for next reporting period: Hold our spring SAB meeting in Apil or May 2019 Continue to b uild on existing relationships with Twin Falls wastewater treatment facility, Food Northwest, Chobani, Amalgamated Sugar, J.R. Simplot, Idaho Dairymen's Association, and Glanbia, and expand to new p artners throughout this project Continue to hold monthly team meetings to monitor progress and facilitate coordination of all project tasks and stakeholder engagement activities. In coming months these meetings will focus on student presentations of research. 2.

Summary of Project Accomplishments and Plans 1.1 Accomplishments for this report period Although the HERC project started on July 1, 2019, the PI did not have access to the funds until September 13, 2019 when the account was set up by the Office of Sponsored Projects at Boise State. This report covers the activities performed since September 13, 2019 until February 1, 2020 . Milestone Achievements Hired undergraduate student, Ms. Jasmine Cox, to work on ink synthesis and printing. Hired Post-Doc Dr. Josh Eixenberger (15% effort) to work on ink volume scale-up. Ordered and received microviscometer to measure the viscosity of material inks being formulated in the Advanced Nanomaterials and Manufacturing Laboratory (ANML). Placed an order for a Tangential Flow System to help scale up ink production. Ink 1: Started working on ZnO (Zinc Oxide) inks since there i s an immediate interest from NASA and Boeing in getting this ink from us. These inks will be the first to be commercialized from partner, INFlex Labs, LLC. Ink 2: Worked on formulating Nickel ink and testing its performance. Nickel ink will also be commercialized through the company. Oak Ridge National Lab is an immediate customer. 1.2 Plans for the next reporting period During the next reporting period, we plan to Fine tune the inks and processing parameters so that we can demonstrate compatibility and printability with the printer suite we have at Boise State. This will help create a datasheet for the different inks being formulated, and help the company market the ink to potential customers. Demonstrate the synthesis of higher volumes of inks so that the ink manufacturing could be made commercially viable. The Tangential Flow System will be set up specifically for this purpose. Develop a business plan together with the company. We will approach potential customers with prototypes and samples. We have already identified a few customers, including NASA Ames, Boeing Corporation, and Oak Ridge National Lab. 2. Summary of Budget Expenditures for the Period Just Completed Expenditure from Boise State University: $50,696.53 to date During this reporting period, we spent $50,696.53 overall. Within this, two pieces of equipment were purch ased - (1) a RheoSense Microviscometer to measure the viscosity of ink synthesized ($9,977.40) and (2) a Tangential Flow System to help scale up the ink volume ($21,150). The remainder was spent to cover the salaries and fringe of the undergraduate student and the post- INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 9 IRSA TAB 6 Page 3 \u0003 Grant # IF20-002 Semi-Annual Report PI: Harish Subbaraman 4 doc. Expenses were also incurred for the printer use in the cleanroom and for ink characterization. 3. Number of Faculty and Student Participation Resulting from Funding This project has had participation from one faculty member - Prof. Harish Subbaraman (PI), one undergraduate student, Ms. Jasmine Cox, and one post-doc, Dr. Josh Eixenberger. This project is providing hands-on ink synthesis and printing experience to the undergraduate student, and furthering the expertise of the post-doc who is skilled in the synthesis of nanoparticles and nanoparticle inks 4. Patents, copyrights, and plant variety protection certificates received or pending While there is still great potential, as yet, there has been no idea or new technology reviewed on this project during this first time period that has led to any specific or particular new intellectual property. 5. Technology licenses signed and start-up businesses created We have seen great interest from industry and national labs in trying to learn more about the project and procuring inks and associated processing information from us. Boise State and INFlex Labs are working on signing an agreement related to commercialization of the inks. 6. Status of private part/industry partnerships PI Subbaraman received a NASA EPSCoR and NSF Nanomanufacturing awards. The incubation fund will enable setting up of state-of-the-art equipment for ink production scale-up. The EPSCoR grant will look into flexible electronic device development integration using a plasma jet printer for space applications. Currently, there are no ink vendors for the plasma jet tool, thus placing INFlex and Boise State in a very good position to work with the equipment manufacturer and promote our inks. The successful outcome from the current HERC project will lead to direct investment from interested companies and investors. 7. Additional Funding Received and Financial Burn Rate As mentioned above, the PI has several other projects that utilize inks for developing flexible electronic devices and sensors. The work that will be performed in this project will be a natural extension of accomplishments in those projects . The PI is also constantly trying to secure extramural funding in this area, and we foresee efforts beyond the IF project going into further development of inks, sensors, and devices that can be used in the food storage, consumer electronics, space, and other markets. In terms of financial burn rate, we will be using the remainder of funds on ink production, ink characterization, and development of processing recipes on the commercial printing tools at Boise State.

CAES' first decade was loaded with milestones, and we intend to continue on that track as we harness the power of collaboration among our members to address complex global energy challenges and train the next generation of scientists, engineers, and researchers. We began implementing the new CAES strategy this year in order to accomplish this. With its focus on collaborative research, education, and innovation, our reinvigorated approach has already begun bearing fruit. In July, for example, a collaborative effort among Idaho State University and Idaho National Laboratory received an award of almost $1.1 million from the Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM) grant program initiative. The project calls for the construction of a disaster response complex for first responders and is led by Dr. Mustafa Mashal, a CAES faculty member from Idaho State University who received seed funding to develop the project from CAES and first met his INL collaborators at a CAES workshop. CAES will also be involved in INL's partnership with NuScale in building the world's first small modular reactor thanks to a grant from the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy University Program that will support the installation of a NuScale reactor control room simulator at CAES. The grant to University of Idaho Professor Rich Christensen's team will allow CAES to train students on nuclear power plant behavior and expand CAES' research efforts, K-12 outreach, and public education regarding nuclear power and the technology behind small modular reactors. Several CAES researchers garnered national recognition for their work in 2019, including Dakota Roberson, a CAES-affiliated Assistant Professor at University of Idaho who was selected for the prestigious White House Fellows program. Dave Estrada, the CAES Associate Director for Boise State University, and CAES-affiliated Boise State Professor Hoda Mehrpouyan received prestigious CAREER Awards from the National Science Foundation. Mehrpouyan's $454,000 award will support her work combatting cyber attacks on critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants. Estrada's award of more than $550,000 will enable research in the CAES focus area of advanced manufacturing and could revolutionize human tissue engineering. In September, CAES made its presence known globally as the CAES Energy Policy Institute's annual Energy Policy Research Conference drew international attendees. And we made our mark in the nation's capital in March, when I had the honor of testifying before the US House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development concerning CAES' innovative efforts to develop the energy workforce of the future. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 10 IRSA TAB 6 Page 56 CAES | 2019 Annual ReportThis year also saw the completion of the first full year of the CAES Summer Visiting Faculty program, which created 18 new partnerships between faculty at the CAES universities and INL researchers. And just recently, we formed working groups in each of the CAES focus areas outlined in the strategy. These seven groups will catalyze researcher-driven deepdives into projects made possible through collaboration and serve as catalysts for sharing and leveraging the expertise, capabilities, and resources across the five CAES entities. These groups will ultimately serve as a force multiplier, allowing CAES to tackle complex global energy challenges and fulfill our vision of creating a better energy future through collaboration that inspires energy leadership, ignites technology innovation, and catalyzes global impact. Finally, Idaho Governor Brad Little closed out the year by declaring October 1, 2019, as CAES Day in Idaho in commemoration of the facility's 10th anniversary. We are now looking forward to the next 10 years and a declaration of The Decade of CAES! There is ample work to be done, and we are eager to get started. First, though, we hope you enjoy this annual report and the opportunity it provides to reflect on what we accomplished together in 2019 - from patents to proclamations, projects to partnerships. There's much to do as we embark on our next decade, so let's get to it.

The milestone was commemorated with a celebratory event in Boise that drew approximately 100 people, including the Idaho governor and Battelle Executive Vice President of Laboratory Operations Ron Townsend, and featured presentations by INL Director Mark Peters, Former Idaho Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter, Boise State University President Dr. Marlene Tromp, University of Idaho President C. Scott Green, and former DOE-Idaho official John Kotek, who is now Vice President of Policy Development and Public Affairs at Nuclear Energy Institute. Change of address - 995 MK Simpson Blvd In the spring, the city of Idaho Falls renamed the street on which CAES is located in honor of Congressman Mike Simpson and Kathy Simpson. The new name is MK Simpson Boulevard, and CAES' address is now 995 MK Simpson Blvd. In 2009, when the facility was dedicated, CAES was the anchor tenant, the first building with an address along the nearly half-mile stretch of road known as University Boulevard. In the decade since, fields have been replaced by buildings that comprise INL's research campus, \"where the hard work of research, education and innovation intersect, \" as Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper wrote in a letter to the Simpsons in April 2019, adding, \"The CAES facility illustrates this. Bringing together National Lab research with four universities and lots of brilliant students and scientists is a remarkable thing. \" INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS JUNE 10, 2020 ATTACHMENT 10 IRSA TAB 6 Page 1011 CAES | 2019 Annual ReportTHE DECADE OF CAESCAES Associate Director & Boise State faculty member receive NSF CAREER Awards Dr. David Estrada, the CAES Associate Director for Boise State University, was awarded a National Science Foundation CAREER Award in April for his work utilizing graphene as a bio-scaffold for musculoskeletal tissue engineering, and CAES-affiliated Boise State Assistant Professor Hoda Mehrpouyan was awarded a CAREER Award to further her cybersecurity and network research. Mehrpouyan, who is also Associate Director of the Cyber Lab for Industrial Control Systems at Boise State, received a five-year award of $454,000 to support her work developing a complex security framework providing mechanisms that address the increasing risk of cybersecurity attacks on water treatment plants, reducing the risk to public health and safety, industry, and national security. Mehrpouyan has worked with Idaho Digital Learning, Suez Idaho, Women Innovators of Idaho, and INL, and the CAREER Award will allow her to advance research and expand opportunities for collaboration in cybersecurity, one of the seven focus areas outlined in the CAES Strategy. Estrada, who has served as Boise State Associate Director to CAES since June, was awarded more than $550,000 to support his collaborative research with fellow Boise State Professor Julie Oxford and faculty from the Italian Institute of Technology and Southern Demark University. The research is in the CAES focus area of advanced manufacturing and involves the use of graphene as a bio-scaffold, or engineering structure on which tissue may grow, for stem cell cultures. The work could revolutionize tissue engineering by enabling patient-specific organ growth, which would reduce patients' dependence on donors to treat organ failure. Estrada's five-year CAREER award also includes research activities to help develop a pathway for English language learners from a Boise-based language immersion program to participate in STEM programs at Boise State. CAES AD for Boise State recognized with national award In September, Estrada, was recognized by the Council for Opportunity in Education as one of six 2019 National TRIO Achievers. The name of the honor stems from the federal TRIO college access and support programs designed to help low-income, first-generation students and students with disabilities succeed in college. Estrada's parents immigrated from Mexico to Idaho in the early 1960s; neither had finished high school. Estrada and his five siblings all graduated from high school, and he was awarded a scholarship at University of Michigan through the Navy ROTC program. After struggling academically as a freshman, Estrada served six years in the Navy before returning to Idaho to pursue a degree in electrical engineering at Boise State. In 2007, Estrada became the first person in his family to earn a college degree, and he credits the McNair Scholars Program with providing the support and preparation he needed to succeed. CAES hosts Hiring our Heroes Fellow CAES hosted Paul Smith as a fellow in the Hiring Our Heroes Fellowship Program throughout fall 2019. Smith contributed to a number of communications projects for CAES, in addition to networking and sharing the story of the fellowship program, which provides military service members with professional training and hands-on experience as they transition from the military to the civilian workforce. A profile on Smith, an Idaho native who served more than 22 years in the US Army, ran on the INL web site and Boise State University web site.

Imel, a CAES-based Nuclear Engineering professor at ISU, is a co-PI on a project led by Purdue University called In-Situ Irradiation Creep Testing Vehicle Instrumented with Novel Sensors that was awarded $350,400. Pope, director of ISU's Nuclear Engineering program who has taken part in several successful projects at CAES, including a 2015 project that received a $200,000 grant from INL to study the performance of nuclear power plant components under flooding conditions, serves as co-PI on an Oregon State University-led project, Accelerating the Experimental Mission of VTR Through an Ex-Pile Operational Program, that received $250,000 in funding through the VTR program. In all, the VTR program awarded $1.7 million in funding to six university-led projects in June. The funding is intended to allow the universities to develop instrumentation and tools for a proposed research reactor that would generate high-speed - or \"fast\" - neutrons for experimentation and testing purposes. While INL leads the VTR program, its team consists of Argonne National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Savannah River National Laboratory, and industry and university partners.that will enhance collaboration between INL and ISU. ISU was awarded nearly $1.1 million this year from the Idaho State Board of Education's Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM) initiative to build the Disaster Response Complex (DRC) in Pocatello. The concept and collaboration for the DRC resulted from a 2018 CAES-coordinated collaborative research planning meeting with INL's National & Homeland Security Directorate. CAES-affiliated ISU Professor Dr. Mustafa Mashal is the Principal Investigator on the project, which calls for the construction of a facility that will replicate the features of a structure collapsed by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster. Mashal and his Co-PI, Dr. Bruce Savage, an associate professor and Chair of ISU's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, teamed on the project with INL's Bryon Marsh, establishing a partnership that provides expertise in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) research. The DRC will be the first of its kind in the Intermountain West, serving as a training site for first responders to learn search-and-rescue operations in disaster scenarios, enabling research into new disaster response techniques and technology, and supporting future collaborative training and exercises planned for INL's Radiological Response Training Range. Potential clients include Idaho National Guard and the Office of Emergency Management. Seed funding for the project came via a 2018 CAES program development award and a 2018 CAES Collaboration Fund award. University of Idaho awarded IGEM grant University of Idaho Professor Indrajit Charit is the Principal Investigator on a collaborative project involving INL and CAES-affiliated Boise State University Assistant Professor Brian Jaques that received a $247,167 grant from the Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM) initiative. The project calls for using laser beams to manufacture complex and unique metallic parts, with potential applications in nuclear reactors and food processing plants. Jaques is one of five Co-PIs on the project, which also involves Blackfoot-based Premier Technology Inc. INL will serve in an advisory role, and the researchers plan to conduct characterization work at CAES. The project could enable Premier Technology to quickly manufacture complex and unique machine parts on-site - parts such as smart filters for food processing equipment - potentially reducing down-time for equipment and personnel. Another potential application is for US Navy fleets - crews would be able to rapidly manufacture needed materials at sea, without returning to port.Did you know: The IGEM grant program initiative began in 2012, with the goal of boosting Idaho's economic growth through commercialized research at the state's three public research universities.
