Each child is evaluated on an individual basis. Every child has a unique biochemistry and physiology with their own set of strengths and weaknesses. Their health challenges include a complex puzzle, to name a few: This myriad of challenges can be overwhelming. However, the naturopathic approach provides a systematic approach, which sets priorities with practical, manageable treatments. Dr. Janet's naturopathic approach is compassionate and caring, as she guides and supports you and your child on their healing journey. She utilizes a wide variety of diagnostic tests to scientifically assess: Treatment suggestions will then include: Dr. Janet's approach to working with your child follows sequential and practical steps. Her emphasis is on managing and helping symptoms that are a priority for you, your child and your entire family. Some of the above tests may be covered by your insurance plan, but some are considered specialty tests and are not covered. I). SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF: Does your child demonstrate symptoms or behaviors that are making their life and yours over-stressed? These symptoms and behaviors are addressed initially using a variety of non-invasive methods. Sometimes, a trial and error approach is needed. Naturopathy offers many options that minimizes actions that are detrimental to your child's and your family's overall health and well-being. II). IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE RISK FACTORS: III). REDUCE TOXIC STRESS Children on the autism spectrum often have problems eliminating toxins such as food allergies, infections, chemicals, pesticides, metals, from their bodies as compared to neuro-typical children. As toxins increase in their bodies, the potential for allergies also increases, which leads to inflammation. Inflammation can occur throughout the body, and also in the brain and nervous system. Not an optimal situation for a growing child. Dr. Janet will support your child in reducing and/or eliminating toxins from their bodies through their detoxification channels, Which is their skin, digestive system, liver and kidneys. A strong detoxification system will allow your child to be more resistant to all the internal and external environmental factors that he/she will encounter in life. IV). NEUROLOGICAL HEALING Neurodevelopment therapies are key factors in achieving your child's greatest potential. Therapies such as sensory processing therapy, hyperbaric oxygen, ionic foot baths, sound therapy, color therapy, neurofeedback, applied behavioral analysis and others will be introduced to you. Suggestions will be made on how to include them in your child's life. Your child will progress at their own pace and your continued support along with encouragement will facilitate their optimal health. As a parent of a child on the autism spectrum, your job is 24/7. You know better than anyone else about his/her behaviors, preferences, likes and dislikes. You also know intuitively what helps and what does not. I see my role in you and your child's life as providing evidence-based scientific information and guidance in making the best decisions for your child's health. Autism is a complex puzzle with a belief by the traditional medical system that, \"nothing can be done\" so that complementary and alternative treatments have no value. These outdated beliefs are false, misleading and disheartening. Educating yourself and your family and friends about autism will be an on-going challenge. The results will be demonstrated in the health of your own child thus will contribute to a greater understanding of autism worldwide. Blessings on your dedication to your child and to the pursuit of integrative, naturopathic therapeutics. WNC Naturopathic Medicine WellSpring Wellness Center "}
