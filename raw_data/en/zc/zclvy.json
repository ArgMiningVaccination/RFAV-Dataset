FEATURED TREATMENT: BEMER TECHNOLOGY BEMER stands for Bio-Electro-Magnetic-Energy-Regulation. The BEMER mat is a pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, which pulses low electromagnetic frequencies through the body, increasing circulation and pulsing our capillary and arterial veins. These waves are safe to pass through human bodies, is non-invasive, and helps improve the functions our bodies already do - moving oxygen and nutrients through the body, and waste and carbon dioxide out. Studies show that it reduces fatigue and chronic pain with short and long term use. BEMER mats are available at Dr. Steve's office, available to rent, and also for sale. Ready to have a BEMER mat in your home and in your everyday routine? [Chiropractic](https://www.networkhealingarts.com/specialties) Dr. Steve utilizes a profound sequence of spinal evaluations and adjusting techniques. Chiropractic sessions release blockages, called subluxations, inside you that interfere with your natural healing ability and therefore prevent full healing. When these blockages are located and released (or adjusted) the result is a healthier you - more balance, more energy, more healing.

[Ayurvedic Medicine](https://www.networkhealingarts.com/specialties) The purpose of an Ayurvedic treatment is to uncover the root cause of disease or imbalance in the body, and restore the body to its natural, joyful and balanced condition. The role of the Ayurvedic practitioner is to show you the unhealthy patterns in your mind and body, and teach you ways to regain health through the use of foods, herbs and daily practices. When you begin to eat, live and cleanse your body in ways that are appropriate for your unique constitutional needs, your body can naturally heal itself and remain vigorous into old age. bottom of page "}
