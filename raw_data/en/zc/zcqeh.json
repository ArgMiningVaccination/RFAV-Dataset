SNAC Seattle Naturopathy & Acupuncture Center Why People Choose Us It is our goal to provide you with the highest quality care. Our family taking care of yours! Qualified Doctors Trusted Treatment Personalized Care What Our Patients Say When my beloved naturopath became \"out of network\" when my insurance changed, I was worried I wouldn't find a good replacement but I did!! Dr. Tressa Pinkleton makes a visit fun because she's so interested and upbeat (not manic, though). Also thoroughly knowledgeable. I should know because so am I, having managed diabetes well with the help of a succession of excellent NDs for at least 10 years. I found parking for my 11 am appointment right out front. The wait was under five minutes. The experience really couldn't be improved upon. Feeling blessed. I made the switch to naturopathy with Dr. Tressa Pinkleton this year, and wow, am I glad that I did, because my faith in healthcare has been reignited and I've been sharing my experience here with all of my friends and coworkers! Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from my visit, as I'd heard mixed reviews about naturopathy and to its \"legitimacy,\" but I have to say, I haven't felt as heard, healthy, or in tune with my body as I have for the last six months! I'd been having some trouble with stress, anxiety, and weight gain and had a feeling that something in my body was out of whack. Dr. Pinkleton was knowledgeable, down-to-earth, patient, and honestly, just overall really cool. I've started taking various supplements to address different health concerns, have changed my diet due to Dr. Pinkleton's recommendations, and just feel overall WAY more knowledgeable about my body and what I put in it. I'm so grateful to have found a primary doctor who actually listens to my concerns, shares natural remedies and solutions, and who works with me to make sure I am feeling my best. My entire experience here is always great \u2014 friendly staff, low wait times, and overall just an amazing healthcare experience. Dr Tressa Pinkleton is amazing! She spends time with us (me and my husband), listens and explains things in detail. I am an RN and I have never had a more thorough doctor! It is easy to make an appointment, we have not had to wait long and she has spent at least 30 minutes with us as we discuss our symptoms and she explains her treatment plan. She is a wonderful Naturopathic Doctor and also refers when needed to other specialists. I have the utmost respect for her! I came here after going through a lot of trouble in the ER and spending a lot of time in the hospital to understand and eliminate the causes of my recurring gastritis. Dr. Tressa Pinkleton is great!! She is smart, enthusiastic and thorough. Thanks to her dedication and knowledge, I have received answers and have seen results faster than with any gastroenterologist I have encountered in the past. I feel confident in leaving a good review in her name. The front staff is also very nice and always on-point throughout the check-in/out and billing process.
