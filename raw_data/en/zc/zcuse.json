The United States National Herbarium, which was founded by the Smithsonian Institution, was transferred in the year 1868 to the Department of Agriculture and continued to be maintained by that department until July 1, 1896, when it was returned to the official custody of the Smithsonian Institution. The Department of Agri- culture, however, continued to publish the series of botanical reports entitled \"Contributions from the United States National Herba- rium,\" which it had begun in the year 1890, until, on July 1, 1902, the National Museum, in pursuance of an act of Congress, assumed responsibility for the publication. The first seven volumes of the series were issued by the Department of Agriculture. W. deC.

To a person walking in the country in search of rest from labor the wild plants are very friendly if he has a speaking acquaintance with them. Such an acquaintance is of untold value as a means of rest and recreation. Yet to most persons our books on botany, instead of opening the path to knowledge, close it with the barrier of technical language. Botanical science is beginning to recognize the prohibitive effect of this barrier and to take steps to open the path to the public. The Flora of the District of Columbia and Vicinity now presented for publication is provided with keys'to the families, genera, and species, and in the preparation of thesejkeys common words have been used extensively as substitutes for tech- nical and unusual words. This is especially true of the key to the families, which is so written that a person with almost no knowledge of botany can trace a strange plant to its proper family. The identification of many of the native species is made still easier'by the illustrations, and it is only the limitation of space and cost that has prevented the more extensive use of these photographic reproductions.

For many years the botanists of Washington have had under consideration the project of preparing a flora of Washington to replace the excellent work of Lester F. Ward, entitled \"Guide to the Flora of Washington and Vicinity,\" published in 1881 as Bulletin 26 of the United States National Museum. This work and other papers relating to the local flora are reviewed interestingly by Mr. P. L. Ricker in a recent paper summarizing botanical activity in the District of Columbia.1 According to Mr. Ricker, the first list of the plants of our region was included in the Florula Columbiensis.2 The second list was compiled by John A. Brereton3 and was based upon investigations made from 1825 to 1830 by the Botanical Club of Washington. In 1876 the Potomac Side Naturalists' Club issued the Flora Colum- biana* in Field and Forest. The best known account of our flora is that by Lester F. Ward,\u00ae mentioned above, usually known as Ward's Flora. There were six supplements to this.* In 1906 the names of the flowering plants . \u2014 1 1 A sketch of botanical activity in the District of Columbia. Jouin. Washington Acad.

Ricker in \"A List of the Vascular Plants of the District of Columbia and Vicinity,\" mimeographed copies of which were distributed among Washington botanists. Besides these there are many articles dealing with certain groups, a list of which papers is included in the bibliography appended to Mr. Bicker's account referred to above. The plan of the present Flora was announced at the annual meeting of the Botanical Society of Washington in the spring of 1915. This plan involved the cooperation of 28 botanists under the leadership of Frederick V. Coville and A. S. Hitchcock, each being responsible for certain families or genera. During the first season keys to the genera and species of nearly all the families were prepared by the contributors and mimeographed copies were distributed, in order that they might be tested for one collecting season. The contribu- tors prepared the finished* manuscript in 1917, In 1916 Mr. Coville- withdrew from active participation in the work and the leadership was assumed by A. S. Hitchcock and Paul C. Standley. Following is a list of the persons who have contributed the final, text and of the groups assigned to each. Ball, C. R.: Saliz. Blake, S. F.: Junc^eae (in Carex, Menthaceae. The following persona aided in the preparation of the preliminary keys: C. V. Piper, P. L. Kicker, P. G. Russell, E. S. Steele, S. C. . Stuntz. i Two keys to families have been prepared, a natural key by Mi Hitchcock (including keys to families of Pteridophyta by Mr. Maxon), and an artificial key by Mr. Standley. The introduction is by Mr, Hitchcock and the glossary by Mr. Maxon. The introductory account of the flora of the region is not so full as might be thought desirable. A detailed presentation of the rela- tions of the flora to the vegetation of the surrounding areas, how- ever, is not regarded as essential in a work intended primarily as a classified list of the species. It is hoped that the present volume will stimulate interest in the phytogeography of the region and serve as a basis for an analysis of the flora by those who may have oppor- tunity to study the subject for a longer period. The area included by the Flora is approximately a circle of 15 miles radius, with the Capitol as the center, this area being prac- tically that of Ward's Flora, though it is not intended to exclude from consideration localities that lie a short distance outside the 15-mile circle. The maritime flora of the shore of Chesapeake Bay and of the lower Potomac River is excluded, as is also that of the Patuxent Valley. In the main, the local area reaches to Bowie, Upper Marlboro, and Brandywine on the east, Mount Vernon on the south, Great Falls on the west, and Rockville and Oak Crest on the north. The formal list includes all indigenous plants and all introduced ones that have become established. Many species have been collected only once, or sometimes oftener but under circumstances which indi- cate that they are waifs or chance introductions and are not to be considered a part of our flora. Such species are mentioned in notes appended to an allied species or genus. It has not always been possible definitely to determine whether these stray individuals are to be considered a part of our flora, and the decisions in this respect may not be consistent; but rare specimens of species native in this general region may usually be assumed to be indigenous, while those 16 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM. that belong to introduced species may require proof that they are established. All the species admitted to the formal list are based upon specimens in the District Flora Herbarium, which has been segregated from the main collection of the National Herbarium. Species reported1 but which are not supported by specimens have been mentioned in notes. All the species listed in Ward's Flora and its Supplements have been accounted for, even though they can not now be verified by specimens. Some of these are accounted for by synonymy; others are shown by the specimens to be errors of identification; a few of which there are no specimens in the Herbarium have been mentioned in notes. The more commonly cultivated species have been noted under the family or genus to which they belong. No iittempt has been made to include the vast array of ornamental plants of greenhouses and parks, except a few of the well-known species, such as trees that are planted along the streets. The nomenclature is in accsrd with the American Code of Botanical Nomenclature, except that so-called duplicate binomials are not used. Synonyms have been given where necessary to coordinate the names with Gray's Manual, Britton and Brown's Illustrated Flora, and Ward's Flora. Errors of identification in Ward's Flora have been indicated thus, Erianihus alopecuroides of Ward's Flora. Mr. L. V. Hallock contributed the photographs for plates 5, 8, 15, 18, 19, 20B, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34, 37, 39, 41; Mr. E. L. Crandall those for plates 11, 17, 2OA, 26, 35, 36; the photographic laboratory of the Department of Agriculture that for plate 13; Mr. Hitchcock furnished those for the remainder. The geology of the region as related to the flora has been briefly discussed by Edgar T. Wherry.2 The chief physiographic feature is the \"fall line,\" which separates the Piedmont Plateau on the north- west from the Coastal Plain on the southeast, being named from the fact that the rivers and smaller streams, flowing southeastward to the sea, often have waterfalls or rapids near this line. On a topographic map of the region the course of the fall line can be readily traced by the change in the contours along the stream valleys. Northwest of the line the streams run in narrow steep-sided gorges, the contoui lines being close together for some distance back of the stream; typical illustrations of this are shown in plates 5, 6, and 7. Southeast of it they have broad open valleys marked by wide spacing of the contour lines. This is shown by the following streams: Back Lick Run and Holmes Run near Lincolnia, Fourmile Run at Barcroft, the Potomac River below Georgetown, Sligo Branch near Riggs School, Northwest 1 See footnotes on page 13. ' In a paper read before the Botanical Society of Washington and abstracted in the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences (7: 435.1917). FLORA OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 17 Branch at Riggs Mill (PL 3), where the change is most strongly marked, and Paint Branch near Paint Branch School (PI, 1). Characteristic Coastal Plain views are shown also in plates 10 and 13. The geological formations of the Piedmont Plateau are chiefly crystalline gneisses of early periods, among which may be mentioned the Carolina gneiss, granite gneiss, diorite, biotite, granite, and basic igneous rocks, including gabbro, meta-gabbro, and serpentine. The Coastal Plain is occupied by unconsolidated gravels, sands, and clays deposited during successive advances of the sea in Creta- ceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary periods. Gravels also occur to some extent as cappings on the hills along the edge of the Piedmont. Bogs are frequent on the Coastal Plain and rare on the Piedmont. Lime is often present in notable amount in the soils of the Piedmont through concentration by means of accumulations of leaf mold, although there are no highly calcareous rocks in the vicinity. Acid soils are predominant on the Coastal Plain. The relation of soils to the floras of the two regions is illustrated by the distribution of the lily family and its allies. Those species limited to calcareous soils and found chiefly on the Piedmont to noncalcareous or acid soils and found chiefly on the Coastal Plain are Aletris farinosa, Tojieldia racemosa, Melanihium species of the Liliales grow throughout the region and apparently have no marked soil preference. The floras of the two physiographic areas are noticeably different, though there are many species common to the two regions. In the Piedmont region there is a marked intrusion of mountain and north- ern plants, these being found especially along the steep banks of the Potomac and of the ravines leading into it, and along Rock Creek and its western tributaries. The uplands, when not under cultivation, for the most part represent land previously cultivated and now covered with second growth forest or waste fields. The original flora was less characteristically mountain than that which occupies the ravines. The Potomac Valley region is easily accessible and offers a most convenient and delightful field for a study of the spring flora. One of the three trolley lines extending in this direction terminates at Cabin John, from which the pedestrian may explore the left bank of the Potomac and the ravines which enter the main valley at intervals above. Though the residential district is extending up the Potomac, there are still many ravines and banks between Georgetown and Cabin John of interest to the collector. These may be reached from the trolley line or from the Conduit Road, which follows this line and continues to Great Falls. The other two of the three trolley lines 69289\u201419\u2014\u20142 18 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM. connect Washington with Great Falls (PL 8B). They pass along the high land skirting the heads of the ravines, one on the Maryland side, the other on the Virginia side. By taking the trolley to a station near the head of a ravine on the south side, one can make a trip down the ravine to the river, along the steep bank of the river to the next ravine, and, ascending this, return by trolley. On the north side one may do the same, or the return can be made along the road or towpath to Cabin John. There are four larger ravines below Great Falls on the south side: Difficult Run (PI. 4), Bullneck Run, Scotts Run, and Dead Run. Farther down is Pimmits Run, which enters the main valley near Chain Bridge, On the north side a pleasant trip can be made by getting off the trolley at Ferndale and going down Cabin John Run to Cabin John Bridge. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal extends from Georgetown to Great Falls and on to Cumberland, following the left bank of the Potomac. The flora along the canal is of especial interest, as the original species have been preserved from destruction by animals and from the encroachment of agricultural operations and residential sections. In the water of the canal and along the margin are numerous aquatic and semiaquatic plants. The cliffs and banks are the home of many species that are not easily accessible elsewhere. The towpath of the canal offers to the pedestrian the most convenient road for observing the plants of the Potomac Valley. (PI. 8A). Spring flowers are abundant in the valleys and on the alluvial slopes (PI. 9). The earliest species of interest to the layman is the hepatica, soon followed by the bloodroot. Several weedy species with in- conspicuous flowers bloom earlier in the season, or even during the winter months, when the weather is warm, or when growing in especially sunny or protected spots. The skunk cabbage, the earliest of the strictly spring flowers, is found widely distributed in our area in moist places, mostly in the woods. Other herbaceous species with showy flowers blooming in early April are the spring beauty, trout lily, wake-robin, twin-leaf, blue violet (Viola sororia pubera. A little later, usually the latter part of April, will be found Phlox divarica&a, wild ginger, Jack-in-the-pulpit, columbine, golden ragwort, and cranesbill. Among the woody plants the soft maple and the elms flower very early, often in February and March. The red maple, ashes, box- elder, and the catkin-bearing trees flower in April or early May. The redbud with red flowers and the June berry with white flowers are conspicuous in the woods before the trees produce their leaves. Somewhat later, but before the forest has come into full leaf, the FLORA OF THE DISTRICT OP COLUMBIA. 19 flowering dogwood attracts attention. Spice bush is abundant and easily distinguished by the fragrance of the broken twigs. - Along the Potomac near Great Falls there are several species not found farther east. One of the most conspicuous of these is Phlox subutata, common on the rocks along the towpath. Other rock plants are Sedum tematumf S. telephioides, and Opurtiia vulgaris. On the bluffs of the right bank of the Potomac the hemlock is an interesting component of the forest flora. Another region of the Piedmont easily accessible is Rock Creek Park, where plants may be observed though they may not be col- lected without permission (PI. 2). The ravines and slopes harbor the original flora of the region and can be reached from many roads and paths. There are also several interesting valleys and wooded areas within easy walking distance of the Rockville trolley line. The upper valleys of Paint Branch and Northwest Branch lie in the Piedmont, but they are not easily accessible except by special con- veyance. The Coastal Plain region can be reached by any of the trolley lines leading northeast, east, or south from Washington. Between the business part of Washington and Takoma Park, which lies about at the fall line, there are several localities men- tioned in Ward's Flora which have now been converted into resi- dential districts, but the vicinity of Takoma Park itself still offers much of interest. The trolley line to Laurel, lying in the valley of Indian Creek and Eastern Branch or Anacostia River, opens up fine collecting grounds. There is a long swamp or series of swamps on the east side of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Hyatts- ville to Berwyn and on to Beltsville, the section from Berwyn to Beltsville being known as the Hollywood Swamp. The eastern sector of our region, lying outside the District and between the Baltimore trolley line and the lower Potomac, is not penetrated by electric lines, but steam railways are available. The Pennsylvania Railroad passes through Lanham and Bowie, the latter a station at the limit of the 15-mile circle, from which a branch extends south through Upper Marlboro and Brandywino to the lower part of the peninsula. The Chesapeake Beach Railroad joins a trolley line at the eastern corner of the District and runs to Upper Marlboro and Chesapeake Beach. A trolley line goes to Anacostia and on south to Congress Heights, from which point one can explore the valley of Oxon Run and the lower left bank of the Eastern Branch. A line of automobile busses runs from Washington to Brandy wine and beyond, passing through Silver Hill, from which the Suitland bog may be reached, and through Camp Springs, from which one can go by a good road to Upper Marlboro. 20 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM. Much of the region east and southeast of the District is fairly level upland occupied by cultivated fields and correspondingly uninteresting from a botanical standpoint, but here and there, especially along the streams, arc bits of land supporting an indigenous flora. One of the most interesting features of the Coastal Plain area is the bogs. These are discussed at length by W. L. McAtee in his \"Sketch of the Natural History of the District of Columbia.\"1 The bogs are there designated as magnolia bogs because one of the con- spicuous plants found in them is Magnolia virginiana. One group of these, known as Powder Mill bogs, lies about 2 miles west of Ulles Crossing, a station on the trolley line south of Beltsville, There are three bogs in the vicinity, the best of which is near the crossroads, hidden in the woods and not visible from the road. A very interesting one is situated about one and a half miles southeast of Suitland, and there are several others scattered here and there. These bogs are usually on a sloping surface near a small stream and are underlaid with a stratum of gravel. The boggy covering may be very thin, and there are often spots of bare wet gravel. Surrounding these bogs is the usual forest growth, but within them the vegetation is herbaceous except for spots or islands of shrubs. There is more or less sphagnum and often an abundance of Panicum lucidum. Some Potomac region is rich in marsh plants. Much of the upper part of the Eastern Branch or Anacostia River estuary is occupied by an extensive marsh of Indian ricc. There are marshes bordering the right bank of the Potomac between Washington and Mount Vemon. A convenient station for reaching this region is Dyke, from which one can penetrate the marsh on a long dike extend- ing into the river. Here may bo found pickerel-weed, Peltandra virginica, narrow-leaved cat-tail, yellow pondlily, pondweeds, and many other marsh and aquatic plants. The collector of aquatic plants should not fail to explore also the waters of the canal, where many pondweeds are found. In contrast with the bogs and marshes are the dry sterile woods characterized by the presence of the laurel (Kalmia latifolia). Thick- 1 Bull. Biol. Soc. Washington. Pp. 1-142. 1918. FLORA OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 21 ets of this evergreen shrub are conspicuous in winter and in early spring before the deciduous trees have produced their foliage (Plate 38). In such localities one finds several species of heaths, grass of such localities is Panicum ashei. Similar to the laurel thickets are the pine and oak woods, consisting of Pinus virginiana and Quercus marilandica. In sandy pine woods one often finds the beautiful moccasin flower. Another type of barrens is found in the pure forests of scrub pine occurring on both the Piedmont and the Coastal Plain. The undergrowth is very sparse, consisting of such plants as Pyrola secunda, the two species of ChimapMla, MitcheUa repens, and Oypripedium acaule. Our knowledge of the flora of the Washington area is far from com- plete. Certain parts of the area are fairly well known; other parts are, so far as our records show, almost wholly unexplored. The best known parts are the District itself and a rather narrow zone around it; the valley of the Potomac from Great Falls to Alexandria for a mile or two back from the river; and the valley of Eastern Branch (or Anacostia River) as far as Beltsville. The unexplored parts lie in general toward the periphery of the fifteen-mile circle, espe- cially from Mount Vernon to Vienna, and the sector from the Penn- sylvania Railroad to the Potomac River. The region west of Brandy wine is practically unknown botanically. SYSTEMATIC TREATMENT OF THE VASCULAB PLANTS.

Stems in cross section showing the vascular strands or fibers distributed irregularly through the pith, as in the cornstalk; embryo with a single cotyledon; parts of the flower usually in 3's or 6's, never in 5's; leaves usually parallel-veined. Our species, with the exception of the genera Arundinaria and Smilax, are herbaceous. In some groups the stems are hollow, except at the nodes; in these cases the vascular strands are aggregate in the exterior zone and may appear as if in a ring. The leaves are net- veined in Diogcorm, Trillium, and several other genera with broad blades, but even in these they are ribbed with more or less prominent main veins running from base to apex. In the family Lemnaceae there is no distinction between stem and leaf. In some books this class is called endogens. Perianth none. Plants free-floating aquatics, consisting of small ovoid or disk-shaped fronds, less than 10 mm. long LEMNACEAE (p. 114). Plants with stems and leaves, the latter sometimes reduced to scales.

Stems in cross section showing a central pith surrounded by a circle or ring of vascular strands, these often merged into a zone of wood; embryo with two cotyle- dons; parts of the flower usually in 4'e or 5*s; leaves net-veined. This claw has also been called exogens because there is, especially in the woody plants, a division of the stem into wood and bark with a growing (cambium) layer between, the increase in diameter being by additions from the cambium to the outer part of the wood and to the inner part of the bark. Division I. CHORIPETALAE. Petals distinct or wanting. The two lower petals are more or less coherent in Fabaceae; the inner pair of petals is united over the stigma in Fumariaceae; thtee petals are somewhat coherent in Polygalaceae; all the petals are slightly united at base in OxaHs, Ilex, and Malvaceae. The division is also called Archichlamydeae. The group without petals has been called Apetalae; the group with distinct petals has been called Polypetalae. A. Petals none, the sepals sometimes colored like petals. In flowers with superior ovary, if only one series of floral envelopes is present, this is assumed to be the calyx.

Br., with short broad heads and plumose bristles, and P. ni]>eUii Steud., the fountain grass, with slender rose-colored spikes tapering at the apex. The graas flower consists normally of a pistil and 3 stamens contained between 2 small bracts, these being aggregated in spikelets (Fig. 1). The spikelet is made up of a central axis (rachilla) upon which the bracts are arranged in 2 ranks. The lower- most pair of bracts (glumes) are without flowers. The succeeding bracts {lemmas) have flowers and an inner bract (palea) next the rachilla. The lemma, palea, and flower are together called the floret. If a lemma contains no flower it is called a sterile lemma. The spikelets may be 1-flowered or several-flowered and are almost always aggregate in an inflorescence. Spikelets with 1 perfect terminal floret (unisexual in Maydeae and in Zizania) and a sterile or staminate floret below, usually represented by a sterile lemma only; rachilla articulate below the glumes, the more or less dorsally compressed spikelets FLORA OP THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 67 falling entire, singly or together with the joints of an articulate rachis or with rachis attached.

TTTHTMALOPSIS Klotzsch & Garcke. The species of this genus, while generally distinct, often hybridize when they occur together, and it is probable that the great variety of occasional intermediates, even between such distinct species as T. corollata and T. ipecacuanhae, have arisen in this way. The flowers are often replaced by a cauliflower-like gall. All the species vary greatly in amount of pubescence, red color of stem and leaves, and form of leaf and appendages. Main stem well developed, longer than the umbel; plants flowering in summer. Leaves bright green, not much paler on the lower side, sessile or nearly so. 5. T. corollata.

In this family, as well as in the Ambrosiaceae and Cichoriaceae (all three of which are often united as the Compoeitae), the form of the inflorescence is conspicuously different from that of our other flowering plants, so much so as often to deceive ama- teurs, who mistake the head of flowers for a single flower. The flowers are borne in a close head (except in the pistillate inflorescence of Ambrosiaceae) upon a flat or convex receptacle, the latter often bearing chaff among the flowers. The head is surrounded by an involucre of brads. The corolla is tubular or strap-shaped. In the Cichoriaceae all the flowers are strap-shaped. In the Asteraceac all the flowers may be tubular, but more frequently the outer ones, or rays, are strap-shaped, while the inner (forming the disk) are tubular. The fruit is an acheme. The calyx tube is united with the fruit, while the calyx limb is represented by bristles, awns, scales, etc., called the pappus. A. Outer flowers of the heads never with strap-shaped (ray) corollas, the corollas with 5 equal or nearly equal lobes, or the corollas of the outer flowers sometimes larger than those of the inner ones.

E. S. Burgess, for instance, in his \"Species and variations of Biotian Asters\" (Mem. Torrey Club 13. 1906), described about 80 new species of the group repre- sented with us by A. divaricalus and A. schreberi, but only one of these is accepted in the last edition of Gray's Manual. Many of them were reported from our region, but they appear to be distinguished by unstable characters. A conservative view has been adopted in the present treatment, and the two species mentioned above have been accepted in their usual sense. 280 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NATIONAL HERBARIUM.
