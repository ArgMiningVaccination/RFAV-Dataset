Vaccine ; 39(8): 1225-1240, 2021 ID: covidwho-1045105 ABSTRACT BACKGROUND:We examined the influence of some factors on seasonal [influenza vaccine] [effectiveness](VE) from test-negative design (TND) the 2009/10 [influenza] [pandemic]. Two reviewers independently selected and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated pooled adjusted VE across geographical regions, [age groups]and levels of [vaccine]antigenic similarity with circulating [virus] [strains], an inverse variance, random-effects model. RESULTS:We included 76 full-text articles from 11,931 VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), [influenza]B, and all [influenza]were homogenous and point pooled VE higher in the Southern hemisphere compared with the Northern hemisphere. The difference in pooled VE between the Southern and Northern hemispheres was statistically significant for A(H3N2), [influenza]B, and all [influenza]. A consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across both hemispheres and continents, with the highest point pooled VE being against A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by [influenza]B, and lowest against A(H3N2). A nearly consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across [age groups]in the Northern hemisphere, with pooled VE mostly decreasing with age. Point pooled VE against A(H3N2), [influenza]B, and all [influenza]were statistically significantly higher circulating [virus] [strains]compared with when antigenically dissimilar. [Similar]pattern was observed in the Northern hemisphere, but there was a lack of data from the Southern hemisphere. CONCLUSION:Consistent patterns appear to exist in seasonal [influenza]VE across regions, [age groups], and levels of [vaccine]antigenic similarity with circulating [virus] [strains], with best [vaccine]performance against A(H1N1)pdm09 and worst against A(H3N2). The evidence highlights the need to consider geographical [location], age, and [vaccine]antigenic similarity with circulating [virus] Vacinas contra Influenza A Subtipo H1N1 "}
