Attendance is mandatory. ** Rotations end at noon on the last scheduled day of the rotation month. REGISTRATION DATES: You need to check ISIS to find the last day for registering for the semester. If your records are flagged for any reason and you cannot be registered, UF will assess you $100.00 late registration fee. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to be sure that you meet the registration deadlines and clear any university flags on your records. FEE PAYMENT: If the fees are not paid by 3:30 p.m. of the 2nd week after the semester starts, UF will assess you a $100 late fee payment. You will also be taken off your rotation immediately, because you will no longer be covered by UF malpractice insurance. 3 CLINICAL ROTATION CHECKLIST 1-2 Weeks Before Rotation Check reporting instructions on the clinical site's area in the TYPHON directory. Complete any administrative paperw ork associated with rotation. NOTE: Some rotations require credentialing be completed 30 days in advance so get in the habit of checking your site's specific instructions early. Review rotation schedule. If you have an Internal Medicine Selective or Elective rotation in 90 days, contact Director of Clinical Studies to discuss scheduling a rotation (see pages 1 5-16). Complete a Clinical Rotation Request Form (*see below) to turn into the Director of Clinical Studies . First Day of Rotation Meet with clinical preceptor to obtain duty assignments and orientation to practice. Offer to review rotation objectives with preceptor. Confirm preceptor's contact information, especially email address, and complete the TYPHON contact confirmation surve y. This is due by the end of the first week. You will frequently be working with multiple residents, fellows, etc. during your rotation. Remember that only your PRECEPTOR will be submitting your evaluation to UF SPAS, but it is very important that he/she receives appropriate information regarding your performance when they are not directly observing you. It is vital that you print out and distribute the Contributing Evaluator Input to Supervising Preceptor Form to those who are supervising you, and ask them to route it directly to your preceptor - do not hold onto these completed forms yourself. Mid-Point of Rotation Meet with clinical preceptor to discuss performance. Obtain feedback on any areas that need improvement during the last two weeks of rotation. Complete TYPHON Mid -Rotation Student Survey Last Week of Rotation Remind preceptor to complete your Student Clinical Performance Evaluation on TYPHON . Complete Rotation Site Evaluation and Preceptor Evaluation as directed by the School of PA Studies (see page 92). On the last day of rotation ensure your preceptor has received his TYPHON Student Clinical Performance Evaluation via email . End-of-Rotation Clinical Day in Gainesville (see pages 8, 19). 4 Clinical year administrative announcements. Turn in any Clinical Rotation Request Forms for upcoming Internal Medicine Selective or Elective rotations. Turn in any Absence Request Forms (*see below) completed and signed by your clinical preceptor if you have missed any days from rotation due to illness, etc. (see pages 18-19). End-of-rotation examinations will be administered according to the assigned rotation (see page 87). PACKRAT, O SCE, and Comprehensive Summative Evaluation will be administered later in clinical year (see pages 89-90). Special Topics presentations (see page 8 ). *All forms mentioned above are available for download on TYPHON : http://www.typhongroup.net/ufl/ 5 University of Florida School of Physician Assistant Studies SCHOOL CONTACT INFORMATION Mailing Address: Physical Address: Phone Numbers: School of PA Studies School of PA Studies Toll Free: 1 -877-416-1365 College of Medicine College of Medicine Office: 352 -265-7955 P.O.

Students function as an integral part of the healthcare delivery team. As part of their education, they share patient care responsibilities under supervision of the ir preceptor, but they will not serve as a substitute for staff. GOALS OF THE CLINICAL YEAR Apply knowledge gained in the academic year to supervised clinical practice. Develop clinical problem -solving skills. Add to fund of clinical knowledge. Develop an understanding of the PA's role in health care delivery. Develop an understanding of the laws governing PA practice in the State of Florida. Develop an indication of the kind of practice setting desired for employment after graduation. Prepare for the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE). REQUIRED AND ELECTIVE CLINICAL PRECEPTORSHIPS / COURSES 1. Required Rotations - 9 months Emergency Medicine - one month General Surgery - one month Intensive Care Medicine - one month Internal Medicine - one month Internal Medicine Selective - one month (see 2. below) Obstetrics / Gynecology - one month Pediatrics - one month Primary Care* - two months (must be a minimum of one month in Family Medicine) Psychiatry / Behavioral Medicine - one month *Primary Care is designated in either a family practice or internal medicine outpatient clinic/facility. 2. Internal Medicine Selective Rotation - one month The internal medicine selective is a restricted elective and can be completed in any adult internal medicine specialty. 7 The Director of Clinical Studies must approve all selective rotations prior to assignment. Examples include but not limited to: ology Endocrinology pediatrics specialties, radiology, emergency medicine, dermatology, and intensive care are not appropriate for the internal medicine selective ; however, they may be used for your elective s. Subject to the approval of the Director of Clinical Studies , and depending on a student's academic standing, clinical performance, and co operation with the policies and procedures of the clinical year, students may request an internal medicine selective rotation with a private preceptor. Every student must complete an internal medicine selective. But choosing a specific internal medicine s elective rotation is a privilege earned throughout the clinical year. It is not a guaranteed right. Requests for INTERNAL MEDICINE SELECTIVE rotations must be submitted to the Director of Clinical Studies NO LATER THAN 90 DAYS IN ADVANCE. If you do not submit a Clinical Rotation Request Form for an internal medicine selective rotation within 90 days of the scheduled rotation month, the Director of Clinical Studies will assign the rotation for you. 3. Elective Rotation s - two months The FIRST priority in assigning rotations is to ensure the student has an experience that allows her/him to meet educational objectives. To that end, the Director of Clinical Studies will assign rotations primarily based on the student's educational needs. While every effort will be made to accommodate reasonable requests, the quality of the student's clinical education will come first, and he/she might not be assigned to their primary choice of elective rotation. Subject t o the approval of the Director of Clinical Studies , and depending on a student's academic standing, clinical performance, and cooperation with the policies and procedures of the clinical year, students may request two elective rotation s. Your choice of an elective rotation is a privilege earne d throughout the clinical year, and is determined on the priorities of (1) your educational needs, (2) availability, and (3) your preferences. While every reasonable effort will be made to place you in the electiv e of your choice, these priorities must be observed. 8 Requests for ELECTIVE rotations must be submitted to the Director of Clinical Studies NO LATER THAN 90 DAYS IN ADVANCE. If you do not submit a Clinical Rotation Request Form for an ELECTIVE rotation w ithin 90 days of the scheduled rotation month, the Director of Clinical Studies will assign the rotation for you. At the completion of each Elective rotation, and at the completion of every rotation that does not have an examination scheduled for that mon th, the student will be required to turn in proof of (3) Category I CME hours of instruction. (All CME activities MUST be AAPA/AMA -approved Category I hours.) These will consist of CME topics, usually in the area of medicine in which the student was rotat ing that month. The student will select the specific CME activities, and submit them to the Clinical Director for approval. THIS ASSIGNMENT SHOULD BE DONE DURING THE MONTH AND IS DUE ON CLINICAL DAY. 4. PAS 5930 Special Topics This is a one credit course that you are registered for each semester. It is graded on a pass -fail basis. Special Topics is conducted each month on the end -of-rotation Clinical Day. ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY . Unexcused absences will result in a failing gra de. Requests to be excused from these activities may only be approved by the Director of Clinical Studies for emergencies or other extraordinary circumstances. Students are expected to attend the end -of-rotation program even if they are on their elective rotation month and have no scheduled examination. Topics covered include advanced clinical lectures, problem -solving exercises, evidence -based medicine discussions, review of the literature, etc. Other topics covered may include job searching, certification, licensure, credentialing, preparation of CVs, personal safety, etc. Class participation will frequently be involved. A full report of history and physical examination (\"H&P\") is required to be submitted at your advisor meeting on Clinical Day after completion of each of the following rotations; o Internal Medicine o Primary Care I o OB/GYN o Pediatrics o General Surgery This is to be a complete H&P, and not an abbreviated clinical problem sheet or brief SOAP note. It may be focused, but still should be an appropriate H&P, and must be signed by your clinical supervisor. No credit will be given for unsigned submissions. 9 CLINICAL PRECEPTOR RESPONSIBILITIES In order to maximize the education al opportunities for PA students and to avoid misunderstandings between students and clinical and auxiliary staff, preceptors are expected to: 1. Meet with the student on the first day of rotation to review: a. Educational objectives for the rotation. b. Work schedules and on -call assignments. These are under the local control of the preceptor. Student should check with the preceptor about call responsibilities, especially if the site is hospital based. The School of PA Studies does adhere to the 80 -Hour Resident Work Rule, whereas, students may work up to a maximum of 80 hours in any one week and call should be no more than every 4th night. c. Local clinic/hospital policies and procedures. 2. Introduce the student to essential clinical and auxiliary personnel in the practice. 3. Provide clinical instruction in accordance with the rotation objectives and the availability of patients and other clinical resources. a. Clinical assignments should be consistent with the PA's role. b. A hands -on clinical experience is required . c. Self-study assignments and library research of clinical topics are encouraged. d. PA students are particularly eager for knowledge and insights from the preceptor's own clinical experience. 4. Provide the PA student with frequent feedback on clinical and professional performance, and formally meet with them approximately halfway through their rotation to discuss this feedback and issue guidance. 5. Meet with the student during the last week of rotation and complete a Student Clinical Performance Evaluation , online in the TYPHON system . a. Evaluations should be frank and accurate as a reflection of the student's clinical competence and professionalism. b. Students should be rated as though they were being considered for employment in the preceptor's practice (taking into account their level of training and experience). 10 c. When the student has been observed by several other clinicians, the student will provide them with a \"Contributing Evaluator Input to Supervising Precepto r Form.\" This is designed to help you better evaluate th eir performance in the rotation, but should NOT be returned to the School. d. Written comments are especially important, but if the preceptor feels written comments are not enough and desires an open discussion, please call the Director of Clinical Studies . e. The evaluation is normally completed online in TYPHON, but in exceptiona l cases, such as Internet access failures, the preceptor may FAX or email the 'Contingency Student Clinical Performance Evaluation Form \" directly to UF SPAS (352-265-7996 or peggy.cissna@medicine.ufl.edu) . It is NEVER given directly to the student. 6. Notify the School of PA Studies of any unexpected student absences during monthly rotations: (352) 265 -7955. A separate guide can be given to each preceptor prior to the first clinical rotat ion by a student and when the preceptor's manual is updated. The above information is to give the student a basic understanding of some of the content of the preceptor's manual. 11 ROTATION GUIDELINES FOR STUDENTS / PRECEPTORS Outlined below are the objectives that studen ts must become proficient in during their clinical year. This list is to guide the preceptor in recognizing trouble areas that may need supplementary training during the students' evolution. Typically, students in their first three months of clinical tra ining are beginning to develop these basic skills. During the fourth through the sixth months, students typically are gaining confidence in their abilities and continue to improve their clinical presence. From the seventh month to the end of the clinical year (twelfth month), refining the students' skills is the main emphasis. Throughout the entire year, students are expected to be fully involved in the activities at the clinical site, to improve upon their skills (i.e., patient workups, attending lectur es/rounds, procedures, etc.). If as a preceptor you note any deficits, please include comments on the student's evaluation or notify the Director of Clinical Studies directly at the School of PA Studies, so we may remediate accordingly . 1.

Physician assistant students on clinical rotation work under the direct supervision of a licensed physician and therefore will not make a diagnosis or carry out any procedure or treatment plan without the explicit approval of a licens ed physician/physician assistant or nurse practitioner. 2. When given an order by a physician and/or preceptor , a student has three possible courses of action: a. Carry out the order as directed. b. If there is disagreement with the order, discuss it w ith the physician and mutually agree on a course of action. c. Inform the physician that as a student you do not feel qualified to safely carry out the order. 3. At no time will a student change a n order or carry out a course of action different from tha t directed by the physician. 4. In the event of the temporary absence of his/her regular preceptor, students must notify the School of PA Studies of their alternate preceptor. At no time will students work without having a supervising physician clearly i dentified. Likewise, at no time may students replace or fill in for absent clinical site employees. 14 5. Students will not be allowed to work extra rotation sites outside of their specified monthly rotation requirements, e.g., working extra hours in an ER when the student is scheduled for pediatrics that month. Students place themselves and the School at great risk since malpractice coverage will not exist, as well as not having a supervising physician to co -sign charts. 6. Students must have all charts a nd written orders countersigned by the supervising physician on the day of the patient encounter. Hospital policy also governs countersignatures. It may be policy in some facilities to not allow students to write in the charts. This does not preclude the student from writing up the patient case for the preceptor to critique, but not include in the chart. 7. NO patient should be discharged from a clinical site by a PA student without the preceptor's approval and signature on the chart. 8. In all clinical activities, PA students should be guided by the principle of KNOWING ONE'S LIMITATIONS. 15 ASSIGNMENT OF CLINIC AL ROTATIONS 1. The first priority when assigning rotations is to e nsure that every student meets the educational objectives of the clinical year . A well rounded clinical education requires that students be exposed to a variety of clinical practice settings (in -patient vs . outpatient practices, academic medical centers vs . community -based sites, urban vs. rural practices, etc.). Clinical students will be required to do a number of their rotations at Florida Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) in medically underserved areas of the State. a. The UF School of PA Studies has contractual obligations with certain rotation sites within the State to provide them with a specific number of students each year. This is a high priority when assigning rotations. b. When assigning rotations, AHECs and rotation sites that have been used frequently, and have a history of providing PA students wit h excellent clinical teaching experiences in the past, are given priority over sites that accept students only occasionally. c. Rotation assignments are always contingent upon the availability of a particular rotation site at any given point in time, and the Director of Clinical Studies ' prior approval of the rotation. d. The School of PA Studies will not consider requests for rotation changes once the clinical rotation schedule has been published and released to student s, except under extraordinary circ umstances. This includes confirmed elective and selective rotations. However, the School of PA Studies reserves the right to change student rotation schedules at any time in order insure that the academic requirements of the clinical year are met. 2. The order in which you complete your rotations has no impact on the quality of your clinical education. 3. Students are NOT permitted to sign any forms or contracts on behalf of the School of PA Studies . 4. Requests for private rotations or internal medicine selective and elective rotations are communicated to the Director of Clinical Studies using the Clinical Rotation Request Form which is available on the School of PA Studies Clinical Year website. Request s for internal medicine selective and elective rotations must be submitted 90 days before the rotation is scheduled to begin. This lead time is necessary to insure that any administrative matters such as inter -institutional affiliation contracts, rotation applications and student credentialing by health care facilities, and other prerequisites imposed by the rotation site are accomplished well in advance of the rotation start date. 16 a. Approval of rotation requests is contingent upon the educational value o f the rotation, the student's demonstration of academic and clinical development , and the student's history of cooperating with the policies and procedures of the clinical year. The willingness of a preceptor to give you access to his /her patients for clin ical training, and to provide you with an end -of-rotation evaluation, are other important factors that are taken into account when considering private rotation requests. b. Out-of-state rotations may be difficult to coordinate and the School of PA Studi es does not assist students in locating out -of-state rotations. However, requests for such rotations will be considered for the second half of the clinical year, subject to the approval of the Director of Clinical Studies , and depending on a student's professionalism, academic standing, clinical performance, and cooperation with the policies of the UF SPAS . As with any clinical rotation, out -of-state rotations are not guaranteed. Once an out -of-state rotation is approved, a ll legal paperwork and practice profiles must be received in the PA office 90 days prior to the start of the rotation in order for this request to be confirmed . c. It is strongly recommended that you discuss any planned private rotation requests with the Director of Clinical Studies before submitting a Clinical Rotation Request Form. The procedure for arranging a private rotation will be outlined at that time. d. Students may not do private rotations with physicians , PAs, or other healthcare professionals who are family members, their personal healthcare provider, close friends of their family , or in clinical sites where th ese individuals are employed. STUDENT HOUSING AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE CLINICAL YEAR 1. UF PA students are responsible for their transportation, housing, and l iving expenses during the clinical year. The School is not obligated to provide you with free housing while you are on rotation. Each of you should plan your clinical year finances in advance to ensure adequate resources for your clinical education. In addition to expenses for tuition, fees, textbooks, and medical equipment, you should include funds for health and disability insurance, temporary housing and pet expenses (if applicable). Reliable transportation i s also essential. Each of you will be required to travel to Gainesville at the end of each rotation month for mandatory exams and other administrative and educational activities. 2. The availability of student housing is very limited and may be offered on ly to students who have to travel outside of their area of preference for a rotation. You are NOT eligible for student housing located within your area of preference . For example, if your area of preference is Jacksonville, you cannot use the housing available at Shands Jacksonville. 17 3. Students taking advantage of available student housing are expected to comply with eligibility and usage rules, check -in procedures, key custody, etc., established by the agency assigning the housing. You should be mindful that the availability of housing to future students could very well depend on how well you take care of the property, appliances, and utilities such as phone, cable service, etc. Before you check out of housing, make sure you clean up, empty trash, and turn out lights. Students who abuse the privilege of available housing and jeopardize the availability of housing may be subject to disciplinary action including dismissal from the School of PA Studies . 4. Pets, and g uests, including family members , significant others, and classmates, are not permitted in any of the student housing facilities under any circumstances . Smoking is prohibited. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action from the School of PA Studies . 5. If you have requested student housing reservations, you are OBLIGATED to stay in the assigned facility unless you have permission from the School of PA Studies before the rotation begins. 6. Any and all fe es associated with available student housing is the sole responsibility of the student. 7. Estimated expenses for the clinical year (Summer B, Fall, Spring and Summer A) : Tuition & Fees $27,345 * (Florida Resident) $ 60,681 (non Florida Resident) Books and Supplies $ 2,465** Lodging and Utilities $ 9,420 Food $ 5,800 Clothing Maintenance $ 1,296 Personal/Insurance $ 2,930 Transportation $ 4,518 *** Computer / Cell phone expense $ 1,760 TOTAL $55,534 (Florida Resident) $ 88.870 (non Florida Resident) *Assumes that the appropriate documentation is secured and presented to the Office of the Registrar to obtain residency in the State of Florida. **Includes cost of PANCE ($4 75). ***Public transportation is free for students. The $ 4,518 figure represents the estimated cost for operating an automobile. Costs of attendance budgets include only those expenses associated with the student. Living expenses for spouse and/or other dependents are not recognized as part of the student's standard costs of attendance. Other expenses not directly essential to a student's education or living expenses are the sole responsibility of the student. Examples of this include, but not limited to, attendance at conferences, membership in specialty professional organizations, and optional medical databases or resources. NOTE: The cost s represent estimates and are based on the costs available at the time of compilation. 18 ATTENDANCE DURING THE CLINICAL YEAR 1. Students normally report to rotations on the first Monday of each rotation block and work until noon of the last Thursday of the rotation block unless directed to do otherwise by the School of PA Studies or preceptor (see Clinical Year Schedule, page 2). 2. The rotation preceptor controls night call, days off, and daily routine. Students are expected to clarify all schedule issues with the preceptor on the first day of rotation. a. The School of PA Studies adheres to the 80 -Hour Resident Work Rule and expects clinical sites to respect the rule. Students may work up to a maximum of 80 hours per work week. Call should be no more frequent than every 4th night. b. Call schedules are to be followed as the service specifies. On -call experience should fulf ill an educational function and not a site staffing need. It should not be excessive. If a problem exists, the School of PA Studies should be notified for clarification. 3. Absences from clinical rotations will not be tolerated. Any student who has an unexcused absence may be brought before the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee. Any absence that occurs must be explained in writing (via e-mail) to the Director of Clinical Studies prior to the absence occurring, unless there is an emergency in which case the School of PA Studies and the preceptor must be notified immediately. A written explanation (via e -mail) must be made to the School of PA Studies office within 24 hours of the absence. Failure to comply with this may result in a substant ial reduction in the professionalism grade for the rotation. 4. Students who must have time off from a rotation must obtain approval from their preceptor first, and then the Director of Clinical Studies . Official approval is obtained by completing an Absence Request Form (available on the Clinical Year website), having it signed by your preceptor, and submitting it to the Director of Clinical Studies for approval. The Director of Clinical Studies and the School Director reserve the right to determine w hat types of absences will be approved. 5. Absence from rotation because of acute illness requires students to call in to their preceptor and the Director of Clinical Studies . After returning to work, an Absence Request Form is completed and submitted as outlined above. Medical documentation of the illness by the student's personal physician may be required at the discretion of the Director of Clinical Studies . 6. Extended leaves of absence are obtained by writing a letter o f request to the School of PA Studies Director (see 79). 7. Friends or family members are prohibited from contacting AHECs, coordinators, preceptors, or rotation sites on a student's behalf. ONLY students or PA personnel 19 are permitted to make phone calls or visit rotation sites. Any interference by friends or family members with regard to the student's scheduling, rotation requests, or rotations in general will be considered the responsibility of the student and may be subject to disciplinary action from t he Professional Standards and Promotions Committee. 8. In emergency situations, if family members are unable to reach students by personal phone calls, they should contact the School of PA Studies first. Faculty or staff will either call the student at the rotation site or give instructions to expedite contact. If unable to contact anyone in the School of PA Studies , then family members may call the site with minimal interruption of patient care. 9. According to University policy, students are not exempt from jury duty. However, any lost clinical time will be made up at a time convenient for the preceptor and coordinated with the Director of Clinical Studies . 10. Conference leaves of absence - Clinical year students may ask to attend either a state or national conference during their clinical training. The Director of Clinical Studies will consider each request on an individual basis, taking into consideration the distance to travel, the academic strength of the stude nt, the rotation , and the amount of time the student would miss. A student's request may be denied if he/she has excessive previous absences, if there are conflicts with scheduled School of PA Studies activities, or if the clinical e ducation outweighs the benefits of attending the conference. 11. End-of-Rotation Clinical Day Attendance - Attendance at the monthly end -of- rotation exams and the educational activities is MANDATORY. Students should expect to be on campus from 8am -5pm on Clinical Days. Please plan your schedule accordingly. Requests to be excused from these activities may be approved only for emergencies or other extraordinary circumstances. Students are expected to attend the end -of-rotation program even if they are on their elective rotation month and have no scheduled examination. ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENTS 1. Some teaching facilities require students to attend weekly meetings. These weekly meetings are utilized for troubleshooting, discussing interesting cases, or participating in lecture. UF at Shands -JAX requires students to report to a weekly meeting. It is the students' responsibility to be aware of any mandatory meetings they are to attend. Particularly if students are rotating in a teaching hospital, they are re sponsible for attending all lectures/classes that the medical students attend. 2. Rotation sites may require additional assignments (i.e., papers, presentations, exams, etc.) that may be factored into students' evalu ation grade. It is the student's responsibility to complete all tasks required to the best of their ability. The School of PA Studies supports the decision of any site to present students with additional educational opportunities. 20 ADDITIONAL SITE REQUIREMENTS 1. Some sites may have additio nal requirements to be fulfilled prior to beginning rotations.

Refer to pages 87-90 for policies regarding student progress. *This book can be found through the HSC Library webs ite 85 CLINICAL YEAR TEXTBOOKS All of the required texts are available online or have been previously required by the School of PA Studies. Each student may find additional books that suit his/her individual learning style, or texts that rotation sites recommend. ONLINE CLINICAL INFORMATION RESOURCES 1. The University of Florida Health Sciences Library has links to a wide range of medical journals and free on -line textbooks ( http://www.library.health.ufl.edu/ ). 2. UpToDate is an online resource that provides information on the diagnosis and management of a large number of diseases ( http://www.uptodate.com/ ). As its name suggests, this information is reviewed and updated on a regular basis. 3. Access to the above sites requires a computer with a UFL.EDU IP address on campus, or via your GatorLink accoun t. You can also access these sites from off - campus using EasyProxy and VPN software - both of which are available to UF students from the Health Science Center web page. Some databases available through the Health Science Center Library may be restricted to on campus access only. 86 COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE STUDENTS 1. The following is the official UF policy (modified) on the student computer requirements: Access to and on -going use of a computer is required for all students to complete their degree programs successfully. The University of Florida expects each student, as well as each student new to the university, to acquire computer hardware and software appropriate to his or her degree program. Competency in the basic use of a computer is a requirement. Class assignments may require use of a computer, academic advising and registration can be done by computer, and official university correspondence is sent via e -mail. While the university offers limited access to computers thro ugh its computer labs, most students will be expected to purchase or lease a computer that is capable of dial -up or network connection to the Internet, graphical access to the World Wide Web, and productivity functions such as word processing and spreadshe et calculation. 2. The School of Physician Assistant Studies requires students to have laptops for classroom use and recommends a computer no older than 2 -3 years. The College of Medicine does not endorse a specific operating system or computer brand. Thi s requirement focuses on function and current open standards. Students should have a current, fully -patched operating system. The following list of capabilities is recommended at a minimum: HARDWARE: Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Turion 64 X2 minimum 1.8 GHz. Recommend 2.1 GHz or higher. Memory: 1.5 GB minimum. Recommend 3 -4 GB. Hard Drive: 100 GB 5400 RPM minimum. Recommend 160 GB 5400 RPM or 7200 RPM. Graphics: Intel GMA 3100 minimum. Recommend discrete ATI or Nvidia graphics. Monito r: 1280 x 800 pixels minimum. Optical 802.11n. SOFTWARE: Malware protection Current, fully -patched operating system Anti-viral software installed and up to date (essential for all Microsoft operating systems) Anti-spyware software installed and up to date (essential for all Microsoft operating systems) Modern, standards -compliant web browser Explorer, Firefox, Mozilla, and Netscape are good choices The three major streaming media players/plug -ins Real, Quicktime and Windows Media Standards -based email client Must be capable of accessing campus Gatorlink email Standard \"run time\" environment for Java programs Software to read/write Microsoft Word, Exce l, Powerpoint formats Microsoft Office (version 2003 or later) Ability to read PDF files (PDF writing recommended) Apple computer products are not supported by the College of Medicine IT department. 87 CLINICAL YEAR TESTING AND EVALUATION A. UF School of PA Studies Grade Scale 1. The following grading system will generally be used for converting percentage grades into letter grades during the clinical year: A = 90 - 100% B+ = 86 - 89% B = 80 - 85% C+ = 76 - 79% C = 70 - 75 % D+ = 66 - 69% D = 60 - 65% E = 59% In the case where the grade is determined to be a fraction, averages will be rounded up to the next highest number when the fraction is 0.50 or greater. B. End-of-Rotation Multiple Choice Examinations 1. At the end of the following rotations, the student will complete a 120 -question, multiple -choice examination, based on the Problem List / EOR Exam Topic List for that rotation: Emergency Medicine General Surgery Internal Medicine (after completing both Internal Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine) OB/GYN (Women's Health) Pediatrics Primary Care (after completing Primary Care II) Psychiatry The examination will consist of 100 scored questions, with 20 un -scored experimental questions. As in the PANCE e xamination, the un -scored questions will not be specifically identified, and are used for evaluating and selecting future questions for these examinations. 2. When given, t he multiple choice examination will count as 50% of your overall rotation grade. C. Student Clinical Performance Evaluations 1. Each month clinical preceptors will evaluate a student's performance based on the preceptors' day -to-day observation of the student's clinical work on rotation. Specific evaluation criteria to be considered incl ude: Proficiency in obtaining a clinical database Clinical problem -solving skills 88 Ability to formulate a rational management plan Proficiency in performing clinical procedures Clinical knowledge base Professional attitudes and behaviors 2. Clinical preceptor evaluations may be completed by licensed physicians, licensed physician assistants, or licensed nurse practitioners that have worked with students for a reasonable time of supervision. Nurses, first year residents (PGY -1), allied health professionals, or other PA students are NOT acceptable evaluators. Resident physicians of PGY -2 or higher, regardless of a \"TRN\" designation on their license, are acceptable. 3. In many rotations, the student will be observed by several providers, who m ay not be the actual preceptor. In order to give the preceptor the best possible input with which to evaluate the student's performance, these providers should be given a \" Contributing Evaluator Input to Supervising Preceptor \" form. This brief form is to be completed, preferably reviewed with the student, and then the contributing evaluator should submit it directly to the preceptor - not to the student. It is never sent to the School. 4. At the end of each rotation, ensure that the preceptor has receiv ed the TYPHON Student Clinical Performance Evaluation online. 5. The evaluation is normally completed online in TYPHON, but in exceptional cases, such as Internet access failures, the preceptor may FAX or scan and email the 'Contingency Student Performanc e Evaluation Form \" directly to UF SPAS (352-265-7996 or peggy.cissna@medicine.ufl.edu) . It is NEVER given directly to the student. 6. Students are responsible for ensuring that the Student Clinical Performance Evaluation is submitted to the School of PA Studies in a timely manner. It is up to you to communicate with your preceptor appropriately and effectively to get this accomplished. 7. The School of PA Studies will not change a clinical preceptor evaluation grade or negotiate evaluation scores with students or clinical preceptors. 8. Clinical year students are expected to assume responsibility for their education while on rotation. Part of this responsibility includes frequently seeking performance feedback from clinical preceptors throughout the rotation so there are no \"surprises\" at the end of the month. At a minimum, students should sit down with their preceptor midway through each rotation, review their progress, and plan strategies for correcting any identified deficiencies. THE END OF ROTAT ION IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR YOU TO FIND OUT THAT YOU HAVE NOT PERFORMED SATISFACTORILY! 89 9. Each student should review the Description of Evaluation Competencies found in this Manual to ensure they understand how they are to be evaluated. 10. The c linical performance evaluation will usually count as 50% of your overall rotation grade, but may be 100% of the grade in rotations that do not have an EOR examination. 11. The preceptor will also evaluate the student for professionalism. Ethics and professional behavior are the foundations of medicine and form an essential component of all clinicians' interactions with their patients and colleagues. The student must pass this evaluation component in order to pass the rotation. 12. Each student must pas s each component of their rotation (preceptor's evaluation, professionalism evaluation, and examination (if given) ) by the equivalent of 70% to pass the month's rotation. A grade of less than 70% on any component, regardless of the overall average, will re sult in an incomplete for the rotation and will remain as such until successful completion of a remediation plan as outlined below. a. The first time a student fails one or more components of a rotation, at minimum, a remediation plan will be developed by the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee. b. Failure of one or more components of a second rotation, at a minimum, will result in probation, additional remediation as determined by the PSPC, and the assignment of an elective that will strengthen the student's area of weakness.. c. Failure of one or more components of a third rotation may result in dismissal. 13. Grades on the Student Clinical Performance Evaluation are given using a 100-point grading scale, with 70% as the minimum passing s core. D. Other Clinical Year Evaluation Instruments PACKRAT This is fundamentally a self -evaluation tool for both the student and the School. Performance that is lower than 1.5 standard deviations from the class mean may require clinical year adjustments to ensure an adequate educational experience. Summative Evaluation The Physician Assistant Student, in their second year of training, will be required to satisfactorily complete a comprehensive summative evaluation within the last four months of their training. The summative evaluation will consist of multiple components including but not limited to the following 90 Written Summative Examination, consisting of at least 100 multiple choice type questions, reflecting the NCCPA blueprint. o A mini mum score of 70 percent or greater will be required to satisfactorily complete this item OSCE, consisting of standardized patient cases o The student must pass (with a 70 percent or greater) all major components of the OSCE to satisfactorily complete this i tem. Major components include: overall score, overall history score, overall physical exam score and individual case scores Professionalism o The professionalism evaluation will be based on a collective sum of the following Faculty interactions during advisee group meetings, and classroom activities Site visits Review of preceptor comments/evaluation Professionalism OSCE, if included Failure to satisfactorily meet professionalism standards will result in a n appearance before the Professional Standards and Promotion Committee. The Physician Assistant Student will be expected to successfully complete all components of the summative evaluation. If a student that fails one component of the comprehensive summative evaluation he/she will be required to re mediate that component If a student fails more than one component of the comprehensive summative evaluation, he/she may be required to meet with the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee at which point a remediation policy will be determined. T he Professional Standards and Promotions Committee reserves the right to enforce any and all actions that the committee deems appropriate for a given case up to and including deceleration and/or dismissal from the School of PA Studies. In addition to th e summative examination, OSCEs, and professionalism components of the summative evaluation, consideration will be given to the student's performance on patient write -ups and oral presentations. E. Testing Procedures 1. End-of-rotation exams and other clini cal year evaluation exercises are scheduled well in advance. Due to the fact that students are typically spread out across the State, and with end -of-semester grade reporting deadlines imposed on us by the University, postponing or making up exams will be very difficult to accomplish. Students must be on time for all scheduled end -of- rotation testing. 91 a. In the event of illness or personal emergency on the day of an examination, contact the Clinical Director by phone. If you have not communicated directly with the Clinical Director or the School Director, you have not been excused from the end -of-rotation exam. Other faculty and clerical staff cannot excuse you from your exams. Documentation of the reasons fo r an excused absence (as directed by the Clinical Director ) must be provided in all cases before exams will be rescheduled. b. Rescheduling of missed exams is at the discretion of the Clinical Director. If you are doing a rotation away from Gainesville, you may be required to take a day off and return to the UF Campus to make up a missed exam. c. Unexcused absences from end -of-rotation exams may result in a failing grade for the rotation. As mentioned in previous sections, unexcused absences may result in a hearing before the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee. 2. The allotted time for all end -of-rotation examinati ons is 120 minutes. Students shall adhere to the following policies while in the Testing Center: a. Students must turn off cell phones and place all personal belongings in the storage bins within the computer testing center. b. Once the exam has begun, the proctor will not answer any questions. Students should remain in their seats at all times until they have finished the examination. Students may be excused during the examination one at a time in order to use the rest room. c. Keep in mind that all e xaminations conducted in the computer testing lab are subject to video monitoring. Do not communicate with other students during exams or do anything that could be construed as cheating. 3. Upon completing and submitting your exam, please leave the testing area . F. End-of-Rotation Exam Review Policy Upon completion of the examination, the student will be able to access a post -exam report from PAEA that outlines their performance by specific organ system and task area, as well as keywords of items missed. This is an excellent tool to guide your study. As in the PACKRAT\u00ae, PANCE\u00ae and PANRE\u00ae exams, the PAEA does not allow review of specific examinatio n questions or responses. It is very important that you access these reports to identify deficiencies in your knowledge base, so you will be able to improve these areas. 92 G. Student Evaluation of Rotation 1. Students are required to complete an evaluation of each rotation, one for the SITE and one for the PRECEPTOR. Evaluation forms will be posted online on TYPHON approximately one week prior to the end of each rotation and must be completed before the final grade for the rotation will be released. 2. These eva luations of the preceptor and clinical site must be completed sometime between the last Monday and the Clinical Day for each rotation. H. Monitoring of Education During Clinical Year 1. The monitoring of clinical sites and the training experiences during the month is accomplished by a variety of methods. Logging of certain patient information and procedures into databases are used to insure an adequate and robust clinical educational experience is obtained by each student and is a requirement of eac h student. All students must log the relevant and required clinical data for each patient seen. Information regarding student logging will be presented in the Summer A term. 2. Site visits, both announced and unannounced, may occur during the month. During the site visit, a faculty member or other person designated by the PA program will visit a student in their clinical site and observe the student during the course of a patient encounter. The student will be evaluated on their performance, such as ability to gather an adequate history, perform a physical examination, presenting the patient to their preceptor, presenting a differential diagnosis, ordering and interpreting diagnos tic testing, development of a management plan, or patient education. Feedback will be given each student and the site visit form will be placed in the student's record. 3. The first time a student does a rotation in Primary Care, Internal Medicine, General S urgery, Pediatrics, and OB/GYN (a total of five rotations), the student will submit a written H&P including assessment and plan to their preceptor before the end of the month's rotation. This may be a separate written document or a copy of a chart entry bu t should not be a SOAP note or other abbreviated H&P. THIS IS A FULL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAM AN D NOT ANY SORT OF PROGRESS NOTE , SOAP NOTE , OR CHART CHECKLIST . Patient identifiers must be removed in accordance with HIPAA regulations prior to submission to the SPAS. This will be reviewed by a faculty member and a copy will be filed in the student's records. 4. For each clinical day, each student will prepare a case presentation of a patient that they saw during the previous month. Selected students will be called upon to present their case during the meeting with their faculty advisor and colleagues. This case should be a different patient than the patient write - up discussed in #3 above. This presentation may be of an unusual presentation, an unusual diseas e or disorder, or a patient where the student learned a valuable lesson. The presentation will take the form of a standard oral case presentation, with a brief discussion at the end, including feedback 93 from colleagues and advisor. This will be graded on a pass -fail basis by each student's faculty advisor. 5. At the completion of each Elective rotation, and any rotation that does not have a scheduled end -of-rotation examination, the student will be required to turn in proof of completion of (3) Category I CME hours of instruction. (All CME activities MUST be AAPA/AMA -approved Category I hours) Two of these three hours will consist of CME topics, usually in the area of medicine in which the student was rotating that month, and may be assigned by the Clinical Tea m. If it is not assigned, you may choose topics related to that rotation. The remaining CME hour may be completed in an area of the student's choosing. THIS ASSIGNMENT SHOULD BE DONE DURING THE MONTH AND IS DUE ON CLINICAL DAY. J. Additi onal Requirements In order to take advantage of educational opportunities as they present themselves throughout the course of the clinical year curriculum, there may be additional experiences required of all students, such as extra classroom sessions, on -line course modules, remedial coursework, quizzes, etc. 94 University of Florida School of Physician Assistant Studies ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THE CLINICAL YEAR INSTRUCTIONAL ROLES While it is recognized that many students may already possess skills/expertise in a given area taught in the academic year and may at the request and supervision of the course instructor help classmates to learn a given skill, at no time will students replace faculty/course instructors. Likewise, in the clinical year students may not be used to substitute for regular clinical or administrative staff. PROFESSIONAL DEMEANOR AND STUDENT DRESS CODE A. While you are on clinical rotation, patients and other health professionals will judge your professionalism by the your grooming and dress, your communication style, your conflict resolution skills, and your work ethic (showing up on time prepared and ready to work). The community of physician assistants and physician assistant employers in the State of Florida is relatively small. Impressions that you make on clinical rotation may influence future employment opportunities and professional licensure. You sh ould all strive to project a positive image of the PA profession and the University of Florida. B. The School of Physician Assistant Studies expects all students to be professional in their dealings with patients, colleagues, faculty, and staff and to e xhibit caring and compassionate attitudes. These and other qualities will be evaluated in the Professionalism Evaluation form by each preceptor during your clinical year rotations. Professional behavior is defined as behavior appropriate to the circumstanc es. Professional behavior reflects on a student's qualification and potential to become a competent clinician. Attitudes or behaviors inconsistent with compassionate care; refusal by, or inability of, the student to participate constructively in learning o r patient care; derogatory attitudes or inappropriate behaviors directed at patients, peers, faculty, preceptors, or staff; misuse of written or electronic patient records (i.e. accession of patient information without valid reason); substance abuse; failu re to disclose pertinent information on a criminal background check; or other unprofessional conduct can be grounds for dismissal. Dismissal from the School of Physician Assistant Studies for unprofessional behavior may, subsequently, jeopardize the studen t's eligibility for admission to any other college in the university. Examples of standards for professional behavior include, but not limited to the following: accepting personal responsibility for the care of one's patients; demonstrating appropriate truthfulness and honesty with colleagues; communicating an attitude of caring (empathy) in the course of health care delivery; recognizes 95 personal beliefs, prejudices, and limitations; demonstrates respect for patients, families, members of the health care team, and colleagues; demonstrates initiative in patient care and a consistently good work ethic; and respects patient confidentiality at all times in verbal and written communication with others. Inadequate communication and/or failure to respond to com munication initiated by the SPAS is also considered unprofessional, and may result in a substantial reduction in professionalism grade on any given rotation. The conferring of the degree Master of Physician Assistant Studies certifies that the student is not only competent to undertake the career as a physician assistant but possesses the personal traits essential to the profession as judged by the faculty, preceptors, peers, and colleagues. C. Students who are not in adherence with the profession al standards set forth by the School will have a hearing of the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee. If the Committee determines that unprofessional behavior was demonstrated by a student, the following steps may be taken: Depending on the seve rity of the behavior, the student may be warned in writing that the behavior is unacceptable and that if the behavior is continued, it may lead to their dismissal from school. Such a letter will provide examples about what is or what is not acceptable, and may encourage the student to seek professional help from an appropriate resource. The letter may state that counseling, therapy, and anger management sessions may be considered as options. Some types of behavior may be so egregious as to justify immediate dismissal of a student. Such behavior might include criminal acts or substance abuse. If there is a second documented case of unprofessional behavior, the student must appear before the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee and addre ss why he/she should not be dismissed from school. Appeals of any decisions of the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee must be made in writing to the Associate Dean/Director of the School of Physician Assistant Studies within two (2) business days of receiving official notification of the decision. The Associate Dean/Director will make a decision based on the facts and the written appeal within three (3) days of receiving the appeal. Official written notification will be made to the student of the decision of the appeal. D. Appropriate dress for clinical rotations 1. A long white lab coat with a name tag identifying you as a University of Florida PA student is REQUIRED while on clinical rotation. 2. All clothing must be clean and appropriate to a professional working environment. Men should wear ties unless directed otherwise by clinical preceptors or when ties would be inappropriate (e.g., in an operating room). 96 3. Blue jeans, shorts, T -shirts, sandals , open -toed shoes , sneakers, and other casual dress are not appropriate to the clinical setting. 4. The University provides liability insurance for PA students ONLY if the student's nametag is worn. Students not in compliance will be pulled off rotation until they have their badge. Nametags ma y be purchased at the HSC Gator 1 Card office. CLASS (ROTATION) REG ISTRATION IN THE CLI NICAL YEAR A. The School of PA Studies completes registration for clinical students each semester during the clinical year. B. Students are responsible for insuring that all fees are paid to the University by the appropriate deadlines. Failure to pay registration fees on time may result in the cancellation of registration by the University and assessment of a late fee. C. Failure to notify both the University and School of PA Studies of address/name changes may result in cancellation of registration and assessment of a late fee by the University. Students may update their current or permanent address at www.isis.ufl.edu . A UF ID and PIN number will be required. D. All required immunizations and proof of current health insurance must be complete and on file prior to registering for clinical rotations. Without these requirements students will not be able to start their clinical rotation. E. If registration is cancelled due to non -payment of fees, students are IMMEDIATELY terminated from their rotation; the University malpractice insurance program covers only registered students. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Any course grade below a \"C\" (or a failure in a pass/fail course) in the clinical year of the School of PA Studies may be grounds for dismissal for academic reasons, subject to the decision of the School of PA Studies faculty Professional Standards and Promotions Committee. If a stud ent earning a grade below a \"C\" is retained in the School , he/she will be placed on probation for the duration of his/her time in the School of PA Studies and will be required to complete any remedial work prescribed by the faculty; this may result in the student's delayed graduation and could affect the selection of elective rotations in the clinical year . STUDENT ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES The School of PA Studies faculty, meeting as the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee (PSPC), will evaluate issues of student compliance with School of PA Studies ' requirements, policies, and professionalism. The Committee will review the issue of concern and the circumstances surrounding it and may require the student to appear 97 before the Committee to answer qu estions or address specific academic/professional concerns. Students may have an advisor in attendance. The advisor cannot address the PSPC but may be consulted by the student. The student will be offered the opportunity to present an opening and closing statement and to take notes during the meeting. Students will be informed of PSPC action within twenty -four hours of the meeting. The PSPC will then decide on the appropriate action, which may include dismissal from the School of PA Studies. ACADEMIC HO NESTY The University of Florida expects students to be honest in all of their university class work. Therefore, students are required to commit themselves to academic honesty by signing the following statement as part of the admissions process. \"I under stand that the University of Florida expects its students to be honest in all of their academic work. I agree to adhere to this commitment to academic honesty, and understand that my failure to comply with this commitment may result in disciplinary action , up to and including expulsion from the University.\" This statement serves to remind students of the obligations they assume as students at the University of Florida. Matters of pure violations of academic honesty are adjudicated pursuant to University regulation by the Health Science Center Student Conduct Committee. GRIEVANCE / APPEALS PROCEDURE After a decision of the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee has been established, a student has the right to appeal. 1. After the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee makes a decision, the student has the right to appeal. Appeals are made in writing - a personal appearance is made ONLY upon request of the person or persons hearing the appeal, and is not automatic. Typically, ground for an appeal include: a. The policies and procedures of the School were not properly applied. b. The findings of fact were incorrect. c. The action exceeded the authority of the PSPC. d. The PSPC demonstrated bias in its action. e. The PSPC considered evidence that should not have been considered, or failed to consider evidence they should have considered. f. The student requested an accommodation for a disability that was not provided. 2. Students may appeal a decision of the PSPC to the Associate Dean/Director of the School of PA Studies in writing within three days of the decision. Actions by the PSPC and the Associate Dean/Director will be final except in cases of dismissal and suspensio n. 98 3. In cases of dismissal and suspension actions, an AFFIRMED dismissal or suspension decision may be further appealed to the Senior Associate Dean for Educational Affairs. A committee consisting of the Senior Associate Dean for Educational Affairs (chair), the Associate Dean for Medical Education, and the Associate Dean of Student Affairs will consider the appeal. The Committee will undertake one of two actions: AFFIRM the decision of the PSPC. REVERSE the decision of the PSPC and REMAND the case back to them for further consideration. In reversing, the Senior Associate Dean for Educational Affairs will formally advise the PSPC of the reasons for reversal. Decisions of this committee will be final. 4. For matters involving a question of academic hon esty, if the student and School of PA Studies Director do not agree on an outcome, the student can exercise his/her right to a hearing with the Health Science Center Student Conduct Committee. This will be conducted through Student Conduct and Conflict Re solution in the Dean of Students office. Please visit http://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/honorcodes/conductcode.php to view a copy of the violation and procedures that will be followed. PROM OTION AND GRADUATION A. Promotion from the academic to the clinical year and graduation from the School of PA Studies are based on the student's mastery of essential competencies and readiness to assume a professional role, as well as his/her academic performance. While grades are important, the decisions for promotion and graduation are based on the composite picture of both academic performance and professional growth and developmen t. If a student has failed to demonstrate an attitude of professionalism or if the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee does not believe the student is prepared to assume patient care responsibilities, a student may be dismissed from the School of PA Studies . B. The following criteria will be used by the Professional Standards and Promotions Committee as the basis for promoting academic year PA students to the clinical year and for recommending clinical PA students for graduation from the School of PA Studies . Students who fail to meet all promotion criteria may be either dismissed from the School of PA Studies or required to remediate any deficiencies deemed necessary by the faculty committee. Maintain a grade of \"C\" or higher (or a \"pass\" in a pass/fail course). Achieve an acceptable score on the summative evaluation at the end of the clinical year. Demonstrate acceptable levels of maturity, integrity, and other attitudes and behaviors normally expected of health professionals as determined by professionalism evaluations and observations by faculty . 99 C. If a student has failed to demonstrate an attitude of professionalism, or if the Professional Standards a nd Promotions Committee believe s a student is not prepared to assume patient care respons ibilities as based on preceptor comments and evaluations , a student may be dismissed from the School of PA Studies at any time prior to promotion or graduation. RELEASE OF INFORMATI ON / REFERENCE LETTE RS A. Throughout the course of the clinical year, the School of PA Studies may have to release information about any student's academic status to third parties (e.g., information relating to student loan verification, scholarship applications, rotation credentialing, licensure, etc.). 1. If you signed the universal release form at orientation, then no further releases are usually required . 2. If release of information is required, the student MUST fill out a release of information form prior to the School 's releasing any information. 3. The School of PA Studies will not release any information without the student's signed consent in compliance with the Buckley Amendment. The form is available in the office and online at the clinical year website. B. Reference letters and telephone emplo yment recommendations by School of PA Studies faculty also require prior release from students. Remember to ask the individual first if he/she will be a reference for you. Fill out the UF FERPA Release form in the Appendix of this manual. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT Outside employment is strongly discouraged during enrollment in the School of PA Studies. Students are not permitted to work for the School in any manner, either for pay or volunteer status. The School will not consider any application for employment from any student in the program. Physician assistant education is a full time endeavor. However, while School approval is not required for a student to start work, it is essential that the work must not interfere with the stud ent's education. If, in the judgment of the faculty, outside employment is diminishing the student's ability to be an effective learner, the student will be required to reduce or eliminate his/her work. WITHDRAWAL Students withdrawing from the School of PA Studies must submit a withdrawal letter to both the School of PA Studies and the UF Registrar's Office, as well as complete any paperwork needed by either office, and settle any university obligations. UF may refund some portion of the tuition. For d etails see The University Record (the UF catalog), the section on \"Fees and Other Fiscal Information,\" the \"Enrollment and Student Fees,\" \"Refund of Fees\" subsections within it. (Catalogs are available by year online at www.reg.ufl.edu/catalog.html .) 100 LEAVES OF ABSENCE Any request for an extended leave of absence (one month or more) must be submitted to the Associate Dean & Director , UF School of PA Studies as a written letter, including the reason and justification for the request. Requests for leave will be considered on a case - by-case basis. An extended absence may require repeating a portion of a year, one entire year, or both years, depending on the i ndividual educational situation. A leave of absence greater than two months may require reapplication to the School of PA Studies . VISITING THE SCHOOL OF PA STUDIES OFFICES In order to maintain a professional atmosphere appointments must be made with a faculty or staff member. This will ensure that academic and personal affairs of each student are kept confidential while abiding by federal and state laws. When arriving for appointments, please let the front desk know whom you need to see and he/she will inform the proper person. Appointments can be made at the discretion of the faculty/staff member. IMMUNIZATIONS AND HEALTH HISTORY A. University of Florida regulations require that all new students complete both the Immunization and Health History with the Student Health Care Center (SHCC). Students failing to meet this requirement will NOT be permitted to register. All required immunizations must be kept current throughout enrollment in the School of PA Studies . Failure to meet these requirements may result in dismissal. B. Allergy to formaldehyde (previous and subsequent to enrollment) must be verified by a physician. The student must give this information to the College of Medicine Americans with Disabilities (ADA) office in order for protective m ask/cartridge charges to be paid. Otherwise, the student will be responsible for the cost. C. Hepatitis vaccination series and Tuberculin skin test (e.g., PPD or equivalent) must be completed during the Summer A semester. Any student who has not completed this series will not be permitted to start clinical rotations. HEALTH AND DISABILITY INSURANCE As outlined in the orientation information, you must show proof of medical insurance prior to matriculation into the School of PA Studies . This must include both health and hospitalization and must be maintained throughout the duration of your matriculation in the School of PA Studies . Please read your policy carefully and note any exclusion for preexisting conditions, HIV infections, etc. Additionally, you are strongly encouraged to carry disability insurance to cover possible consequences in the event of a needle stick injury or oth er potential exposure to HIV infection. Currently, the College of Medicine does not have a group policy available. Student Health ( www.shcc.ufl.edu/insurance/ship.shtml ) offers coverage to stud ents who are enrolled in a professional program and are taking at least 6 credit hours/semester. Since disability insurance carriers for students are limited, you are encouraged to explore this option through your own insurance carrier. 101 CRIMINAL BACKGROUN D CHECKS AND DRUG SCREENING A. For any felony convictions that occur between the time of submission of the CASPA application and matriculation into the School of PA Studies , the specific details, including date of charge(s), type of offense, and dispositi on of the case, must be reported to the School Director's office immediately. After matriculation into the School of PA Studies , should you be convicted of any felonies at any time during your enrollment in the School , you must report the details (see spec ific details enumerated above) immediately to the School Director's office. Failure to comply will be grounds for dismissal from the School of Physician Assistant Studies . B. During the course of the clinical phase of the School of Physician Assistant Stu dies, students will be required to undergo one or more national criminal background checks, which may include fingerprinting. In addition, certain clinical sites that are regularly used by the School of PA Studies may require additional drug screening in order for students to have practice opportunities at those institutions. C. A criminal background check that reveals criminal activity or a failure to pass drug screening may impede clinical training or status in the School of PA Studies. By accepting admission to the School, students agree to submit to national criminal background checks and drug screening, and also agree to pay expenses associated with screenings. NAME CHANGES Any PA student who changes his/her name while enrolled in the School of PA Studies (i.e., marriage, divorce) is responsible for filing the appropriate forms with the University of Florida requesting a name change. The School of PA Studies will not be responsible for requesting the student 's name change. Failure to complete this change may result in grade reports or a degree being withheld by the University of Florida until this process is complete. ADDRESS / PHONE CHANGES You may update your current and/or permanent address with UF onlin e at www.isis.ufl.edu . You will need your UFID number and PIN. In addition, you must notify the School of PA Studies office of any address or phone number change. FINANCIAL AID Students in the College of Medicine are now able to handle all of their financial aid affairs in the Health Science Center (Room M -128). Ms. Eileen Parris is the Coordinator of Student Financial Aid and can be reached at 273-7939 or at eparris@ufl.edu . She is available for appointments or can be seen on a walk -in basis for counseling, check disbursement, etc. She has a detailed website at http://finaid.med. ufl.edu/ . 102 STUDENT COUNSELING AND DEVELOPMENT Students within the College of Medicine have the availability of confidential personal and academic counseling at the Health Science Center (Room M-135). The Program Director, Beverly L. Vidaurreta, Ph.D., can be reached at 352-273-8383, by pager at 352 -413-6313, or by email at dr.vidaurreta@gmail.com . Dr. Vidaurreta provides student counseling and student development workshops on topics such as effective study techniques, resume writing, stress management, etc. SEXUAL HARASSMENT It is the policy of UF that sexual harassment will not be tolerated at t he university and should not be ignored. It is a violation of federal and state laws and university rules and policy. Sexual harassment is the inappropriate introduction of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, where sex would otherwise be irrelevant. See the UF Sexual Harassment web page at www.aa.ufl.edu/aa/affact/harass . If you believe you have been sexually harassed, report i t at once to the School of PA Studies . In addition, confidential counseling is available from Beverly L. Vidaurreta, Ph.D., Program Director of the College of Medicine Office of Student Counseling and Development. Dr. Vidaurreta can be reached at 352 -273-8383 , by pager at 352 -413-6313, or by email at dr.vidaurreta@gmail.com . COMMUNICATING WITH THE SCHOOL OF PA STUDIES DURING THE CLINICAL YEAR A. Student Status Changes Students must immediately inform the School of PA Studies of any personal or professional circumstance that affects their standing in the University, the status of the clinical rotation, or the School of PA Studies itself. Students are also responsible for notifying both the University and th e School of PA Studies of any address or name changes. B. Email Policy IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU CHECK YOUR UF EMAIL EVERY DAY . Student communication with the School of Physician Assistant Studies is routinely accomplished via email communications. This i s especially true during the clinical year of education when many students are away from Gainesville. Students will be expected to check their University of Florida (e.g. \"@ufl.edu\") email accounts every day for essential communications. These may also be accessed via UF Exchange email at http://www.mail.ufl.edu/ . Email responses are expected in a timely manner. In order to avoid problems with receiving important messages from the School due to exceeding your GatorLink email quota, delete old messages and clear your browser cache on a regular basis. You will be responsible for the inability of the School to deliver important email to you because of failure to manage your email account. Failure t o do so reflect s poorly on the student's profes sional development. 103 When communicating with the School, it is SPAS policy that only University of Florida email accounts will be recognized for student communication. This is important because e -mails origina ting from third -party accounts/services, such as Yahoo, gmail, and others are frequently routed to quarantine folders. In these cases, the recipient may not be notified of the email until a later date when the quarantine folder contents are reviewed. University of Florida policy allows emails to be forwarded to on -campus or alternate e -mail addresses. If a student wishes to use such a service, please assure that when responding to emails the student's GatorLink email account is displayed as the sender's id entification. If the sender's identification does not reflect the student's GatorLink account, it may be sent to a quarantine folder and not responded to within an appropriate timeframe. University of Florida policies pertaining to email forwarding and computing resources, including security and privacy issues, can be found at : http://www.it.ufl.edu/policies/aupolicy.html and http://www.it.ufl.edu/policies/forwarding.html C. Social Networking Sites The School of Physician Assistant Studies subscribes to the policy pertaining to the use of social networking sites as adopted by the College of Medicine. This policy, reproduced below, can be found at: http://osa.med.ufl.edu/policies/use -of-social -networking -sites/ The administration of the College of Medicine recognizes that social networking websites and applications, including but not limited to Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter, are an important and timely means of communication. However, students and residents who u se these websites and other applications must be aware of the critical importance of privatizing their web sites so that only trustworthy \"friends\" have access to the websites/applications. They must also be aware that posting certain information is illega l. Violation of existing statutes and administrative regulations may expose the offender to criminal and civil liability, and the punishment for violations may include fines and imprisonment. Offenders also may be subject to adverse academic actions that r ange from a letter of reprimand to probation to dismissal from school or resident training. The following actions are strictly forbidden: In your professional role as a caregiver, you may not present the personal health information of other individuals. Re moval of an individual's name does not constitute proper de -identification of protected health information. Inclusion of data such as age, gender, race, diagnosis, date of evaluation, or type of treatment or the use of a highly specific medical photograph (such as a before/after photograph of a patient having surgery or a photograph of a patient from one of the medical outreach trips) may still allow the reader to recognize the identity of a specific individual. You may not report private (protected) acade mic information of another student or trainee. Such information might include, but is not limited to: course 104 or clerkship grades, narrative evaluations, examination scores, or adverse academic actions. In posting information on social networking sites, you may not present yourself as an official representative or spokesperson for the University of Florida College of Medicine. You may not represent yourself as another person, real or fictitious, or other wise attempt to obscure your identity as a means to circumvent the prohibitions listed above and below. You may not utilize websites and/or applications in a manner that interferes with your official work commitments. That is, do not tie up a hospital or clinic computer with personal business when others need access to the computer for patient -related matters. Moreover, do not delay completion of assigned clinical responsibilities in order to engage in social networking. In addition to the absolute prohib itions listed above, the actions listed below are strongly discouraged. Violations of these suggested guidelines may be considered unprofessional behavior and may be the basis for disciplinary action. Display of vulgar language Display of language or photographs that imply disrespect for any individual or group because of age, race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Presentation of personal photographs or photographs of others that may reasonably be interpreted as condon ing irresponsible use of alcohol, substance abuse, or sexual promiscuity. Posting of potentially inflammatory or unflattering material on another individual's website, e.g. on the \"wall\" of that individual's Facebook site. When using these social network ing websites/applications, students and residents are strongly encouraged to use a personal e -mail address, rather than their ufl.edu address, as their primary means of identification. Individuals also should make every effort to present themselves in a ma ture, responsible, and professional manner. Discourse should always be civil and respectful. Please be aware that no privatization measure is perfect and that undesignated persons may still gain access to your networking site. A site such as YouTube, of course, is completely open to the public. Future employers (residency or fellowship program directors, department chairs, or private practice partners) often review these network sites when considering potential candidates for employment. Finally, although o nce-posted information can be removed from the original social networking site, exported information cannot be recovered. Any digital exposure can \"live on\" beyond its removal from the original website and continue to circulate in other venues. Therefore, think carefully before you post any information on a website or application. Always be modest, respectful, and professional in your actions. 105 PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS A. Physician assistant students, like students in any professional program, are expected t o maintain high standards of honesty and personal integrity. Academic achievement alone will not assure successful completion of the School of PA Studies . PA students must also demonstrate professionalism, maturity, integrity, and those attitudes and beh aviors expected of all health professionals. B. The School of PA Studies expects all PA students to be professional in their dealings with patients, colleagues, faculty, and staff and to exhibit caring and compassionate attitudes. Professional behavior i s defined as behavior appropriate to the circumstance. Attitudes or behaviors inconsistent with compassionate care; refusal by or inability of the student to participate constructively in learning or patient care; derogatory attitudes or inappropriate beh aviors directed at patient groups, peers, faculty, or staff will not be tolerated by the School of PA Studies . Also see section on Professional Demeanor and Student Dress Code (page 94). C. No alcoholic beverages are to be consumed during working hours or while on call. D. Students are reminded that use of illicit drugs is incompatible with the professional role of the physician assistant. Students who use illicit drugs during the clinical year risk dismissal from the School of PA Studies as well as legal consequences. E. Clinical year students are representatives of the UF School of PA Studies as well as the physician assistant profession as a whole. This should be kept in mind during all interactions with patients, physicians, and other health care personnel during rotations. F. Students are expected to conduct all personal business and soci al activities after assigned hours of the rotation and end -of-rotation days. G. Male students will obtain a female chaperone for female breast and pelvic examinations. Female students are encouraged to obtain chaperones for GU examinations on males. H. Employment during the clinical year is strongly discouraged. If a student chooses to moonlight, it MUST NOT interfere with academic work or clinical rotation schedules. I. Sexual Harassment: 1. In addition to being a violation of state and federal laws , behavior involving unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature is incompatible with faculty, staff, and student status in the University of Florida School of PA Studies . 106 2. Dating individu als at your monthly rotation site (i.e., physicians, residents, support staff, etc.) is highly discouraged. This can be viewed as a form of sexual harassment. 3. Further information regarding sexual harassment policies is outlined in the sexual harassment policy section under the Administrative Policies and Procedures portion of this manua l (see page 102). 4. Students should call the School of PA Studies immediately if they have felt as if they have been harassed while on clinical rotation. J. Medical Re cords and Patient Confidentiality 1. During your training as a physician assistant student you will have occasion to review patients' medical records and gather health information. All data gathered about a patient and his/her medical condition, including all items within a patient's medical records or verbal communication from a patient, is privileged information. Students are not to discuss a patient's medical record in any manner or situation that would reveal any information about that patient to any p erson not involved in the patient's health care. Refrain from discussing your patients in public places, such as cafeterias and elevators, where your conversations may be overheard. Remind those who may be inappropriately discussing patient information, ab out patient confidentiality. 2. If you are asked to present information about a patient's condition while on rotation or as part of a Clinical Day activity, all identifying information (name, address, date of birth, and ID numbers) should be deleted from the records that are copied or pr esented. A patient may be identified according to initials or a fictitious name. Never discuss patients in a dehumanizing or insensitive manner. Although you are required by the School of PA Studies to complete HIPAA training, some practices and most hospi tals will require you to sign a confidentiality statement or complete additional training. 3. All entries that you make in patients' records must be signed with your name followed by PA -S (physician assistant student). The clinical preceptor must countersign all entries/orders before the end of each day during rotation. NO student should EVER leav e the rotation for the day without orders or documentation signed off. Additionally no patient should ever be discharged without a physician co -signature. Non -compliance with these requirements could result in liability issues for the student, the site, and the School of PA Studies . All signatures MUST be legible. Therefore, it is recommended that in addition to your signature, you should BLOCK print your name and title under it. K. Students will adhere to ethical principles and use practical reasoning when treating patients. Refer to the Guidelines for Ethical Conduct for the Physician Assistant 107 Profession Policy of the American Academy of Physician Assistants Adopted May 2000 below (see page 130). L. No student should medically treat other PA student s, friends, or family members while a student in the UF School of PA Studies . STUDENT HEALTH / RISK MANAGEMENT / UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS / ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD EXPOSURE The College of Medicine School of Physician Assistant Studies has a solid, long -standing commitment to protect the health and well -being of students, faculty, staff, patients, and the general public. Students in the School of Physician Assistant Studies are required to show proof of appropriate immunity, or document ed immunization, prior to matriculation and prior to the onset of actual patient contact. Ultimately, each student is responsible for his/her health and safety in the clinical/educational setting. Therefore, it is the goal of the School of Physician Assist ant Studies that all students learn appropriate policies and procedures to follow in the event that they are injured or potentially exposed to blood -borne pathogens or other communicable diseases, as well as exposure to environmental hazards. During the academic year of training, presentations are given on universal blood and body fluid precautions, infection control, and prevention of the spread of communicable disease. In addition, the Student Advocacy Committee monitors student health policies and proced ures, in order to insure compliance with institutional and state health requirements. A. Health and Immunization Requirements. All health and immunization requirements must be up to date and documented in the School of PA Studies office. The following are the requirements of the University of Florida and the College of Medicine School of Physician Assistant Studies : 1. A screening health history form provided by the Student Health Care Center (SHCC). 2. Proof of current health insurance. Certification of current health insurance is mandatory for each year of enrollment in the School of Physician Assistant Studies. 3. Proof of two immunizations against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), or laboratory evidence of a positive (immune) titer against each of the three infections. In the absence of proof of either immunization or immunity, students will be re -immunized by the SHCC. 4. Proof of a negative PPD skin test for tuberculosis (by Mantoux) within the past year, and if positive, proof of a chest x -ray negative for active disease. Additionally, the TB skin test must be repeated in Summer A of the academic year and those who tested positive must complete a TB Surveillance Form. 5. Documentation of varicella (chickenpox). Either proof of positive (immune) varicella titer or two immunizations with varicella vaccine must be submitted. 108 In the absence of proof of either immunization or immunity, students must be immunized; this can be d one by the SHCC or your primary care physician. 6. Proof of the three -dose immunization against Hepatitis B, or completion of the three -dose immunization series prior to the comp letion of the first semester of the first year. Immunizations can be received a t the SHCC. Proof of the completion of the Hepatitis B immunization series is required prior to patient contact. 7. Meningococcal meningitis vaccine. 8. Seasonal influenza vaccine. 9. Tdap within the last 2 years. Remember that, as clinicians, you bear a responsibility to your patients and colleagues to reduce the transmission of disease, especially to the most vulnerable among us. Refusing vaccination, for whatever reason, puts these people at higher risk of nosocomial infection. Students are strongly a dvised to consider this when making a decision to not vaccinate. In accordance with Florida Statutes, any student attending a public educational institution may decline any vaccination, based on religious beliefs/personal tenets. A formal UF Beliefs Exem ption must be completed, and the student must meet with a registered nurse at the Student Health Care Center Immunization Clinic for counseling and information regarding risks associated with such an exemption. Furthermore, if a vaccine -preventable diseas e occurs on campus, or at a clinical site, students who have not been vaccinated may be excluded from attending classes or participating in other School activities. While the Beliefs Exemption applies to Florida public institutions, private hospitals an d clinics may not accept students for clinical rotations who cannot demonstrate either vaccination against or immunity from communicable diseases. As both public and private rotations are an essential part of the clinical curriculum, the loss of a rotation due to lack of vaccination/immunity may result in the student being unable to successfully complete the prescribed course of study for graduation, and may result in dismissal. Contact the Clinical Coordinator at the School for specific forms and instructions for applying for a formal Beliefs Exemption. B. Health and Disability Insurance. The School of Physician Assistant Studies requires all students to be covered by major medical insurance. It is not sufficient for the student to seek care thro ugh the Student Health Care Center, for the SHCC can offer only primary outpatient care. Insurance may be acquired through a family major medical policy, through a private insurance agency, or by purchasing the University of Florida Student Government Heal th Insurance Plan B. It is highly advisable that the insurance plan chosen, offer appropriate, comprehensive coverage throughout the State of Florida and not simply in Gainesville and Alachua County or at a distant city/county/state only. The student shoul d check with his/her insurance company as 109 to the coverage provided for accidental exposure. It is important for students to realize that medical expenses for care provided by Shands Hospitals and hospitals affiliated with the College of Medicine School of Physician Assistant Studies , including laboratory procedures and emergency care, are the responsibility of the student and not the College of Medicine School of Physician Assistant Studies or the University. Any injury or accidental exposure is NOT consi dered workmen's compensation since the student is not an employee of the site. The School of Physician Assistant Studies strongly advises all PA students to acquire disability insurance, to provide protection in the event of a long -term illness or injury. C. Policies for Potential Exposures to Blood -borne Pathogens and Communicable Diseases . FIRST, USE THE ACCIDENTAL NEEDLE -STICK CHECKLIST IN THE APPENDIX OF THIS MANUAL, THEN CAREFULLY READ THE POLICIES BELOW: 1. Policies and procedures concerning blood -borne pathogen exposures and exposures to communicable diseases are addressed during the academic year of training. 2. It is the responsibility of the student to report sharp injuries, needle sticks, or other potential exposure to blood -borne pathog ens via blood or body fluids immediately to the supervisor at the facility where the accident occurs. The student must also notify the School of PA Studies in the event of an exposure incident within 24 hours of the exposure (see Report of Accidental Expo sure form in the Appendix of this manual ). . In the event that the student contracts a communicable disease which potentially poses a risk to patients or co -workers (e.g., tuberculosis, varicella), steps will be taken to prevent dissemination in accordance with Student Health, Public Health, and/or CDC protocols. Certain communicable diseases may also be reported to county or state health authorities, as required by law. 3. Potential Blood -borne Pathogen Exposures. It is the goal of the UF Stude nt Health Care Center to offer timely, state -of-the-art care for students who have experienced potential blood -borne pathogen exposures in the UF/Shands Health System. Time is frequently of the essence in managing blood -borne pathogen exposures. For exampl e, some treatment regimens must be started within two hours of exposure to be maximally effective. In the event of a potential blood -borne pathogen exposure, students should immediately contact a medical provider at the Student Health Care Center at (352) 392-1161; after hours, call 1 -866-477-6824. A member of the medical staff is available for phone consultation 24 -hours a day. The SHCC medical provider will make recommendations for immediate evaluation and care as follows: 110 a. If the student is within a one-hour radius of Gainesville (including Shands at UF Hospital and Clinics, Shands at AGH, the Gainesville VA Hospital, or other nearby clinical sites), the student should receive his/her care at one of the following Student Health Care Center facilities: The Student Health @ Shands satellite clinic, (352) 392 -0627, Room D2 -52, located in the 2nd floor Dental Tower, open Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m ., Fall & Spring semesters. The Student Health Care Center (SHCC) at the main Infirmary Building on Fletcher Drive, located next to the Florida Gym, (352) 392-1161. During Fall and Spring semesters, the SHCC is open Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. It is closed on weekends and university holidays. During Summer semester and semester breaks, please call the SHCC for hours. b. If the student is at an off -site rotation more than one -hour from Gainesville (including UF Health Science Center in Jacksonville and rotations in Orlando), the student should notify his/her rotation supervisor a nd the UF SHCC (352 -392-1161), and then seek care at the Emergency Department or Employee Health Clinic at his/her hospital, or at a nearby hospital emergency center. Subsequently, the student should call to make an appointment at the SHCC @ Shands or the main SHCC @ the Infirmary Building for appropriate follow -up care. c. After hours, the student should seek immediate care for potential blood -borne pathogen exposures at the Shands at UF Emergency Department, (352) 395 -0050, or at the local Emergency De partment for distant off -site rotations. Once again, the student should call to make an appointment at the SHCC @ Shands or the main SHCC @ the Infirmary Building for appropriate follow -up care. In the event of any potential blood -borne pathogen exposure , the student should obtain the name of the source patient, medical record #, room number, and diagnosis. This information is necessary to assist the medical provider in determining the potential severity of the exposure , and it must be protected in accord ance with HIPAA and institutional rules . If initial care is provided outside the SHCC/Shands system, the student should inform the provider that UF physicians follow current CDC guidelines in determining the need for post -exposure HIV prophylaxis. If the p rovider has questions, he/she could call the SHCC at (352) 392 - 1161 or the Shands @ UF Emergency Department at (352) 395 -0050. Appropriate first aid should be given for the injury and a tetanus booster when indicated. If a student's health insurance has finally determined that it will not cover a medically appropriate course of prophylactic treatment for the student's potential exposure to 111 HIV (which exposure occurred in the course of the student's college studies and activities), the College of Medicine may assist the student and pay for the treatment. A student may request the College of Medicine's assistance by discussing his/her situation with a representative of the Office of Student Affairs at 352 -273-7971 . D. Students Ill with Communicable Diseases. By College of Medicine and Shands Hospital policy, students with communicable diseases or conditions may not be allowed patient contact. This restriction may be necessary to protect the health and safety of UF and Shands patie nts and staff. Persons with the following medical conditions will not be allowed patient contact without a medical clearance: Active chickenpox, measles, German measles, herpes zoster (shingles), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, tuberculosis Oral h erpes with draining lesions Group A streptococcal disease (i.e., strep throat) until 24 hours of treatment received Diarrhea lasting over three days or accompanied by fever or bloody stools Draining or infected skin lesions Conjunctivitis If an ill stu dent is unsure whether he/she should participate in patient care, the student should contact the SHCC clinical staff at (352) 392 -1161, or the Student Health @ Shands satellite clinic at (352) 392 -0627. E. Policies Regarding HIV/AIDS and Other Communicabl e Diseases. It is the policy of the University of Florida to assess the needs of students or employees with HIV infection or other communicable diseases on a case -by-case basis. If any such infection occurs in a College of Medicine student, any recommenda tions made or actions taken by the College of Medicine or the Shands Hospitals will respect the confidentiality and welfare of the student, while also recognizing and responding to issues regarding the welfare of patients, the College of Medicine/ School o f PA Studies , and the hospital. The College on a case -by-case basis will evaluate each student's situation. With the permission of the affected student, the Director of the Student Health Care Center (a physician) will assist in the coordination of resourc es and services. 1. Currently, the UF College of Medicine and the Shands Hospital do not recommend the routine HIV testing of patients, students, or healthcare workers. However, it is certainly prudent for individual healthcare workers, including student s, to be aware of their own individual HIV status so that they can take appropriate precautions and measures. With current advances in HIV/AIDS treatment, early intervention can be crucial to maintaining well - being and delaying complications of the illness . If future state or federal legislation were to change guidelines or requirements for HIV testing of healthcare workers or healthcare students, the College of Medicine and Shands Hospitals would comply as required. 112 2. In the event of a potential blood -borne pathogen exposure in a student, the medical provider will recommend HIV testing as a baseline and also follow -up intervals of 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. When testing is medically advisable, it is subject to informed consent and results are treated confidentially. 3. The best protection is prevention and adherence to Standard Universal Precautions (see below). F. Standard Universal Precautions . When providing patient care, regardless of the real or perceived communicable disease status of the patient, all students and staff should follow Standard Universal Precautions: Wash hands before and after patient contact, according to hospital policy , even if gloves are used. Wear gloves when exposure to blood, body fluids, excretions, or secretions is likely. Use gloves appropriately according to aseptic and/or sterile techniques, and change gloves between patients. Wear gowns/aprons when soiling of clothing with blood or body fluids is likely. Wear masks, face shields, and eye protection when aerosolization of blood or body fluids may occur. Dispose of sharps in designated rigid sharps containers. Never recap by hand. Dispose of waste saturated with blood or body fluids in designated red -bag trash containers. G. Environmental Hazards/Hazardous Waste . If exposure to environmental hazards of any kind occurs (either on campus or on clinical rotation), follow all approp riate reporting instructions at your clinical site (if on clinical rotations) and in all cases, the exposure should be reported immediately to the School. If deemed necessary, students should present for medical care at an appropriat e facility. Please refe r to Appendix \"D\" of this Manual for specific procedures and guidance. 113 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA SCHOOL OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT STUDIES Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession Preamble In 2003, the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) initiated an effort to define PA competencies in response to similar efforts being conducted within other health care professions and growing demand for accountability and assessment in clinical practice. The following year, representatives from three other national PA organizations, each bringing a unique perspective and valuable insights, joined NCCPA in that effort. Those organizations were the Accreditation Review Commis sion on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC -PA), the body that accredits PA educational programs; the Association of Physician Assistant Programs (APAP), the membership association for PA educators and program directors; and the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), the only national membership association representing all PAs. The resultant document, Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession , is a foundation from which each of those four organizations, other physician assistant organizations, and individual physician assistants themselves can chart a course for advancing the competencies of the PA profession. Introduction The purpose of this document is to communicate to the PA profession and the public a set of competencies th at all physician assistants regardless of specialty or setting are expected to acquire and maintain throughout their careers. This document serves as a map for the individual PA, the physician -PA team, and organizations that are committed to promoting the development and maintenance of these professional competencies among physician assistants. The clinical role of PAs includes primary and specialty care in medical and surgical practice settings. Professional competencies1 for physician assistants includ e the effective and appropriate application of medical knowledge, interpersonal and communication skills, patient care, professionalism, practice -based learning and improvement, systems -based practice, as well as an unwavering commitment to continual learn ing and professional growth, and the physician -PA team, for the benefit of patients and the larger community being served. These competencies are demonstrated within the scope of practice, whether medical or surgical, for each individual physician assista nt as that scope is defined by the supervising physician and appropriate to the setting. 1In 1999, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) endorsed a list of general competencies for medical residents. NCCPA's Eligibility Commit tee, with substantial input from representatives of AAPA, APAP and ARC -PA, has modified the ACGME's list for physician assistant practice, drawing from several other resources, including the work of Drs. Epstein and Hundert; research conducted by AAPA's EV P/CEO, Dr. Steve Crane; and NCCPA's own examination content blueprint. 114 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA SCHOOL OF PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT STUDIES PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT COMPETENCIES The PA profession defines the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes required and provides educational experiences as needed in order for physician assistants to acquire and demonstrate these competencies. Medical knowledge Medical knowledge includes an understanding of pathophysiology, patient presentation, differential diagnosis, patient management, surgical principles, health promotion, and disease prevention. Physician assistants must demonstrate core knowledge about established and evolving biomedical and clinical sciences and the application of this knowledge to patient care i n their area of practice. In addition, physician assistants are expected to demonstrate an investigatory and analytic thinking approach to clinical situations. Physician assistants are expected to: Understand etiologies, risk factors, underlying patholo gic process, and epidemiology for medical conditions Identify signs and symptoms of medical conditions Select and interpret appropriate diagnostic or lab studies Manage general medical and surgical conditions to include understanding the indications, contr aindications, side effects, interactions, and adverse reactions of pharmacologic agents and other relevant treatment modalities Identify the appropriate site of care for presenting conditions, including identifying emergent cases and those requiring referr al or admission Identify appropriate interventions for prevention of conditions Identify the appropriate methods to detect conditions in an asymptomatic individual Differentiate between the normal and the abnormal in anatomy, physiology, laboratory finding s, and other diagnostic data Appropriately use history and physical findings and diagnostic studies to formulate a differential diagnosis Provide appropriate care to patients with chronic conditions. Interpersonal & communication skills Interpersonal and communication skills encompass verbal, nonverbal, and written exchange of information. Physician assistants must demonstrate interpersonal and communication skills that result in effective information exchange with patients, their patients' families, phys icians, professional associates, and the health care system. Physician assistants are expected to: Create and sustain a therapeutic and ethically sound relationship with patients 115 Use effective listening, nonverbal, explanatory, questioning, and writing s kills to elicit and provide information Appropriately adapt communication style and messages to the context of the individual patient interaction Work effectively with physician and other health care professionals as a member or leader of a health care tea m or other professional group Apply an understanding of human behavior Demonstrate emotional resilience and stability, adaptability, flexibility, and tolerance of ambiguity and anxiety Accurately and adequately document and record information regarding the care process for medical, legal, quality, and financial purposes. Patient care Patient care includes age appropriate assessment, evaluation, and management. Physician assistants must demonstrate care that is effective, patient -centered, timely, efficien t, and equitable for the treatment of health problems and the promotion of wellness. Physician assistants are expected to: Work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals to provide patient -centered care Demonstrate caring and respec tful behaviors when interacting with patients and their families Gather essential and accurate information about their patients Make informed decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on patient information and preferences, up -to-date scientific evidence, and clinical judgment Develop and carry out patient management plans Counsel and educate patients and their families Competently perform medical and surgical procedures considered essential in the area of practice Provide health care s ervices and education aimed at preventing health problems or maintaining health. Professionalism Professionalism is the expression of positive values and ideals as care is delivered. Foremost, it involves prioritizing the interests of those being served above one's own. Physician assistants must know their professional and personal limitations. Professionalism also requires that PAs practice without impairment from substance abuse, cognitive deficiency, or mental illness. Physician assistants must demo nstrate a high level of responsibility, ethical practice, sensitivity to a diverse patient population, and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. Physician assistants are expected to demonstrate: Understanding of legal and regulatory requirement s, as well as the appropriate role of the physician assistant Professional relationships with physician supervisors and other health care providers 116 Respect, compassion, and integrity Responsiveness to the needs of patients and society Accountability to patients, society, and the profession Commitment to excellence and ongoing professional development Commitment to ethical principles pertaining to provision or withholding of clinical care, confidentiality of patient information, informed consent, and business practices Sensitivity and responsiveness to patients' culture, age, gender, and disabilities Self-reflection, critical curiosity, and initiative. Practice -based learning and improvement Practice -based learning and improvement includes the processes t hrough which clinicians engage in critical analysis of their own practice experience, medical literature, and other information resources for the purpose of self -improvement. Physician assistants must be able to assess, evaluate, and improve their patient care practices. Physician assistants are expected to: Analyze practice experience and perform practice -based improvement activities using a systematic methodology in concert with other members of the health care delivery team Locate, appraise, and integ rate evidence from scientific studies related to their patients' health problems Obtain and apply information about their own population of patients and the larger population from which their patients are drawn Apply knowledge of study designs and statisti cal methods to the appraisal of clinical studies and other information on diagnostic and therapeutic effectiveness Apply information technology to manage information, access online medical information, and support their own education Facilitate the learnin g of students and/or other health care professionals Recognize and appropriately address gender, cultural, cognitive, emotional, and other biases; gaps in medical knowledge; and physical limitations in themselves and others. Systems -based practice Systems -based practice encompasses the societal, organizational, and economic environments in which health care is delivered. Physician assistants must demonstrate an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger system of health care to provide patient care tha t is of optimal value. PAs should work to improve the larger health care system of which their practices are a part. Physician assistants are expected to: Use information technology to support patient care decisions and patient education Effectively interact with different types of medical practice and delivery systems 117 Understand the funding sources and payment systems that provide coverage for patient care Practice cost -effective health care and resource allocation that does not compromise quality of care Advocate for quality patient care and assist patients in dealing with system complexities Partner with supervising physicians, health care managers, and other health care providers to assess, coordinate, and improve delivery of health care and patien t outcomes Accept responsibility for promoting a safe environment for patient care and recognizing and correcting systems -based factors that negatively impact patient care Use information to support patient care decisions and patient education Apply medica l information and clinical data systems to provide more effective, efficient patient care Utilize the systems responsible for the appropriate payment of services. 118 Exam Content Blueprint Task Areas The list of tasks below include knowledge and skill areas that were identified as important to physician assistant practice through an intensive practice analysis.

COMMUNITY WELL BEING CONCLUSION 131 Introduction The physician assistant profession has revised its code of ethics several times since the profession began. Although the fundamental principles underlying the ethical care of patients have not changed, the societal framework in which those principles are applied has. Economic pressures of the health care system, social pressures of church a nd state, technological advances, and changing patient demographics continually transform the landscape in which PAs practice. Previous codes of the profession were brief lists of tenets for PAs to live by in their professional lives. This document depart s from that format by attempting to describe ways in which those tenets apply. Each situation is unique. Individual PAs must use their best judgment in a given situation while considering the preferences of the patient and the supervising physician, clinic al information, ethical concepts, and legal obligations. Four main bioethical principles broadly guided the development of these guidelines: autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Autonomy, strictly speaking, means self -rule. Patients have the right to make autonomous decisions and choices, and physician assistants should respect these decisions and choices. Beneficence means that PAs should act in the patient's best interest. In certain cases, respecting the patient's autonomy and acting i n their best interests may be difficult to balance. Nonmaleficence means to do no harm, to impose no unnecessary or unacceptable burden upon the patient. Justice means that patients in similar circumstances should receive similar care. Justice also applies to norms for the fair distribution of resources, risks, and costs. Physician assistants are expected to behave both legally and morally. They should know and understand the laws governing their practice. Likewise, they should understand the ethical responsibilities of being a health care professional. Legal requirements and ethical expectations will not always be in agreement. Generally speaking, the law describes minimum standards of acceptable behavior, and ethical principles delineate the highest moral standards of behavior. When faced with an ethical dilemma, PAs may find the guidance they need in this document. If not, they may wish to seek guidance elsewhere possibly from a supervising physician, a hospital ethics committee, an ethicist, trusted colleagues, or other AAPA policies. PAs should seek legal counsel when they are concerned about the potential legal consequences of their decisions. The following sections discuss ethical conduct of PAs in their professi onal interactions with patients, physicians, colleagues, other health professionals, and the public. The \"Statement of Values\" within this document defines the fundamental values that the PA profession strives to uphold. These values provide the foundation upon which the guidelines rest. The guidelines were written with the understanding that no document can encompass all actual and potential ethical responsibilities, and PAs should not regard them as comprehensive. 132 Statement of Values of the Physician As sistant Profession Physician assistants hold as their primary responsibility the health, safety, welfare, and dignity of all human beings. Physician assistants uphold the tenets of patient autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. Physician assis tants recognize and promote the value of diversity. Physician assistants treat equally all persons who seek their care. Physician assistants hold in confidence the information shared in the course of practicing medicine. Physician assistants assess their p ersonal capabilities and limitations, striving always to improve their medical practice. Physician assistants actively seek to expand their knowledge and skills, keeping abreast of advances in medicine. Physician assistants work with other members of the h ealth care team to provide compassionate and effective care of patients. Physician assistants use their knowledge and experience to contribute to an improved community. Physician assistants respect their professional relationship with physicians. Physician assistants share and expand knowledge within the profession. The PA and Patient PA Role and Responsibilities Physician assistant practice flows out of a unique relationship that involves the PA, the physician, and the patient. The individual patient -PA relationship is based on mutual respect and an agreement to work together regarding medical care. In addition, PAs practice medicine with physician supervision; therefore, the care that a PA provides is an extension of the care of the supervising physician . The patient -PA relationship is also a patient -PA-physician relationship. The principal value of the physician assistant profession is to respect the health, safety, welfare, and dignity of all human beings. This concept is the foundation of the patient -PA relationship. Physician assistants have an ethical obligation to see that each of their patients receives appropriate care. PAs should be sensitive to the beliefs and expectations of the patient . PAs should recognize that each patient is unique and has an ethical right to self -determination Physician assistants are professionally and ethically committed to providing nondiscriminatory care to all patients. While PAs are not expected to ignore their own personal values, scientific or ethical standards, or the law, they should not allow their personal beliefs to restrict patient access to care . A PA has an ethical duty to offer each patient the full range of information on relevant options for their health care. If personal moral, religious, or ethical beli efs prevent a PA from offering the full range of treatments available or care the patient desires, the PA has an ethical duty to refer a patient to another qualified provider . That referral should not restrict a patient's access to care . PAs are obligated to care for patients in emergency situations and to responsibly transfer patients if they cannot care for them. 133 Physician assistants should always act in the best interests of their patients and as advocates when necessary. PAs should actively resist poli cies that restrict free exchange of medical information. For example, a PA should not withhold information about treatment options simply because the option is not covered by insurance. PAs should inform patients of financial incentives to limit care, use resources in a fair and efficient way, and avoid arrangements or financial incentives that conflict with the patient's best interests. The PA and Diversity The physician assistant should respect the culture, values, beliefs, and expectations of the patien t. Nondiscrimination Physician assistants should not discriminate against classes or categories of patients in the delivery of needed health care. Such classes and categories include gender, color, creed, race, religion, age, ethnic or national origin, po litical beliefs, nature of illness, disability, socioeconomic status, physical stature, body size, gender identity, marital status, or sexual orientation. Initiation and Discontinuation of Care In the absence of a preexisting patient -PA relationship, the physician assistant is under no ethical obligation to care for a person unless no other provider is available. A PA is morally bound to provide care in emergency situations and to arrange proper follow -up. PAs should keep in mind that contracts with health insurance plans might define a legal obligation to provide care to certain patients. A physician assistant and supervising physician may discontinue their professional relationship with an established patient as long as proper procedures are followed. Th e PA and physician should provide the patient with adequate notice, offer to transfer records, and arrange for continuity of care if the patient has an ongoing medical condition. Discontinuation of the professional relationship should be undertaken only af ter a serious attempt has been made to clarify and understand the expectations and concerns of all involved parties. If the patient decides to terminate the relationship, they are entitled to access appropriate information contained within their medical r ecord. Informed Consent Physician assistants have a duty to protect and foster an individual patient's free and informed choices. The doctrine of informed consent means that a PA provides adequate information that is comprehendible to a competent patient or patient surrogate. At a minimum, this should include the nature of the medical condition, the objectives of the proposed treatment, treatment options, possible outcomes, and the risks involved. PAs should be committed to the concept of shared decision m aking, which involves assisting patients in making decisions that account for medical, situational, and personal factors. In caring for adolescents, the PA should understand all of the laws and regulations in his or her jurisdiction that are related to th e ability of minors to consent to or refuse health care. Adolescents should be encouraged to involve their families in health care decision making. The PA should also understand consent laws pertaining to emancipated or mature minors. (See the section on Confidentiality .) When the person giving consent is a patient's surrogate, a family member, or other legally authorized representative, the PA should take reasonable care to assure that the decisions made are consistent with the patient's best interests and personal prefere nces, if known. If the PA 134 believes the surrogate's choices do not reflect the patient's wishes or best interests, the PA should work to resolve the conflict. This may require the use of additional resources, such as an ethics committee. Confidentiality Physician assistants should maintain confidentiality. By maintaining confidentiality, PAs respect patient privacy and help to prevent discrimination based on medical conditions. If patients are confident that their privacy is protected, they are more likely to seek medical care and more likely to discuss their problems candidly. In cases of adolescent patients, family support is important but should be balanced with the patient's need for confidentiality and the PA's obligation to respect their emerging auto nomy. Adolescents may not be of age to make independent decisions about their health, but providers should respect that they soon will be. To the extent they can, PAs should allow these emerging adults to participate as fully as possible in decisions about their care. It is important that PAs be familiar with and understand the laws and regulations in their jurisdictions that relate to the confidentiality rights of adolescent patients. (See the section on Informed Consent .) Any communication about a patien t conducted in a manner that violates confidentiality is unethical. Because written, electronic, and verbal information may be intercepted or overheard, the PA should always be aware of anyone who might be monitoring communication about a patient. PAs sho uld choose methods of storage and transmission of patient information that minimize the likelihood of data becoming available to unauthorized persons or organizations. Computerized record keeping and electronic data transmission present unique challenges t hat can make the maintenance of patient confidentiality difficult. PAs should advocate for policies and procedures that secure the confidentiality of patient information. The Patient and the Medical Record Physician assistants have an obligation to keep i nformation in the patient's medical record confidential. Information should be released only with the written permission of the patient or the patient's legally authorized representative. Specific exceptions to this general rule may exist (e.g., workers co mpensation, communicable disease, HIV, knife/gunshot wounds, abuse, substance abuse). It is important that a PA be familiar with and understand the laws and regulations in his or her jurisdiction that relate to the release of information. For example, stri ngent legal restrictions on release of genetic test results and mental health records often exist. Both ethically and legally, a patient has certain rights to know the information contained in his or her medical record. While the chart is legally the pro perty of the practice or the institution, the information in the chart is the property of the patient. Most states have laws that provide patients access to their medical records. The PA should know the laws and facilitate patient access to the information . Disclosure A physician assistant should disclose to his or her supervising physician information about errors made in the course of caring for a patient. The supervising physician and PA should disclose the error to the patient if such information is si gnificant to the patient's interests and well being. Errors do not always constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior, but failure to disclose them may. 135 Care of Family Members and Co -workers Treating oneself, co -workers, close friends, family members, or students whom the physician assistant supervises or teaches may be unethical or create conflicts of interest. For example, it might be ethically acceptable to treat one's own child for a case of otitis media but it probably is not acceptable to treat one's spouse for depression. PAs should be aware that their judgment might be less than objective in cases involving friends, family members, students, and colleagues and that providing \"curbside\" care might sway the individual from establishing an ongoing relationship with a provider. If it becomes necessary to treat a family member or close associate, a formal patient - provider relationship should be established, and the PA should consider transferring the patient's care to another provider as soon as it is practical. If a close associate requests care, the PA may wish to assist by helping them find an appropriate provider. There may be exceptions to this guideline, for example, when a PA runs an employee health center or works in occupational medic ine. Even in those situations, the PA should be sure they do not provide informal treatment, but provide appropriate medical care in a formally established patient - provider relationship. Genetic Testing Evaluating the risk of disease and performing diagno stic genetic tests raise significant ethical concerns. Physician assistants should be informed about the benefits and risks of genetic tests. Testing should be undertaken only after proper informed consent is obtained. If PAs order or conduct the tests, th ey should assure that appropriate pre - and post -test counseling is provided. PAs should be sure that patients understand s the potential consequences of undergoing genetic tests from impact on patients themselves, possible implications for other family members, and potential use of the information by insurance companies or others who might have access to the information. Because of the potential for discrimination by insurers, em ployers, or others, PAs should be particularly aware of the need for confidentiality concerning genetic test results. Reproductive Decision Making Patients have a right to access the full range of reproductive health care services, including fertility treatments, contraception, sterilization, and abortion. Physician assistants have an ethical obligation to provide balanced and unbiased clinical information about reproductive health care. When the PA's personal values conflict with providing full disclosur e or providing certain services such as sterilization or abortion, the PA need not become involved in that aspect of the patient's care. By referring the patient to a qualified provider who is willing to discuss and facilitate all treatment options, the PA fulfills their ethical obligation to ensure the patient's access to all legal options. End of Life Among the ethical principles that are fundamental to providing compassionate care at the end of life, the most essential is recognizing that dying is a per sonal experience and part of the life cycle. Physician Assistants should provide patients with the opportunity to plan for end of life care. Advance directives, living wills, durable power of attorney, and organ donation should be discussed during routine patient visits. PAs should assure terminally -ill patients that their dignity is a priority and that relief of physical and mental suffering is paramount. PAs should exhibit non -judgmental attitudes and should assure their terminally -ill patients that th ey will not be abandoned. To the extent possible, patient or surrogate 136 preferences should be honored, using the most appropriate measures consistent with their choices, including alternative and non -traditional treatments. PAs should explain palliative and hospice care and facilitate patient access to those services. End of life care should include assessment and management of psychological, social, and spiritual or religious needs. While respecting patients' wishes for particular treatments when possible , PAs also must weigh their ethical responsibility, in consultation with supervising physicians, to withhold futile treatments and to help patients understand such medical decisions. PAs should involve the physician in all near -death planning. The PA shou ld only withdraw life support with the supervising physician's agreement and in accordance with the policies of the health care institution. The PA and Individual Professionalism Conflict of Interest Physician assistants should place service to patients before personal material gain and should avoid undue influence on their clinical judgment. Trust can be undermined by even the appearance of improper influence. Examples of excessive or undue influence on clinical judgment can take several forms. These may include financial incentives, pharmaceutical or other industry gifts, and business arrangements involving referrals. PAs should disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest to their patients. Acceptance of gifts, trips, hospitality, or other items is discouraged. Before accepting a gift or financial arrangement, PAs might consider the guidelines of the Royal College of Physicians, \"Would I be willing to have this arrangement generally known?\" or of the American College of Physicians, \"What would the public or my patients think of this arrangement?\" Professional Identity Physician assistants should not misrepresent directly or indirectly, their skills, training, professional credentials, or id entity. Physician assistants should uphold the dignity of the PA profession and accept its ethical values. Competency Physician assistants should commit themselves to providing competent medical care and extend to each patient the full measure of their professional ability as dedicated, empathetic health care providers. PAs should also strive to maintain and increase the quality of their health care knowledge, cultural sensitivity, and cultural competence through individual study and continuing education . Sexual Relationships It is unethical for physician assistants to become sexually involved with patients. It also may be unethical for PAs to become sexually involved with former patients or key third parties. Key third parties are individuals who have i nfluence over the patient. These might include spouses or partners, parents, guardians, or surrogates. Such relationships generally are unethical because of the PA's position of authority and the inherent imbalance of knowledge, expertise, and status. Iss ues such as dependence, trust, transference, and inequalities of power may lead to increased vulnerability on the part of the current or former patients or key third parties. 137 Gender Discrimination and Sexual Harassment It is unethical for physician assis tants to engage in or condone any form of gender discrimination. Gender discrimination is defined as any behavior, action, or policy that adversely affects an individual or group of individuals due to disparate treatment, disparate impact, or the creation of a hostile or intimidating work or learning environment. It is unethical for PAs to engage in or condone any form of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or academic environment, or Accepting or rejecting such conduct af fects or may be perceived to affect professional decisions concerning an individual, or Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's training or professional position. The PA and Other Professio nals Team Practice Physician assistants should be committed to working collegially with other members of the health care team to assure integrated, well -managed, and effective care of patients. PAs should strive to maintain a spirit of cooperation with ot her health care professionals, their organizations, and the general public. Illegal and Unethical Conduct Physician assistants should not participate in or conceal any activity that will bring discredit or dishonor to the PA profession. They should repor t illegal or unethical conduct by health care professionals to the appropriate authorities. Impairment Physician assistants have an ethical responsibility to protect patients and the public by identifying and assisting impaired colleagues. \"Impaired\" mean s being unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety because of physical or mental illness, loss of motor skills, or excessive use or abuse of drugs and alcohol. PAs should be able to recognize impairment in physician supervisors, PAs, and other health care providers and should seek assistance from appropriate resources to encourage these individuals to obtain treatment. PA-Physician Relationship Supervision should include ongoing communication between the physician and the physician assistant regarding patient care. The PA should consult the supervising physician whenever it will safeguard or advance the welfare of the patient. This includes seeki ng assistance in situations of conflict with a patient or another health care professional. Complementary and Alternative Medicine When a patient asks about an alternative therapy, the PA has an ethical obligation to gain a basic understanding of the alternative therapy being considered or being used and how the treatment will affect the patient . If the treatment would harm the patient, the PA should work diligently to dissuade 138 the patient from using it, advise other treatment, and perhaps consider tr ansferring the patient to another provider. The PA and the Health Care System Workplace Actions Physician assistants may face difficult personal decisions to withhold medical services when workplace actions (e.g., strikes, sick -outs, slowdowns, etc.) occ ur. The potential harm to patients should be carefully weighed against the potential improvements to working conditions and, ultimately, patient care that could result. In general, PAs should individually and collectively work to find alternatives to such actions in addressing workplace concerns. PAs as Educators All physician assistants have a responsibility to share knowledge and information with patients, other health professionals, students, and the public. The ethical duty to teach includes effective communication with patients so that they will have the information necessary to participate in their health care and wellness. PAs and Research The most important ethical principle in research is honesty. This includes assuring subjects' informed consent, following treatment protocols, and accurately reporting findings. Fraud and dishonesty in research should be reported so that the appropriate authorities can take action. Physician assistants involved in research must be aware of potential conflicts of i nterest. The patient's welfare takes precedence over the desired research outcome. Any conflict of interest should be disclosed. In scientific writing, PAs should report information honestly and accurately. Sources of funding for the research must be incl uded in the published reports. Plagiarism is unethical. Incorporating the words of others, either verbatim or by paraphrasing, without appropriate attribution is unethical and may have legal consequences. When submitting a document for publication, any pr evious publication of any portion of the document must be fully disclosed. PAs as Expert Witnesses The physician assistant expert witness should testify to what he or she believes to be the truth. The PA's review of medical facts should be thorough, fair, and impartial. The PA expert witness should be fairly compensated for time spent preparing, appearing, and testifying. The PA should not accept a contingency fee based on the outcome of a case in which testimony is given or derive personal, financial, or professional favor in addition to compensation. The PA and Society Lawfulness Physician assistants have the dual duty to respect the law and to work for positive change to laws that will enhance the health and well being of the community. 139 Executions Physician assistants, as health care professionals, should not participate in executions because to do so would violate the ethical principle of beneficence. Access to Care / Resource Allocation Physician assistants have a responsibility to use health car e resources in an appropriate and efficient manner so that all patients have access to needed health care. Resource allocation should be based on societal needs and policies, not the circumstances of an individual patient -PA encounter. PAs participating in policy decisions about resource allocation should consider medical need, cost -effectiveness, efficacy, and equitable distribution of benefits and burdens in society. Community Well Being Physician assistants should work for the health, well being, and th e best interest of both the patient and the community. Sometimes there is a dynamic moral tension between the well being of the community in general and the individual patient. Conflict between an individual patient's best interest and the common good is n ot always easily resolved. In general, PAs should be committed to upholding and enhancing community values, be aware of the needs of the community, and use the knowledge and experience acquired as professionals to contribute to an improved community. Conc lusion The American Academy of Physician Assistants recognizes its responsibility to aid the PA profession as it strives to provide high quality, accessible health care. Physician assistants wrote these guidelines for themselves and other physician assista nts. The ultimate goal is to honor patients and earn their trust while providing the best and most appropriate care possible. At the same time, PAs must understand their personal values and beliefs and recognize the ways in which those values and beliefs c an impact the care they provide. 140 UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA SCHOOL OF PA STUDIES CLINICAL ROTATION ABSENCE REQUEST FORM Complete Parts 1 & 2 and fax to School of PA Studies at 352 -265-7996 IN ADVANCE of the requested absence.
