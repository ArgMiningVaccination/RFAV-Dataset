We utilize various techniques. Many of the techniques we utilized have no popping noise at all. If there is a popping sound, it is caused by the joints releasing tiny pockets of gases. A chiropractic adjustment does not affect the bones of the joint, but rather the connective tissue that holds the joint together. Is Chiropractic Care Safe? Chiropractic is non-invasive. Because we don't prescibe drugs or perform surgeries, it is one of the safest forms of health care available. Dr. Terah and Dr. McClain both interned at a pediatric chiropractic office and have learned how to perform safe, gentle adjustments for all ages. Does Chiropractic Care Hurt? Chiropractic adjustment is a highly controlled procedure that rarely causes discomfort because minimal force and gentle pressure are used. Will I be Sore following a Chiropractic Adjustment? Most people do not report any soreness. If a patient does report soreness it is often described as similar to that associated with starting a new exercise program. Drinking plenty of water and following the Doctor's ice pack instructions after your visit can help ease any discomfort to promote healing. Should my children see a chiropractor? Parents are well aware of pediatricians and their role in healthcare. However, when it comes to pediatric chiropractors, a majority of the population is puzzled by how they can help children thrive without use of medications or procedures. Often times parents bring their children to us when they have exhausted all other options. But how different would the public's health be if chiropractic was started far before the problem ever originated! According to [\"Well-Adjusted Babies\"](https://usa.welladjusted.co/product/wab/) written by Dr. Jennifer Barham-Floreani (2009), the top 10 reasons parents take their children to see a chiropractor are to: - Maximize brain and nerve development - Enhance overall health and well-being - Strengthen immunity and decrease incidences of colds, earaches and general illnesses - Help with colic - Improve spinal posture - Help with asthma, allergies and other breathing difficulties - Improve concentration - Assist with behavioral disorders - Alleviate bedwetting and digestive problems - Assist with sleep issues "}
