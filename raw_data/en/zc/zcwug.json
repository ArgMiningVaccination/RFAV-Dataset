Additionally several agents are indicated for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, clinically significant patent ductus arterioles, or fever reduction. Each year, approximately 60 million NSAID prescriptions are written, with the number of prescriptions for older patients approximately 3.6- fold higher than that for younger patients. NSAIDs have been prescribed for decades and a number are available generically and/or over -the-counter. 38 Salicylates, over -the-counter formulations of ibuprofen and naproxen, any topical and ophthalmic preparations of NSAIDs or combination products will not be included in this review. A list of medications reviewed is summarized in Table 1 and includes various salt formulations for the NSAIDs. The primary mechanism of action of all NSAIDs is through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), resulting in impaired transformation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes. 39 The COX enzyme can be subdivided into related isoforms, including COX -1 and COX -2; however, important differences in the regulation and expression of these two enzymes in various tissues exist which are relevant to the mechanism of action of NSAIDs and their associated adverse effect profile. Specifically, the COX -2 enzyme is typically undetectable in most tissue except during states of inflammation; therefore, the anti -inflammatory properties of NSAIDs are associated with the inhibition of COX -2.39 In contrast, COX -1 is expressed variably in most tissues and regulates normal cell processes including gastric cytoprotection, vascular homeostasis, platelet aggregation and kidney function. The inhibition of COX -1 by NSAIDs is thought to be associated with the well -established gastrointestinal adverse reaction profile of these agents, which includes dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease and b leeding. 40 All NSAID -containing agents are associated with a Black Box Warning regarding the increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions including bleeding, ulceration and perforation of the stomach and intestines, which can be fatal. 1-37 Additionally, ketorolac tromethamine, a potent NSAID, is also contraindicated in renal impairment, patients at risk of bleeding (i.e., before surgery), and during labor, delivery, breast -feeding and coadministration with other NSAIDs.15-17 Due to these r isks, ketorolac should only be administered for acute pain (5 days).15-17 NSAIDs have traditionally been grouped by their chemical characteristics. Currently available products have been derived from acetic acid, anthranilic acid, enolic acid, or propionic acid. However, with the development of products selective to COX -2, classification has begun to shift towards selectivity, rather than chemical structure. 41 There is only one selective COX -2 inhibitor currently available, celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae). In addition, recent evidence suggests that some of the older NSAIDs such as diclofenac and meloxicam show some selectivity towards the COX -2 enzyme.41 Due to the variability in NSAID half -life (t1/2), a classification system has also been developed to group NSAIDs by half -life. Some NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac are eliminated rapidly (t 1/2 of one to four hours), while other agents have a much greater half -life. Agents with t 1/2 greater than 10 naproxen, meloxicam, nabumetone, oxaprozin and estimated t 1/2 of 50 hours.41-43 Agents with longer half -lives are generally given once per day.

However the majority of literature supporting the use of these agents was either published decades ago or are lacking in statistical significance and detail. As such, older evidence will be summarized utilizing systematic reviews and meta- analyses. Selected trials are summarized in Table 4. Generally speaking there is limited evidence to suggest that one NSAID is safer or more effective than another for any given indication. The efficacy of diclofenac potassium liquid- filled soft gelatin capsules ( Zipsor \u00ae) was demonstrated in two double- blind, placebo- controlled trials, in patients with postoperative pain following bunionectomy with osteotomy. The study reported that by the end of the 48- hour inpatient period, pain intensity scores were approximately 1.3 in the diclofenac group, and 3.1 in th e placebo group ( P<0.001) .2,44 The results in the second study were noted to be similar to the first in the FDA -approved package insert ; however, the study has not been pubplished and there is no additioanl information available .2 The efficacy of ketorolac tromethamine nasal spray on acute pain was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled clinical trials.17,45,46 Both trials eavluated ketorolatc tromethamine every eight hours compared to placebo in postoperative acute pain in patienst who were undergoing elective abodominal and/or orthopedic surgery. The efficacy of ketorolac tromethamine nasal spray was demonstrated by a statistically significant greater reduction in the single- dose summed pain intensity difference score at six hours compared to placebo (83.3 \u00b1 10.6 comapred to 37.2 \u00b1 12.9, P=0.007) in the first trial. 45 In the second trial, the least square mean six hour summed pain intensity difference scores were also significantly higher in the ketorolac tromethamine group compared to placebo (117.4 versus 89.9, P=0.032; difference, 27.6; 95% CI, 2.5 to 52.7). 46 The incidence of adverse events was similar between the ketorolac tromethamine and placebo groups in both the trials.45,46 The effect of diclofenac sodium injection (Dyloject\u00ae) in the short -term treatment of acute pain was evaluated in two double- blind, placebo and active- controlled, multiple -dose clinical trials in patients with postoperative pain. In both trials, intravenous morphine was permitted as rescue medication for pain management.5,47,48 Efficacy was demonstrated by a reduction in pain intensity as measured by the sum of the pain intensity differences over 0 to 48 hours in patients receiving diclofenac sodium as compared to placebo (P=0.032 and P<0.0001 for 18.75 and 37.5 mg, respectivly).There was no differnece between either dose of diclofenac sodium injection and active- control ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg. 47 Similar resutls were seen in the second study, with a reduction in pain intensity as measured by the sum of the pain intensity differences over 0 to 48 hours in patients receiving diclofenac sodium injection as compared to placebo (P<0.0001). The second study did note improved sum of pain intesnity difference scorese, faster onset of analgesia and significantly lower opioid requirement than the active- control ketorolac tromethamine (P<0.008). saftey and efficacy of ibuprofen intravenous injection (Neoprofen\u00ae) for the closure of clinically significant pattent ductus arterious (PDA) was established in a double- blind, multicenter clinical study premature infants of birth weight between 500 and 1000 grams, less than 30 weeks post -conceptional age. The ibuprofen group had a significantly lower proportion of infants who died, dropped out , or required rescue (21/68; 30.9%) as compared with the placebo group (36/68; 52.9%; P=0.005). Excluding those who died before study day 14, a significantly lower proportion of infants needed rescue in the ibuprofen group compared with the placebo group ( 25.0% compared with 48.5%, P=0.003). 31,49 The efficacy of ibuprofen injection (Caldolor \u00ae) for the treatment of acute pain was evaluated in two multi - center, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies.30,50,51 The first study evaluated women who underwent elective hysterectomy while the second study evaluated patients who underwent elective abdominal or orthopedic surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint of both studies was the difference in median morphine use during the first 24 hours following surgery. The first study showed a 19% reduction in morphine requirement in the ibuprofen 800 mg injection group compared to placebo (P<0.001) and a Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 6 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 22% reduction in the second study (P=0.03). The second study also noted no significant difference in ibuprofen 400 mg injection and placebo (no P value reported).30,50,51 The efficacy of diclofenac submicron capsules ( Zorvolex\u00ae) in the treatment of acute pain and osteoarthritis pain was demonstrated in two multi -center, randomized, double- blind trials.1,52,53 The acute pain trail was both placebo and active controlled. Diclofenac submicron capsules 18 mg and 35 mg taken three times daily was compared to celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and placebo in patients with pain following bunionectomy. There was a statically significant difference in sum of pain intesnity difference in the first 48 hours post surgery when diclofenac submicron 35 mg capsules , diclofenac submicron 18 mg capsules , and celecoxib 200 was compared to placebo (P< 0.001, P=0.010, and P=0.011, respectively) . 52 In the osteoarthritis trial, diclofenac submicron capsules 35 mg twice daily and three times daily were compared to placebo. The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale score at week 12. Submicron diclofenac 35mg TID significantly improved WOMAC pain subscale scores from baseline at week 12 compared placebo ( -44.1 versus -32.5; P=0.0024). Submicron diclofenac 35mg BID pr ovided numerical improvement in pain at week 12 that did not reach statistical significance compared with placebo ( -39.0 compared with -32.5; P=0.0795). 53 The FDA approval of indomethacin submicron capsules (Tivorbex \u00ae) was based upon the results of a phas e III, double- blind, multi -center, placebo- controlled trial. The trial was conducted in 462 subjects aged 18 to 68 years following bunionectomy surgery. Patients were randomized to indomethacin 40 mg three times daily, indomethacin 40 mg twice daily, indomethacin 20 mg three times daily, celecoxib 400 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg twice daily or placebo in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion. The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall summed pain intensity difference (SPID) measured on a Visual Analog Scale over 48 hours. All indomethacin groups showed a statistically significant reduction in SPID over 48 hours compared to placebo (P0.046). Celecoxib did not show a statistically significant reduction in SPID over 48 hours compared to placebo (P=0.103). 9,54,55 The efficacy of meloxicam submicron capsules (Vivlodex\u00ae) in the management of osteoarthritis pain was demonstrated in a randomized, double- blind, multicenter, parallel -arm, placebo- controlled study comparing meloxicam submicron 5 mg or 10 mg taken once daily a nd placebo in patients with pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to Week 12 in the WOMAC Pain Subscale Score. There was a statistically significant reduction in mean WOMAC scores for both meloxicam submicron groups compared with placebo (P=0.0005 and P=0.0059 for 5 mg and 10 mg respectively). 23,56 A recent meta- analys is was conducted evaluating the relative efficacy of available treatments of knee OA. The analysis included clinical trials of adults and compared two or more of the acid, oral placebo, and IA placebo. The analysis concluded that all active treatments, with the exception of acetaminophen, showed clinically significant improvements in pain. However, intra -articular treatments were superior to NSAIDs.57 Two other systematic reviews evaluated differeces in NSAIDs compared to one another and conclude that there is insufficient data to suggest that any of the available NSAIDs are more effective than any other for OA of the knee or hip.58,59 A systematic review was conducted that evaluated the use of NSAIDs for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Available evidence from clinical trials suggests that both nonselective and COX -2 selective NSAIDs have similar efficacy and that various NSAIDs are equally effective. Additionally, there is limited data to suggest that continuous NSAID use may reduce radiographic progression, but requires confirmation. 60 Another recent systematic review of 73 randomized trials evaluated the use of NSAIDs to treat primary dysmenorrhea. The study concluded that NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo ( odds ration [ OR], 4.50; 95% CI 1.90; 95% CI , Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 7 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 is unclear if a particular NSAID is more effective or safe than the others.61 Several studies have shown no difference in safety or efficacy, while others suggest that the anthranilic acid derivatives (e.g. , mefenamic acid), may be slightly more effective than propionic acid derivatives (e.g. , ibuprofen, naproxen).62-66 There have been no randomized trials have compared the efficacy of NSAIDs versus hormonal contraception for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. The use of NSAIDs in the acute treatment of gouty arthritis was evaluated in a number of clinical trials and systematic reviews. Available data suggest NSAIDs are at least as effective and safe as other agents used for the treatment of gout with little or no differences between NSAIDs. 67-73 A randomized, double- blind, active- control study eval uated the safety and effectiveness of the selective COX -2 inhibitor celecoxib. The study concluded that high- dose celecoxib is significantly more effective than low -dose celecoxib and is comparable in efficacy to the nonselective NSAID indomethacin.74 There are currently no randomized trials that compare NSAIDs with colchicine. A 2008 systematic review of 65 randomized trials of NSAID use for low back pain included a meta- analysis of 11 trials for acute low back pain. Global symptomatic improvement after one week of NSAID therapy in patients with low back pain was modestly greater compared to those treated with placebo (relative risk, RR; 1.19; 95% CI , 1.07 to 1.35). The review also concluded that NSAIDs had similar efficacy compared with acetaminophen and mores side effects compared with either placebo or acetaminophen. 75 Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 8 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Table 4. Clinical Trials Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results Acute Pain Riff et al44 Diclofenac potassium liquid -filled soft gelatin capsule (DPSGC; Zipsor\u00ae) 25 mg Q6H vs placebo All other pain medication was discontinued at least four hours before the first dose of study drug. Patients could request rescue medication after the first study drug was taken. DB, MC, P C, PG, RCT Patients 18 years of age scheduled to undergo primary unilateral first - metatarsal bunionectomy with distal osteotomy and internal fixation and had an NPRS score 4 on the day after surgery N=201 4 days Primary: Mean NPRS score over 48- hour in- patient period (first two days) Secondary: NPRS score at predefined times, SPID48, time-weighted sum of pain relief scores over the first eight hours, mean dosing interval, the proportion of patients requiring rescue medication, and the onset of perceptible and meaningful pain relief Primary: There was a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity (mean NPRS score) over the inpatient 48- hour period in the DPSGC 25 mg compared with those receiving placebo (2.5 compared with 5.6; P<0.001). NPRS scores were significantly lower in the DPSGC 25 mg arm compared with the placebo arm at the time of administration of the second dose (P<0.001) and throughout the inpatient 48- hour multiple- dose period (P<0.001). Secondary: Patients receiving DPSGC 25 mg had significantly lower NPRS scores (i.e., less pain) compared with those receiving placebo as early as one hour after dosing (4.8 compared with 6.0; P<0.05) and continuing from two hours (4.9 compared with 6.6; P<0.01) through the remainder of the initial 8 -hour single- dose period (P0.01). The number of patients requiring rescue medication on each day of the inpatient 48- hour period was significantly lower in the DPSGC 25 mg group compared with the placebo group (P<0.001). The overall mean dosing interval during the inpatient 48- hour multiple- dose period was significantly longer in the DPSGC 25 mg group compared with the placebo group (331.5 compared with 263.9 minutes; P < 0.001). Mean dosing intervals on days one through three were significantly longer for those treated with DPSGC compared with those receiving placebo (P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the median time to the onset of perceptible pain relief when DPSGC was compared to placebo (26.0 and 22.2 minutes). Meaningful pain relief, defined as 30% reduction in pain intensity, occurred significantly faster in the DPSGC group compared with the Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 9 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results placebo group (70.2 c ompared with 106.3 minutes; P=0.008) and in a greater proportion of patients (56.9% compared with 35.4%; P=0.003). Patients receiving placebo took the second dose of study medication significantly earlier than did those receiving DPSGC 25 mg (80.0 compared with 156.5 minutes; P<0.001). The proportions of patients in the DPSGC 25 mg and placebo groups who reported 30% reduction in pain during the initial single- dose period were 60.8% and 40.4%, respectively (P=0.004). Patients receiving DPSGC 25 mg reached this level of pain relief significantly faster than those receiving placebo (60.0 compared with 150.0 minutes; P=0.038) and maintained it significantly longer (median duration of 30% pain reduction, 222.5 compared with 102.5 minutes; al45 Ketorolac intranasal spray 30 mg Q8H vs placebo All patients had access to morphine sulfate PCA. DB, MC, PC, RCT Patients 18 years of age undergoing major surgery and expected to remain in the hospital for at least 48 hours and up to 5 days N=300 5 days Primary: SPID6 score during the single- dose phase Secondary: Onset, peak effect, quality of analgesia, and duration of analgesia in the first six hours after single- dose phase, global evaluation of pain control, mean total morphine use, and quality of analgesia ratings Primary: The mean \u00b1 standard error visual analog scale pain intensity rating at baseline was 54.0 \u00b1 0.9 for the ketorolac group and 53.6 \u00b1 1.1 for the placebo group. The mean \u00b1 SE SPID6 score for the ketorolac group was significantly higher compared with the placebo group (83.3 \u00b1 10.6 vs 37.2 \u00b1 12.9, P=0.007). Secondary: At all time points between 0.5 and 5 hours, significantly more ketorolac - treated subjects reported better quality of analgesia ( P<0.05). At 6 hours, the difference approached significance and continued to favor the ketorolac group ( P=0.068). The duration of analgesia was significantly longer in the ketorolac group as represented by the time to restarting PCA or requesting rescue medication (median time 3.0 hours in the ketorolac group compared with 1.3 hours in the placebo group, P<0.04). A significantly ( P<0.05) greater proportion of patients in the ketorolac group reported meaningful pain relief compared with placebo within 1 hour (84% vs 70%) and at 1.5 hours (84% vs 72%). The difference at Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 10 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results two hours approached statistical significance, ind icating a trend that was still in favor of the ketorolac group (84% vs 73%, P=0.058). Morphine use was significantly lower in the ketorolac group compared with placebo group for all time intervals (P<0.001). The quality of analgesia rating for patients in the multi -dose regimen was significantly higher at eight hours in the ketorolac group compared with the placebo group (2.9 \u00b1 0.06 vs 2.6 \u00b1 0.1, P=0.011). The majority of patients in both groups reported the quality of analgesia as being very good or excellent through 48 hours after the first dose of study drug. Singla et al46 (abstract only) Ketorolac intranasal spray 30 mg Q 8H vs placebo All patients had access to morphine sulfate PCA. DB, MC, PC, RCT Patients 18 years of age who are undergoing abdominal surgery. N= 321 5 days Primary: Mean six -hour summed pain intensity difference scores, pain intensity difference, morphine use over 48 hours, day one global pain control scores, quality of analgesia, adverse events Secondary: Not reported Primary: Least square mean six -hour summed pain intensity difference scores were significantly greater in the ketorolac group compared to placebo (117.4 compared with 89.9, P=0.032; difference 27.6, 95% CI, 2.5 to 52.7). Pain intensity difference indicated significantly better pain relief in the ketorolac group at 20 min after the first dose (P=0.01). Morphine use over 48 hours decreased 26% in the ketorolac group compared to placebo (P=0.004). Day one global pain control scores were significantly higher in the ketorolac group compared to placebo (P=0.009). Quality of analgesia was rated significantly higher (P=0.009) in the ketorolac group by 20 min after first dose. Adverse event and serious adverse event incidences were similar in both groups. Rhinalgia and nasal irritation, generally mild and transient in nature, occurred more frequently in the ketorolac group. Gan et al47 AC, DB, the Primary: Mean SPID over the first 48 hours was significantly greater fo r both Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 11 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results diclofenac sodium (Dyloject\u00ae) 18.75 mg IV bolus Q6H tromethamine 30 mg IV bolus Q6H vs placebo Rescue medication (IV morphine) was available up to once every three hours .

Secondary: SPID over other periods , total pain relief, proportion of patients with clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity, PID at each assessment, time from study drug administration to use of rescue mediation, frequency and amount of rescue medication used, patient -reported global evaluation of the study drug doses of diclofenac sodium injection comparted to placebo (18.75 mg, P=0.032; 37.5 mg, P=0.0001). The same effect was seen between ketorolac and placebo (P<0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy among the three active treatment groups. Secondary: SPID over first 24 -hours was significantly greater than placebo for both diclofenac doses (18.75 mg, P=0.015; 37.5 mg, P<0.0001) and ketorolac (P<0.0001). For the 0- to 72- hour period, 18.75 mg diclofenac did not lead to a significantly greater SPID than placebo (P=0.08), but 37.5 mg diclofenac (P=0.0010) and ketorolac (P=0.0018) did significantly improve SPID. Mean PID was consistently greater with the active treatments than with placebo over the first 45 hours, with the exception of the 6- hour and 30- hour assessments. During the first 6- hour dosing period, the proportion of patients that had a 30% reduction in pain intensity was 55.3% ( N=42) of patients receiving placebo, 76.8% (N=63) of patients receiving ketorolac, 64.3% (N=54) mg diclofenac , 69.8% ( N=60) of patients receiving 37.5 mg diclofenac (no P values reported) . The mean time to 30% pain intensity reduction among subjects reporting this decline within 6 hours after first study drug dose was rapid across all treatment groups (27 to 33 minutes for the modified ITT population). Median times to 30% pain intensity reduction did not differ among any of the active treatment groups and placebo (all P>0.05). Total pain relief was significantly greater with active treatment than with placebo over the 0- to 24- and 0- to 48- hour time intervals ( P=0.0002 and P=0.0008, respectively). Use of both 18.75 mg and 37.5 mg diclofenac resulted in significantly greater mean total pain relief than placebo (18.75 mg: 0- to 24 -hour interval [P=0.037], 0- [P=0.038]; 37.5 mg: 0- to 24- and 0- to 48- hour intervals [P=0.0018]), as did use of 30 mg ketorolac (P<0.0001 for the 0 - to 24 -Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 12 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results hour interval and P=0.0001 for the 0 - to 48 -hour interval). There were no significant differences among active treatments. Median time to rescue morphine administration in the ITT population was 2:07 (hours:minutes) (95% CI, 1:15 to 2:40) for placebo but was significantly longer with 18.75 mg diclofenac (3:14; 95% CI, P=0.0007 compared with placebo). Time to rescue morphine administration did not meet statistical significance versus placebo with 37.5 mg diclofenac. (2:24; 95% CI, 1:50 to 4:23; P=0.0574). Active treatment decreased the frequency of rescue morphine administration, and for all time intervals studied, patients receiving active treatments required significantly less morphine compared with the placebo group (all P<0.0001). All active treatments led to a significant reduction in morphine dosage over the 0- to 48- and 0- to 72-hour intervals, as well (all P<0.0001). Patient global evaluations was significantly different in favor of each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo (P<0.001) at both 24 and 48 hours, with no significant differences among active treatment groups.

DB, MC, PC, RCT Female patients 18 to 70 years of age scheduled for elective abdominal hysterectomy (benign or malignant) and were expected to require postoperative hospitalization or IV morphine analgesia lasting at least 24 hours. N=319 5 days Primary: Morphine requirement during the f irst 24 hours following surgery Secondary: Reduction in pain intensity, time to first subsequent narcotic analgesia for breakthrough pain, incidence of opioid- related side effects, resumption of ambulation, resumption of liquid intake and solid di et, and length of hospital stay Primary: Patients who received IV- ibuprofen required significantly less morphine in the first 24 hours following surgery, compared with patients who received placebo (median mg of morphine used: IV -ibuprofen, 43.5 mg; placebo, 54.0 mg morphine), representing a 19% reduction in median morphine use for those receiving IV -ibuprofen (P<0.001). Secondary: Compared with patients receiving placebo, those receiving IV -ibuprofen reported statistically significantly lower pain assessment scores, both at rest and with movement, for all three time segments (during the first 24 hours, 6 to 24 hours, and 12 to 24 hours), as determined by t he AUC for patient self -reported scores (P0.001). In addition to the morphine sparing- effect, patients receiving 800 mg IV - ibuprofen experienced a significant reduction in pain as measured by the VAS at rest AUC for the first 24 hours (21%, P=0.011), from 6 through 24 hours (27%, P<0.001), and from 12 through 24 hours (37%, P<0.001) and pain with movement for the first 24 hours (14%, P=0.010), from 6 through 24 hours (20%, P=0.001), and from 12 through 24 hours (24%, P<0.001) after surgery. The time to ambulation was significantly shorter in the IV -ibuprofen group than in the placebo group (23.4 hours vs. 25.3 hours, P=0.009). The incidence of treatment failure was numerically lower in the group of patients receiving IV- ibuprofen compared to those in the placebo group (4% vs. 7%); this difference, however, was not statistically significant Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 14 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results (P=0.250).

There was no significant difference in morphine use between the ibuprofen 400 mg group and placebo group. Secondary: In the ITT population, the use of ibuprofen 800 mg IV was associated with significant reductions in pain at rest across all three time periods (P=0.001, P<0.001, and P<0.001 for 1 to 24, 6 to 24, and 12 to 24 hours, respectively) compared with placebo. Ibuprofen 400 mg IV was associated with significant reductions in pain at rest during the periods of 6 to 24 hours (P=0.013) and 12 to 24 hours (P=0.005) compared with placebo. The use of ibuprofen 800 mg IV was associated with significant reductions in pain with movement across all three time periods compared with placebo (P=0.002, P<0.001, and P<0.001 for 1 to 24, 6 to 24, and 12 to 24 hours, respectively). The use of ibuprofen 400 mg IV was also associated with significant reductions in pain with movement across all three time periods compared with placebo (P=0.021, P=0.004, and P=0.003, respectively). The rates of treatment failure were not statistically significant between study groups. No significant differences between study groups were noted with respect to time to gastrointestinal motility, mean number of nocturnal awakenings due to pain, time to resumption of ambulation, resumption of liquid intake and solid diet, or hospital length of stay.

Secondary: Diclofenac submicron particle capsules 35 mg (4.52) provided some pain control (higher mean PID) at 30 minutes following administration, in contrast to celecoxib 200 mg BID (0.80), diclofenac submicron particle capsules 18 mg (0.31), and placebo (0.12). Better pain control (PID) was noted across all active treatment groups at five hours compared with placebo (P0.03), and pain relief was sustained throughout the treatment period. The most frequent non- procedure- related adverse events were naus ea, headache, dizziness, and vomiting.

Indomethacin submicron capsules 40 mg TID, 40 mg BID, and 20 mg TID reduc ed pain intensity from 0 to 48 hours compared to placebo (P0.046 for all 3 groups). There was some evidence of patient analgesia for celecoxib (279.4 \u00b1 91.9; P=0.103). Secondary: Some evidence of pain control was observed in patients as early as two hours following administration of indomethacin submicron particle capsules and was sustained throughout the treatment period. Indomethacin submicron particle capsules were generally well tolerated Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 16 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results indomethacin submicron capsules (Tivorbex\u00ae) 20 mg TID vs celecoxib 200 mg BID vs placebo by patients. Patent Ductus Arteriosus Aranda et al49 Ibuprofen IV (Neoprofen\u00ae) vs MC, PC, PG, RCT Premature newborns 30 weeks' gestation, birth weight 500 to 1000 grams, <72 hours postnatal age, nonsymptomatic PDA with evidence documented by echocardiogram N=136 5 days Primary: Proportion of patients with the presence of a symptomatic PDA requiring rescue with indomethacin or surgery , patients that died or dropped out before study day 14. Secondary: Safety Primary: Based upon the intent -to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint, the ibuprofen group had a significantly lower proportion of infants who died, dropped out, or required rescue (21/68; 30.9%) as compared with the placebo group (36/68; 52.9%; P=0.005) for sym ptomati c PDA on or before study day 14. This significant difference was even more pronounced when adjusted for covariates ( P=0.0014), including birth weight, gestational age, gender, maximum weight loss, use of oscillatory ventilation, and site. Excluding those who died before study day 14, a significantly lower proportion of infants needed rescue in the ibuprofen group compared with the placebo group (25.0% compared with 48.5%, P=0.003). With respect to rescue after study day 14, 5 (7.4%) ibuprofen infants and 4 (5.9%) placebo patients were rescued. The mean ages were 19 and 18 days in the ibuprofen and placebo groups, respectively. Of these patients, three ibuprofen patients and one placebo patient subsequently underwent surgery, and one patient in each group died due to NEC. Placebo treatment was the only factor statistically associated with an increased rescue outcome (P=0.001) with neither gestational age nor birth weight was related to the rates of rescue Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 17 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Study and Drug Regimen Study Design and Demographics Sample Size and Study Duration End Points Results (P=0.187, P=0.817). Secondary: With respect to complications and adverse events, there were no differences in the proportion of babies who developed IVH, NEC, BPD, PPHN, or ROP between groups. None of the ibuprofen- treated infants had PVL, whereas four newborns in the placebo group had PVL diagnosed by head ultrasound at 36 weeks or prior to discharge (P=0.059).

The two agents that do not have this black box warning are ibuprofen lysine solution (Neoprofen\u00ae) and indomethacin powder for solution. In addition to the standard warnings for NSAIDs, ketorolac tromethamine products have many additional black box warnings.1-37 Black Box Warning for NSAIDs1-14,18-37 WARNING WARNING: RISK OF SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR AND GASTROINTESTINAL EVENTS Cardiovascular Risk \u00b7 NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. \u00b7 NSADS are contraindicated for the treatment of perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Gastrointestinal Risk \u00b7 NSAIDs cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events. Black Box Warning for ketorolac tromethamine (tablet, injection solution, nasal spray [Sprix\u00ae])15-17 tablets, a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID), are indicated for the short -term (up to 5 days in adults), management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level and only as continuation treatment following IV or IM dosing of k etorolac tromethamine, if necessary. The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine should not exceed 5 days. * Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients and it is NOT indicated for minor or chronic painful conditions.* Gastrointestinal Risk * \u00b7 Ketorolac tromethamine can cause peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and/or perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal. These events can occur at any time during use and without warning symptoms. Therefore, ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with active peptic ulcer disease, in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleedi ng. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events Cardiovascular Risk* \u00b7 Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. This risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use. \u00b7 Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Renal Risk * \u00b7 Ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with advanced renal impairment and in patients at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion. Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 31 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 WARNING Risk of Bleeding * \u00b7 Ketorolac tromethamine inhibits platelet function and is, therefore, CONTRAINDICATED in patients with suspec ted or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, patients with hemorrhagic diathesis, incomplete hemostasis and those at high risk of bleeding. Ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED as prophylactic analgesic before any major surgery. Hypersensitivity \u00b7 Hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from bronchospasm to anaphylactic shock, have occurred and appropriate counteractive measures must be available when administering the first dose of ketorolac tromethamine injection. Ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to ketorolac tromethamine or allergic manifestations to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Intrathecal CONTRAINDICATED for intrathecal or epidural administration due to its alcohol content. Risk During Labor and Delivery \u00b7 The use of ketorolac tromethamine in labor and delivery is contraindicated because it may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit uterine contractions. Concomitant Use With NSAIDs \u00b7 Ketorolac tromethamine is CONTRAINDICATED in patients currently receiving aspirin or NSAIDs because of the cumulative risk of inducing serious NSAID -related side effects. Special Populations \u00b7 Dosage should be adjusted for patients 65 years or older, for patients under 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight and for patients with moderately elevated serum creatinine. Dosage and Administration \u00b7 Ketorolac tromethamine tablets are indicated only as continuation therapy to ketorolac tromethamine injection, and the combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine injection and ketorolac tromethamine tablets is not to exceed 5 (five) days, because of the increased risk of serious adverse events. \u00b7 The recommended total daily dose of ketorolac tromethamine tablets (maximum 40 mg) is significantly lower than for ketorolac trometham ine injection (maximum 120 mg) . *Black box warning for all products. Black box warning only injection solution formulation only . Black box warning for tablet and injection solution formulation only. Warnings/Precautions All NSAIDs share similar warnings and precautions.1-37 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX -2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for cardiovascular thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The increase in cardiovascular thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 32 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs cause serious gastrointestinal adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for three to six months, and in about 2% -4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short -term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Hepatotoxicity Elevations of liver enzymes (three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID -treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Hypertension NSAIDs, can lead to new onset or worsening of pre- existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs . Monitor blood pressure during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Heart Failure and Edema Several studies have implicated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of NSAIDs may blunt the cardiovascular effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]). Monitor blood pressure during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. Avoid the use of NSAIDs in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If NSAIDs are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Long- term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Limited or no information is available regarding the use of NSAIDs in patients with advanced renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating NSAIDs. Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic -hypoaldosteronism state. Anaphylactic Reactions NSAIDs have been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity. Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin- sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross -reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 33 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 in such aspirin- sensitive patients, NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity asthma. Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Fetal Toxicity Starting at 30 weeks gestation, NSAIDs should be avoided by pregnant women as premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus may occur. If this drug is used during this time period in pregnancy, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Corticosteroid- Responsive Illness NSAIDs cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid- responsive illness. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. Hematologic Toxicity (Anemia) Anemia may occur in patients receiving NSAIDs. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. In patients on long- term therapy with NSAIDs, check hemoglobin or hematocrit if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss. Hematologic Toxicity (Prolonged Bleeding) NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Carefully monitor patients treated with NSAIDs who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants. Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of NSAIDs in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long- term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically Central Nervous System Effects NSAIDs may aggravate depression or other psychiatric disturbances, epilepsy, and parkinsonism, and should be used with considerable caution in patients with these conditions. Discontinue the NSAID(s) if severe central nervous system adverse reactions develop. Ocular Effects Corneal deposits and retinal disturbances, including those of the macula, have been observed in some patients who had received prolonged therapy with NSAIDs . Be alert to the possible association between the changes noted and the NSAID . Blurred vision may be a significant symptom and warrants a thorough ophthalmological examination. Since these changes may be asymptomatic, ophthalmologic examination at periodic intervals is desirable in patients receiving prolonged therapy. TIVORBEX is not indicated for long-term treatment. Eye Exposure (NSAIDs) Page 34 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Avoid contact of Sprix\u00ae with the eyes. If eye contact occurs, wash out the eye with water or saline, and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour. Drug Interactions Table 8. Drug Interactions1-37,42,43 Generic Name Interacting Medication or Disease Potential Result NSAIDs (all) ACE inhibitors, ARBs NSAIDs may decrease the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs and could precipitate renal failure.

Do not administer NSAIDs within 10 days of high- dose methotrexate. If concomitant administration is necessary, monitor closely for toxicity, especially myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity. Lower doses have been tolerated with NSAID therapy, however caution is Concurrent u se of indomethacin and lithium may result in an increased risk of lithium toxicity (weakness, tremor, excessive thirst, confusion). Monitor serum lithium levels for any symptoms of lithium toxicity. NSAIDs (ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen, piroxicam) synthesis, allowing unopposed pressor systems to produce hypertension and impair the antihypertensive effect of beta- blockers. Avoid using interacting NSAIDs if possible. Monitor blood pressure and adjust dose as needed. NSAIDs (diclofenac, indomethacin) Digoxin NSAIDs used concurrently with digoxin may result in an increased risk of digoxin toxicity (nausea, vomiting and arrhythmias). Monitor the patient for signs of digoxin toxicity and if digoxin toxicity is suspected a digoxin serum concentration should be determined. NSAIDs (ibuprofen) Phenytoin Ibuprofen used concurrently with phenytoin may result in an increased risk of phenytoin toxicity, especially in renally impaired patients. Monitor phenytoin serum concentrations and for signs and symptoms of phenytoin toxicity. NSAIDs (indomethacin) Potassium Indomethacin used concurrently with potassium supplementation may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium and if necessary discontinue potassium supplementation or decrease indomethacin dose.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: Osteoarthritis: Care and management in adults (2014) 78 \u00b7 This summary will focus on pharmacologic therapy of osteoarthritis Oral Analgesics \u00b7 Healthcare professionals should consider offering acetaminophen for pain relief in addition to core treatments; regular dosing may be required. Acetaminophen and/or topical NSAIDs should be considered ahead of oral NSAIDs, COX -2 inhibitors or opioids. \u00b7 If acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs are insufficient for pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, then the addition of opioid analgesics should be considered. Risks and benefits should be considered, particularly in older people. Topical Tr eatments \u00b7 Consider topical NSAIDs for pain relief in addition to core treatments for people with knee or hand osteoarthritis. Consider topical NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen ahead of oral NSAIDs, COX -2 inhibitors or opioids. \u00b7 Topical capsaicin should be considered as an adjunct to core treatments for knee or hand osteoarthritis. \u00b7 Do not offer rubefacients for treating osteoarthritis. NSAIDs and Highly -Selective COX -2 Inhibitors \u00b7 Although NSAIDs and COX -2 inhibitors may be regarded as a single drug class of 'NSAID s', these recommendations use the two terms for clarity and because of the differences in side -effect profile. Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 49 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 Where acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs are ineffective for pain relief for people with osteoarthritis, then substitution with an oral NSAID/COX -2 inhibitor should be considered. \u00b7 Use oral NSAIDs/COX -2 inhibitors at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period of time. \u00b7 When offering treatment with an oral NSAID/COX -2 inhibitor, the first choice should be either a standard NSAID or a COX -2 inhibitor (other than etoricoxib 60 mg). In either case, co- prescribe with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), choosing the one with the lowest acquisition cost. \u00b7 All oral NSAIDs/COX -2 inhibitors have analgesic effects of a similar magnitude but vary in their potential gastrointestinal, liver and cardio- renal toxicity; therefore, when choosing the agent and dose, take into account individual patient risk factors, including age. When prescribing these drugs, consideration should be given to appropriate assessment and/or ongoing monitoring of these risk factors. \u00b7 If a person with osteoarthritis needs to take low -dose aspirin, healthcare professionals should consider other analgesics before substituting or adding an NSAID or COX -2 inhibitor (with a PPI) if pain relief is ineffective or insufficient. Intra- Articular Injections \u00b7 Intra- articular corticosteroid injections should be considered as an adjunct to core treatments for the relief of moderate to severe pain in people with osteoarthritis. \u00b7 Do not offer intra- articular hyaluronan injections for the management of osteoarthritis. American College of Rheumatology : 2015 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (2015) 79 Recommendations for Early RA Patients \u00b7 We strongly recommend using a treat -to-target strategy rather than a non- targeted approach, regardless of disease activity level. The ideal target should be low disease activity or remission, as determined by the clinician and the patient. In some cases, another target may be chosen because risk tolerance by patients or comorbidities may mitigate the usual choices. \u00b7 For disease- modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) -na\u00efve patients with early, symptomatic RA, we strongly recommend DMARD monotherapy over doub le or triple DMARD therapy in patients with low disease activity and conditionally recommend DMARD monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy in patients with moderate or high disease activity. M ethotrexate should be the preferred initial therapy for most patients with early RA with active disease. \u00b7 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD therapy (with or without glucocorticoids), we strongly recommend treatment with a combination of DMARDs or a TNFi or a non- TNF biologic, w ith or without methotrexate (MTX) in no particular order of preference, rather than continuing DMARD monotherapy alone. Biologic therapy should be used in combination with MTX over biologic monotherapy, when possible, due to superior efficacy. \u00b7 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite any of the above DMARD or biologic therapies, we conditionally recommend adding low -dose glucocorticoids (defined as 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent). Low - dose glucocorticoids may also be used in patients who need a bridge until realizing the benefits of DMARD therapy. The risk/benefit ratio of glucocorticoid therapy is favorable as long as the dose is low and the Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 50 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations duration of therapy is short. \u00b7 For patients experiencing a flare of RA, we conditionally recommend adding short -term glucocorticoids (< 3 months of treatment) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible duration, to provide a favorable benefit -risk ratio for the patient. Recommendations for Established RA Patients \u00b7 We strongly recommend using a treat -to-target strategy rather than a non- targeted approach, regardless of disease activity level. The ideal target should be low disease activity or remission, as determined by the clinician and the patient. In some cases, however, another target may be chosen because tolerance by patients or comorbidities may mitigate the usual choices. \u00b7 For DMARD -na\u00efve patients with low disease activity, we strongly recommend using DMARD monotherapy over a TNFi. For DMARD -na\u00efve patients with moderate or high disease activity, we conditionally recommend DMARD monotherapy over double or triple DMARD therapy and DMARD monotherapy over tofacitinib. In general, MTX should be the preferred initial therapy for most patients with established RA with active disease. \u00b7 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite DMARD monotherapy including methotrexate, we strongly recommend using combination DMARDs or adding a TNFi or a non- TNF biologic or tofacitinib (all choices with or without met hotrexate) in no particular order of preference, rather than continuing DMARD monotherapy alone. Biologic therapy should be used in combination with MTX over biologic monotherapy, when possible, due to its superior efficacy. \u00b7 For all scenarios for established RA below, treatment may be with or without MTX. \u00b7 For moderate or high disease activity despite TNFi therapy in patients currently not on a DMARD, we strongly recommend that one or two DMARDs be added to TNFi therapy rather than continuing TNFi therapy a lone. \u00b7 If disease activity is moderate or high despite single TNFi biologic therapy, we conditionally recommend using a non- TNF biologic. \u00b7 If disease activity is moderate or high despite non- TNF biologic therapy, we conditionally recommend using another non- TNF biologic. However, if a patient has failed multiple non- TNF biologics and they are TNFi -na\u00efve with moderate or high disease activity, we conditionally recommend treatment with a TNFi. \u00b7 For patients with moderate or high disease activity despite prior treatment with at least one TNFi and at least one non- TNF-biologic (sequentially, not combined), we conditionally recommend first treating with another non- TNF biologic. However, when a non- TNF biologic is not an option (e.g., patient declines non- TNF bio logic therapy due to inefficacy or side effects), we conditionally recommend treatment with tofacitinib. \u00b7 If disease activity is moderate or high despite the use of multiple (2+) TNFi therapies (in sequence, not concurrently), we conditionally recommend non- TNF biologic therapy and then conditionally treating with tofacitinib when a non-TNF biologic is not an option. \u00b7 If disease activity is moderate or high despite any of the above DMARD or biologic therapies, we conditionally recommend adding low -dose glucocorticoids. \u00b7 If patients with established RA experience an RA flare while on DMARD, Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 51 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations TNFi, or non -TNF biologic therapy, we conditionally recommend adding short -term glucocorticoids (< 3 months of treatment) at the lowest possible dose and for shortest possible duration to provide the best benefit -risk ratio for the patient. \u00b7 In patients with established RA and low disease activity but not remission, we strongly recommend continuing DMARD therapy, TNFi, non- TNF biologic or tofacitinib rather than discontinuing respective medication. \u00b7 In patients with established RA currently in remission, we conditionally recommend tapering DMARD therapy, TNFi, non- TNF biologic, or tofacitinib . \u00b7 We strongly recommend not discontinuing all therapies in patients with established RA in disease remission. Recommendations for RA patients with High- risk comorbidities \u00b7 Congestive Heart Failure o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF), we conditionally recommend using combination DMARD therapy, a non- TNF biologic, or tofacitinib rather than a TNFi. o If patients in this population are treated with a TNFi and their CHF worsens while on the TNFi, we conditionally recommend s witching to combination DMARD therapy, a non- TNF biologic, or tofacitinib rather than a different TNFi. \u00b7 Hepatitis B o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and evidence of active hepatitis B infection (hepatitis surface antigen positive > 6 months), who are receiving or have received effective antiviral treatment, we strongly recommend treating them the same as patients without this condition. o For a patient with natural immunity from prior exposure to hepatitis B (i.e., HB core antibody and HBS antibody positive and normal liver function tests), we recommend the same therapies as those wi thout such findings as long as the patient's viral load is monitored. o For patients with chronic hepatitis B who are untreated, referral for antiviral therapy is appropriate prior to immunosuppressive therapy. \u00b7 Hepatitis C o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and evidence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, who are receiving or have received effective antiviral treatment, we conditionally recommend treating them the same as the pat ients without this condition. o We recommend that rheumatologists work with gastroenterologists and/or hepatologists who would monitor patients and reassess the appropriateness of antiviral therapy. This is important considering the recent availability of highly effective therapy for HCV, which may lead to a greater number of HCV patients being treated successfully. o If the same patient is not requiring or receiving antiviral treatment for their hepatitis C, we conditionally recommend using DMARD therapy rather than TNFi. \u00b7 Malignancy o Previous Melanoma and Non- Melanoma Skin Cancer o In patients with established RA and moderate or high disease activity Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 52 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations and a history of previously treated or untreated skin cancer (melanoma or non- melanoma), we conditionally recommend the use of DMARD therapy over biologics or tofacitinib. o Previous Lymphoproliferative Disorders o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and a history of a previously treated lymphoproliferative disorder, we strongly recommend using rituximab rather than a TNFi and conditionally recommend using combination DMARD therapy, abatacept or tocilizumab rather than TNFi . o Previous Solid Organ Cancer o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activity and previously treated solid organ cancer, we conditionally recommend that they be treated for RA just as one would treat an RA patient without a history of solid organ cancer . \u00b7 Serious Infections o In patients with established RA with moderate or high disease activ ity and previous serious infection(s), we conditionally recommend using combination DMARD therapy or abatacept rather than TNFi . o Recommendations for the Use of Vaccines in RA patients on DMARD and/or biologic therapy o In early or established RA patients aged 50 and over, we conditionally recommend giving the herpes zoster vaccine before the patient receives biologic therapy or tofacitinib for their RA. o In early or established RA patients who are currently receiving biologics, we conditionally recommend that live attenuated vaccines such as the herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine not be given . o In patients with early or established RA who are currently receiving biologics, we strongly recommend using appropriately indicated killed/inactivated vaccines . National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence: Rheumatoid Arthritis: The Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Adults (2009) 80 \u00b7 In people with newly diagnosed active rheumatoid arthritis, offer a combination of DMARDs (including methotrexate and at least one other DMARD, plus short -term glucocorticoids) as first -line treatment as soon as possible, ideally within three months of the onset of persistent symptoms. \u00b7 In people with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis for whom combination DMARD therapy is not appropriate, start DMARD monotherapy; placing greater emphasis on fast escalation to a clinically effective dose rather than on the choice of DMARD. \u00b7 When introducing new drugs to improve disease control into the treatment regimen of a person with established rheumatoid arthritis, consider decreasing or stopping their pre- existing rheumatological drugs once the disease is controlled. \u00b7 Offer short -term treatment with glucocorticoids for managing flares in people with recent onset or established disease, to rapidly decrease inflammation. \u00b7 In people with established rheumatoid arthritis, only continue long- term treatment with glucocorticoids when the long- term complications of glucocorticoid therapy have been fully discussed, and all other treatment options (including biological drugs) have been offered. \u00b7 On the balance of its clinical benefits and cost -effectiveness, anakinra is not recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, except in the context of a controlled, long- term clinical study; patients s hould continue therapy with anakinra until they and their consultant consider it is appropriate to stop. \u00b7 The anti -TNF agents adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab are Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 53 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations recommended as options for the treatment of adults who have both of the following charact eristics: o Active rheumatoid arthritis as measured by disease activity score (DAS 28) >5.1 confirmed on at least two occasions, one month apart. o Have undergone trials of two DMARDs, including methotrexate (unless contraindicated). A trial of a DMARD is defined as being normally of six months, with two months at standard dose, unless significant toxicity has limited the dose or duration of treatment. \u00b7 Anti-TNF agents should be used in combination with methotrexate. Adalimumab or etanercept may be given as monotherapy in patients with intolerance or contraindication to methotrexate. \u00b7 After initial response, treatment should be monitored no less frequently than six-monthly intervals with assessment of DAS 28. Treatment should be withdrawn if an adequate response is not maintained. \u00b7 An alternative anti -TNF agent may be considered for patients in whom treatment is withdrawn due to an adverse event before the initial six -month assessment of efficacy. \u00b7 Escalation of dose of the anti -TNF agents above their licensed st arting dose is not recommended. \u00b7 Treatment should normally be initiated with the least expensive drug (taking into account administration costs, required dose and product price per dose). This may need to be varied in individual cases due to differences in the mode of administration and treatment schedules. \u00b7 Use of the anti -TNF agents for the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate or other DMARDs is not recommended. \u00b7 Initiation of ant i-TNF agents and follow -up of treatment response and adverse events should be undertaken only by a specialist rheumatological team with experience in the use of these agents. Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society/European League Against Rheumatism: 2010 Update of the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society/European League Against Rheumatism Recommendations for the Management of Ankylosing Spondylitis (2010) 81 \u00b7 Treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) should be tailored according to: o Current manifestations of the disease (axial, peripheral, entheseal, extra- articular symptoms and signs). o Level of current symptoms, clinical findings, and prognostic indicators (disease activity/inflammation, pain, function [disability, hand icap], structural damage [hip involvement, spinal deformities]. o General clinical status (age, sex, comorbidity, concomitant drugs). o Wishes and expectations of the patient. \u00b7 Disease monitoring of patients with AS should include: patient history, clinical parameters, laboratory tests, and imaging, all according to the clinical presentation, as well as the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society core set. The frequency of monitoring should be decided on an individual basis depending on symptoms, severity, and drug treatment. \u00b7 Optimal management of AS requires a combination of non- pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. \u00b7 Non- pharmacological treatment of AS should include patient education and regular exercise. Physical therapy with supervised exercises, individually or in a group preferred. Patient associations and self help groups may be useful. \u00b7 Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclooxygenase (COX) -2 inhibitors, are recommended as first line drug treatment for patients with AS with pain and stiffness. Continuous treatment with an NSAID is preferred for patients with persistently active, symptomatic Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 54 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations disease. Cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal risks should be taken into account. \u00b7 Analgesics, such as opioids and paracetamol, might be considered for pain control in patients in whom NSAIDs are insufficient, contraindicated, and/or poorly tolerated. \u00b7 Corticosteroid injections directed to the local site of musculoskeletal inflammation may be considered. The use of systemic corticosteroids for axial disease is not supported by evidence. \u00b7 There is no evidence for the efficacy of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate and sulfasalazine, for the treatment of axial disease. Sulfasalazine may be considered in patients with peripheral arthritis. \u00b7 Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF - inhibitor) treatment should be given to patients with persistently high disease activity despite conventional treatments according to the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society recommendations. There is no evidence to support the obligatory use of DMARDs before, or concomitant with, TNF - inhibitor treatment in patients with axial disease. There is no evidence to support a different efficacy of the various TNF - inhibitors on the axial and articular/entheseal disease manifestations; but in the presence of inflammatory bowel disease a difference in gastrointestinal efficacy needs to be taken into consideration. Switching to a second TNF - inhibitor mig ht be beneficial, especially in patients that have lost response. There is no evidence to support biologic agents other than TNF - inhibitor in AS. \u00b7 Total hip arthroplasty should be considered in patients with refractory pain or disability and radiographic evidence of structural damage, independent of age. Spinal corrective osteotomy may be considered in patients with severe disabling deformity. A spinal surgeon should be consulted in patients with AS and an acute vertebral fracture. National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Adult Cancer Pain (2014) 82 \u00b7 Pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with cancer. \u00b7 The most widely accepted algorithm for the treatment of cancer pain was developed by the World Health Organization which suggests that patients with pain be started on acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID). If sufficient pain relief is not achieved, patients should be escalated to a \"weak opioid\" and then to a \"strong opioid\", such as morphine. \u00b7 This guideline is unique it that it contains the following components: o In order to maximize patient outcomes, pain is an essential component of oncology management. o There is an increasing amount of evidence that survival is linked to effective pain control. o Analgesic therapy must be administered in conjunction with management of multiple symptoms or symptom clusters and complex pharmacologic therapies that patients with cancer are generally prescribed. o Pain intensity must be quantified by the patient (whenever possible), as the algorithm bases therapeutic decisions on a numerical value assigned to the severity of pain. o A formal comprehensive pain assessment must be performed. o Reassessment of pain intensity must be performed at specified intervals to ensure that the therapy selected is having the desired effect. o Persistent cancer pain often requires treatment with regularly Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 55 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations scheduled analgesics with supplemental doses of analgesics provided as needed to manage breakthrough pain. o A multidisciplinary team may be needed for comprehensive pain management. o Psychosocial support must be available. o Specific educational material must be provided to the patient. \u00b7 The pain management algorithm distinguishes three levels of pain intensity, based on a zero to 10 numerical rating scale: severe pain (seven to 10), moderate pain (four to six) and mild pain (one to three). \u00b7 Pain associated with oncology emergency should be addressed while treating the underlying condition. \u00b7 Patients considered to be opioid tolerant are those who are taking >60 mg oral morphine/day, 25 \u00b5g transdermal fentanyl/hour, 30 mg oral oxycodone/day, 8 mg oral hydromorphone/day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone/day or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for one week or longer. Patients not meeting this definition are considered opioid na\u00efve. \u00b7 Opioid na\u00efve patients (those not chronically receiving opioid therapy on a daily basis) should be provided with non- opioid adjuvant analgesics as indicated, prophylactic bowel regimen, psychosocial support as well as patient and family education. \u00b7 Opioid na\u00efve patients (those not chronically receiving opioid therapy on a daily basis) experiencing severe pain should receive rapid titration of short - acting opioids. \u00b7 Opioid -na\u00efve patients whose pain intensity is moderate at presentation, the pathways are quite similar to those for severe pain, with slower titration of short -acting opioids. \u00b7 Opioid -na\u00efve patients experiencing mild pain intensity should receive nonopioids analgesics, such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen or treatment deration of slower titration of short -acting opioids. \u00b7 Patients with chronic persistent pain controlled by stable doses of short - acting opioids should be provided with round- the-clock extended release or long acting formulation opioids with provision of a 'rescue dose' to manage break -through or transient exacerbations of pain. Opioids with rapid onset and short duration as preferred as rescue doses. The repeated need for rescue doses per day may indicate the necessity to adjust the baseline treatment. \u00b7 Optim al analgesic selection will depend on the patient's pain intensity, any current analgesic therapy, and concomitant medical illness(es). \u00b7 In a patient who has not been exposed to opioids in the past, morphine is generally considered the standard starting drug of choice at an initial oral dose of 5 to 15 mg. \u00b7 Morphine and hydromorphone should be used with caution in patients with fluctuating renal function due to potential accumulation of renally cleared metabolites that may cause neurologic toxicity. \u00b7 Pure agonists (fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone) are the most commonly used medications in the management of cancer pain. \u00b7 Due to the ease of titration, opioid agonists with a short half -life are preferred fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphi ne, and oxycodone. \u00b7 Transdermal fentanyl is not indicated for rapid opioid titration and only should be recommended after pain is controlled by other opioids in opioid tolerant patients. It is usually the drug of choice for patients who are unable to swallo w, patients with poor tolerance to morphine, and patients with poor Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 56 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations compliance. \u00b7 Transmucosal fentanyl may be considered in opioid- tolerant patients for brief episodes of incident pain not attributed to inadequate dosing of around- the- clock opioid. \u00b7 Individual variations in methadone pharmacokinetics make using this agent in cancer pain difficult. Methadone should be started at lower -than- anticipated doses and slowly titrated upwards with provision of adequate short acting breakthrough pain medications during the titration period. Methadone use should be initiated by physicians with experience and expertise in its use. \u00b7 At a maximum dose of 400 mg/day, tramadol is less potent than other opioids and is approximately 1/10 as potent as morphine. \u00b7 Meperidine, mixed agonist -antagonists, and placebos are not recommended for cancer patients. Meperidine is contraindicated for chronic pain especially in patients with impaired renal function or dehydration. \u00b7 The least invasive, easiest and safest route of administration should be provided to ensure adequate analgesia. Oral administration is preferred for chronic opioid therapy. The oral route should be considered first in patients who can take oral medications unless a rapid onset of analgesia is required or the patient experiences adverse events associated with the oral administration. Continuous parenteral infusion, intravenous or subcutaneous, is recommended for patients who cannot swallow or absorb opioids enterally. Opioids, given parenterally, may produce fast and effective plasma concentrations in comparison with oral or transdermal opioids. Intravenous route is considered for faster analgesia because of the short lag- time between injection and effect in comparison with oral dosing. \u00b7 The methods of administering analgesics that are widely accepted within clinical practice include \"around the clock\", \"as needed\", \"Around the clock\" dosing is provided to chronic pain patients for continuous pain relief. A \"rescue dose\" should also be provided as a subsequent treatment for patients receiving \"around the clock\" doses. Rescue doses of short acting opioids should be provided for pain that is not relieved by regularly scheduled, \"around the clock\" doses. Opioids administered on an \"as needed\" basis are for patients who have intermittent pain with pain- free intervals. The \"as needed\" method is also used when rapid dose titration is required. The patient -controlled analgesia technique allows a patient to control a device that delivers a bolus of analgesic \"on demand\". \u00b7 For opioid- na\u00efve patients experiencing pain intensity 4 or a pain intensity <4 but whose goals of pain control and function are not met, an initial dose of 5 to 15 mg of oral morphine sulfate, 2 to 5 mg of intravenous morphine sulfate or equivalent is recommended. \u00b7 Patients should be reassessed every 60 minutes for oral medications and every 15 minutes for intravenous medications. If pain remains unchanged or is increased, opioid dose is increased by 50 to 100%. If inadequate response is seen after two to three cycles of the opioid, changing the route of administration from oral to intravenous or subsequent management strategies can be considered. \u00b7 If the pain decreases to 4 to 6, the same dose of opioid is repeated and reassessed again in 60 minutes for oral medications and 15 minutes for intravenous medications. If the pain decreases to 0 to 3, the current effective dose is administered \"as needed\" over the initial 24 hours before proceeding Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 57 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations to subsequent management strategies. \u00b7 No single opioid is optimal for all patients. When considering opioid rotation, defined as changing to an equivalent dose of an alternative opioid to avoid adverse events, it is important to consider relative effectiveness when switching between oral and parenteral routes to avoid subsequent overdosing or under -dosing. \u00b7 For opioid- tolerant patients (those chronically receiving opioids on a daily basis) experiencing breakthrough pain of intensity 4, a pain intensity <4 but whose goals of pain control and function are not met, in order to achieve adequate analgesia the previous 24 hour total oral or intravenous opioid requirement must be calculated and the new \"rescue dose\" must be increased by 10 to 20%. \u00b7 Subsequent treatment is based upon the patient's continued pain rating score. All approaches for all pain intensity levels must be administering regular doses of opioids with rescue doses as needed, management of constipation coupled with psychosocial support and education for patients and thei r families. \u00b7 Addition of adjuvant analgesics should be re- evaluated to either enhance the analgesic effect of the opioids or in some cases to counter the adverse events associated with opioids. \u00b7 Although pain intensity ratings will be obtained frequently to evaluate opioid dose increases, a formal re- evaluation to evaluate patient's goals of comfort and function is mandated at each contact. \u00b7 If adequate comfort and function has been achieved, and 24- hour opioid requirement is stable, the patients should be converted to an ER oral medication (if feasible) or another ER formulation (i.e., transdermal fentanyl) or long- acting agent (i.e., methadone). The subsequent treatment is based upon the patients' continued pain rating score. Rescue doses of the short acting formation of the same long acting drug may be provided during maintenance therapy for the management of pain in cancer patients not relieved by ER opioids. \u00b7 Procedure- related pain represents an acute short -lived experience which may be accompanied by a great deal of anxiety. \u00b7 Interventions to manage procedure- related pain should take into account the type of procedure, the anticipated level of pain, other individual characteristics of the patient such as age, and physical condition. \u00b7 Opioids alone may not provide the optimal therapy, but when used in conjunction with nonopioid analgesics, such as an NSAID or adjuvant, and psychological and physical approaches, they can help to improve patient outcomes. \u00b7 The term adjuvant refers to medication that are coadministered to manage an adverse event of an opioid or to adjuvant analgesics that are added to enhance analgesia. Adjuvant may also include drugs for neuropathic pain. Clinically adjuvant analgesics consist antidepressants corticosteroids, anesthetics (e.g., topical lidocaine patch. \u00b7 Adjuvant analgesics are commonly used to help manage bone pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain, and to reduce systemic opioid requir ement and are particularly important in treating neuropathic pain that is resistant to opioids. \u00b7 Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are recommended non- opioid analgesics that can be used in the management of adult cancer pain. Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 58 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 Clinical Guideline Recommendations \u00b7 Non- pharmacological specialty consultations for physical modalities and cognitive modalities may be beneficial adjuncts to pharmacologic interventions. Attention should also be focused on psychosocial support and providing education to patients and families. Conclusions NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide to treat common pain and inflammatory conditions.38 NSAIDS are FDA-approved to treat acute pain and inflammation, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondyli tis, painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendonitis), acute gouty arthritis, and postoperative pain. Additionally several agents are indicated for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea, clinically significant patent ductus arterioles, or fever reduction. NSAIDs have traditionally been grouped by their chemical characteristics. Currently available products have been derived from acetic acid, anthranilic acid, enolic acid, or propionic acid. However, with the development of products selective to COX -2, classification has begun to shift towards selectivity, rather than chemical structure. 41 There is only one selective COX -2 inhibitor currently available, celecoxib (Celebrex\u00ae). In addition, recent evidence suggests that some of the older NSAIDs such as diclofenac and meloxicam show some selectivity towards the COX -2 enzyme.41 Due to the variability in NSAID half -life (t1/2), a classification system has also been developed to group NSAIDs by half -life. Some NSAIDs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac are eliminated rapidly (t 1/2 of one to four hours), while other agents have a much greater half -life. Agents with t 1/2 greater than 10 naproxen, meloxicam, nabumetone, oxaprozin and estimated t 1/2 of 50 hours.41-43 Agents with longer half -lives are generally given once per day. Clinical trials have demonstrated NSAIDs to be more efficacious compared to placebo in the treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions. Although there are many head to head trials comparing various NSAIDs, there is no single agent that has been continuously found to be more efficacious or safe than the others. 44-75 Although the efficacy of NSAIDs appears to be similar at equipotent doses, there is a wide variability of response between individual patients, which is believed to be associa ted with non- prostaglandin- mediated NSAID -induced mechanisms of action. Thus, it is suggested that if a patient fails an NSAID of one class, an NSAID from a different class may be effective and is a reasonable option.38 A summary of current clinical guidelines and NSAIDs place in therapy for specific disease states are listed in Table 10.76-82 Therapeutic Class Review: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Page 59 of 62 Copyright 2016 Review Completed on 1/25/2016 References 1.
