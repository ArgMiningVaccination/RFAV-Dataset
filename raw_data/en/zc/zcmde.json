The Energy Crystal [[1]](#cite_note-StHEP3-1) is an object that appears in the [Sonic the Hedgehog](/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(TV_series)) television series. It is a type of energizing mineral that can be found in the [Crystal Mine](/wiki/Crystal_Mine). Description[ ] Energy Crystals are light blue gem-like crystals. These crystals are able to produce energy, and are as well resilient to energy attacks, like laser energy, which they can absorb and convert into a golden aura. However, these crystals are not unbreakable and will break when subjugated to hard enough physical impacts. These crystals are as well tightly connected to the eco-system of [Mobius](/wiki/Mobius_(SatAM)), as the extraction of too much enough active Energy Crystal at once will destroy Mobius's whole eco-system. [[1]](#cite_note-StHEP3-1) History[ ] TV series[ ] Season one[ ] Seeking to replace his dwindling oil supply, [Dr. Robotnik](/wiki/Doctor_Robotnik_(SatAM)) had his forces in the [Crystal Mine](/wiki/Crystal_Mine) get ready to extract a colossal Energy Crystal with a crane that was supposed to pull the Energy Crystal up to the surface, either unaware or not caring that removing an active crystal like that would destroy [Mobius](/wiki/Mobius_(SatAM))'s entire eco-system. However, with assistance from [Sir Charles](/wiki/Sir_Charles_Hedgehog_(SatAM)), the [Knothole Freedom Fighters](/wiki/Knothole_Freedom_Fighters_(SatAM)) hijacked the mine's [Dinobot](/wiki/Dinobot) and used its lasers to cut the ropes that supported the Energy Crystal. As a result, the Energy Crystal fell back into the mine and shattered. What happened to its remains after that is unclear.
