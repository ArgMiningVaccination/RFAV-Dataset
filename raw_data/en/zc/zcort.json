Methods: The Vaccine Impact in Men study surveyed MSM and transgender women aged 18-26 years in 3 US cities during 2016-2018. Self-collected anal swab and oral rinse specimens were assessed for 37 types of HPV. We compared HPV prevalence among vaccinated and unvaccinated participants and determined adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Among 1767 participants, 704 (39.8%) self-reported receiving HPV vaccine. Median age at vaccination (18.7 years) was older than age at first sex (15.7 years). Quadrivalent vaccine-type HPV was detected in anal or oral specimens from 475 (26.9%) participants. Vaccine-type HPV prevalence was lower among vaccinated (22.9%) compared with unvaccinated (31.6%) participants; aPR for those who initiated vaccination at age 18 years was 0.41 (CI, 0.24-0.57) and at age >18 years was 0.82 (CI, 0.67-0.98). Vaccine effectiveness of at least 1 HPV vaccine dose at age 18 years or >18 years was 59% and 18%, respectively. Conclusions: Findings suggest real-world effectiveness of HPV vaccination among young adult MSM. This effect was stronger with younger age at vaccination. |Original language||English| \u00a9 2020 Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2020.
