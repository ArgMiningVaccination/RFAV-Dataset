The study reportedly describes a patient with no age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or vision problems who was referred to the retinal clinic for crystal deposits in the macular region of the retina in both eyes. Upon follow-up, physicians learned for the past eight years the patient had been taking a daily lutein supplement (20 mg) in addition to following a lutein-rich diet, reportedly causing her to consume more than twice the recommended dosage of lutein for an AMD patient of 10 mg per day. According to researchers, once the patient stopped taking the lutein supplement but maintained her lutein-rich diet, the crystals in her right eye disappeared after seven months. The study was recently published in [JAMA Ophthalmology](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/2569672).
