CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION The goal of writing Safe and Sustainable was simple: to bring the best available information\u2014and the right mix of people\u2014together to address critical challenges associated with protecting our food supply and the environment. In researching and writing this report one thing became clear: we must pursue both food safety and environmental goals in tandem. Producing safe and nutritious fruits and vegetables is a critical component of public health. So too are grower's efforts to safeguard natural resources such as clean water, clean air, and healthy ecosystems. Throughout the development of this report, produce growers have resoundingly stated their commitment to producesafe food, their desire to be excellent stewards of natural resources, and their belief that they can do both well - butonly if food safety programs effectively integrate resource conservation goals. Today, growers overwhelmingly report being pressured by what appear to be conflicting demands. However, as detailed in this report, we believe \"co- managing\" for food safety and ecological health is not only possible, but in fact represents the optimal path forward. We owe it to growers and consumers to work together to provide a framework that makes this a reality. This joint effort has resulted in a long and thorough process. More than 35 expert advisors contributed directly to the drafting of this report, representing many facets of the agricultural industry\u2014from small and mid-scale growersto shippers and buyers\u2014as well as government agencies, environmental non-profits, the legal world, academia, andother related organizations and interests. The research and writing process built extensive networks of cooperation and learning to produce this in-depth report. The project was further advised by top scientific experts in the fields of microbiology, wildlife biology and veterinary science who are engaged in groundbreaking work to define sources of contamination in fresh produce, as well as processes of contamination. We encourage policy makers and industry leaders at every level to read Safe and Sustainable and consider its findings. From legislative offices to corporate boardrooms, it is essential to pay close attention to the research and \"on-the-ground\" realities represented here. The decisions we make now regarding managing food safety and our natural resources may impact our nation's health and prosperity for generations to come. Sincerely, Timothy York, President Christina Fischer, Project Director Gail Raabe Markon Cooperative The Nature Conservancy Agricultural Commissioner San Mateo County Foreword AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org4SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Abstract The safety of fresh produce persists as a pressing national issue. Farmers, environmental groups, and others are working together toward a common goal of promoting food safety and environmental stewardship. Members of these groups have expressed concerns that certain on-farm food safety requirements may do little to protect human health and might in fact damage the natural resources on which agriculture and all life depend. This report analyzes the state of the science behind integration of food safety and ecological health. Drawing from multiple sources - including more than 100 interviews with experts, observations at 68 farms, two large-scale surveys of growers, and a review of more than 250 scientific studies - the report provides the most in-depth examination to date of this topic. The main finding is that growers report yielding to tremendous pressure from auditors, inspectors, and other food safety professionals to change on-farm management practices in ways that not only generate uncertain food safety benefits, but also create serious environmental consequences. Environmental concerns include reduction ofwater quality, removal of wetland, riparian and other habitat, and elimination of wildlife on and near farm land. Many growers and a wide consortium of regional experts believe that \"co-management\" for food safety and envi- ronmental protection represents the optimal path forward, albeit one that faces several key obstacles. Co-management is defined as an approach to minimize microbiological hazards associated with food production while simultaneously conserving soil, water, air, wildlife, and other natural resources. It is based on the premise that farmers want to produce safe food, desire to be good land stewards, and can do both while still remaining econom- ically viable. Although the report focuses on lettuce, spinach, and other leafy greens grown in the Central Coastregion of California, its findings reflect concerns across the nation. Executive Summary This report represents the most in-depth examination to date of integrating food safety and environmental protection in agricultural production. The need for such integration occurs in many places and in association with an increasingnumber of crops. Major national concerns about food safety and ecological health have converged on leafy greens production areas in California's Central Coast region. The local agricultural industry, supporting government and academic professionals, and the environmental community have come together in a collaborative effort to addressthese concerns. The confluence of environmental and food safety concerns presents several pressing challenges. It also creates rich opportunities for broad-based coalitions to form around shared concerns, interests, and values. Agricultural producers as well as consumers seek to minimize foodborne illness risks while also conserving the natural resources that make agriculture possible. This includes protecting water quality and preserving the diversity, beauty and utility of natural ecosystems that sustain all of human life. Managing for these multiple goals presents a critical challenge with national implications. Unfortunately, available information on this challenge varies in quality and is scattered across multiple disciplines. Stakeholders - including industry members, government officials, and environmental and consumer advocates - have lacked an in-depth and objective synthesis of the best available information. This case study fills part of that information gap. Its goal is to aid efforts to make food production safe and sustainable by reviewing the current state of knowledge regarding integration of food safety with ecological health in leafy greens production. Four key questions lie at its core:Abstract and Executive Summary AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org5SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION 1.What is the background and context of the food safety and environmental protection conflict? 2.What is happening \"on the ground\" with respect to food safety and natural resource conservation practices ? 3.What is the current state of the science with respect to these topics? 4.What is \"co-management \" and which key issues affect its viability? In answering these questions, the analysis incorporates quantitative and qualitative data spanning both social and natural sciences. Key data sources include:1) more than 100 interviews conducted with regional experts; 2) authors' direct observations on 68 Central Coast farms; 3) a review of more than 250 scientific studies and other relevantpublications; and 4) secondary analysis of anonymous mail surveys of 181 growers in 2007 and 154 growers in 2009.The report uses a well established protocol for calibrating different levels of scientific certainty. Terms such as likely, very likely , andpractically certain appear throughout the document and reflect increasing levels of confidence regarding expected impacts of on-farm management practices. Confidence is determined by the availability, qualityand applicability of scientific evidence. While numerous important findings appear in this executive summary and throughout the full report, the weight ofevidence supports a single overall conclusion: Growers report yielding to tremendous pressure from auditors, inspectors, and other food safety professionals to change on-farm management practices in ways that not only generate uncertain foodsafety benefits, but also create serious environmental consequences. Many growers and a wide consortium of regional experts believe that \"co-management\" for food safety and environmental protection represents the optimal path forward, albeit one that faces several key obstacles. In terms of context , the Central Coast is nationally significant for its agricultural production and ecological features. Like southern California, western Arizona, the central Mexico highlands, and other major leafy green production areas, the Central Coast region has conditions that support immense biological diversity and position it as an area of national ecological significance. The region's agriculture and environment also play key roles in protecting public health, for example by directly affecting water quality and food safety. Agricultural and ecological features are also the subject of significant regulation and mounting challenges to their long-term viability. On-the-ground farm management practices have changed in response to food safety concerns. First, growers report being pressured by auditors, inspectors, and other food safety professionals to modify management efforts in ways that cause concern among growers. Second, auditors/inspectors/others most often specify multiple environmental features as food safety risks. For example, 47% (n = 72) of the 154 growers in the above-mentioned 2009 survey reported being told that wildlife was a risk to food safety (including feral pigs, deer, birds, rodents, and amphibians). Additionally, 31% (n = 48) were told the presence of streams, wetlands, and other water bodies near farm fields wasa risk to food safety. The pressures growers face have resulted in changes to agricultural management practices, including impacts on related efforts to conserve soil, wildlife, and water. Anonymous mail-in surveys, authors' visits to dozens of farms, and interviews with more than 80 growers across 2007, 2008, and 2009 provide clear evidence of widespread adoption of conservation practices over the past decade. For example, 91% (n = 165) of respondents to the 2007 grower survey mentioned above reported adopting one or more conservation practice, and the majority reported completing a Farm Water Quality Plan. Seventy-three percent (n = 112) of respondents in the 2009 grower survey AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org6SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION indicated they had adopted at least one conservation practice. Growers implement conservation practices for multiple reasons including the maintenance of long-term viability of the natural resource base. The same sources that provide evidence of adoption of conservation practices also provide clear evidence that in response to pressure from auditors, inspectors and other food safety professionals some conservation practices are now being removed and/or discontinued. For example, twenty-one percent (n = 38) of growers surveyed in 2007 reported that they had removed or abandoned conservation practices. In addition, many growers have taken stepsto eliminate wildlife, vegetation, and water bodies near crops in response to pressures from auditors, inspectors, and other food safety professionals. Eighty-nine percent (n = 161) of all growers who responded to the 2007 survey indicated that they had adopted at least one measure to actively discourage or eliminate wildlife from cropped areasin response to expressed food safety concerns. The 2009 grower survey and interviews provide additional evidence.For example 28% (n = 43) of survey respondents stated they had installed fencing to deter wildlife and 22% (n =34) reported installing bare ground buffers between natural habitat and row crops for the same purpose. Thescience discussion addresses three questions: What food safety risk do wildlife, non-crop vegetation, and water bodies present? To what extent does removing these three natural resources adversely affect ecological health? What are the food safety consequences of removing or retaining them? The most important finding from the sciencecomponent is that available data relevant to the three questions posed above are incomplete. For example, research scientists are beginning to collect survey-based data on pathogen prevalence in diverse wildlife in relation to season and geospatial movements. These data will help to better characterize the role that wildlife mightplay in direct and indirect pathogen contamination of produce, perhaps in connection with cattle or as independent reservoirs of certain pathogens. The potential for, and relative importance of, direct fecal contamination (e.g., contaminated feces in contact with fresh produce) and indirect contamination of the growing environment (e.g.,contamination of water, soil, dust, bioaerosols) by domestic animals and wildlife is an area of active research. The current level of understanding is not sufficient to fully predict risk posed by various contamination processes, norto identify and implement specific, effective and economically viable mitigation strategies to protect fresh produce from contamination by domesticated and wild animals. Some studies have demonstrated pathogen presence or vectoring potential in diverse wildlife species, generally at low frequencies. Three investigations following illness outbreaks have found the same pathogens that made people sick to be present in samples collected near fields where the implicated produce was grown. Much of the researchto date has helped answer the question, what canhappen with regard to pathogens in wildlife and domestic animals? Focus has largely rested on the fact that some species of wildlife can carry pathogens, and that they enter crop fields. To fully assess the risks posed by these animals, however, it is necessary to answer the questions: what does happen, how much risk does it pose, and what management strategies are appropriate to minimize risk? The main points here are two-fold:1) contamination processes involving both domesticated and wild animals are not well-described; and 2) the documented ongoing removal of non-crop vegetation and water bodies from farms is based on the assumption that wildlife are attracted to these areas, and that wildlife and their wastes in proximity to crops pose food safety risk. This report's environmental focus has led to a detailed examination of wildlife's potential role in the process of contamination, but several other possible sources of farm-based contamination exist. Leading examples include domesticated animals, water, soil amendments, and workers - all of which are subjects of ongoing research and extensive farm-based food safety practices that lie beyond the scope of this report. Regarding ecological health, available data from the Central Coast and beyond point to negative environmental consequences of activities reported by growers to be occurring. Reported activities include eliminating or deterring AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org7SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION wildlife, reducing non-crop vegetation, and removing natural and engineered water bodies. A large body of scientific literature documents that removal of natural habitat such as wetlands and riparian vegetation leads to negative environmental effects. While quantitative measurement of the impact of on-farm management changes on ecological health was not part of this study, some impacts may be predicted based upon knowledge of both the importance of specific management practices and indicators of changes in their use. Based on evidence reviewed for this report, the following are likely effects of changes in management practices in response to food safety concerns in the Central Coast region: adverse impacts on the quality of water for local populations of aquatic organisms such as fish and frogs, as well as on habitat quality for terrestrial species such as birds and mountain lions, due to removal of riparian vegetation; adverse effects on water quality, as well as on wildlife populations as integral parts of ecosystems, due to removal of natural water bodies such as wetlands; negative environmental impacts on non-target species - including bioaccumulation up the food chain to raptors, bobcats, and other predators - due to use of anticoagulant rodenticides in bait stations; compromises in water quality due to reduced use of vegetated treatment systems such as vegetated ponds and grassed waterways; increased sedimentation in waterways, leading to reduced aquatic habitat and less capacity to handlefloodwaters, due to removal of vegetation and basins that catch sediment before it enters streams and rivers. This report has not completely considered cumulative and synergistic environmental effects related to food safety practices in the Central Coast region, although it is reasonable to expect that they occur. Cumulative and synergistic effects are environmental impacts that result from individually minor but collectively significant actions. The reportflags them as issues of concern, but notes that fully documenting cumulative and synergistic effects in the Central Coast region could require extensive research. With respect to food safety implications, replacement of vegetated buffers with bare ground buffers is of particular concern. To the extent that bare ground allows increased surface water runoff to reach crop land, the potential exists for this practice to increase food safety risk. The risk is especially high in places where range land abuts crop landand during rainfall periods. Given the changes to practices, and the implications of these changes, what approach do regional stakeholders consider to be a potential path forward? Experts from government, academia, non-profits, and the agriculture industry widely describe co-management as a way to reconcile conflicts between food safety and natural resource protection. Co-management is defined as an approach to minimize microbiological hazards associated with food production while simultaneously conserving soil, water, air, wildlife, and other natural resources. It is based on the premise that farmers want to produce safe food, desire to be good land stewards, and can do both while still remaining economically viable. Suggested initial co-management principles include being science-based, adaptable,collaborative, commodity-specific, and site-specific. Through the process of developing this report, stakeholders have identified key issues that must be considered in efforts to address the challenges of integrating food safety and natural resource conservation goals. Top among these is the presence of numerous private corporate food safety standards, which raise multiple concerns such as: inconsistent interpretation and application of requirements, a spiraling food safety \"arms race,\" lack of transparency in the standards, unclear scientific basis for certain standards, requirements that pressure growers to contravene environmental laws, and a spreading of 'leafy greens' requirements to crops such as Brussel sprouts and artichokes that do not present the same food safety risk because consumers cook them before eating. Other issues are related AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org8SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION to mounting liability and litigation risk, potential effects of national food safety standards, the industry's movement into value-added products, and lack of existing scientific data regarding minimizing risk. Understanding andaddressing these and other issues will be critical to successful implementation of effective co-management strategies. Lack of certainty about both food safety risk and threats to ecological health puts growers in a difficult situation. Growers are currently asked to make high stakes decisions with low levels of information, the only certainty beingthat if anything goes wrong they will be held accountable in both legal and public opinion. That said, even thestrongest scientific guidance can only go so far. Individual and societal values play a key role in decision-making atall levels, which stakeholders acknowledge affects co-management success. Taken as a whole, this case study stands as the most in-depth assessment to date of opportunities and obstacles formaking produce safer and more sustainable. It should be of interest wherever people seek to conserve sensitive natural resources, reduce foodborne illness, or both. Although this case study focuses on a single category of produce(leafy greens) and a specific geographical area, the findings and underlying principles may apply across the nation. The report represents an important step toward helping society minimize acute risks of foodborne illness while alsopreventing chronic dangers posed by ongoing degradation of natural resources. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org9SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION A. WhyThis Study? National concerns about food safety and ecological health are converging in the agricultural fields of California's Central Coast region. On one hand, prevention of foodborne illnesses has emerged as an important national issue (e.g., Booz Allen 2009, United States Government 2009). On the other hand, long-standing awareness of the risks of environmental degradation to both ecological and human health continue to drive efforts to protect wildlife, habitat, and water quality (e.g., U.S. EPA 2009, Worldwatch Institute 2008, TNC 2006). The confluence of these two concerns presents several pressing challenges. It also creates unprecedented opportunities for broad-based coalitions to form around shared concerns, interests, and values. Both the agriculture industry and consumers have expressed a desire to minimize risks of foodborne illness. But society also wants to conserve thenatural resources that make agriculture possible, by protecting the quality of water for human and animal use, and by preserving both the beauty and utility of natural ecosystems. This convergence of societal goals presents a critical challenge with national implications. Available information on this challenge varies in quality and is scattered across multiple disciplines. Stakeholders- including industry members, government officials, and environmental and consumer groups - have lacked in- depth and objective synthesis of the best available information. This case study attempts to address that information gap. Its goal is to aid efforts to make food production safe and sustainable, considering production of food that addresses the needs of society, the stewardship of the natural environment and the economic viability of theagricultural community. The report reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the integration of food safety with ecological health. The analysis seeks to answer four questions in particular: 1.What is the background and context of the food safety and environmental protection conflict? 2.What is happening \"on the ground\" with respect to food safety and natural resource conservationpractices? 3.What is the current state of the science with respect to these topics? 4.What is \"co-management \" and which key food safety issues affect its viability? The report synthesizes available information regarding the issues so that interested parties can benefit from a greater understanding of multiple perspectives and current scientific findings. While all interested parties can benefit from its findings, it is important to note that the report reflects perspectives of the Technical Advisory Committee assembled to develop it. By design, the committee focused on activities occurring on or near farms, i.e., the production stage. It did not attempt to include perspectives and representation from large buyers and retailers who comprise other links in the \"farm to fork\" chain. Nevertheless, the results should be of interest to a diverse set of parties in California and beyond. B. Agriculture in the CentralCoast Region California has the largest agriculture sector in the United States (U.S.), producing 50% of the nation's fresh-market vegetables and 78% of its lettuce (CA Agricultural Resources Directory 2009). The Central Coast region of Californiais one of the most high-value agricultural areas in the state. The region encompasses seven counties: Monterey, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, San Mateo, and San Luis Obispo. These counties produce over 200types of crops and support a $6 billion dollar agricultural industry, according to the latest Crop Reports availablePART I. Introduction and Background AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org10SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION from county agricultural commissioners' offices. Agriculture is one of the top industries in the region supporting approximately 57,400 jobs in 2006 (CA EDD 2006). Agriculture in the region, especially vineyards and wineries, attracts visitors and contributes towards regional tourism. This report focuses primarily on the production of lettuce and other leafy greens in the Central Coast region. Due to its role as a dominant producer of these commodities,Monterey County is the focus of much of the discussion, even though the issues are not unique to that area. Appendix A provides additional details on Central Coast agriculture and on each of the other topics addressed under sub- heads in this section. As the top producers of raw product for bagged salads, growers in the Central Coast and especially in Monterey County have been dramatically impacted by the 2006 outbreak of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 associated with spinach. The outbreak sickened over 200 individuals and resulted in at least 3 deaths (CDC 2006). The ensuing loss of consumer confidence has cost the leafy greens industry more than $350 million by some estimates (Weise and Schmit 2007). Although federal and state officials traced the outbreak to spinach processed in a single facility in San Juan Bautista and sourced from a field in San Benito County, they did not determine how the contaminationoccurred. The 51-page final report noted that, \"No definitive determination could be made regarding how E. coli O157:H7 pathogens contaminated spinach in this outbreak.\" (California Food Emergency Response Team 2007,p.4). The resulting attention on food safety has rippled throughout the Central Coast and largely has been directed towards the most productive regions in the Salinas Valley. Monterey County and the larger Central Coast region have therefore become the center of discussions regarding how to prevent future outbreaks associated with leafy greens. C. EcologicalResources in the CentralCoast Region Highly productive agricultural areas are often areas rich in biodiversity and unique natural resources. Like southern California, western Arizona, the highlands of central Mexico and other significant leafy green production areas, theCentral Coast region has fertile soils, a moderate climate during the growing season, and topographical diversity thatsupport immense biological diversity and position it as an area of key ecological significance. A combination ofcoastal systems and topographic diversity makes the region home to a large array of microclimates suitable for several important specialty crops. The Central Coast eco-region contains the largest percentage of bays, estuaries, and salt marshes in California (Davis et al. 1998). Waterways in the central portion of the region flow into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the largest marine sanctuary in the United States and an area of exceptional significance for wildlife and commercial fisheries. Rivers include the Salinas, Pajaro, and Santa Maria,plus numerous smaller coastal streams. Riparian 1areas provide essential habitat for birds (including migratory and resident songbirds and waterfowl), mammals, fish (including the federally listed as Threatened steelhead trout(Oncorhynchus mykiss ), and amphibians (including frogs, toads, snakes and salamanders). The Central Coast region is home to more than 80 species listed or proposed for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. D. Protecting PublicHealth The Central Coast plays a key role in protecting public health at the local and national levels. The region contributes to national public health by serving as the nation's main source of leafy greens, the consumption of which leads to well documented health benefits (e.g., Goldman 2003, Su et al. 2006). Given the 2006 E. coli O157:H7 outbreak linked to spinach that was grown here (California Emergency Food Response Team 2007), the region is also on the front lines of implementing on-farm measures to prevent contamination of leafy greens with the pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses. The 2006 incident is only one of numerous outbreaks linked to fresh produce over recent decades (Sicapalasingam et al.2004). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org11 1Bold-faced FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Decisions in managing agricultural land play a key role in protecting air, water and soil resources, which are also essential to public health. On-farm conservation practices that effectively remove sediment, excess nutrients, pathogens and pesticides from agricultural drainage water protect both ground and surface water quality. Un- treated agricultural drainage water may contain high levels of all of these contaminants and may affect public health by compromising water quality. For example, in yearly well tests by California's Department of Pesticide Regulation, 2.4% (8 out of 328) wells tested on the Central Coast had positive detections for pesticide residues (CDPR, 2008), and 46 Central Coast waterways are listed as impaired, where agriculture is considered one of the contamination sources.2Growers are keenly aware that their management strategies have a large impact on the human and natural communities around them, and have made strong efforts to implement conservation practices that protect air, water and soil quality. E. The Roles of VoluntaryConservation Efforts and Regulation Central Coast growers face a complex and escalating array of environmental and food safety regulations, which are detailed in Appendix A. As noted above, the Central Coast region is home to over 80 species listed or proposed for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, which prohibits removal of habitat designated as Critical Habitat for these species' survival. Meanwhile, numerous local ordinances restrict vegetation removal and other landmodifications, especially in riparian areas and floodplains (Monterey County 2009). Due to existing water quality problems and threats to natural resources, several agencies have devoted substantial resources towards protecting ecological health in the Central Coast region. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is a part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and offers technical and financial assistance to growers who adopt conservation practices. These practices serve a variety of purposes including minimizing erosion, reducing the run-off of pesticides, fertilizers and sediment, and promoting wildlife habitat (NRCS 2009). Agencies promote conservation practices through programs such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), funded through the U.S. Farm Bill. In addition, local Resource Conservation Districts (RCDs) work with growers to adopt conservation practices and other measures to address water pollution and to protect natural resources. Manyof these practices use vegetation to filter out and absorb pollutants before drainage water and runoff enterswaterways. This vegetation may also serve as wildlife habitat. Neither the NRCS nor the RCDs are regulatory bodies,which means that their programs rely on voluntary grower participation. Central Coast landowners and growers have voluntarily implemented conservation practices designed to reduce agricultural impacts to waterways and wildlife and to enhance ecosystem health on and near their farms (Resource Conservation District 2007). Regional conservation and farming organizations have become increasingly involved in efforts to reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture in the Central Coast. Several organizations assist growers with installing native vegetation and hedgerows to provide wildlife habitat and reduce agricultural run-off. The award-winning Agriculture Water Quality Alliance formed to further encourage environmental stewardship on farmland. The collaborative effort represents a partnership between the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, six county Farm Bureaus, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, local Resource Conservation Districts, and the University of California Cooperative Extension (AWQA 2008). Through these and other voluntary efforts, the Central Coast region has become a leading example of cooperation in promoting ecological health and continues to be the focus of efforts to protect water quality, ecosystems, and wildlife.

See: http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/tmdl/docs/303dlists2006/epa/r3_06_303d_reqtmdls.pdfSAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION In addition to voluntary programs, regulatory approaches have evolved to protect water quality in the Central Coast. In 1987, Congress amended the U.S. Clean Water Act to include a new Non-point Source Management Program.This program recognizes the need for leadership to address non-point source pollution and provides support for states to establish their own methods to do so. The non-point source program in California is administered by the State Water Resources Control Board and nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB). Along with urban area inputs, agriculture is a leading source of non-point source pollution in California. Consequently, a large portion of program resources focus on agricultural pollution. In 2004, the Central Coast RWQCB adopted the \"AgriculturalWaiver Program,\" which includes mandatory grower education and promotes the same conservation practices supported by the NRCS. The program also requires growers to participate in water quality monitoring, which maybe used in the future to identify pollution \"hot spots\" and implement enforcement where necessary (Dowd et al. 2008). Overall, Central Coast growers have demonstrated exceptional interest and cooperation in addressing environmental problems associated with agriculture. Central Coast RWQCB staff report that among the roughly 2500 growers in the Central Coast region, approximately 1800 growers (who manage 93% of the total regional acreage) have enrolled in the Agricultural Waiver Program, 1000 growers have completed 15 hours of water quality education, and many of these growers have at least one conservation practice in place. 3Despite gains and a demonstrated history of voluntary implementation of conservation practices, significant challenges remain, including potential environmentaldegradation stemming from on-farm food safety practices. The 2006 outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 associated with spinach spawned new measures to address food safety concerns. In 2007, California and national legislative bodies (U.S. Congress and U.S. Senate) both debated newly proposed laws to address food safety but did not pass any legislation. An alternative approach led by industry resulted in a state marketing agreement known as the Leafy Green Products Handler Marketing Agreement (www.lgma.com), with administration by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the California Department ofFood and Agriculture (CDFA). For more information on the LGMA or private food safety programs see AppendixA. Many private firms also adhere to their own food safety standards, including processers, shippers, retailers, and third party auditors. As will be detailed in Part IV, the result is that growers now face new, complex, and ofteninconsistent measures directed by the produce industry - requirements that occur outside any regulatory oversight or scientific review. F. Regarding the Scope and Methods The following sections explore the extent to which on-farm management practices, promoted either by the produce industry or conservation agencies/organizations, support or undermine food safety and ecological health goals. Theyanalyze current on-the-ground practices relating to food safety and environment, then assess the state of the science underlying these practices. To maximize the quality of this effort, this research process used multiple methods,multiple researchers, and multiple data sources. The three main methods were:1) review of key documents; 2) personal interviews with regional experts; and 3) direct observations conducted at farms and processing facilities. In addition to these qualitative methods, researchers also drew heavily from quantitative data from 154 growers who AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org13 3According to an August 13, 2008 Regional Board Staff Report (http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/centralcoast/water_issues/programs/ag_waivers/docs/renewal_summary_8_08.pdf), accessed on the regional board website (http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/centralcoast/water_issues/programs/ag_waivers/index.shtml), as of June 30, 2008 1127 growers have completed at least 14 hours of farm water quality education and 1419 growers (representing 379,022 acres of irrigated agriculture) have completed a farm water quality management plan.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION answered a mail survey in spring 2009, as well as 181 growers who answered a mail survey in 2007. Appendix B provides additional details on these methods. Bold-faced words in this report appear in the glossary (Appendix C) . Considerable scientific uncertainty, opinion, emotion, and politics surround this topic. Thus, this report attempts to gauge the quality of the underlying science regarding specific issues, particularly the amount of evidence available and degree of consensus among experts on its interpretation. The report borrows from a well established protocol for calibrating different levels of scientific certainty. Terms such as likely, very likely and practically certain appear throughout the report and reflect increasing levels of confidence regarding expected impacts of on-farm management practices. Confidence is determined by the availability, quality and applicability of scientific evidence. For additional details and an illustrative example, please consult IPCC (2004). Given how large and complex issues concerning agriculture and the environment are, it was necessary to define the project scope with a clear focus. First, with respect to microbial pathogens , the report applies to a broad range of human pathogens but focuses on pathogenic E. coliandSalmonella . Second, the geographical focus is on the Central Coast region of California, including the Salinas Valley, although the underlying principles have broad applicability across California and beyond. Third, the analysis applies to a wide variety of crops but has focused on leafy greens,with awareness that many of the contamination issues apply to other produce consumed raw. Fourth, significant outbreaks have occurred dating back to the 1990s, but this report generally focuses on events and practices sincethe 2006 spinach outbreak. Last, the report focuses on production and harvesting, but acknowledges the critical role of practices during the entire product supply chain including processes associated with fresh-cut / value added, distribution, and end-user handling. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org14SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION A. Introduction to Analysis of Management Practices This section documents on-farm management practices and how they have changed in response to food safety concerns. It focuses on those practices relating to environmental protection, food safety, or both. These are vast topics. For example, the Commodity Specific Food Safety Guidelines for the Lettuce and Leafy Greens Supply Chain lists 125 \"things to consider\" as possible \"mitigation steps or practices\" to reduce pathogenic contamination (Gorny et al.2006). A more recent document specifies 76 \"best practices\" for growers to follow during production and harvest stage alone (Leafy Greens Marketing Board 2008). Regarding the environment, Farm Water Quality Plan templates used in the area describe more than 300 on-farm practices to protect water quality (Bianchi, Mountjoy, and Jones 2008). Analyzing this immense set of management practices lies beyond the scope of this report. Instead, the report focuses on the small subset of practices that have generated the most discussion and concern. This analysis of management practices draws from four primary data sources: 1) interviews with 66 randomly selected growers from Monterey County in 2007 and 2008; a mail survey of 181 Central Coast growers in 2007; 3) interviews with roughly three dozen regional experts in 2009, including 12 growers and representatives fromindustry, environmental non-profits, and government agencies; and 4) a mail survey of 154 growers in 2009. Theuse of two quantitative studies, two qualitative sources, and a three-year time period provides a strong foundation for assessing changes in management practices. Multiple sources each provide different perspectives on the topic.Taken as a whole they converge on a single compelling conclusion for Part II: as a condition to sell their produce, growers report yielding to tremendous pressure exerted by auditors, inspectors, and other food safety professionals to take measures that are potentially damaging to the environment. The rest of this section covers the four data sources in chronological sequence and summarizes key points from each. It also describes grower concerns andmanagement practices relating to flood waters. B. KeyFindings fromthe 2007Grower Survey By spring 2007, concerns had arisen about potential environmental impacts of industry-led food safety practices being taken after the fall 2006 E. coli outbreak associated with spinach.4For example, in a March 19th letter to the region's farm bureaus and agricultural commissioners, the California Department of Transportation commented on observed environmental changes: \"Since the E. coli bacteria outbreak this past year, the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has observed an increased number of property owners and ranchers performing vegetation management measures where the State Right-of-way abuts private property. These efforts include mechanical, manual,and chemical weed and brush control which may be in direct violation of Caltrans vegetationmanagement policies, environmental law and permits obtained by Caltrans from other regulatory agencies.\" (cited in multiple sources, e.g., Monterey County Farm Bureau 2007, p.6) In response to mounting concerns, the Resource Conservation District of Monterey County implemented an anonymous mail survey of growers. The survey provided quantitative documentation of concerns about food safetyPART II. Current State of Management Practices AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org15 4For example, the following website displays letters written by local, state, and federal agencies expressing concerns about environmental impacts of new food safety practices: http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/centralcoast/water_issues/programs/ag_waivers/food_safety.shtmlSAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION management practices. A consortium of agriculture entities co-sponsored the research, among them the Grower- Shipper Association of Central California, the Central Coast Agricultural Water Quality Coalition, and the Monterey County Agricultural Commissioner's Office. Exactly 181 growers returned the survey for a response rate of 30% \u2014 a rate that is considered by social science standards to be sufficient for the purposes of this analysis. The final report,A Grower Survey: Reconciling Food Safety and Environmental Protection (Resource Conservation District 2007) contained several findings, including: Growers actively plan and implement practices to protect the environment. For example, 91% of survey respondents (n = 165) had adopted one or more conservationpractice(s) , and the majority had completed a Farm Water Quality Plan. Growers are encouraged to eliminate wildlife, vegetation, and waterbodies near crops. For example, 89% (n = 161) of all growers who responded to the survey indicated that they have adopted at least one measureto actively discourage or eliminate wildlife from cropped areas, in response to food safety concerns. Growers are encouraged to remove non-cropvegetation andconservationpractices. For example 32% (n = 30) of leafy greens growers who responded had removed non-crop vegetation and 21% (n = 19) reported they had actively removed one or more conservation practice. The 2007 report also documented the large amount of land potentially affected by this issue (140,000 acres managed by the survey respondents), the extent to which growers are concerned about conflicting demands, and growers'personal thoughts on the situation. For example several growers wrote comments that were included in RCD (2007),among them: 5 ''Food safety auditors have been very strict about any vegetation that might provide habitat. We are very concerned about upsetting the natural balance, but we have to comply with our shipper's requests.'' ''I am afraid many positive environmental programs and practices are going to be abandoned due to retailers/shippers new food safety practices. I am all for the environment and safe food, but feel many new food safety ideas are being driven by fear and uncertainty rather than sound science.'' ''Ultimately, clean margins and no compost or recycling irrigation water will only hurt the farmers, sincethey will be liable for ground and surface water pollution.'' ''We have definitely been put in a conflicting position with new leafy green guidelines and watershed management. For now until more scientific studies produce the needed information I choose to err on the side of food safety, not environmental quality.'' A detailed summary of the survey findings appears in a peer reviewed scholarly journal article (Beretti and Stuart 2008), which is reproduced in Appendix D. C. KeyFindings fromthe 2007-2008Grower Interviews From fall 2007 to spring 2008, a University of California researcher conducted 66 personal interviews with growers in Monterey County, where the bulk of leafy greens production occurs. Growers of row-crops were selected randomly for interviews. Results appear in a variety of scholarly publications. For example, Stuart (2009a) analyzes interviews with leafy greens growers and includes verbatim comments from several growers expressing regret or concern about the adoption of practices that eliminate vegetation or wildlife. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org16 5Direct quotes from anonymous growers appear in several places throughout this report and are based on interview tran- scripts. They do not pretend to serve as representative samples of all interview data, but rather strive to provide illustrative examples and deeper insights for key topics.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Although interviews focused on qualitative data, the number of interviews conducted makes limited quantitative analysis possible. For example, 84% (n = 55) of interviewees said they had adopted at least one measure to eliminate vegetation and/or wildlife as a result of pressure from auditors, inspectors, or other food safety professionals. Of these, 42% (n = 28) used poisoned bait, 37% (n = 24) removed non-cropvegetation , and 21% (n = 14) removed or abandoned conservationpractices specifically installed for water quality. Approximately 37% (n = 24) reported using traps and 42% (n = 28) reported erecting fences (Stuart 2009b). These quantitative and qualitative data provide solid confirmation of the 2007 mail survey findings. D. KeyFindings fromthe 2009Grower Survey In early 2009, the Resource Conservation District of Monterey County collaborated with conservation organizations and agricultural industry groups to conduct a follow up mail survey of Central Coast irrigated row crop operations. The survey was designed to obtain clearer understanding of conflicts between food safety and environmental protection. It focused on three objectives:1) identifying the key drivers within the production, marketing, distributionand retail chain that contribute to the challenge; 2) determining which farming operations experience the most pressure as a result of conflicting demands; and 3) assessing if and how the on-the-ground impacts of thesechallenges have changed over time. Appendix E contains the executive summary of the resulting 68-page report,titledChallenges to Co-Management for Food Safety and Environmental Protection: A Grower Survey. Based on data provided by 154 irrigated row crop operations (from a group of 647 surveyed), the report provided a quantitative, comprehensive snapshot of current on-farm practices and drivers of those practices. 6The report focused on three categories of practices of particular concern: wildlife management, non-crop vegetation , and waterbodies.7This sub-section focuses on management practices within those three categories. The relevant overall finding from the 2009 grower survey was that as a condition to sell their produce, nearly half the growers (49%, n = 76) reported being pressured to exclude wildlife, remove non-crop vegetation, and/or removewater bodies from their fields, resulting in substantial on-farm changes. Growers report that pressure came from auditors, inspectors, and others. As noted in the report \"inspectors\" are employed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture to monitor for compliance with the Leafy Green Marketing Agreement, \"auditors\" represent a company that buys produce, and \"others\" consist mostly of growers' in-house food safety professionals. Thissection provides specific details supporting the overall finding. It focuses only on portions of the study relevant tothis report. Key relevant findings from the survey report include: Auditors/Inspectors/Others Pressure Growers to Change Practices When an environmental feature presents a real or perceived food safety risk growers must take appropriateaction to address the food safety concern or risk potential consequences. RCD (2009) provides detailed analysis of common consequences. Examples include auditors deducting audit points, requiring removal of the feature, or rejecting the crop entirely. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org17 6From RCD (2009): \"Surveys were mailed to irrigated row crop operations in Monterey, San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, and San Luis Obispo Counties. The survey was mailed out to all known row crop opera- tions using the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board Conditional Waiver Program (Region 3) mailing list of enrolled properties, which covers every county except San Mateo. In San Mateo County the survey was mailed out to all row crop operations identified by the San Mateo County Agricultural Commissioner's Office.\" 7As used in the survey, water bodies and ponds may be either natural or engineered. Some engineered water bodies may occur in areas in which natural ponds, springs or seasonal wetlands have been engineered for agricultural use when land was converted from previous use.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Approximately half (49%, n = 76) of the survey respondents reported that an auditor/inspector/other had indicated that wildlife, non-crop vegetation or water bodies were risks to food safety. Among all 154 respondents, wildlife (47%, n = 73) was most commonly reported as being indicated as a food safety risk, followed by waterbodies (31%, n = 48) and non-cropvegetation (26%, n = 40). Of the 73 respondents who were told wildlife is a risk to food safety, respondents reported the following were noted as animals of concern: feral pig (41%, n = 30); deer (63%, n = 46); birds (57%, n = 42); rodents (73%, n = 53); amphibians (43%, n = 31); other (22%, n = 16). Of the 40 respondents who were told non-crop vegetation is a risk to food safety, respondents reported the following vegetation types associated with these concerns: plants in ditches or ponds (70%, n = or 22);wetland orriparian vegetation (55%, n = 22); other (10%, n = 4). Of the 47 respondents who were told water bodies are a risk to food safety, respondents reported thefollowing water bodies associated with these concerns: irrigation reservoir (64%, n = 30); tailwater and other farm pond (53%, n = 25); stream, river or wetland (51%, n = 24); agricultural ditch (45%, n (34%, n = 16); other (0%). RCD (2009) documents differential treatment of growers based on a variety of factors. For example, growers whoadhere to other food safety programs (OFSPs) and sell to either processors or national/international buyers (insteadof directly to local markets) were more likely than others to be told that wildlife was a risk to food safety. Table 1 below provides specific details, including comparisons across species. Table1.

Six percent (6%, n = 9) of respondents indicated they had taken other actions for wildlife which include: trapping and monitoring bait stations and traps; bird and deer chasers; maintaining no standing water; and informing neighbors of the potential food safety risks associated with their pets. Actions in Response to Food Safety Concerns about Non-Crop Vegetation Theone-time actions most commonly reported by respondents to have been taken to address food safety concerns about non-crop vegetation expressed by auditors/inspectors/others were clearing bare ground buffers (20%, n = 31), removing vegetation from farm ponds and ditches (17%, n = 26), and removing trees and shrubs (16%, n = 25). A total of 13% (n = 20) respondents indicated use of fencing between non-crop vegetation and cropland. Ten percent (10%, n = 15) of respondents indicated that they planted a different crop adjacent to non-crop vegetation. Three percent (3%, n = 5) of respondents indicated that they removed wetland or riparian vegetation.9 Actions in Response to Food Safety Concerns about Water bodies The one-time actions most commonly reported by respondents to address food safety concerns about waterbodies expressed by auditors/inspectors/others were bare groundbuffers (15%, n = 23), fencing (15%, n = 23), planting different crops adjacent to water bodies (10%, n = 15), and stopping use, draining or filling farm ponds or ditches (9%, n = 14). Five percent (5%, n = 8) of respondents indicated that they drained, diverted, or filled in a natural water body. Three percent (3%, n = 5) of respondents indicated taking other actions to address food safety concerns about water bodies which include: water testing, copper sulfate, discontinued use of irrigation reservoirs, and drained water from the area. Actions in Response to Food Safety Concerns about Conservation Practices In response to food safety concerns expressed by auditors/inspectors/others,12% (n = 18) of all respondents indicated that they had removed a conservation practice ( one-time action ). Practices removed and manure; covercrops; and habitats. In response to food safety concerns expressed by auditors/inspectors/others,11% (n = 17) of all respondents indicated that they had disabled or stopped using a conservation practice (ongoing action ). Practices taken out of use or disabled include: vegetated buffers and ditches/waterways; cover crops; areas cattle on cropland. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org19 8As noted in RCD (2009), \"one-time\" actions include actions such a removal of practices, removal of vegetation, or installa- tion of structures such as fencing. \"Ongoing\" activities include trapping or hunting. Some actions such as installing fencing and bare ground buffers could be one-time or ongoing, but for the purposes of this report are considered as one-time actions. 9The illegality of removing wetland and riparian habitat and using copper sulfate to eliminate amphibians may have led to under-reporting.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY E. KeyFindings fromthe 2009Qualitative Interviews Research methods for this report also included conducting informal interviews with more than two dozen technical experts representing the agricultural industry, environmental organizations, and government agencies. Many of these experts also served on the project's technical advisory committee. In addition to these technical experts, researchers also interviewed 12 growers. Growers were selected through purposive sampling (Trochim 2000), based on their demonstrated willingness to speak candidly about issues lying at the core of this report, and their representativeness in terms of size (both large/small) and production type (organic/conventional). Interview datado not indicate prevalence of certain experiences and viewpoints, but do offer rich, descriptive information intendedto supplement concerns raised during the grower surveys. The following excerpts from interview summaries illustrate pressures that growers face to deter or eliminate wildlifeand/or remove or abandon vegetation or conservation practices. Full summaries of all 12 grower interviewsconducted in March-April 2009 appear in Appendix F. These interviews, and the subset of 8 brief summaries belowprovide deeper insights into growers' experiences with food safety requirements: Grower #1 10(Size category > 3000 acres, mostly conventional) : worked with the RCD to install grassed waterways but has had to remove several of them. S/He shares that: \"the auditors said they were possible harborage for wildlife and wanted us to either get rid of them or put buffers around them.\" S/He also shares that they can no longer use reservoirs and have filled several in. S/He has managed to keep some of her/hisgrassed waterways although they remain a serious problem. S/He states that grassed waterways are always \"an audit topic and they argue about it every time.\" S/He explains how auditors want to see clean pondswith no amphibians, so they use copper sulfate to eliminate frogs and tadpoles. Grower #6 (Size category 200-500 acres, conventional and organic) : has grassed waterways and catch basins near crop fields. When the auditors from the buyer complain about them s/he tries to explain: \"Ifwe didn't catch the tailwater it would just flood over into other fields.\" Grower has lost business because ofthese practices. Some buyers will no longer buy crops from her/his fields, so s/he has had to find other buyers with \"less stringent standards.\" Grower #11 (Size category 500-1000 acres, all conventional) : has been asked by auditors from shippers to remove their conservation practices. Grower used to have grasses in the ditches to reduce erosion, but now keeps them sprayed and clean to keep wildlife out. Grower says that now s/he has more erosion. Grower also puts copper sulfate in all of her/his ponds because the shippers say they must have a pond policy toeliminate amphibians. Grower #7 (Size category 1000-3,000 acres, conventional and organic) : has removed hundreds of trees and extensive brush around the companies' fields due to pressure from salad processors. Salad plant auditorstell grower: \"this tree is too close\" and \"if you remove this, then I will approve it [the field].\" The company also uses blue tablets of copper sulfate in all of their ponds or any standing water because the processors\"don't like frogs.\" Grower shares that processors do not allow them to use their reservoirs anymore so they have bulldozed them over. Grower #9 (Size category 1000-3000 acres, all conventional) : lost 10 acres of crop, about $32,000, from one incidence of deer intrusion. Grower explains that they have had to build fences all along the [name redacted to protect anonymity] river and more will be added. They have been asked to remove riparian AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org20 10Grower number corresponds to the grower number CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION vegetation along the river, but told the auditor (from their shipper) that \"it is protected riparian vegetation and we cannot remove it.\" Grower #10 (Size category >3000 acres, conventional and organic) : Grower describes why her/his company had to remove conservation practices: \"People can't do these practices anymore because they are not allowed to have grasses.\" Grower explains that for the LGMA it is not so much they are not allowed to have the grasses, but that \"the buffer requirements for the LGMA make it unreasonable to install conservation practices.\" Grower says that you need to have a buffer of at least 10 feet on each side and that \"10 feet along a mile and a half is a lot of land that could be farmed.\" Grower shares that if you need the buffer on both sides that means at least 20 feet out of production on each side. Grower states that keeping conservation practices with these requirements is not practical for business. Grower #10 (Size category >3000 acres, conventional and organic) : was asked by auditors from a processor to clear brush and put up fences along the [ name redacted to protect anonymity ] river. Grower explains how processors are concerned about foreign matter in the lettuce: seeds from cottonwood trees would get intothe romaine lettuce so they were required to cut down the trees. Auditors have also told them to remove extensive shrubs and grass \"because they like clean fields.\" Almost all of their ponds and reservoirs have been bulldozed over because auditors said they were a problem. Grower #12 (Size category 200-500 acres, all conventional) : has been told by shippers to put out bait stations all along fields, grower states that s/he has close to 1000 bait stations. Grower also put up a fence along the creek. S/He was told by her/his shippers to remove vegetation along the [name redacted to protectanonymity] creek that could serve as habitat and harbor wildlife. They cleared out large sections of thecreek: \"We probably took out about 90 truck loads of brush from along the creek.\" Identification of Flood Risk and Flood Management Practices . Interviews with growers in 2009 also highlight concerns about flooding. For example, one grower interviewed for this report commented, \"All of the shippers gobeyond the LGMA in their own way. They are stricter regarding flooding and the widths of buffers.\" Flooding concerns also surfaced in the 2007 quantitative and qualitative data. For example, a participant in the 2007 growersurvey described having 23 acres of head lettuce and 2 acres of mixed lettuce rejected by auditors due to contact with [name redacted to protect anonymity ] river flood water (RCD 2007, Beretti and Stuart 2008). A grower interviewed in 2007 commented, \"Fields were flagged out for bird [droppings]. If there was a flood you couldn't plant for 3 years. Ridiculous rule.\" Why are growers concerned about food safety when managing for flood prevention, and how do food safety programs alter growers' response to flood management practices? In 2005 the FDA sent a letter to California leafy greens growers stating that product from flooded fields is considered adulterated and not safe for consumption because flood waters may carry human pathogens (FDA, 2005). Citing this letter, current LGMA guidelines require destruction of flooded crops, and recommend a waiting period of 60 days after flooding before re-planting. Soil tests for the presence of microorganisms of significant public health concern, or appropriate indicator microorganisms, may be used to shorten this period to 30 days (LGMA, 2008). In California's Central Coast region, loss of the standing crop, plus a 60 day waiting period, can result in significant financial loss. Private, corporate food safety standards that go beyond the LGMA requirements can sharply increase these waiting times, resulting in even greater losses. Fresh Express, for example, was reported to require a 5-year post-flood waiting period in a USA Today article available on Fresh Express' website at the time of writing and AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org21SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION reproduced in Appendix G.11Responding to an inquiry made for this report, Fresh Express declined to provide their current standards, but did provide a brief description of them (See Appendix G). Growers and other landowners cite several reasons other than food safety concerns for wanting to control flooding, among them reducing flood-induced erosion, property damage, and threats to public safety. However, extended periods of lost productivity generate increased financial risk associated with even minor flooding events. This represents a significant new consideration for landowners when contemplating the level of effort to direct at floodcontrol activities such as riparian vegetation management. Growers report acting on concerns about financial impacts from both loss of crop due to flooding and waiting periods after flooding. New food safety requirements featured prominently in a November 2008 permit request for emergency flood control activities in Monterey County: \"Major financial impacts would result from the temporary loss of available agricultural lands for crop production subjected to a flood. Under the California Leafy Green Products Handler Marketing Agreement (LGMA), rigid food safety standard controls are now in place for production of crops inrecently flooded areas. The LGMA standard states the grower/landowner must till under any existingflooded areas, allow the soil to dry sufficiently, and perform active tillage therein for at least 60 dayfollowing the receding of the flood water before planting a new crop. This tillage work is required to provide additional protection against the survival of pathogenic organisms.\" (Army Corps of Engineers Public Notice, November 2008, pg. 2) The LGMA guides growers to consult with appropriate regulatory agencies prior to implementing flood control strategies in environmentally sensitive areas adjacent to crop land (LGMA 2008, including its Appendix Z). It is not known whether private corporate standards provide similar guidance, nor the extent to which such guidance is followed. Based on the above, it is reasonable to assume that growers will consider food safety related risks when making flood control decisions, and that such consideration may lead to more channel clearing and riparian vegetation management than was previously considered necessary to address flood risks. Should this be the case, it could lead to substantial adverse impacts on affected rivers and streams. These waterways and the associated riparian vegetation serve as regional wildlife corridors and habitat for steelhead and other aquatic species (Entrix Inc. 2009, Moyle 2002, Smith 2007). Part II Conclusion . Overall, the 2009 qualitative interview data, combined with the grower interviews from 2007- 2008 and quantitative survey results from both 2007 and 2009, provide compelling evidence of changes in management practices due to food safety concerns. These changes influence management of wildlife, water bodies, non-crop vegetation, and flood risk. Part III explores the implications of the management changes that growers report taking to address food safety issues. Specifically, the following section explores the science behind this subset of practices in order to clarify implications for both food safety and ecological health.

Defining Risks in a LocalContext As indicated above, growers report being told that wildlife, non-crop vegetation and water bodies pose a risk to food safety. They also indicate that proximity of domestic animals and their waste products to crop production areas is considered a risk. The following section begins by reviewing information regarding factors that growers report they have been told are risks for food safety, and reviews scientific literature that addresses risk from these factors. The review then considers available information to assess the impact of changes in management practices to address food safety concerns - deterring or eliminating wildlife, reducing use of non-crop vegetation or altering use of water bodies - on ecological health and food safety objectives in the Central Coast region. Much of the discussion here summarizes review of relevant literature, reports, and other information sources that are presented with full citations and in more detail in Appendices H and I. Wherever possible, research done in the Central Coast region, under conditions representative of local, irrigated row crop production systems, is discussedto help provide the most relevant assessment of the effectiveness of local management practices. B. Evidence of Food SafetyRisk FromOn-FarmFactors Risks from Wildlife: Wildlife has received considerable attention in efforts to identify sources of E. coli O157:H7 and other pathogens in fresh produce. However, data relevant to food safety risk from wildlife is scarce and incomplete (Atwill, 2008). Table 2 summarizes details about the methods, sample size, and factors reported in 52 studies relevant to pathogens in wildlife. These studies demonstrate the range of research areas, species, and methodologies used to investigate therole both wild and domestic animals may play in contamination processes. See Appendix I for a detailed explanation of how these studies were identified and selected. Prevalence studies of pathogens in cattle or other domestic animals typically represent the infection rate in thepopulation as a whole. Population size is known, as is percent of the population sampled. In the vast majority of studies investigating pathogen prevalence in wildlife, population size and percent of the population sampled are not known. For example, if 100 fecal samples are collected after deposition, in many instances it is not known whether this represents fecal samples of 100 animals, or fecal samples of 25 animals defecating four times each. Also, methods of collection, knowledge of sample age and condition, duration of pathogen shedding from infected animals, magnitude of infection (number cfu/g fecal matter), and possibility of contamination after deposition are usually unknown. Because of these uncertainties, the data summarized in Table 2 should be seen as a guide for future study, not a statement of risk. Few studies have been conducted in North America, and particularly in California or the Central Coast region. Pathogen prevalence and movement may depend upon the environment in which animals live and coexist. For this reason, full assessment of the risk wildlife and their wastes may pose to food safety must include studies in the relevant growing environment. Research to date primarily addresses whether various species of animals are capable of carrying human pathogens. Contamination processes might include direct transfer of pathogens to fresh produce through fecal deposition directly onto plants. Other contamination processes might involve contamination of the growing environment (e.g., water,Part III: State of the Science - Implications of Changes toManagement Practices AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org23SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION soil, dust, bioaerosols), elements of which may subsequently come in contact with crops. The relative importance of these mechanisms in recent contamination processes remains unclear. Without information that describes the contamination process, it is extremely difficult to assess the risk posed by the presence of pathogens in domesticated and wild animals, particularly in wildlife populations where sample collection is more challenging.

STEC is generally used by U.S. based researchers, VTEC by European based researchers. 13It is important to note that direct comparisons between studies are problematic because of the lack of standardized methods. Proportion of the population sampled impacts the margin of error of reported results. The size (weight) sample tested and the microbiological methods used may also influence the sensitivity of the test. Additionally, improvements in laboratory detection methods in recent years raise questions regarding negative results from older surveys of pathogen prevalence in wildlife popu- lations.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR Branham et al.,2005 E. coliO157,Salmonella Sampled for E. coliO157:H7 and Salmonella in populations of deer and livestock grazing the same range land in Texas. Deer were sampled after hunter kill. Some information about spatial relationships of water sources, animal grazing areas is given in the discussion. E. coli O157:H7 found in 1 of 80 (1.25%) cattle; 1 of 82 (1.22%) sheep; 0 of 81(0%) goats; and 0 of 26 fecal or rumen samples from white tailed deer (samples of each from 26 animals). One of 20 (5%) water samples was positive for E. coliO157:H7.

Chapman et al.,1997 E. coliO157 Study of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry in England. Tested 400 cattle each month over an entire year and found 13.4% of beef cattle and 16.1% of dairy cattle tested positive for E. coliO157:H7; in spring/summer up to 36.8% of cattle tested positive forE. coliO157:H7. Also tested 1000 each of sheep, pigs and poultry over the same period.E. coliO157:H7 was isolated from 2.2% of sheep, 0.4% of pigs, and 0% of chickens. Cizeket al., 1999 E. coliO157 Fecal samples were collected from cattle, feral pigeons, domestic sparrows (no further description given) and rodents. 72 of 365 (20%) of cattle fecal samples; 0 of 50 (0%) of pigeon samples; 0 of 20 (0%) of sparrow samples; and 4 of 10 (40%) of Norwegian rat samples (Rattus norvegicus) were positive for E. coliO157:H7. Codyet al.,1999 E. coliO157 Deer (species not noted) feces collected near an orchard in California from whichE. coli O157:H7 contaminated apples had been used to make juice tested positive forE.coliO157:H7. Amount of fecal material collected is not noted. Consumers of the juice became ill from the contamination. Compton et al.2008 SalmonellaTenSalmonella enterica serotypes were found in fecal samples from raccoons (Procyon lotor ) in Pennsylvania. Samples were collected from live, anesthetized animals caught in traps. Salmonella was isolated in 55 of 738 (7.4%) of the samples collected over a two year period. Converse et al.,1999 E. coliO157,Salmonella spp.,Campylobacter Fecal material from Canada geese resident in non-agricultural areas in Massachusetts, Virginia and New Jersey was collected three times over approximately 2 months from 12 study sites. Ten samples were collected each of the three sampling sessions from each site. Samples were collected from the ground and were of unknown age at the time of collection, but were noted to be \"fresh\". Some samples were marked and allowed to remain for five days before collection and analysis. No movement patterns of the geese populations sampled noted. Two of 360 samples (0.6%) were positive for Salmonella spp., none of the samples were found positive for E. coliO157:H7 or Campylobacter. Dunnet al.,2004 E. virginianus) deer in Louisiana, was 0.3% (n=338). In August 2001, E. coli O157:H7 was detected in one of 55 deer (1.8%) from the captive herd, which was fed a grain concentrate. Prevalence over the 1-yr period for the captive herd was 0.4% (n=226). CO-MANAGINGFOR Faithet al.1996 E. coliO157 Researchers sampled dairy cattle manure to test for prevalence of E. coliO157:H7 in the animals. In a prevalence study, 10 of 560 calves (1.8%) tested positive for E. coliO157:H7. In a follow up study, in addition to bovine fecal samples, a total of 302 environmental samples including feed, water, and non-bovine animal feces were tested. The 18 non-bovine animal feces tested included cat, dog, pig, rabbit, and raccoon (number of each not specified). None of the non-bovine samples were positive. Three percent (3/101) animal drinking water samples were positive. Prevalence in the bovine feces during the follow up study was 3.7% (19/517). Fenlon,1981 SalmonellaFound prevalence of feces of 12.9% for 1,242 samples. Samples were taken at various locations in Scotland in open areas, by lakes, and by sewage outfalls. Results showed that gulls feeding at sewage works had higher rates (17-21%) of carriage of pathogens than those elsewhere. Fischeret al.,2001 E. coliO157 Did a two year study in southeast states in the U.S. with sampling in a total of 11sites. Samples collected from the rectum of hunter kill deer or from the ground. None of 310 (0%) samples of fecal material collected from the ground (ageunknown, but described as fresh) were positive for E. coliO157:H7. Three of 469 (0.64%) fecal samples collected from free-ranging deer (hunter kill) were positive in the first year. All 3 were from same sample site. Thirteen of 305 (4.3%) cattle sampled from an adjacent area (sampling method not stated) to the area in whichpositive E. coli O157:H7 results for deer were found were positive for E. coli O157:H7. While both the cattle and the deer found to carry E. coli O157:H7 in their feces came from the same sample site, there was not a match between the E. coliO157:H7 strains found in each. In a subsequent sampling of all 11 sites, one of 140 (0.7%) deer samples was positive. Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2007E. coliO157 Used rectal swabs to sample wild populations. 206 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 20 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), (Ovis musimon ) in southwestern Spain were tested for E. coliO157:H7. Three of 206 red deer (1.5%) were positive for E. coliO157. All other samples were negative. Gaukler et al.,2009 E. coliO157,Salmonella Used tags and radio transmitters on European starlings ( Sturnus vulgaris ) in Kansas to explore movement of these birds among feedlots and roosting spots. All cloacal swabs (n=434) were negative for E. coliO157:H7. Three out of 434 samples (0.7%) tested positive for Salmonella . Distances traveled by the birds were recorded for those collected from tagged individuals. Average distance from roosting site to feedlot was 19 km, though some radio tagged individuals moved as far as 40 km from the capture site, and one bird was found 1,287 km away.

None of 23 tadpoles'organ samples showed positive results for E. coli O157. 54% of 24 metamorphs, housed in a stagnant tank after inoculation, had positive results for organ tests of E. coliO157. The two metamorphs sampled on the last day of the study (21 days after inoculation) were negative for E. coli O157 in their organ tissues. Small sample size, differences in water condition for tadpoles and metamorphs, and imperfect replicates of natural environments make extrapolation to field settingsproblematic. Hancock et al.,1998 E. coliO157 Research conducted in the Pacific Northwest tested for E. coli O157 in wild birds on cattle ranches. One of 200 (0.5%) bird feces samples from 12 farms tested positive for E. coliO157:H7. Feces were collected from roosting spots, not directly from birds; species not described. None of 300 rodents from 11 farms were foundto harbor E. coliO157:H7. Rodents were live caught and euthanized for sampling; species not given. None of 34 wildlife fecal samples from 6 farms positive for E. coli O157. Species of wildlife not listed; feces of unknown age. Henzler and Opitz, 1992Salmonella 715 mice and rats were sampled from 10 poultry farms with 16.2% culture-positive forSalmonella enteritidis. Salmonella enteritidis was shown to persist for at least 10 months in an infected mouse population. Authors conclude that mice may be important amplifiers of disease in egg-laying farms. Heuvelink et al.2008 E. coli O157, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia Wildlife samples were collected over a 22 month period in The Netherlands. A total of 897 fecal samples was collected. Prevalence of E. coli O157 was 13.8%, Salmonella was 0.1% and Campylobacter was 0.5%. Campylobacter was isolated mainly from fecal samples collected from birds, including corvidea (59.8%), andmeadow birds and waterfowl (22.4%). A subset of 247 samples was also analyzedforCryptosporidium andGiardia ; none were positive for Cryptosporidium , one roe deer sample was positive for Giardia . (Information extracted from abstract only) Hussein,2007 STECReviewed literature of prevalence of STEC (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, of which E. coliO157:H7 is one) in beef cattle. The review found prevalence rates of E. coli O157:H7 ranged from 0.3% to 19.7% in feedlots and from 0.7% to 27.3% on pasture. Prevalence rates for non-O157:H7 STEC were 4.6% to 55.9% in feedlots and 4.7% to 44.8% on pasture. The authors note that non-O157:H7 should also be considered in addressing pathogen risks in beef products. Janisiewicz et al.,1999 E. coliO157 Fruit flies were contaminated with E. coliby allowing them to walk on an ager plate with the bacteria. Seven of nine fruit flies were contaminated after 2 hours exposure toE. coli; all fruit flies were contaminated after 6 or 24 hours. In a separate experiment, transfer of E. coli F-11775 (a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli found to grow similarly to E. coli O157:H7 on apples) to wounded apple tissue was demonstrated to be possible. Four, three and all six apples in the glass dome experimental container were contaminated after exposure to the fruit flies after 6, 24 and 48 hours.

Sampling results for E. coli O157 in a irrigated row crop production area in California of cattle E. coliO157,Salmonella Fecal samples collected from wild animals taken to two wildlife rehabilitation centers in Ohio were analyzed for E. coli O157 and Salmonella . Samples were taken within 3 days of arrival in the center. None of the animals tested were positive forE. coli O157. A total of 8 of 71 samples were positive for Salmonella . The researchers note that acquisition of Salmonella at the rehabilitation facility itself was likely in some of the infections, perhaps in as many as half the cases (Dr. Jeff LeJeune, DVM, Dipl. ACVM, personal communication). Number of positivesamples/number of samples from the species were as et al.,2001 E. coliO157 Intestinal contents from 1,541 cattle, 665 sheep, and 1,976 pigs in Norway were analyzed for E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was present in 0.35% of cattle, 0.24% of pigs and 0% of sheep. Keeneet al.,1997 E. coliO157 Consumption of venison jerky by a hunter and family members in Oregon led to E. coliO157:H7 infection. E. coliO157:H7 was recovered from 3 of 32 (9%) of black tailed deer ( Odocoileus hemionus columbianus ) fecal pellets and none of 9 elk (species not given) fecal pellets collected in forest land near where deer had been hunted. In samples collected 4 months later, none of three deer samples, and none of 70 cow fecal samples collected from a nearby ranch were positive. Kirket al.,2002 SalmonellaSampled water in troughs from weaned dairy calves in California. Salmonella was found in 4 of 48 dairies in fall 1998 and 8 of 37 dairies in summer 1999. Methods of managing water (continuous filing vs. valve) may affect likeliness of Salmonella . Kullaset al.2002 E. coliO157 Researchers collected total of 397 Canada goose ( Branta canadensis ) fecal samples from four study sites over approximately 11 months. An aggregate sample was collected once every four weeks from a marked area at four sites around Fort Collins, CO. The sample area was raked clean for three weeks in a row; the sample was collected in the fourth week. Samples were also collected from outside the transect area. No E. coli O157 strains were identified, though 6% of the samples were classified as EHEC strains.

Pedersen et al.2006 STECCloacal swabs were collected from a total of 406 rock pigeons (Columba livia ) live trapped or sampled immediately after being shot in. Pigeons from seven locations, including both urban and dairy farm settings, were sampled. No STEC wasdetected in the 406 samples. Salmonella was detected in nine of 106 (9%) of pigeons samples collected from a dairy environment, and none of 171 of samples collected from urban pigeons. The prevalence for Salmonella in all samples was 3% (9/277). Environmental samples in the dairy farm setting were also positive forSalmonella as follows: deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in Nebraska were collected by hunters from dead animals when they weighed in withtheir kill. E. coliO157:H7 was cultured from four (0.25%) of 1,608 total samples submitted. Renteret al.2003 E. coliO157 Fecal and water samples collected in range cattle environments in Kansas andNebraska over an 11 month period were analyzed for E. coli O157. 92 of 9122 (1.01%) cow fecal samples and 14 of 4083 (0.34%) water samples were positive forE. coliO157.

Samples were collected from 16 different cow herds. Researchers chose to examine cow / rabbit cohorts on 6 of the 7 farms on which fecal samples indicated that cows were shedding E. coliO157. Traps were set to catch rabbits, and fecal samples were collected from the trap area daily; trapswere disinfected after each use. None of 32 rabbit fecal samples contained E. coli O157 in the winter sampling period. Two fecal samples on each of four farmscontained E. coli O157 in the summer sampling period (total positives 8 of 97 (8.2%). One tagged rabbit was negative when sampled in the winter and positive when re-caught in the summer. Shereet al.1998 E. coliO157 Researchers examined E. coli O157 content of the guts of necropsied wildlife on four Wisconsin dairy farms and sampled fresh dog feces as well. The samples weretaken over a 14 month longitudinal study period. A total of 89 samples was collected from the following animals on the farms: deer, opossum, wild turkey, mice,rats, raccoon, birds (sparrows, starlings, pigeons), and flies. A total of 99 bird fecalsamples were collected by cloacal swabs from pigeons, sparrows and starlings. Number of samples from each species not noted. One pigeon sample from a total of 99 bird samples (1%), and one fly trap was positive (authors state this as 5% of samples). In addition, one raccoon (Procyon lotor) sample was positive for E. coli O157. All other samples were negative. Sprosten et al.,2006 E. coliO157 Slugs were collected from sheep pasture where E. coli O157:H7 contamination from previous sheep grazing was known. A total of 474 slugs was collected, separated into 33 groups, and homogenized in a sterile blender. A slurry of the homogenized slugs was tested for E. coli O157:H7. One in 33 groups tested positive. Additional laboratory investigation demonstrated that slugs exposed to E. coliO157:H7 contaminated food source shed the pathogen in their feces.

Talleyet al.,2009 E. coliO157 Filth flies (flies that have a stage of development in animal feces) in the families Muscidae andCalliphoridae were captured in leafy green fields in the Central Coast of California. Eleven of 18 (61%) of the flies captured tested positive tested for E. coliO157:H7. A follow-up lab study demonstrated that house flies confined on manure or agar containing E. coli O157:H7 were able to transfer the bacteria to spinach plants. A marker used to trace presence of the E. colibacteria on spinach leaves on which flies had landed found 50-100% of the leaves contaminated. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org32SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Growers and food safety auditors regularly find evidence of animal incursion in row crops (e.g., crop damage, tracks, or fecal material). However, controlled studies examining the frequency of incursion into row crops by these animals, and detailed information about how behavior in the crop might impact contamination processes (e.g., contact of animal or animal feces with harvested portion of crop) is not available from the existing literature. Without a better understanding of the contamination process it is not possible to define risk from these incursions. Currently, the crop in areas around evidence of incursion is not harvested. The area designated for exclusion varies widely, however, and may even result in an entire field being removed from fresh produce production for an extended period of time (Schmit 2006). The foodborne illness outbreak investigations presented by Jay et al. (2007) and Cooley et al. (2007) explored whether feral pigs may be involved in processes of contamination. The text box below and Appendix K describe their work in detail. No other wildlife studies provide the level of detail regarding contamination sources and processes as Jayet al. and Cooley et al. for deer, amphibians, rodents, and birds - the wildlife identified by growers in the mail survey as sources of buyer of food safety professional concern. Pathogen prevalence in amphibians and reptiles in particular is not well represented in the literature. What is known does not clearly indicate what risk these animals pose to food safety. For example, studies conducted in laboratory settings using levels of imposed contamination far greater than are likely to occur in field settings must be interpreted with great caution. Laboratory settings may not reflect what is likely or possible in field conditions. In a study of wild caught amphibians and reptiles in natural settings, no human pathogens were detected (Richards et al., 2004). Reports of amphibians (typically frogs) found in fresh produce occur in the media (Sacks 2008), but to date no evidence indicate that these episodes represent a food safety risk.14 Detailed studies documenting risk from rodents are similarly limited. Extension specialists and growers confirmthat several local rodents including ground squirrels, mice, voles and rats are present as pests in fresh produce cropsCitation Findings/Comments Wallace et al.,1997 E. coliO157 Researchers isolated E. coli O157 from wild birds (mainly gulls). Freshly voided fecal samples were collected at two sites in England, one being a landfill waste site and the other an intertidal zone. Birds were primarily herring gulls, black-headed gulls, and common gulls, crows, and jackdaws. 400 samples were collected from each site over 4 visits. 2.9% of samples from the intertidal site and 0.9% from the urban landfill tested positive for E. coliO157:H7. No information about the extent to which these two samples represent different populations of birds is given. Distance between the sample sites is not given, nor is the food on which each groupof birds feeds mentioned. Age and conditions that might impact the survival of E. coliO157:H7 in fecal material are not noted. Wahlstrom et al.,2003 E. coliO157,Salmonella ,Campylobacter 791 samples were collected from Canada geese, roe deer, hares, moose, wild boar and seagulls in Sweden. Samples were collected from animals that had been hunted. E. coli O157 was not isolated from any of the samples. Salmonella species were isolated only from seagulls, of which 4% were estimated to be positive. Thermophilic Campylobacter species were commonly isolated from all the species except the deer.

While rodents are capable of carrying various strains of E. coli,Salmonella , and other infectious bacteria (Clark, 1994), the number of animals tested in field studies has been limited (Hancock et al., 1998; Cizek et al., 1999). In one study E. coliO157:H7 was isolated from Norwegian rats (Cizek et al. 1999). Ongoing research in the Central Coast region (see text box and Appendix K) is collecting information to help assess the prevalence of E. coliO157:H7 in local wildlife populations, including rodents. Compared to information regarding rodents and amphibians, a larger body of literature demonstrates that some birds may carry important pathogens, including several bird species occurring in the Central Coast region (e.g., Canada geese, European starling, seagulls). Authors of several published studies report samples that are often of unknownage at collection. When detected, prevalence varies widely but is typically very low (see Table 2). Many of the studies were done in settings in which birds fed in cattle yards or areas of concentrated human waste (e.g., dumps), which the authors note increases the incidence of contamination. In a study of wild birds in England, Hughes et al. (2009) determined that while the birds were unlikely to be a direct source of Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) they provide a potential reservoir of genetic variations that increase virulence of the pathogen. They note that the birds' capacity to serve as reservoirs of the bacteria, coupled with their ability to transport the bacteria long distances,means that wild birds have the potential to influence the spread and evolution of STEC. Aside from the 2006 E.colioutbreak traced to Central Coast spinach, research for this report identified two other investigations regarding pathogen outbreaks in fresh produce for which a subsequent investigation found the pathogen in animal fecal matter collected on the implicated farm. In a recent investigation of a campylobacteriosis outbreak linked to fresh peas in Alaska, the strain of the bacteria that made people ill was isolated from Sandhill crane feces found in the field from which the implicated produce was harvested (Gardner and McLaughlin 2008).Campylobacteriosis is caused by bacteria in the genus Campylobactor, and causes gastrointestinal symptoms that may be quite severe. In the Alaska outbreak, an estimated 99 people who ate the peas became ill from campylobacteriosis , five of whom were temporarily hospitalized (none died). The other investigation involved a Yersinia pseudotuberculosis outbreak in carrots in Finland. This pathogen causes illness accompanied by fever and severe abdominal pain that mimics appendicitis. The outbreak bacterium was isolated from a pooled sample of common shrew (Sorex araneus) intestines from one farm (Kangas et al. 2008). As with the 2006 E.coli O157:H7 outbreak in spinach in the Central Coast region, the process of contamination in the pea crop in Alaska and the carrot crop in Finland is not well described. Deer have received much discussion as hosts of pathogens, in particular of E. coli O157:H7. Some (but not all) studies have shown deer to contain pathogens (see Table 2). Additional discussion of pathogens in deer appears below, particularly when they share range land with cattle. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org34SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Risk from Cattle: Studies relevant to pathogen risk in wildlife note the prevalence of pathogens in domestic animals. Domestic ruminants are documented sources of E. coliO157:H7 (Pedersen and Clark, 2007). Studies demonstrating high pathogen prevalence in cattle typically examined prevalence in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) or large dairy production systems. Neither of these types of operations have a significant presence in the Central Coast region compared with ranch-based, cow-calf operations. That said, it is worthnoting that the specific E. colistrain that caused the 2006 spinach outbreak was found in pastured \"grass fed\" cattle on the ranch where the spinach was grown (California Food Emergency Response Team 2007; Jay et al., 2007). Most cattle in the region are pastured beef cattle. See Table 2 and Appendix I for citations and details regarding pathogen prevalence in cattle and local cattle production information. Cattle are by far the largest domestic animal presence in the region, however small numbers of sheep and goats are also present and may pose some risk. Although neither CAFO's nor dairy operations are a large component of Central Coast cattle operations, connections to large dairy operations and CAFO's outside the Central Coast region exist. These connections exist through use of composted manure products as soil amendments in row crops, and through the periodic rotation of stocker cattle from outside the area to Central Coast winter range land. No studies have examined direct links from these products or practices to crop contamination. Raw manure is not applied to fresh produce production areas, and compost manufacturers manage the composting conditions (temperature, moisture, aeration, duration) to effectively mitigate pathogen risks before finished product is sold. Strict processing guidelines (See Appendix I) ensure that pathogen contamination risk is minimized, but it may not be completely eliminated.InvestigationofContaminationProcesses Following the 2006 E. coliO157:H7 outbreak in bagged spinach, intense research focus centered on the area from which the product was harvested. The research was unique in its effort to detect evidence of the pathogen in a wide range of sources, not just a specific animal (in this case feral pigs), and in its effort to capture impor- tant information about how contamination processes involving wildlife and cattle may occur. The study sampled water, soil, and wild and domestic animal feces for E. coliO157:H7 (Jay et al. 2007). Combined with work by Cooley et al. (2007), which traced potential fate and transport of E. coli O157:H7 with a source tracking method in the same samples, the research provided the most comprehensive and relevant data avail- able to address the role of feral pigs in E. coliO157:H7 outbreaks in fresh produce. In both studies the authors conclude that feral pigs are among the potential sources or vectors of E. coli O157:H7, but that the process by which the produce was contaminated remains unclear. The influence of thehigh population density of feral pigs and proximity to cattle on prevalence of E. coliO157:H7 were identified as important areas that need further research. Jay and Wiscomb (2008) subsequently published a review of food safety risks and mitigation strategies for feral swine near agriculture fields that highlights the best known practices at this time. For additional information about this research see Appendix I. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org35SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Growers receive verification of composting methods with each shipment of composted material to document use of approved methods. Nonetheless, as noted above, growers report reduced use of compost and manure,15as well as reduced cattle rotation on cropland in response to food safety concerns. Because processes of contamination remain unclear, one cannot rule out the possibility that local cattle may be involved in pathogen contamination of fresh produce. Central Coast cattle often graze on lands near or adjacent to row crop production, typically on hillsides from which seasonal run-off may move to fresh produce productionareas. 16Both fresh produce growers and cattle managers acknowledge the risk inherent in this arrangement, and have developed management guidelines to minimize the risk of either waste materials, or water which has come in contact with waste materials, reaching produce fields or irrigation reservoirs. Appendix I contains an excerpt from a document produced by Central Coast Cattlemen describing a wide variety of management practices suggested tominimize contamination risk, including maintenance of adequate vegetative cover and strategies to direct cattlemovement away from crop production areas. The extent to which ranchers follow these guidelines is unknown at this point. Growers attempt to protect water sources and produce from animal intrusion or run off from range landby maintaining separation between rangeland and crops and water sources, by fencing, and by avoiding planting in areas that cannot be adequately protected. Risk from Deer Sharing Range Land with Cattle: Several studies have investigated pathogen prevalence in deer and cattle that share range land (Branham et al. 2005; Fischer et al. 2001; Sargeant et al. 1999). When researchers sample cattle and deer from the same area, infection rates in deer (when researchers document infection) are not ashigh as those found in cattle. None of the studies examining pathogens in deer and cattle sharing range land have been done in California. Pathogen movement between domestic and wild animals may depend on pathogen persistence in the shared environment, and other factors dependent upon local conditions. Thus, research to verify that similar results are found when research is repeated in a variety of locations, including the Central Coast producegrowing region, is essential. Ongoing research is addressing this information gap. At this point, an understandingof how pathogens may transfer from domestic to wild animals (or the reverse) is incomplete. Research Questions: Evidence exists that cattle, deer, wild pigs and some birds are capable of carrying pathogens and shedding them in waste products. A lack of sufficient information regarding the prevalence of pathogens in wild amphibians and rodents makes assessment of the risk presented by these animals impossible at this time. There is very limited data for other animals that may enter crop land, including dogs, coyotes, possums, raccoons, cats, bobcats, and rabbits, among others. Research conducted in the Central Coast region and guided by the following questions is essential to inform food safety guidelines: 1.What pathogens are found in each type of animal of organism? With what frequency? 2.Are wildlife species significant sources and/or vectors for important pathogens? 3.What types of animals live in the farm environment? Do they enter crop fields or remain in adjacent areas? 4.Do specific features, such as vegetation or water sources, encourage wildlife to enter ranches and farms? AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org36 15LGMA food safety standards does not allow the use of raw manure on fresh produce crops (Leafy Green Handler Marketing Board 2008). 16Runoff from rangeland is only likely if it is irrigated, or during seasons in which there is rainfall. The majority of the rain- fall in the region is received between October and April, yet pathogen contamination events are most frequent in the late summer and early fall. Movement of pathogens in runoff from rangeland may be significantly reduced when there is vegeta- tion present, as is typical in rangeland (Tate et al., 2006).SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION 5.Is it necessary for the animal to move into the crop field to contaminate produce, or is it possible to facilitate contamination without direct contact? For example, do pathogens from fecal materials or other contamination sources reach crop fields via water, wind, or attached to other materials or organisms? 6.How do animal species known to carry pathogens become infected (e.g., by eating cattle manure or drinking contaminated water)? Risks from Non-crop Vegetation: Two assumptions seem to underlie food safety concerns related to non-crop vegetation: first, that wildlife are attracted to these plantings; and second, that wildlife and their wastes in proximity to crops are a risk to food safety. Risk from wildlife is discussed above; the review below focuses on what is known about how non-crop vegetation attracts wildlife, and the extent to which wildlife moves from non-crop vegetation to crops. Expert opinion from wildlife biologists and conservation agency staff suggest that certain wildlife are attracted to habitats created by non-crop vegetation, and that others (such as feral pigs) are more mobile and less likely to be attracted to such areas. Jay and Wiscomb (2008) note that habitat removal is not likely to be an effective control strategy for feral swine, due to their mobility and large home range. Salmon (2008) notes that rodents naturally occur in range land and other vegetated areas, and that it is reasonable to assume they will at least occasionally enter crop production areas if they are nearby. Animals may move into or through crop land to reach food or water sources or wildlife movement corridors even if they do not feed on the crop. Earnshaw (2003) notes that some grass plants produce less seed than others, and therefore tend to attract fewer mice. Management parameters may also influence the extent to which animals are attracted to non-crop vegetation. For example, the NRCS and Monterey County RCD advise that mowing vegetation used in grassed waterways and filter of buffer strips may reduce wildlife presence by reducing cover provided by the vegetation.Aside from flies, 17insects have not been a focus of food safety research. Because much of the research on species attracted to non-crop vegetation has focused on insects as pollinators, pests, and the natural enemies of insect pests, these studies provide little insight into food safety concerns. Aside from sporadic anecdotal information, there is little or no information that describes the species attracted to various non-crop vegetation practices, nor about the movement of these species in crop fields. Research Questions: Information regarding wildlife use of non-crop vegetation is generally not from controlled or systematic studies. Rather, it is information shared informally among growers or conservation agency staff, and is occasionally included as observations in manuals intended to guide implementation and management of various non- crop vegetation systems. Evidence exists that wildlife species, including insects, differ in the extent to which they are attracted to or use non-crop vegetation. Collaborative efforts to combine information from expert experiences, combined with research efforts in the Central Coast region and guided by the following questions is essential to inform food safety guidelines: 1.What are the patterns of use and movement with wildlife species into and through non-crop vegetation adjacent to croplands. 2.To what extent potential vectors of pathogens? AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org37 17See Appendix H for additional information SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S 3.Would increased information about species' preference for vegetation allow management of non-crop areas to reduce the incidence of particular wildlife species of concern? 4.What additional farm management practices, like mowing of filter strips to reduce cover for rodents, might reduce preference for particular wildlife species? Risks from Water Bodies: The same two assumptions regarding the food safety risk posed by non-crop vegetation also underlie concerns relevant to water bodies in the production area - namely that these areas may attract wildlife and that wildlife and their wastes pose a risk. The latter is discussed above. As noted above, cattle may be important pathogen sources; however, these animals' access to water bodies in production areas is typically controlled by intentional placement of water supplies and fencing. Use of cattle, goats or sheep to graze crop residue on harvested crop land, a valuable nutrient cycling strategy, is no longer commonly practiced in fresh produce production areas. To the extent that domestic animals are in close proximity to crops or irrigation water sources (e.g., via a broken fence), domestic animals' movement around water bodies near crop areas is also of interest. In areas where water is scarce, which is the case for much of the dry season (approximately May through November in the Central Coast region), animals may seek water sources in farming areas. Fencing around water bodies that are intended for irrigation use is common to exclude animals both for practical and food safety risk concerns. In water systems that are more extensive and may be more difficult to fence (e.g., natural water features or a large constructedwetland) it is more likely that a variety of animals will be attracted. Amphibians, birds, and rodents may be among the more challenging to exclude because of the larger numbers of these animals, and the ease with which they may pass a barrier fence. As noted above, how, or if, these animals may contribute to processes of contamination is poorly understood. Currently, there are no known studies demonstrating that wild amphibians pose a food safety risk. California red-legged frogs ( Rana Ambystoma californiense ) - federally protected species for which the Central Coast contains critical recovery habitat - rely upon ponds in range land areas (Symonds 2008). Since both red-legged frogs and tiger salamanders are thought to disperse 2-3 km fromtheir natal ponds, movement into farm ponds near range land is a reasonable assumption. Red-legged frogs are more likely to be found in areas in which suitable terrestrial habitat occurs within 100 meters of a frog-occupied water source (Bulger et al., 2003). Red-legged frogs have been documented in and near row crop areas in the Central Coast region (Bulger et al., 2003; Seymour and Westphal, 2000; Westphal and Seymour, 1998) and also have been known to migrate across agricultural land (Bulger et al., 2003). Wildlife is likely to be attracted to water sources wherever they occur in the landscape. Field surveys find that non- native bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeiana ), as well as the native Pacific regilla ) and western toads (Anaxyrus boreas halophilus ), are commonly found in or near on-farm water bodies. In a survey of an irrigation reservoir in San Mateo County western yellow-bellied racer newt (Taricha granulosa ) were all found (Swaim Biological, Inc. 2007). The presence of both adult red-legged frogs and metamorphs (young frogs recently developed from tadpoles) in and around irrigation reservoirs in San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Monterey County suggests that these water bodies are important habitat for red-legged frogs in the region (Bulger et al., 2003; al., Biological, Inc.; Westphal and Seymour, 1998; Seymour et al., 2007). The importance of farm water sources as wildlife habitat has increased as natural wetlands have declined (Noss et al. 2001). A number of state and federal programs encourage enhancement of on-farm water bodies for wildlife habitat (Wolinsky, 2005). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org38SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN sensitive western pond turtle ) are rarely found in on-farm ponds, though many local and migrating species of birds have been observed in on-farm water bodies (Rich Seymour, personal communication). Research Questions: As with non-crop vegetation, information regarding wildlife use of water bodies is generally not from controlled or systematic study. Evidence exists that wildlife species, particularly in the dry summer and fall months, use water bodies in or adjacent to crop production areas. Collaborative efforts to combine information from experts' observations, combined with research efforts in the Central Coast region and guided by the following questions are essential to inform food safety guidelines: 1.Which animals are attracted to water? 2.What strategies are useful to exclude wildlife if they are a food safety risk? 3.Is it possible to selectively exclude wildlife so that species that do not present food safety risk may still access water supplies? Summary of Risk Evaluation: Growers report being told that wildlife, domesticated animals, non-crop vegetation and water bodies present food safety risks in their crop production areas. However, sufficient information to fully define and effectively manage these risks is lacking. For example, the majority of the available literature regardingpathogen presence in wildlife was conducted outside of California, and before the development of improved detection methodologies. As noted, pathogen movement and persistence, and other factors dependent upon local conditions,may vary by geographical region. Thus, caution is required when applying results of research from outside theregion to local settings. Some studies have demonstrated pathogen presence or vectoring potential in diverse wildlife species, generally at low frequencies. Three investigations following illness outbreaks have found the same pathogens that made people sick in samples of feces (cattle, feral pigs, cranes), intestinal samples (shrews), and water collected near fields where the implicated produce was grown. No investigations have linked frogs collected near fields to outbreaks of food- borne illness. While studies with cattle in confined animal operations have found high levels of pathogens, such operations are not typically found on the Central Coast. The existing body of research contains little information about the potential for (or relative importance of) direct contamination (e.g., contaminated feces coming into contact with fresh produce), or indirect contamination of the growing environment (e.g., contamination of water, soil, dust, or bioaerosols) by domesticated animals and wildlife. The current level of understanding is not sufficient to fully predict risk posed by various contamination sources and processes. Much of the research to date has helped answer the question, what canhappen with regard to pathogens in wildlife and domestic animals? Focus has largely centered on the fact that some species of wildlife cancarry pathogens, and that they enter crop fields. To fully assess the risks posed by these animals it is necessary to answer the questions: what doeshappen, how much risk does it pose, and what can be done to minimize risk? It is beyond the scope of this report to consider all the factors likely to contribute to contamination processes. Because wildlife featured prominently in investigations of a high profile outbreak linked to fresh produce from the Central Coast region, and because growers report taking actions to reduce wildlife for food safety reasons, this report focuses on wildlife and food safety risks. Several other potential sources of farm-based contamination exist, including domesticated animals, water, soil amendments, and workers (see LGMA 2008), all of which are subjects of ongoing research and extensive farm-based food safety practices that lie beyond the scope of this report. Persistence of AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org39SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION pathogens in the environment (in soil and water and on crops), mechanisms of transfer from waste material or contaminated water to crops, and the role of soil management and environmental factors in pathogen survival are among other important variables that also influence contamination processes. Several overviews of this topic are available and the reader is encouraged to consult these (e.g., , Brandl 2006, Doyle and Erickson 2008, Harris et al. 2006, Suslow 2003). C. What Evidence Demonstrates Impact of Management Practices? As described above, growers report several on-farm management strategies adopted in response to food safetyconcerns. These responses can be characterized as follows: Deter or eliminate wildlife; Reduce non-crop vegetation (either by removal or by reduced use); Reduced construction, discontinued use, or removal of non-natural water bodies; Destruction of natural water bodies by draining or filling. It is important to note that the RCD survey results only partially quantify the changes in management practices usedto address food safety concerns. Survey data do not provide specific details of changes to management practices. For example growers report use of bare ground buffers, but details of placement and what the bare ground buffer replaced are not known. Fully evaluating impacts of management practice changes would require defining detailsof implementation in the field, which is beyond the scope of this report. The following, therefore, summarizes whatis known about how changes in management practices to achieve improved food safety can impact ecological health,and also the likelyimpact of the changes on both ecological health and food safety. Deter or eliminate wildlife: Actions or specific practices reported by growers that are taken to reduce movement of wild animals near fresh produce production areas include fencing, installing baregroundbuffers, trapping, use of poison bait, use of copper sulfate, and hunting and shooting. Fencing : Foraging (for both food and water), mating behavior, seasonal movement or migrations, and shelter needs are all important factors in how wild animal populations can be sustained within a landscape. Fences may interferewith animals' ability to access important resources. Atwill (2008) reports that much of the riparian corridor alongthe Salinas River is now fenced, and that the remaining gaps in fencing have high concentrations of wildlife transiting them. In the case of fencing along riparian corridors, escape from flood waters may also be problematic (Paige, 2008). Neither of the two grower surveys (2007 & 2009) provides specific information about precisely where fencing is erected, how extensive its use is, and the extent to which fences disrupt typical animal movement. Fencing designs range from four-foot-tall black fabric fencing with soil used to seal the lower boundary to chain link fences of heights up to 10 feet, and include a number of other options. Some animals are notoriously difficult to deter (e.g., feral pigs) as they are able to destroy fences or dig around or under them. Jay et al.(2007) found that wild pigs could pass under a fence due to erosion and rooting (animal digging). Red-legged frogs have also been found able to climb over frog barriers, though not consistently (Rathbun et al., 1997) It is broadly accepted in the field of ecology that isolated remnants of habitat suffer predictable, cumulative losses of species (Soul\u00e9, 2001). In the California context, habitat fragmentation was described in a California-wide analysis of wildlife corridors and landscape connectivity (Penrod et al., 2001). The report describes over 20 threats to animal movement and habitat connectivity; the top three being urbanization, roads and agriculture. Based on this report, AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org40SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION the impact of additional fencing around and on agricultural lands is practically certain to further reduce connectivity among remaining natural areas and adversely affect local wildlife. Bare ground buffers : Installing bare ground buffers serves two purposes. First, they allow inspectors and growers to see tracks or other evidence of animal incursion into crop fields. Second, they are assumed to reduce animal movement by providing a vulnerable area that small animals are less likely to cross (e.g., no vegetation cover in which to hide from predators). Creating open ground may decrease movement of some but not all rodent pests (Salmon 2008). The width required for bare ground buffers to be effective in discouraging movement of rodent pests into crop fields is unknown (Clarke, 1995). The impact of these buffers depends upon how much area is affected, the species likely to move in those areas, and whether or not creation of the buffer entails removing non-crop vegetation, all of which are site specific. For all these reasons, it is not possible to describe the effect of these buffers on wildlife at this time. Trapping and Use of Poisoned Bait : Trapping and poison bait use are practices aimed at defining rodent populations (trapping) and reducing them (trapping and use of poison bait). Growers have long used poisons to control rodent populations as a standard management practice unrelated to food safety concerns (Salmon, 2008). The University of California and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation both maintain statewide pesticide usage statistics that document widespread and long-term use of specific pesticides in Central Coast counties, including a widevariety of anticoagulants. 18Documented anticoagulant use in the study area includes \"first-generation\" rodenticides (warfarin, chlorophacinone, diphacinone) difenacoum, and difethialone). Rodenticides are generally placed in T-shaped PVC pipes in an attempt to minimize consumption by non-target animals, however there is little clear knowledge about which rodent species take the poison (Salmon 2008). The 2007 grower survey found that poison baits were the most commonly adopted wildlife mitigation measure (RCD 2007). As noted in Salmon (2008) and documented during field visits conducted during research for this report, it is common to see leafy-green field borders lined with PVC bait stations most likely containing first-generation anticoagulant materials. As the marketing director for a major lettuce buyer noted, \"Some processors are requiring trapping stations [bait stations] every 50 feet for rodents\" (Salmon 2008).19 A concern investigated during research for this report was that increased poison bait use in response to food safetyconcerns may decrease mice, vole, and other rodent populations so dramatically that raptors and other predators could face a reduced food supply. A California Department of Fish and Game biologist interviewed for this report commented that starvation risk to raptors is small given their low population densities on the Central Coast region, and their ability to migrate to areas with more abundant prey. However, other concerns remain. After more than a decade of research and an intensive public comment process, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently concluded that anticoagulant rodenticides pose a significant risk to both human health and the environment (U.S. EPA 2008a). With respect to wildlife, EPA notes: AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org41 18For University of California data, see http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PUSE/puse1.html. For Department of Pesti- cide Regulation data, see: http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/purmain.htm 19Rodenticide use may be less widespread than the abundance of visible T-shaped stations suggests. Growers report that food safety inspectors are now requesting less use of these poisons because they increase risk of dead or poisoned animals in crops.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION \"EPA's comparative ecological risk assessment concludes that each of the rodenticide active ingredients poses significant risks to non-target wildlife when applied as grain-based bait products. The risks to wildlife are from primary exposure (direct consumption of rodenticide bait) for all compounds and secondary exposure (consumption of prey by predators or scavengers with rodenticide stored in bodytissues) from the anticoagulants.\" (US EPA 2008a, p.7) Drawing mostly from New York and California data, U.S. EPA has documented more than 500 incidents nationwide of dead mammals and birds testing positive for anticoagulants in liver tissue, representing 44 species (U.S. EPA 2006).Anticoagulant incidents are based on detection of residues in liver tissue and corroborating evidence from carcass necropsy. Although tissue analysis showed that second generation anticoagulants were present in most cases, numerous mortality incidents also occurred where the dead animal only contained first generationanticoagulants . According to U.S. EPA (2006), avian species in this category included hawks, owls, turkeys, falcons, and a bald eagle. Mammalian species included coyotes, bobcats, mountain lions, raccoons, deer, squirrels, badgers,and the federally endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox. Within California, 71% of liver samples from 35 dead mountain lions contained at least one anticoagulant rodenticide. Eighty-four percent (84%) of 32 dead San Joaquin kit foxes also tested positive, as did 79% of 39 dead bobcats (U.S. EPA 2006). The adverse impacts of anti-coagulants on non-target species and through bioaccumulation are well documented, and are reasonably assumed risks related to use of these poisons. Pesticide use statistics provide some insight, but the magnitude of the impact of poisoned bait on non-target species remains poorly defined. Use of Copper Sulfate : Use of the algaecide copper sulfate to maintain irrigation reservoirs (engineered water bodies, specifically managed for irrigation use) clear of algae so that irrigation equipment is not damaged or disabledis a widespread and accepted agricultural practice in the Central Coast region 20.Copper sulfate is labeled for use to minimize growth of algae and aquatic weeds in ponds, and for use in flooded rice fields to control freshwater snails, leeches, and tadpole shrimp. Irrigation reservoirs are not intended for use as habitat, and are not typicallymaintained to encourage wildlife presence; thus, in theory at least, fewer animals are likely to be present or affected.Nonetheless, as discussed above, field surveys document that many animals do use these water bodies. A small number of survey respondents report use of this material to reduce frog and fish populations in irrigationreservoirs, and to control frogs in other water bodies. Several growers interviewed for this project specificallyexplained that they have increased coppersulfate use to reduce frog populations in response to food safety concerns expressed by auditors or others. Copper toxicity in fish and aquatic invertebrates is caused by interference with the ability of gills to function properly (U.S. EPA, 2008b). A recent study by Garcia-Munoz et al. (2009) found toad tadpoles exposed to copper sulfate showed reduced growth and decreased escape behavior, both of which may reduce survival. Chen et al. (2007) found similar results in leopard frog tadpoles exposed to copper sulfate. Copper in sediments may have adverse impacts on midge larva (Servia et al. 2006), suggesting that cumulative effects of copper sulfate application may be of importance for some species. The above studies were done in laboratory conditions, and indicate the need to investigate the effects of copper sulfate in field conditions. Coppersulfate tends to rapidly immobilize in sediments, probably in association with organic fractions (van Hullebusch et al., 2003), and behavior in a natural system may be quite different from that of laboratory observation. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org42 20Increased use of irrigation systems that are easily disabled by algae (e.g., drip irrigation) may lead to increased use of this material in the region.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION The federally protected California red-legged frogs and California tiger salamanders each have a life stage as gill- breathing organisms. The above research strongly suggests that impact of copper sulfate on these populations is possible when exposure occurs. As noted above, it is likely these species use farm ponds at least in some settings. More information is needed to assess the impact of coppersulfate on wildlife in field settings with typical copper sulfate application rates. Hunting and Shooting : Growers report hunting and shooting of wildlife to reduce animals perceived to pose a food safety risk. Feral pigs and deer are both large game legally hunted in California and among the animals targeted by food safety-related hunting. Boxall (2009) notes that following the 2006 E. coliO157:H7 outbreak, an increase in requests for state depredation permits occurred, which allow farmers to shoot some wildlife species that damage their crops. Waithman et al. (1999) report that feral pig populations can withstand an annual combined mortality rate (death by all causes) of 70% without affecting existing populations. It should be noted that feral pigs are non-native species, and as such the relative merits of concerns of hunting them should consider their impact not just on agriculture and food safety risk, but also on broader ecosystem balance (Kreith, 2007). Deer are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game to maintain populations for both ecological balance and big game hunting. Historically their populations have fluctuated, largely in response to available habitat (DFG, 2009). The impact ofincreased hunting by growers with depredation permits is not documented. Species other than deer or feral pigs may be targeted by growers concerned about wildlife presence, but there is little information to document such hunting. Determining whether hunting occurs, and the extent of it, would be necessary to fully understand the impact of hunting on wildlife populations. Reducenon-cropvegetation: Actions reported by growers that reflect reduced use of non-crop vegetation include creation of baregroundbuffers , removal of vegetation intended to reduce run off and erosion, removal of vegetation from farm ponds and ditches, removal of trees and shrubs, and removal of wetland or riparian vegetation. A comprehensive discussion of all research relevant to the use of non-crop vegetation in on-farm management strategiesis beyond the scope of this report. Appendix J provides background information to document the benefits of non-crop vegetation to soil and water quality and protection, as well as to support sustainable farming practices, such as integrated pest management. Research relevant to the effectiveness of non-crop vegetation as a conservation management strategy in irrigated row crops in Central Coast region settings is included below. BareGroundBuffers or Removal of Vegetation Intended to Reduce Run Off and Erosion : Soil without vegetative cover is susceptible to increased erosion by wind and water, and also tends to develop poor surface structure, thereby decreasing water infiltration and increasing surface run off. The impact of bare ground on soil and water quality depends in large measure on topography and the land use it replaces (e.g., vegetated buffers or waterways, hedgerows or field margin plantings, crop acreage, riparian vegetation). By slowing surface water movement and capturing suspended soil and debris, vegetated buffers may retain and break down pollutants, decrease erosion, increase soil deposition, increase nutrient uptake by plants, and increase microbial activity. Vegetated buffer zones have been found to effectively remove some pesticides from surface run off. Vegetated buffers and filter strips have also been shown to reduce the transfer of pathogenic bacteria in surface water. See Appendix J for citations and details of relevant studies to support these statements. This ability may be particularly important in the Central Coast region between range land and crop land. Pathogen movement by overland flow from range lands may be reduced when perennial forage and/or grasses act as a barrier to reduce movement of manure and water downslope (Tate et al. 2006). In rangeland systems, manure deposition is typically AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org43SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION spread across a wide area, and water flow is typically not concentrated. The benefits relate to both mechanical trapping of manure, and increased infiltration of water as it moves across the landscape. To assess the impact of bare ground buffers and un-vegetated areas on both food safety and ecological health, it is essential to know how extensively they are used, and where they are placed in the landscape (e.g., upslope from cropland to protect from adjacent land use run-off or downslope from cropland to filter irrigation run-off). Of particular importance is information regarding proximity to sensitive areas (e.g., water bodies or crops), and whether vegetation exists between sensitive areas and baregroundbuffers . Slope, volume and concentration of run-off, and soil type and structure are also important factors. Other management practices may be available to mitigate the water quality impact of bare ground buffers downslope from cropland. Increased use of drip irrigation, as well as other irrigation management practices that reduce water use and/or irrigation water runoff21, decreases the volume of water moving across or off of cropland. Vegetated systems downslope of the field may then be effective in reducing movement of pollutants and contaminants. Drip irrigation may also help minimize pathogen contamination risk. Soloman et al. (2002) found greater numbers of plants tested positive for E. coli O157:H7 when irrigated by sprinkler irrigation than when irrigated by drip irrigation. Fertigation (application of fertilizer through the irrigation system) in drip irrigation systems reduces nutrient loads in run off or tail water as nutrients are more precisely placed to reduce application rates. Applications of materials still being developed may decrease soil loss by holding fine soil particles together in larger aggregates (e.g., PAM) or reduce organophosphate pesticide contamination of tail water with an enzymatic treatment that helps break down organophosphate pesticides (e.g., Landguard\u00ae). In places where range land abuts crop land, and where bare ground allows increased flow of upland run off to reach crops or irrigation water sources, bare groundbuffers have the potential to reduce not just ecological health, but food safety as well. Because bare ground buffers do not capture debris that may carry contaminants, nor facilitate infiltration of surface runoff as effectively as vegetated buffers, movement of pathogens through them is more likely. Removing vegetation from farm ponds and ditches : Intentionally vegetated ponds - also called Vegetated Treatment Systems (VTS) - are constructed to hold or convey runoff and/or tail water and to facilitate contaminant retention, sorption, and breakdown. Vegetated treatment systems may reduce runoff, sediment delivery, and nutrient (nitrogenand phosphorus) and pesticide content of discharge water. Vegetation within waterways can also reduce the presence of water borne pathogens. Appendix J provides detailed information and citations to support these statements. Effective vegetated ditches (also called Grassed Waterways) are constructed to convey run-off without causing channel erosion and thereby prevent additional sediment from being transported downstream to waterways. To reduce nutrient or pesticide content effectively, the vegetated ditch must be installed with a broad flat bottom, with minimal slope and limited runoff volume. Huntet al. (2007, 2008) measured the effectiveness of two vegetated pond systems in reducing concentrations of both pesticides and nutrients. Both ponds were originally constructed to retain sediment and had been maintained since with vegetation established to help increase denitrification (a process by which excess nitrogen in water is reduced) and microbial populations (to facilitate pesticide breakdown), and to slow flow through rates (to increase sedimentation). Both water and sediment concentrations of pesticides were lower at the outlets of both VTS than at the inlet, demonstrating the ability of both systems to effectively reduce pesticide loads from farm runoff. Turbidity AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org44 21An alternative irrigation strategy that reduces run-off from overhead sprinklers is to use \"hand-move\" lines so that the field is irrigated in several sets. Compared to solid-set sprinklers, where fields are irrigated in a single set, the overall applica- tion rate of hand-move sprinklers is SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION (a measure of sediment load) and nutrient levels were consistently lower at the outlet of one VTS, but not the other. The effectiveness of the VTS to retain pesticides carried in farm run off appears to vary, and is dependent upon the manner in which individual pesticides interact with sediment as they are retained, residence time, effective contact with vegetation and other factors in each VTS. Anderson et al. (2008) built upon the work of Hunt et al. (2007, 2008) and demonstrated that a vegetated ditch system was effective at reducing pesticide concentrations, especially when used in conjunction with Landguard\u00ae treatment. While some pesticides (organochlorines and pyrethroids) showed declines after treatment in thesedimentation and vegetated sections of the ditch, diazinon (an organophosphate) was not sufficiently removedduring the VTS residence times observed in the study. Landguard \u00aewas able to effectively remove diazinon. In addition to uncertainty regarding the ability of VTS to handle the volume of water and contaminants typically discharged from irrigated row crops (particularly those without tile drainage22), difficulty in maintaining these practices may reduce their effectiveness. Local soils vary in texture and structure, with some being more challenging for establishment of effective VTS than others. Visits to farms in the area revealed an instance where water flowed around the vegetation in a VTS, making little contact with it. In such cases, the effectiveness of the system is compromised. Growers and UC Cooperative Extension personnel recount difficulty in maintaining VTS in optimum conditions, and effectiveness of VTS undergoes continuous assessment by growers, extension personnel and research scientists. Given the persistent problems with excess nutrients, sediment and pesticides in agricultural runoff in the region, suites of conservation practices used in tandem are appropriate. While VTS may not be universally or solely effective, both the extensive body of literature and local research suggest they are an important component of water qualityFactorsthatinfluencepracticeeffectiveness: Thecaseofvegetation Research conducted in irrigated row crops in the Central Coast region suggests that the effectiveness of VTS and vegetated ditches can vary based on site specific characteristics, and the design and maintenance of the practice. The value of vegetation as described above is best demonstrated in systems receiving low volume of water with low levels of pollutants and contaminants, such as water flowing off of range land (e.g., Tate et al. 2006). The impact is less evident in typical narrow V-shaped ditches and treatment ponds receiving high volumes of water with high levels of pollutants and contaminants. Cahn et al. (2009) found that VTS and vege- tated ditches were not consistently capable of reducing the concentration of suspended sediments and nutrientsin water, nor coliform and E. coli bacteria, in the run off from research trials in irrigated vegetable crops in the Central Coast region. Supporting practices, appropriate design, residence time (the amount of time water remains in the VTS), contaminant load, turbidity (amount of suspended solids), and contact with vegetation all influence the effectiveness of VTS. Overall, the research provides a reminder that efficacy of conservation practices varies widely. The impact of removing them is dependent upon how effectively they were installed and managed. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org45 22Tiled drainage systems are generally installed in soils with poor drainage. Without installation of such drainage, fields are prone to waterlogging. Less water tends to be discharged from such systems, and any water discharged has already passed through the soil, a potent filtration system that significantly reduces sediment and pesticide loads, though not necessarily nutrients.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION management. Since their level of effectiveness varies based on site-specific characteristics, proper design and maintenance, it is difficult to know precisely how reduced use of these systems may impact water quality. However, where they have been found to be effective at reducing pollutant transport downstream, their loss is practically certain to reverse water quality gains at the farm level. Removing trees and shrubs: Trees and shrubs in the agricultural landscape may be present as hedgerows, windbreaks, wood lots, field border plantings, and stands of native vegetation, especially along streams or rivers. According to USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service standards (NRCS 2002), hedgerows may serve as living fences, provide food and habitat for wildlife, create barriers for pesticide drift, dust and odors, and improve the landscape appearance. These plantings may provide habitat for predator and pollinator insect populations (Denys and Tscharntke Kremen et al. 2002, Pickett and Bugg 1998), and reduce pest populations and displace noxious weeds (Ehler et al.2002, Long and Pease 2005).23 Landscape connectivity is required to maintain wildlife populations that are well balanced in both numbers and composition (e.g. predators and prey) (Soul\u00e9, 2001). Corridors of vegetation connecting areas of habitat can provide critical connectivity and serve as \"stepping stone reserves\" for insects, pollinators, seed dispersers, bats, birds, and other species (Penrod et al. 2001; Rosenberg and Noon 1997). Use of tree patches has been demonstrated to be important for red-legged frog populations, which move away from water sources in the non-breeding season (Chan- McCleod and Moy, 2007). Vegetation loss plays a role in landscape-level habitat fragmentation, which persists as the most widespread and pernicious threat to wildlife worldwide (e.g., Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005, Groom et al. 2006). In a conference in which participants identified 20 key wildlife corridors, gaps in habitat cover is listed as a primary barrier to animal movement in 35% of the corridors identified in the Central Coast region (Penrod et al., 2001). Hedgerows and other stands of trees or shrubs can have a beneficial effect of reducing wind velocities in their vicinity.Dispersal of pathogens with dust has been documented (Chang et al., 2001, Lee et al., 2006, Whyte et al. 2001). If a pathogen capable of dispersal by dust and wind is present near a crop field, the removal of hedgerows or other vegetation that reduce dust on crops may compromise not only crop quality, but also food safety. At this time there is little information to verify dispersal of pathogens by dust locally, or to define the extent to which hedgerowsprovide their intended services to both wildlife and crops. Removing wetland or riparian vegetation : Riparian vegetation provides terrestrial habitat, aquatic habitat, stream bank stability, shade, and large woody debris. Vegetative debris in waterways may increase retention of sediment moving in them, thereby improving water quality downstream and contributing to healthy watershed functions.The vegetation provides ecological services that support local wildlife populations dependent upon intact vegetation around water sources for habitat and food (Kocher and Harris 2007). Long, intact riparian corridors can provide regionally important wildlife movement corridors for both aquatic and terrestrial animals (Penrod et al., 2001). The unique qualities of riparian zones may make them habitat for a particularly diverse population of wildlife (Naiman et al. 1993). Local research in a restored riparian zone AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org46 23It should be noted that reasons other than food safety concerns may discourage growers from using some non-crop vegeta- tion. For example, an economically significant pest that vectors a viral disease in lettuce is associated with the landscaping plant alyssum (often inter-planted with organic lettuce to attract beneficial insects) and ice plant (commonly planted for erosion control) (Bryant, 2008). Koike et al. (2009) documented that thrips on alyssum plants were carrying a virus that causesImpatiens necrotic spot virus (INVS) in lettuce. Growers interviewed in the course of researching this report also noted concerns about dispersal of weed seeds from unmanaged non-crop vegetation (e.g., vegetation that grows in drainage ditches without intentional planting).SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION demonstrated that many local species use riparian corridors, and that restoring damaged or cleared riparian vegetation to support wildlife is challenging and expensive, and requires close attention to original features to ensure that appropriate habitat characteristics are restored (Queheillalt and Morrison 2006). Maintenance of wide, well-vegetated riparian zones appears to be very important for large predators, such as the mountain lion. Hilty and Merenlender (2004) found that mountain lions were 11 times more likely to be found in riparian zones than in surrounding vineyards. Riparian habitat was listed as a key feature in 65% of the wildlife corridors Penrod et al. (2001) identify in the Central Coast region. Local river systems and their riparian boundaries, including the Salinas River, Santa Ynez River, Uvas Creek, Llagas Creek and San Antonio Creek, were all specifically mentioned as linkage features in the corridors (Penrod et al., 2001). The riparian corridors along these rivers and streams provide important habitat connectivity for large and small mammals, southern steelhead and neotropical migratory birds (Penrod et al. 2001). Increased canopy cover in riparian zones may prevent water temperatures from rising during warm seasons, thereby improving survival of some aquatic species (Kocher and Harris, 2007). Many creeks and rivers within the Central Coast region, including the Salinas River, are designated as Critical Habitat for the steelhead, which is federally listed as Threatened (NMFS 2005). Adequate water quality, including cool water temperatures, are necessary forsteelhead to persist in areas of spawning and rearing habitat. During the summer, the cover and shading providedby riparian vegetation is essential to keeping water temperatures cool enough for the species (David Boughton,Research Ecologist, NOAA, personal communication). High water temperatures and poor water quality adverselyaffect steelhead both by direct effects and by changing competition factors with more tolerant species (Moyle andWilliams 1990). Riparian vegetation is also critical in steelhead management as it provides large debris in the waterways, which creates changes in stream flow that facilitate abundance of food sources upon which steelhead rely (Thompson et al. 2006). Also, insects falling off of riparian vegetation into the water are an important source of food for steelhead (Rundio and Lindley 2008). Aquatic macroinvertebrate populations tend to be greater in and nearriparian zones with vegetation. The explanation for this finding is not yet clear, but suggests that riparian vegetation may be important to ecological balance of aquatic life in ways that are not yet fully understood (Anderson et al. 2003). The discussion at the end of Part II explains the impact of food safety related changes on the ability to use recently flooded land. Removal of riparian vegetation is practically certain to increase the amount of sediment that enters waterways and moves downstream, potentially carrying pollutants (e.g., pesticides) that adhere to sediment and have adverse impacts on steelhead trout and wildlife near riparian zones.Reducedconstructionanddiscontinueduseorremovalofengineeredwaterbodies : Engineered water bodies specifically mentioned in the survey include ditches and farm ponds, which may include irrigation reservoirs, irrigation runoff recovery ponds, and sediment basins. These are management tools that growers use to receive, capture or store excess water, capture sediment or convey water safely across a property. Their decision to discontinue use of such strategies should be viewed as loss of the erosion control or other resource management benefits they provide, not destruction of natural habitat. Nonetheless, these systems are noted to have critical ecological value for some wildlife. In many regions, financial resources and technical support have been offered to growers as an incentiveto manage these water sources to support wildlife (Wolinsky, 2005). As noted above, the threatened California red-legged frog may be found in Central Coast region irrigation reservoirs (Swaim Biological, Inc., 2007). Information documenting use of these water sources by wildlife is not extensive, but as noted above, the surveys that have been published list several species of snakes, frogs, salamanders and birds that have been observed in farm ponds, particularly where there is suitable terrestrial habitat nearby. The impact of AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org47SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION removing these water bodies is dependent upon factors such as their proximity to suitable terrestrial habitat, other water bodies, and how they are managed (e.g., Does water level fluctuate? Are they seasonally drained? Are they treated with copper sulfate? Does the water or sediment contain high levels of contaminants?) Sediment detention basins (also called sediment ponds or settling ponds) hold storm water and tail water, allowing sedimentation (soil to drop out of water and settle to the bottom) before water is discharged, thus preventing sediment from entering nearby water bodies. They may also reduce flooding risk by managing surges in runoff (NRCS 2008). Sediment basins are well established management practices in many farm environments. Although they do not completely address water quality concerns, they are widely accepted as at least partially effective as a component of a suite of practices to reduce nutrient, sediment and contaminant loads in water. As noted above in Huntet al. (2007, 2008) and Anderson et al. (2008), some pesticides are removed with sediments as they settle out. Even if these management practices do not completely address sediment reduction goals, they may provide important improvements in water quality relevant for local wildlife. For example, Wood et al. (2009) found that western toad tadpoles could tolerate turbidity at low levels but not higher levels, such as those of untreated agricultural discharge. Another key function of sediment detention basins is to capture eroded soil from cropland and prevent it from being transported downstream where it will accumulate in lower gradient channels and waterways. Sediment basins, therefore, play a critical role in reducing flooding frequency by detaining runoff and keeping local drainages open during winter storm events. If food safety requirements result in the abandonment of sediment basins, thendownstream farm flooding will increase unless channel dredging is increased. This, in turn, would reduce growers' ability to use flood-prone acres, since flooded land is considered a food safety risk. To the extent that engineered water bodies used to support water quality improvement (e.g., settling ponds, use of VTS to reduce sediment, nutrient, pesticide and pathogen loads prior to discharge) are abandoned, it is practically certain that unless other management practices are substituted to address loss of VTS services, water quality at the farm level will be adversely affected. Volume of sediments and certain pesticides entering waterways are particularly likely to increase. This impact will likely be more pronounced in areas without tiled drainage systems. Destruction of natural water body by draining or filling: Removal of water sources in a region characterizedby a long dry season is likely to adversely affect local and migratory wildlife populations. It will certainly adversely affect any animals living in the water source, such as fish or amphibians depending upon it for a stage of the lifecycle. If natural water bodies are habitat for endangered or protected species, their destruction may be deemed unlawful (Symonds 2008). Both locally and nationally, many endangered plant and animal species depend on increasingly fragmented wetlands. These areas often support concentrated populations of sensitive species, in part because so much original wetland area has been converted to other land use (Noss et al., 2001). Wetlands also provide many of the services described above for VTS, as they are essentially natural VTS, though natural wetlands may become less effective over time if channels form that allow water to flow through them more rapidly with less contact with vegetation (Knox et al. 2008). Locally, Dayton et al. (2006) demonstrated that nitrate concentrations in a natural wetland were greatest where farm runoff entered the wetland, and decreased as the water flowed through the wetland. Knox et al. (2008) demonstrated that wetlands may be capable of retaining pathogens, but that these same pathogens may be released later if a scouring flow passes through the wetland. Wetlands may also mitigate flood effects by temporarily holding water during flood peaks, and subsequently allowing drainage downstream or to groundwater drainage (Potter 1994). Removal of natural water bodies is practically certain to have adverse impacts on wildlife and water quality. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org48SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Summary of Environmental Impacts: The degree to which on-farm management strategies adopted in response to food safety concerns may have generated adverse impacts on ecological health is not known at this time. The impact of shifting management strategies is not well defined because there is not quantitative data to describe the extent to which grower reported actions occur in the landscape. Acreage affected, number of water bodies filled, type of vegetation removed, and many other details are necessary to determine actual impact. The intent of this review is to provide background information to describe the operation and potential impacts of these strategies in CentralCoast irrigated row crop systems. The discontinued use of appropriately placed, and properly designed and maintained vegetated practices may also reduce the potential for other interdependent practices to protect water quality at a particular site. A combination of numerous strategies, including use of materials for treatment of field or tailwater, improved irrigation and nutrient management technologies, and continued adaptation of conservation practices for local conditions, providesinnovative ways to address long standing water quality problems. If vegetation is lost from some farms as acomponent of these strategies, greater reliance on the other components will be required. Adverse impacts on amphibians from both direct attempts to eliminate them, and indirect impacts of removal of water sources, are also practically certain if extensive removal of water bodies occurs in the farm landscape. Also practically certain is adverse impact on local steelhead and other aquatic species if significant riparian vegetation removal proceeds. Impacts on other wildlife are difficult to assess without more information regarding the extent to which wildlife use existing farm resources (non-crop vegetation and water bodies) as habitat. Cumulative and Synergistic Effects : This report has not thoroughly considered cumulative and synergistic environmental effects related to food safety practices in the Central Coast region, although it is reasonable to expect that they occur. Cumulative impacts result from the incremental impact of an action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor butcollectively significant actions taking place over a period of time. 24Synergistic effects occur when interactions produce more than additive effects, and are well documented throughout the natural world (e.g., Cunningham and Cunningham 2008, Primack 2008, Wright 2007). With synergistic effects, the total impact of two or more threats - such as chemical exposure and habitat removal - can exceed what would be expected from their independent effects (Groom et al. 2008). Cumulativeeffects typically result from multiple stressors. For example, increased hunting of a certain species for food safety concerns may not lead to significant adverse effects on the population. But when combined with other stressors - such as increased chemical ingestion, exposure to sound cannons, the need to navigate around more fences, and reduced habitat in which to find shelter, mates, and food - the combined effect may prove lethal. D'Amore et al. (2009) describe an example of this in the Elkhorn Slough area of Monterey County. In this area and across many parts of the region, the cumulative effect of habitat fragmentation and degradation, combined with the well-documented adverse impacts of non-native bullfrogs on the threatened California red-legged frog (D'Amore 2009: Doubledee et al. 2003; Lawler et al.1999) has led to declines in red-legged frog populations. Regarding synergistic impacts, removal of vegetation, application of coppersulfate, and other management prac- tices documented to occur in the Central Coast region may mix in particularly lethal combinations that scientists have not begun to analyze. Documenting cumulative and synergistic effects in the Central Coast region could require years of intensive research.

What is Co-Management? As described above, pressures from buyers and auditors have resulted in reduced use of certain in-field conservation management practices, with serious environmental and food safety implications. Understandably, some authors have described this as a \"conflict\" or \"apparent conflict\" between food safety and environmental protection (Stuart et al. 2006, Bianchi et al.2008, Crohn and Bianchi 2008). The conflict pitches two largely supported societal goals - public health and environmental protection - against one another. In an attempt to achieve both goals, stakeholders in the Central Coast region are currently working towards \"co- management \" strategies. These stakeholders include growers, environmental non-profits, farm organizations, government agencies, produce companies, and industry trade organizations. The current co-management challenge and the key issues stakeholders describe in the Central Coast region are an important case study to evaluate as new food safety standards are applied in other regions or nationally. While \"co-management \" can be used in different ways, here it is defined as an approach to minimize microbiological hazards associated with food production while simultaneously conserving soil, water, air, wildlife, and other natural resources. The term co-management has a long history in fisheries and other natural resources where it implies multiple stakeholders jointly managing the resource base in a way that balances protection with production (e.g., Pomeroy and Rivera-Guieb 2005, Wilson et al. 2003). Within food safety, co-management has roots in a 2007 conference organized by University of California in cooperation with agency and industry stakeholders (Bianchi et al.2008). It is based on the premise that food safety and ecological health goals are attainable and compatible. B. Towards Co-Management for Food Safetyand EcologicalHealth Co-management for food safety and ecological health has great appeal for growers. The 2009 grower survey noted that eighty percent (80%, n = 123) of growers agreed or strongly agreed that it is their responsibility to protect food safety on their farms. Less than 1% (n = 1) disagreed and the rest either had no opinion or did not answer the question (RCD 2009). Similarly, 80% (n = 123) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, \"I feel it is my responsibility to protect water quality and the environment on my farm.\" Less than 2% (n = 3) disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement, and the rest either expressed no opinion or did not answer the question (RCD 2009). Growers clearly value food safety and ecological health and are committed to working towards both goals. Co- management allows growers to manage for both goals while also maintaining economic viability. Co-management is science-based, adaptive, collaborative, commodity-specific, and site specific. Science-based means building management practices upon a solid scientific foundation. Adaptive entails staying current with new scientific findings and incorporating them into management decisions. Collaborative encompasses tapping expertise held by resource agency staff, scientists, growers, food safety professionals, and others to manage for both environmental and food safety goals. Commodity-specific involves matching management practices to specific crops rather than adopting a \"one size fits all\" approach. Last, site specific implies knowing the conditions under which a given practice does (or does not) accomplish food safety and conservation goals. With respect to the last principle (site specific), co-management avoids absolutes. It rejects the notion that a given practice is categorically good or bad. Instead, co-managers apply practices in ways that maximize their contributionPART IV. Co-Management and KeyIssues ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION to food safety and ecological health. Scientifically grounded \"if...then...\" statements can be helpful in this regard by clarifying the conditions under which a practice is most advisable. For example Ifa field sits directly adjacent to a pasture and downslope from it, thena vegetated buffer is useful for mechanical filtration of pathogen-containing manure particles before they enter the farm. Ifa field sits next to a road traversed by manure-carrying trucks, thenplanting hedgerows or windbreaks may help intercept windblown dust particles that might transport pathogens onto the field. Ifa field contains Brussels sprouts, artichokes, or other crops that are cooked before eating (which kills bacteria), thena different set of food safety measures than those for produce that is eaten raw may apply. While specific recommendations lie beyond the scope of this report, these examples show the kind of co- management strategies possible. The main point is to provide useful, concrete guidance for accomplishing both food safety and ecological health, rather than make blanket statements about practices being appropriate orinappropriate, or prioritizing one goal to the detriment of the other. Several challenges to co-management exist, and Central Coast stakeholder groups continue to work towards defining specific co-management strategies. Efforts to achieve co-management began with numerous industry led meetings, revisions of food safety and conservation guidelines, and a 2007 conference of scientist and stakeholders (Bianchi et al. 2008). They have continued with creation of a \"Farm Food Safety and Conservation Network\" of diverse stakeholders that meets monthly to facilitate co-management efforts. 25 Qualitative interviews revealed several grower attempts to co-manage in their production areas. For example, growers with diverse operations have temporarily shifted where crops are grown in order to reduce proximity of vegetated conservation practices to leafy greens.26Other growers who are subject to private standards from produce firms negotiated or altered business arrangements in order to continue the use of conservation practices. While these represent small steps, regional stakeholders continue to refine management guidelines. C. KeyIssues Stakeholders face many challenges while working toward co-management . This section presents five key issues related to food safety that are critical to ongoing co-management efforts as well as the development of future policy. These issues have been identified by multiple sources, including:1) the 2007 co-management conference mentioned above; 2) the Farm Food Safety and Conservation Network; 3) interviews with regional experts; 4) the 2007 and 2009 grower surveys; and 5) authors' extensive interactions over a 6-month period with this project's 36- person Technical Advisory Committee, which served as a de facto co-management focus group. Key food safety issues that impact co-management include: the use of private corporate food safety program requirements, liability and litigation risk, concerns about possible effects of national food safety standards, the role of value-added products, and the lack of scientific information. Understanding and addressing these issues could greatly aid co-management efforts and will be critical when considering new food safety policies. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org51 25The mission of the Network is \"to facilitate the coordination of related organizations to support the agricultural industry's efforts to reduce food safety risks through methods which also minimize or avoid impacts to water quality, wildlife and habitat through education, training, research, communication and outreach.\" (http://www.awqa.org/networkwiki/index.php?title=NetworkWiki:Community_Portal) 26Growers indicate that even if sufficient acreage exists to buffer leafy greens by growing them in the interior of a large field, crop rotation requirements make this a short-term solution.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION PrivateCorporateFoodSafetyProgramRequirements Private corporate food safety programs may be created and managed by processors, shippers, major buying organizations, and/or third-party auditing companies, and often vary significantly from state-sanctioned standards such as the LGMA (Produce Safety Project 2009, RCD 2009). These programs have arisen for multiple purposes,not the least of which is to minimize the legal risk described above. One-third of the 154 participants in the 2009 grower survey reported being held to more than one set of food safety standards (RCD 2009). Based primarily oninterview and survey data, this section raises seven issues surrounding private corporate programs' key role in driving on-farm practices that cause environmental and other concerns. Lack of transparency. In many cases, standards used by private food safety programs are considered proprietaryinformation and companies insist that suppliers sign a confidentiality statement precluding them from discussingor otherwise sharing the standards. Standards used by businesses in the food safety inspection industry (e.g., Primus Labs and NSF Davis Fresh) and other third-party certifier companies hired by buyers to inspect operations, are often subject to less stringent confidentiality requirements. Growers face many challenges planning for co-management, and having to adhere to standards they cannot discuss adds to their concerns. The designation of corporate food safety standards as 'proprietary' allows companies to impose requirements that are not subject to environmentalreview, posing significant challenges to an analysis of the ecological implications of these standards Some conservation groups (including The Nature Conservancy) are also concerned that the secrecy surrounding private standards allows companies to impose requirements with unknown environmental and fiscal implications. Questionable scientific basis for standards. Growers, farm organizations, and conservation groups have expressedconcern about the scientific support for private corporate food safety standards. Private companies and/or groups of companies appear to have specific requirements for buffer widths and other practices that vary widely fromcompany to company and may not be grounded in scientific data. For example, private standards reviewed for this report revealed up to a 10-fold difference in width requirements for baregroundbuffers around fields. They also showed 6- to 30-fold differences in post-flood waiting periods before crops can be grown there again. Suchdiscrepancies illustrate the variable interpretation of scientific evidence regarding processes of contamination and how best to manage for contamination risk. Questions regarding scientific support become a serious concern for growers when compliance with the private standards is costly and/or disrupts management of their farms. A survey of leafy greens growers found that growers' costs for modifications made specifically for LGMA compliance averaged $21,490, or $13.60/acre (Hardesty and Kusunose, 2009). Growers who sell their produce to more than one company may be forced to implement the most stringent of each of the various requirements in order to avoid penalties. Growers, farm organizations, and conservation groups have expressed concern that food safety programs requiring specific practices not only lack a scientific basis, but may also undermine both environmental and food safety goals. Examples include removing vegetated buffers, grassed waterways, and constructed wetlands, all of which can help growers maintain water quality and minimize pathogen risk under certain conditions (see Part III). Inconsistent interpretation and application of food safety requirements . According to interviews conducted in 2007, as well as grower interviews conducted in 2009, inconsistent interpretation and application of private corporate standards by auditors and inspectors persist as major concerns. The 2009 grower survey confirmed these findings. It documented that a higher percentage of growers disagree than agree with statements that food safety auditors/inspectors are consistent in their interpretation of either the LGMA standards or other food safety programs (RCD 2009). For example, 52% of growers who adhere to LGMA requirements disagreed or strongly disagreed AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org52SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S with the statement \"Other [non-CDFA] food safety auditors/inspectors are consistent in their interpretation of the LGMA Metrics and audit documents.\" Only 23% agreed with the statement and none strongly agreed. The remainder did not answer the question or indicated that they had no opinion. The survey report indicates that insufficient technical capacity may contribute to this problem and recommends that auditors/inspectors possess knowledge of microbiology, human health, agriculture, natural resource management, and other relevant topics (RCD 2009). Growers interviewed in 2007 and in 2009 report that in many cases auditors intentionally vary interpretation and application based on market conditions. Multiple growers described instances where an auditor rejected a field for food safety concerns only to return a few days later to accept the same crop. Conversely, interviews also document situations where excess supply had led auditors to reject a crop on a minor technicality, i.e., for something that had not been a prior concern (see Appendix L for examples). One of the 36 technical advisors to this project, Devon Zagory, is the past owner of a food safety auditing company. He was able to help interpret the findings and provide additional context, especially regarding the role that market forces play: \"In the absence of government regulation of food safety auditing, a market for produce audit companies has developed. Many companies currently offer food safety audit services and, as is the case in markets, great diversity occurs in auditors and their qualifications. Auditors face no formal requirements or qualifications, nor do they have any explicit educational or licensing requirements. Price competition among auditors and audit companies adds another layer of complexity. Such market forces perhaps inevitably lead to a tendency toward less educated and less qualified auditors. There is also variabilityin oversight of auditors by the audit companies they represent. Nevertheless, auditors can exert a greatdeal of influence over growers because a satisfactory audit outcome is often required for market access. This can result in uninformed or even incorrect information and requirements articulated by auditors.\" (Personal communication, Devon Zagory) Food safety \"arms race.\" Growers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders are concerned that food safety standards used by private companies escalate because they are used as a marketing advantage. A Canadianconsortium of food industry leaders and government agencies recently agreed that \"food safety should be a non- competitive matter\" (Chambers 2008). Evidence suggests this is not the reality in the U.S. For example, the Food Safety Leadership Council 27(FSLC) issued what one of its members (Publix) has called \"enhanced\" On-Farm Produce Standards. The Western Growers Association called the FSLC standards \"the beginning of a destructive food safety 'arms race' where different groups of produce buyers, in an effort to claim that they have safer produce than the next, will impose on fresh produce suppliers ever more stringent, expensive, and scientifically indefensible food safety requirements...\"28Several other industry consortiums maintain their own private food safety standards, such as the Global Food Safety Initiative, the Safe Quality Food Program, and GlobalGAP. Interviews with growers support the \"arms race\" phenomenon. As one grower shared: \"Everyone is going above the [LGMA] metrics. It's about ego. Trying to out-food-safety the other guy.\" The food safety manager on another farm noted, \"Standards above and beyond are not based on safety, but are a marketing tool.\" A USA Today article quotes a company employee claiming \"the most stringent food safety standards in the country\" (Schmit 2006). Growers AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org53 27FSLC is a consortium of large food retailers including McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Walt Disney, Darden Restaurants, and Publix. The Publix cover letter and HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION indicate that private standards that exceed officially reviewed programs such as the LGMA increase and further contribute to rising costs associated with escalating requirements. Private food safety programs can contravene environmental laws . Growers indicate that they are in some cases pressured by their buyers or auditors to act in ways that violate environmental laws and regulations. For example, removing vegetation can constitute loss of CriticalHabitat for species protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, several of which occur in Arizona, California, and other leafy greens production areas. The documented removal of conservation practices can also place growers in violation of the U.S. Clean Water Act by increasing nutrient,pesticide, and sediment runoff into rivers and streams, unless growers reduce the runoff in other ways. Vegetation removal that includes native trees could violate local regulation such as Monterey County Ordinance 16.60.030, andwould not typically fall under approved agricultural exceptions (Monterey County 2009). As noted earlier, the statehighway agency has expressed concern that growers' increased vegetation removal on agency-controlled lands thatabut farms could be in violation of environmental laws (Monterey County Farm Bureau 2007). Certain food safety program measures appear to focus on goals other than food safety. Animals that have not been shown to pose a significant risk to crop contamination are targeted in private food safety programs, and growers report taking steps to eliminate these animals as a result. The motivation is not clear, but may include other industry goals. For example, larger animals can consume and/or damage crops; small animals, such as rodents and amphibians, can also be captured by machinery during harvest and processed along with produce. While unpleasantand a target of litigation efforts, this \"foreign object\" contamination is not necessarily a food safety issue. Rodents and amphibians are not identified as animals of significant risk as defined by the LGMA. Growers and conservation groups are concerned that corporate food safety programs that discourage these animals may be aimed at improving food quality rather than food safety. Respondents of the 2009 mail survey who are subject to LGMA standards as well as those subject to other food safety programs reported that they have been told by auditors orinspectors that wildlife that are not considered animalsofsignificantrisk (birds, amphibians, and rodents) may still be a risk to food safety. Neither the LGMA nor the scientific review in Part III of this report support such claimsof significant food safety risk. Food safety pressures have caused management changes in operations that do not grow leafy greens and/or cropsthat are consumed raw . Personal interviews and results from the 2009 grower survey illustrate how food safety pressures have influenced non-leafy greens operations and even crops that are not consumed raw (cooking kills bacteria and dramatically reduces risks of foodborne illness). 29According to findings from the 2009 survey, 50- 75% of artichoke growers and 60-80% of Brussels sprout growers reported being told by auditors or buyers that some combination of wildlife, vegetation, and/or water bodies are a risk to food safety. Interviews also revealed that many growers who grow leafy greens as well as non-leafy greens crops applied the same food safety measures to all fields. Vegetable growers who do not grow leafy greens reported adopting the LGMA standards for competitive advantage or to appease concerns from buyers. Extending requirements intended to reduce risk in 'ready to eat' produce to crops that are virtually assured of being cooked before being consumed unnecessarily increases both the AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org54 29Rare exceptions could potentially occur. For example, certain consumers may eat Brussels sprouts and artichokes raw. Also, if a contaminant occurs on the external surface of a product then it could transfer to consumers' hands (and further) before cooking occurs. In general, the agricultural industry prefers to mitigate risk as close to the farm as possible rather than rely on consumer behavior. However, the broad application of measures intended to reduce risk in leafy greens to other, less vulner- able crops in an abundance of caution could have serious ramifications for ecological health and financial sustainability inmany agricultural regions.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION economic and environmental costs of food safety activities. Results from the 2009 survey show that recent food safety concerns have also affected the strawberry sector.30 LiabilityandLitigationRisk Liability and litigation risk can represent a significant challenge to co-management. Data from interviews indicate that growers face increasing pressure from processors and buyers to accept liability for contaminated product.Starting with a landmark 1963 case, the modern notion of \"strict liability\" arose in California and has spread to all 50 states and much of the industrialized world (California Supreme Court 1963). The concept has persisted as a driving force in food safety litigation (Stearns 2006). Under strict liability, a person who becomes ill after eatingproduce needs to demonstrate that the produce was contaminated, was used as intended, and caused the sickness.Having demonstrated this, a plaintiff can sue anyone along the chain of production. Actions that growers, shippers,and others take (or do not take) matter relatively little because the plaintiff does not need to prove \"negligence\" anywhere along the chain. Until recently, growers who took basic precautionary steps could significantly reduce risk of food safety liability and litigation. Following voluntary FDA recommendations, they usually carried adequate insurance, had their facilities tested by a certifying laboratory, and used contracts that provided extensive indemnification along the entire supply chain (Gilles et al. 2004). These measures provided reasonable protection, especially considering that most involvement in litigation and liability for foodborne illness has focused on retailers. Recent scientific and technological advances have dramatically altered the legal landscape. Improvements in the traceback of produce to growers, and quick appreciation and identification of outbreaks, have shifted legal attention to other parties in the distribution chain all the way back to the growers. Using genetic fingerprinting, bar codes, and other techniques, scientists can now trace a specific pathogen from a sick person to the processing facility, and from there to the farm where the food was grown. As the chain of evidence has extended back to the individual farm or facility, so too has strict liability. Regardless of where along the supply chain the contamination event may have occurred (typically difficult or impossible to determine), the grower will now likely be swept up in the lawsuits that follow. The result is an ongoing spate of large legal settlements, often for millions of dollars. This has serious implications for growers and for agricultural sustainability in general, including greater challenges regarding insurance (see Appendix L).Growers have expressed strong concern about how the implementation of on-farm food safety practices influences legal risks. On one hand, they face immense pressure to implement food safety practices that run counter to federal and state environmental regulations. This places them at risk of fines and other penalties. On the other hand, growers who do not fully implement environmentally-damaging food safety practices, yet still manage to sell their crops, face increased food safety litigation risk. Growers fear that food safety legal challenges are unlikely to ease without policy reform. They also anticipate legal issues related to new practices and technologies such as irradiation (see Appendix L). Growers are concerned that a practice that FDA considers voluntary could become mandatory as a result of lawsuits. At least one prominent food safety litigator has already said as much, noting that failure to irradiate may lead to punitive damages because it could \"constitute a conscious disregard of a known risk\" (Marler 2009). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org55 30According to the 2009 RCD mail survey, over 43% of strawberry growers had been told that wildlife was a risk to food safety, 8.7% had been told that non-crop vegetation was a risk to food safety, and 26.1% had been told that water bodies were a risk to food safety. Interviews with 23 strawberry growers (2007-2008) found that approximately 39% now use fences todeter wildlife, 43% use poisoned bait, and 35% use traps for wildlife.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION NationalFoodSafetyStandards Legislation and ensuing national produce standards could either strengthen co-management efforts or undermine them. Concurrent with legislative initiatives on Capitol Hill is an effort to create a National Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (NLGMA). Proposed by a group of agricultural associations representing the leafy greens industry, theNLGMA would implement best practices and a corresponding verification program for reducing microbialcontamination (see www.NLGMA.org). The proposed NLGMA would be modeled after the California LGMA, and would require USDA approval and administration instead of the FDA. This section highlights several stakeholderconcerns regarding possible national standards raised in interviews with regional experts through the development of this report. Addressing the food safety \"arms race\". National standards created by FDA and/or USDA/NLGMA may inadvertently incentivize private corporations to develop requirements that exceed those national standards. As experienced in California, private corporate standards may create an \"arms race\" phenomenon, and drive increasingly aggressive on-farm management practices despite a more widely accepted set of standards. New nationalproduce safety guidelines could have the unintended consequence of ratcheting these private standards higher, resulting in increased environmental impacts. Secrecy surrounding private standards makes it difficult to assess both the level of increased environmental or fiscalimpacts these corporate requirements may cause, as well as the information and assumptions that drive them. Interview data from growers suggests that a ratcheting above any new federal standards could occur for multiple reasons including marketing advantage (see above). Growers and other stakeholders are concerned that this could:1) exacerbate environmental, economic, and other concerns featured in this report; 2) create confusion in the market rather than clarity; 3) perpetuate doubt about the role of science in food safety standards; and 4) generate consumerdoubt about the adequacy of the national standards due to the presence of private standards that exceed national requirements. National standards could help resolve these concerns if the standards clearly require corporate programs to be transparent, science based, and otherwise consistent with the principles of \"co-management.\" Ensuring a scientific foundation. Proposed legislation reviewed for this report calls for the use of best available science. However, as this document illustrates, current scientific understanding of processes of crop contamination is quite limited. Stakeholders are concerned that the current lack of scientific understanding could lead to national standards that stretch beyond what existing science can support, and also are subject to a regulatory process that will be unable to keep up with constantly evolving scientific findings. As noted earlier, scientific studies are already underway that, once completed, should shed important light on the process of contamination. Studies such as these can create significant breakthroughs that should be reflected in national food safety standards on an ongoing basis, making them truly science-based.Ensuring Flexibility. Concerns persist that national standards developed in, and administered from, Washington DC could entail a \"one size fits all\" approach unsuitable to a diverse range of locations, crops, and production methods. As noted earlier, growers report that 'leafy green' food safety pressures have spilled over into non-leafy greens operations including crops such as artichokes and Brussels sprouts that are cooked before consumption (which kills bacteria). Yet they are required to comply with the same strict standards as crops that are eaten raw. The U.S. produces an immense diversity of crops for multiple end uses, under a wide range of growing conditions and farming practices. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org56SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Organic production, which continues to expand throughout the region, requires growers to \"maintain or improve the natural resources of the operation\" in order to keep their organic certification. National and state organic standards define natural resources to include \"soil, water, wetlands, woodlands, and wildlife\" (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2007,p. 7). Food safety requirements entailing removal of wildlife, non-crop vegetation, and water bodies may run counter to these organic standards. IndustryMovementintoValueAddedProducts Bagged salads, known as \"value-added products,\" have transformed the produce industry, recently becoming the second biggest selling produce item in U.S. grocery stores (Consumer Reports 2006). Numerous foodborne illness outbreaks have been linked to bagged salads, most notably the 2006 spinach E. colioutbreak (CDC 2006). Several growers and conservation organizations strongly believe that bagged products are largely responsible for food safety issues relating to leafy green outbreaks. In October 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture funded a 3-year, multi-university study to explore growth of E.coliand other pathogens in these products (Swedberg 2009). What exactly is the purported link between bagged salads and on-farm environmental concerns? The theory is thatenvironmentally destructive on-farm management practices are being required in response to food safety risk that is largely driven by this category of product. In other words, the theory is that large-scale industry movement into bagged products has increased foodborne illnesses outbreaks, which in turn has led to a misguided crackdown on wildlife, water bodies, and non-crop vegetation. The USDA-funded study will shed light on pathogen growth in bagged products during shipping and storage, but that is not the only concern. Another potential connection centers on how processed salads have contributed to an increase in harvesting by machines - an increase noted in LGMA (2008). Unlike human harvesters, machines inadvertently harvest frogs and other small wildlife that are concealed in crops. Machines process these \"foreignobjects\" (or parts of them) into bags which are shipped to buyers. The resulting consumer reaction may lead buyersto discourage wildlife or habitat that supports wildlife near crops. Evidence indicates that leafy greens tend to create more illnesses per outbreak than other types of produce. In a recent analysis of 10,421 foodborne disease outbreaks dating back to 1973, CDC researchers noted that \"the median sizeof leafy green-associated outbreaks (18 illnesses) was twice the median size of non-leafy green-associated outbreaks\"(Herman et al.2008). Centralized processing plants with larger geographic ranges increase risks of dispersed outbreaks (Altekruse et al. 1997). Contaminated lettuce mixed and bagged in a centralized plant can impact more consumers than a single head of contaminated lettuce. In some cases, greens from different states (and/or Mexico) are mixed before packaging. Experts from the produce industry report that cross contamination in wash water is a possibility in leafy greens processing plants (see Appendix L). Consumers as well as those in the produce industry have raised concerns that extended shelf lives of processed products and the plastic packaging itself may promote bacterial growth in bagged products. Stakeholders continue to discuss and debate the existence of a linkage between incidence of foodborne disease outbreaks and the rise of processed leafy greens products. Several non-profit organizations, as well as experts interviewed, suggest a possible connection, however, no known quantitative studies have explored this question. Insufficient data exist at this time to determine whether a correlation (let alone causation) exists between the rise in value added products and incidence of foodborne illness. Any effort to demonstrate a link would need to take into account numerous important considerations. An initial list of important factors appears in Appendix L. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org57SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION TheRoleofScience Scientific research focused on food safety and environmental implications of on-farm management practices remains limited, though several new studies are either planned or already in progress, including the wildlife E. coli study mentioned in Part III. Appendix K briefly describes several of these projects. Based on a 2007 conference, Bianchi, Mercer and Crohn (2008) and Crohn and Bianchi (2008) identify areas that both food safety and ecological health professionals agree require further research: 1) persistence and fate of pathogens in the crop and in conservation practices; 2) pathways by which pathogens move through the crop production system; and 3) identification of environmental conditions that promote pathogen survival and proliferation.31This report builds on that list, adding new topics and questions that could guide future research to aid co-management (see Part III). Filling information gaps will allow stakeholders to make more informed decisions regarding important management tradeoffs. Growers are currently asked to make high stakes decisions with low levels of information, the only certainty being that if anything goes wrong they will be held accountable in both legal and public opinion. It is important to acknowledge that even the best scientific efforts will not answer every question or generate 100% certainty. Policy makers and others must make difficult decisions and move forward based on the best available information filteredthrough societal values. As noted in Bianchi, Mercer, and Cohn (2008), the key is to institute a coordinated process that fills the most critical research gaps on a systematic and continuous basis so that high quality information isregularly available. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org58 31The following website provides a complete summary of conference outcomes and results: http://groups.ucanr.org/wqfsconf/SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Pathogenic contamination events in fresh produce are, fortunately, extremely rare relative to the amount of produce consumed. The rarity of these events makes detailed understanding of how and why they occur evasive. Improved scientific methods (e.g., source tracking) are helping researchers follow pathways in the landscape to more precisely identify and define important sources and processes of contamination. However, critical information remains poorly defined, and therein lies the challenge for co-management. How do we navigate risk when the comfort of scientificcertainty remains unavailable? Because the stakes for human health are so high, lack of certainty about the details of how pathogen contamination occurs does not allow growers to delay response. On the contrary, it has led food industry members to identify a broad suite of possible food safety risks, and to devise management protocols that attempt to minimize those risks. This broad focus has generated concerns that efforts to minimize food safety risk may increase impacts on ecological health, in particular water quality and wildlife populations. Acknowledgement of impacts of various management practices to both food safety and ecological health is essential to forge co-management strategies that capture the best available science and ensure a safe and sustainable food supply. Further, decisions made with incomplete riskinformation ultimately reflect the values of growers, industry leaders and society at large. Substantial evidence indicates that food safety measures at times run counter to ecological health goals. The extent to which the contradiction has led, or will lead, to measurable impact on ecological health is uncertain, in part because available information fails to quantify and provide detail regarding changes in practices. It is also hard to quantify because the precise ecological value of conservation practices intended to address water quality, in particular, is poorly defined. An analysis of studies in the region found little conclusive evidence of improved water quality despite reports of substantial implementation of conservation practices (Conley et al. 2008). On a smaller scale, and in a unique highly erodible setting, the Elkhorn Slough area in Monterey County has recorded impressivegains in soil conservation and resultant decrease in sediment loads in local waterways (NRCS 2006). Despite media claims of a \"scorched earth\" policy being carried out (e.g., Lochhead 2009, Lovett 2008, Abraham 2007, and grower interviews) no studies have yet attempted to quantify environmental changes associated with food safety practices on the Central Coast. That said, at least five adverse environmental impacts are likely to occur due to destruction of riparian vegetation, use of anticoagulants , and removal of both natural and engineered water bodies. In some cases (e.g., replacement of vegetated buffers with baregroundbuffers or removal of dust trapping hedgerows) altered management practices can potentially increase both food safety risk and environmental damage. Limited information regarding contamination processes has created significant challenges for co-management, especially regarding the role of wildlife. Investigations of foodborne illness outbreaks necessarily occur after something bad has already occurred. Since it would be unethical to create a contamination event intentionally (i.e., a robust \"controlled\" study that makes people sick), scientists face the formidable task of trying to piece things together after a contamination event has already occurred. The results of investigations can provide important information in understanding management practices that might reduce contamination. But because wildlife are considered potential sources of pathogens, risk management strategies have focused on completely excluding wildlife from the farm, including species for which the literature shows low (or no) frequency of pathogens. Growers report changes in practices involving non-crop vegetation and water bodies on farms that reflect uncertainty regarding risks from wildlife and how these features may attract wildlife. These actions widen the scope of influence to include impacts on water quality as well as wildlife and their habitat.Conclusion AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org59SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Several studies are currently underway to examine the sources and vectors of pathogens in the Central Coast, as well as how vegetation may reduce the transport of pathogens in agricultural settings. Further evidence may suggest that the exclusion of wildlife and the removal of vegetation, water bodies, and conservation practices are not the best way to manage food safety risk. If standards are to be science based, it is important for food safety programs to adapt promptly in ways that reflect the most recent scientific findings. TowardsCo-ManagementCo-management has been defined in this report as an approach to minimize microbiological hazards associated with food production while simultaneously conserving soil, water, air, wildlife, and other natural resources. It is based on the premise that farmers want to produce safe food, desire to be good land stewards, and can do both while still remaining economically viable. Many Central Coast stakeholders are currently working towards co-management butit is not yet a mainstream approach, and they face many challenges from the various food safety programs they often must accommodate to sell their produce. Success in instituting a co-management approach will require those involved in both food safety and ecological health management to increase awareness of each others' concerns and to adjust standards and guidelines accordingly. The report notes several food safety issues that may impact the success of co-management. These issues remain the primary areas of concern expressed by stakeholders involved in the co-management process and addressing them may be critical if significant progress is to occur. Focused discussion with a wide range of stakeholders undertakenas part of this case study indicates concern about the role of liability, private corporate food safety standards,potential implications of national food safety standards, value-added processed produce, and insufficient scientificinformation. Many of these challenges remain controversial and unresolved, and recommending solutions to them lies beyond the scope or intent of this report. Nevertheless, it is critical to understand stakeholder concerns in order to move forward with co-management efforts. These same issues are also important to consider for development and implementationof food safety programs to be applied in other regions or nationally. MovingForward This report provides a snapshot of an evolving issue. Co-management continues to be a challenge, and regional stakeholders will continue to use the best available science to the extent possible to help inform farm-management practices for both food safety and ecological health. As these are both highly valued public goals, it is in the best interest of stakeholders to work towards co-management rather than exclude one goal or the other. Co-managementwill benefit from additional scientific information and from increased communication between involved parties. A variety of stakeholders participating in the co-management process far beyond the boundaries of California's Central Coast should find use for this report's findings. The report indicates that clear scientific knowledge gaps exist regarding pathogen transport, the role of wildlife, and other key factors. Future studies designed specifically with co-management goals in mind will be of particular use. Through identifying the range of management changes and the sources of pressure driving these changes, this report also indicates the importance of broad representation in future co-management efforts. The clear commitment to co-management demonstrated by many stakeholders in the region presents an important opportunity for collaborative efforts to ensure that on-farm management practices evolve in ways that reflect the dual goals of food safety and ecological health. Such collaborative, co-management efforts can and should play a critical role in making fresh produce both safe and sustainable for years to come AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org60SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org61 Abraham, K. 2007.

Monterey County produces 63% of the lettuce and 91% of the salad greens grown in California (CAAgricultural Resources Directory 2009). Monterey County contains the Salinas Valley, known as the \"Salad Bowl of America\". The climate is ideal for long growing seasons: for example, iceberg lettuce can be harvested April through October (ERS 2001). In addition to lettuce, Monterey County is also a top producer of other commodities, producing 44% of broccoli, 37% of strawberries, 81% of artichokes, 63% of spinach, and 44% of cabbage grown in California (CA Agricultural Resources Directory 2009). In 2007, there were approximately 1,200 farms in the county covering over 1.3 million acres of land (U.S. Census of Agriculture 2007). In 2008, Monterey County reported an agricultural production value of $3.82 billion with lettuce production alone producing over $1.1 billion in gross value (CA Agricultural Resources Directory 2009, Monterey County Agricultural Commissioner's Office 2009). Other Central Coast Counties While Monterey County produces the majority of lettuce and leafy greens in California, other counties in the Central Coast region are also important agricultural producers. San Benito County produces many vegetable crops including 8% of spinach and 4% of lettuce in California (CA Agricultural Resources Directory 2009). Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties have over 9,000 acres planted in a diversity of vegetable crops including lettuce and leafy greens. The two counties are the top producers of Brussels sprouts in California. San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are both major producers of broccoli, strawberries, and wine grapes but growers in these counties also produce lettuce and other leafy greens. Diversified Agriculture Industry The agricultural industry in the Central Coast region is diverse in many ways. Due to the diversity of local microclimates, the region is able to produce over 200 different agricultural crops. Growers in the region are also diverse with both small and large-scale operations as well as organic and conventional production. According the U.S. Census of Agriculture (2007) approximately 20 percent of growers in Monterey County operate less than 10 acres while another 20 percent operate over 1,000 acres. The average farm size in Monterey County is 1,108 acres (U.S. Census of Agriculture 2007).Appendix A. SupplementalBackground Information SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Organic production is growing in the region with over 13% of all Central Coast growers producing organic products in 2005 and farm receipts of approximately $1.5 billion (UC Agricultural Issues Center 2007). Approximately 40% of growers in the region lease their land (U.S. Census of Agriculture 2007). Many growers have contracts to sell to shippers (who sell commodities to retailers) or processors (who process foods and sell value-added goods to retailers, such as bagged ready-to-eat salads). Other growers operate as both growers and shippers with contracts to sell to food retailers. Retailers include grocery stores, restaurants, and food service companies. In some cases large processors or shippers own land that they contract with growers to cultivate. Eachgrower may have different specifications in their production contracts regarding who pays for upfront costs and inputs and expectations regarding crop quality, harvest, and payment. In many cases there is considerable competition between growers to garner contracts with the largestshippers or processors who account for a significant portion of market share. Due to the interconnected and competitive nature of the produce sector, decisions made by retail, shipping, and processing firms canimpact business conditions for other firms as well as produce production and the income of regional growers. The Importance of Bagged Salads With the rising popularity of bagged salads, processors play an increasingly important role in Central Coast agriculture. Washed and bagged leafy greens as well as chopped salad blends and kits have become lucrative value-added products in the produce sector (ERS 2001, Mintel 2008, Shaw 2008). Baby greens and lettuce mixes were once considered a delicacy found at fine restaurants. Due to innovations in the late 1980's, bagged salads became the second biggest selling item in U.S. grocery stores, reaching $2.5billion in annual sales (Consumer Reports 2006). Sales of bagged salads increased approximately 560% between 1993 and 1999 (ERS 2001), 42% between 2001 and 2006 and are predicted to rise an additional 38% from 2007 through 2011 (Peot 2008). The largest bagged salad processors in the U.S. are Fresh Express, Dole, and Taylor Farms, which togethercontrol the vast majority of the bagged salad industry. Processing companies have headquarters and processing plants located in the Central Coast region, and have production contracts with area growers. EcologicalAttributes of the California's CentralCoast Region Economic Contribution The region's natural resource endowment drives a significant part of the economy through tourism in avariety of forms (general tourism, nature tourism, agro-tourism). The natural resources also provide multiple types of \"ecosystem services\" that contribute economically tothe region and maintain the high quality of life. Resource economists have recently begun to calculate the total dollar value of ecosystem services on local and global scales. Central Coast ecosystems provide more than two dozen types of goods and services, parts of which can reasonably be expected to be lost in the absence of conservation efforts. They include: AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org76SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Provisioning Services: Safe drinking water (naturally purified in aquifers & wetlands); clean air (cycled by plants), fuelwood for fireplaces & stoves, genetic resources for creating new medicines, wild foods (mushrooms, berries), hunting opportunities, and many other benefits Regulating Services: Wetlands minimize flood damage, hillside vegetation reduces risk of mud slides, bees provide pollination, nutrient cycling via decomposers, erosion prevention, climate regulation, disease regulation, decomposition of wastes, pest control from beneficial insects, raptors, etc.., hedgerows and windbreaks reduce pesticide drift, and many other benefits. Cultural Services: Recreation and tourism (local and non-local visitors), aesthetic values (open space, nice views, sense of beauty), social benefits (place for picnics, walks, family outings), sense of place (what your \"home\" looks & feels like), religious use (church gatherings / worship), educational values (summer camps for kids), inspiration (for painters, sculptors, musicians and others), existence value (knowing that eagles, condors, frogs, and other life forms exist even if you do not experience them directly), physical well-being (places to jog, run, walk), emotional well-being (relaxed rural setting compared to city) Ecosystem contributions are often overlooked, without them society would be forced to find expensive alternatives to these services. Central Coast ecosystems tend to be large and complex, but protecting them consists of small, specific steps.A farmer does not set out to maintain an ecosystem per se, but rather plants a hedgerow, keeps a wetland, or takes any number of other small steps that have larger impacts when aggregated across a landscape. Ecological Features The Central Coast ecoregion has been identified by scientists as an \"ecological hotspot\" based on species richness and identified threats to biodiversity (Olson et al.1998, Myers et al.2000). The Central Coast provides essential habitat for many rare species, including, Steelhead trout (federally listed as Threatened), California red-legged frog (federally listed as Threatened), the California tiger salamander (federally listed as Endangered in Sonoma and Santa Barbara Counties. Threatened throughout the rest of the range), and the San Francisco garter snake (federally listed as Endangered). According to the California Department of Fish and Game, the Central Coast region is home to more than 80 species thatare listed as endangered, threatened, or rare. 1 Central Coast watersheds drain to 29 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) newly approved by the California Fish and Game Commission, representing 204 square miles of protected marine waters. Additionally, the Central Coast ocean waters are protected by a suite of other marine management designations, including the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and multiple Critical Coastal Areas and Areas of Special Biological Significance. (http://www.sanctuarysimon.org/monterey/sections/reserves/index.php). The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is home to one of the last populations of the endangered Southern Sea Otter (Enyhdra lutris nereis), federally listed as Threatened. The Central Coast region also contains Elkhorn Slough, one of the largest remaining salt marsh wetlands, providing vital habitat for fish and bird species (Caffrey et al.2002). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org77 1Complete species list AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Ongoing Environmental Challenges Regional wildlife are increasingly threatened by expanding development, invasive species, water pollution, the alteration of waterways, and climate change (TNC 2006, CWC 2002). Natural ecosystems can be significantly impacted by degraded water quality. Agricultural and urban run- off impairs several of the major waterways in the Central Coast region. Three of the major watersheds are the Pajaro River, the Salinas River, and the Elkhorn Slough (NOAA 1999). Approximately 75% of the land surrounding these watersheds is used for agricultural production (State of California 1997). The waterwaysemptying into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary repeatedly fail to meet water quality standardswith significantly elevated levels of nutrients, pesticides, and sediment (Caffrey 2001, Hunt et al.1999). 2 Monitoring in Elkhorn Slough indicates excessive nitrogen loads and erosion due to row crop agriculture (Caffrey et al.2002, Los Huertos et al.2001). While there are also urban sources of non-point source pollution in the Central Coast region, agriculturalland use has been directly linked with elevated nutrients as well as microbial and organic contaminants in coastal waters (Handler et al.2006). CentralCoast Contributions to Localand NationalPublicHealth Provider of Fresh Produce Consumers have become increasingly aware of linkages between food choices and health and are more commonly selecting foods based on nutritional value and caloric intake (Goldman 2003). Salad consumers have been shown to have higher intakes of vitamin C, vitamin E, folic acid, and carotenoids(important antioxidants) (Su et al.2006). Numerous studies indicate that diets high in fresh fruits and vegetables are linked with decreased risks of cancer (Steinmetz and Potter 1996). A U.S. Department of Agriculture survey conducted in the mid-1990s indicated that lettuce is the number one produce item consumed by U.S. adults, with 40% of the survey population consuming lettuce over a two day survey period (Johnston et al.2000). Some scientists suggest that increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in household diets can reduce the intake of fats and sugars and therefore reduce the chances of obesity and type II diabetes (Epstein et al. 2001). According to the Center for Disease Control (2009), 34% of the U.S. population is considered obese. Up to 95% of current diabetes cases have been diagnosed as Type II diabetes, which in many cases is linked to obesity. Studies indicate lettuce consumption can reduce cholesterol and enhance antioxidant status (due to high levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenoids) and scientists suggested regular consumption may reduce cardiovascular disease (Nicolle et al.2004). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org78 2The Salinas River only reaches the ocean during part of the year, depending on rainfall and water releases from upstream dams.SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Outbreaks of Foodborne Illness Associated with Fresh Produce Produce-associated outbreaks accounted for 0.7% of all reported foodborne outbreaks in the 1970s, but accounted for 6% in the 1990s (Sivapalasingam et al.2004). This rise may be attributed to several factors including the increase in consumption of raw fruits and vegetables (Bureau of Census 1996, Beuchat 1996), increased reporting of illness and outbreaks (and significantly improved state and federal government capacity to identify them), changes in human demography, microbial adaptation (Altekruse et al.1997), and/or changes in farming or processing practices (Beuchat 2002). Produce can become contaminated with a variety of pathogens including Salmonella spp . andEscherichia coliO157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7). The 2006 outbreak of E. coliO157:H7 associated with bagged spinach brought increasing attention to this particularly virulent strain of E. coli. E. coli O157:H7 comes from an animal \"reservoir\" and can be transmitted onto food through contact with animal feces (Tauxe 1997). Each year in the United States an estimated 73,480 illnesses occur from E. coliO157:H7 resulting in 2,170 hospitalizations and 61 deaths (Mead et al.1999. Only a portion of these illnesses are reported. Most outbreaks are traced to the consumption of contaminated meat, which is often contaminated during the slaughtering process. Consumption of ground beef is the most common vehicle of food borne E. coli O157:H7 outbreaks: 41 percent of food borne outbreaks are from ground beef, whereas 21 percent are from produce (Rangel et al.2005). An estimated half of all produce contamination occurs during food preparation due to cross contamination with contaminated meat or other foods in the kitchen (Rangel et al.2005). Foodborne illness concern peaked in the Central Coast region following the 2006 spinach outbreak. It was not the first time the region was linked to E. coliO157:H7 outbreaks: of the 10 outbreaks of E. coliO157:H7 since 1995 linked to spinach and lettuce, 8 have been traced back to the Central Coast Region (CIDRAP 2007). The region is the largest producer of leafy greens and production has been expanding, sometimes into regions near livestock operations and wildlife habitat (Roberts 2008). Public Health and the Environment Adoption of intensive agricultural practices in the U.S. has significantly impaired water quality and can negatively impact human health. Agriculture is the largest single contributor of non-point source water pollution in the U.S.: agriculture contributes to 70% of impaired rivers, 49% of impaired lakes, and 27% of impaired estuaries (U.S. EPA 2000). Studies show that approximately 60% of coastal rivers and bays in the U.S. have been degraded specifically by nutrient pollution, and agriculture remains the major source of nutrient deposition in the U.S. (Howarth et al.2002). Over 20 waterways in the region are listed as impaired for one or more contaminants by the EPA including the Salinas River, the Santa Maria River, and Corralitos Creek. Primary contaminants include fecal coliforms, pesticides, and nutrients (EPA 2009). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org79SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Recent monitoring of regional surface waters by Central Coast Water Quality Preservation indicate that the majority of Salinas Valley test sites and others in the Central Coast region are well over the EPA nitrate standard of 10 ppm. Waterways flowing into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary repeatedly fail to meet water quality standards with significantly elevated levels of nutrients, pesticides, and sediment (Conley et al.2008, Caffrey et al.2001, Hunt et al.1999). Regulations for Food Safety Food Safety: The California Leafy Greens Products Handler Marketing Agreement (LGMA) The California Leafy Greens Products Handler Marketing Agreement (LGMA) was created in 2007 and oversight was granted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food andAgriculture (CDFA). Signing the marketing agreement is voluntary for handlers of leafy greens. Leafy greens include arugula,butter lettuce, chard, escarole, iceberg lettuce, red leaf lettuce, spinach, baby leaf lettuce, cabbage, endive,green leaf lettuce, kale, romaine lettuce, and spring mix. The term \"handler\" refers to firms responsible for bringing produce to retailers and other produce buyers. Approximately 120 handlers have signed the LGMA that together represent over 99% of the leafy greens produced in the state (LGMA 2009). Handlers who sign the Agreement are required to purchase or source their leafy greens produce only from fields which are managed in accordance with a specific set of strict in-field food safety requirements. Therequirements, commonly known as \"metrics,\" are detailed in the Commodity Specific Food Safety Guidelines for the Production and Harvest of Lettuce and Leafy Greens (LGMA 2009). LGMA metrics were developed by technical staff and scientists in the produce industry with some input from government agencies and natural resource organizations. Growers who do business with signatories of the LGMA are subject to audits that are performed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) inspectors trained by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA). Food Safety: Private, Corporate Food Safety Programs In addition to the LGMA, private produce firms, including shippers, processors, and retailers, developed new measures for food safety following the 2006 spinach outbreak. Almost all processors and retailers already had their own food safety standards in place prior to the 2006 outbreak. These standards involve protocols for growing, harvesting, processing, shipping, and storage. Most of these standards are considered proprietary information as part of the contracts between growers, handlers, and retailers. After the spinach outbreak many of these standards were modified, aiming to further reduce chances of cropcontamination and address public concern regarding the safety of fresh produce. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org80SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Several factors drive the development of these individual corporate food safety programs. For example, private firms face pressure to avoid litigation following outbreaks, and even single contamination events can permanently tarnish brand names and business. Also, in some cases food safety standards may be a means to achieve competitive advantage over other firms. Many food safety standards used by private firms entail measures that go beyond those required in the LGMA. Growers who do not follow these additional food safety measures, sometimes referred to as 'super-metrics,' may have crops rejected or may lose contracts for future business. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org81SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Overview of Main Qualitative Methods Review of relevant documents, including: published scholarly literature, farm water quality plans, food safety requirement checklists, unpublished scientific reports, transcripts of testimony, internal memoranda, letters, court rulings, government databases, and policy documents such as laws, regulations, and guidance. Personal interviews with regional experts. Experts included NGO representatives (agricultural and environmental), government officials (federal, state, and local agencies); industry representatives (growers, handlers, buyers, shippers, auditors, and an attorney), and both scientists and extension agents from the state university system. Time limitations and the project focus precluded us from interviewing retailers and consumers. A Technical Advisory Committee consisting of 36 individuals with expertise in a wide range ofresearch, industry and conservation fields provided extensive input into the research and writing process. Experts submitted more than 2,000 written comments on multiple drafts of the report, participated in threehalf-day face to face meetings to vet the report, and worked with the research team on an individual basis to provide information, contacts, and other resources. A seven-person team of University of California food safety scientists also provided detailed review and input. Direct observations. This included field visits to farms, with landowners' approval, to observe management practices and get a stronger sense of challenges. It also included visits to processing facilities. Overview of Quantitative Methods Methodological details of the 2007 survey of 181 growers appears in Beretti and Stuart (2008). RCD (2009) describes methodological details from the 2009 survey of 154 growers. Every mail survey has flaws, including the two used for this analysis. Despite shortcomings, the surveymethodologies were sound overall given the purposes of the surveys. Assessing the Quality of Sources Considerable scientific uncertainty, opinion, emotion, and politics surround this topic. Thus, this report attempts to gauge the quality of the underlying science regarding specific issues, particularly the amountof evidence available and degree of consensus among experts on its interpretation. Additional weight has been given to scientific studies that had been replicated and were conducted in field conditions rather than in a laboratory setting. Priority was also given to peer reviewed scholarly literature and expert opinions from multiple sources with a wide variety of affiliations. Regarding \"Burden of Proof\" and Scientific Uncertainty As is the case with any policies informed by science, \"burden of proof\" plays a critical role in current co- management discussions. To what extent should those who create or demand specific food safety practicesbe required to \"prove\" that the practices significantly reduce risk? Likewise, must they prove that their practices do not cause environmental damage? Finally, to what extent should those who are concerned about environmental impacts be required to \"prove\" that significant environmental impacts have occurred?Appendix B. AdditionalDetails on Project Scopeand Methods SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION We note that parties to the discussion tend to answer these two questions differently, applying a higher standard to others' claims than to their own. This illustrates the role of differential interpretation and values regarding management for food safety and environmental quality A certain degree of scientific uncertainty always exists concerning complex, real-world issues, especiallythose involving natural resources. This tends to steer people toward the well-established precautionaryprinciple, which entails erring on the side of caution when faced with scientific uncertainty. Given the persistent lack of 100% certainty, policy makers and others must make difficult decisions basedon societal values and an understanding of the best available science. This report does not discuss values, but it does attempt to review and assess the best available science.

All actions of the LGMA and its Advisory Board must be approved by the Secretary of CDFA. See www.caleafygreens.ca.gov for more information. LGMA 'Metrics', or Commodity Specific Food Safety Guidelines for the Production and Harvest of Lettuce and Leafy Greens : Food Safety Best Management Practices for Lettuce and Leafy Greens Guidance document developed by Western Growers working with regulatory agencies, scientists, produce industry representatives, and other interested parties. The document is accepted by the Leafy Green Marketing Agreement Board and applies to all signatory handlers and associated growers under the Leafy Green Marketing Agreement. Non-crop vegetation : Vegetation not harvested as a crop that is either resident or planted in and adjacent to or near farmed land. This includes cover crop (in-field); field border vegetation such as weedy areas, filter strips or AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org85SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION hedgerows; and nearby expanses of open non-cropped land, whether in low-statured (grasses, etc.) or tall (trees and shrubs) vegetation regardless of habitat value. Non-point source pollution : pollution with diffuse sources as compared to pollution with a specific and known outlet. PAM (anionic polyacrylamide) : a soil conditioner that decreases soil loss by holding fine soil particles together in larger aggregates Pathogen : a disease causing agent. Important pathogens in foodborne illnesses include bacteria, helminths, protozoans, coccoid parasites and viruses (Harris et al., 2003). Processors : Companies that contract for product to be grown and/or buy, receive and process leafy green products for \"value added\" packaged products such as bagged iceberg and romaine lettuce, spinach, spring mix, etc. Many processing companies also ship their product to wholesale distributors and retail and foodservice buyers.Rangeland : Pasture areas on which cattle or other domestic animals graze. Retail and foodservice buyers : Grocers, restaurants, hospitals, schools, prisons, hotels, cruise ships, military, airlines and others that purchase fresh and/or value-added leafy green products from wholesale buyers, shippers, processors, and growers for sale to consumers. Some corporate grocers and foodservice companies provide their own trucking/shipping fleet to transport products from wholesale buyers or processorsRiparian : of or relating to the banks of a stream, creek or river. Sediment basin : a basin or off stream pond constructed to capture sediment as well as handle excess run-off. Aims to reduce run-off and erosion and reduce the transport of potential pollutants including nutrients, agricultural chemicals, and pathogens.Shippers : Companies that transport fresh and/or value-added leafy green products to wholesale distributors and retail and foodservice buyers.Synergistic effect : when an injury caused by exposure to two environmental factors together is greater than the sum of exposure to each factor individually. For example, an interaction that has more than additive effects; for example, when the joint toxicity of two compounds is greater than their combined, independent toxicities. Tailwater : The runoff of irrigation water from the lower end of an irrigated field. Tailwater recovery system : a facility to collect, store, and transport irrigation tailwater for reuse in farm irrigation systems as well as acting as a sediment and nutrient detention basin. Aimed to aid in water conservation and to protect water quality.Vegetated treatment systems : areas of permanent vegetation used for agricultural wastewater treatment. Aims to improve water quality by reducing the runoff of potential pollutants including nutrients, organic waste, agricultural chemicals and pathogens.Vertebrates : animals with backbones. Water bodies : On-farm and near-farm water bodies include man-made and natural features. Man-made water bodies are those that do not occur naturally in the landscape; they range from drainage and supply ditches to irrigation reservoirs and tailwater basins. Natural water bodies include natural ponds, wetlands, rivers and streams. Wetland : An area of land typically flooded for part of the year with hydrophytic vegetation.

Stuart. Food Safety and Environmental Quality Impose Conflicting Demands on Central Coast Growers. California Agriculture 62(2):68-73 ARTICLE SUMMARY :Growers of fresh produce on the Central Coast of California currently face conflicting demands regarding measures to protect food safety and those to protect environmental quality. To explore the extent of conflicting pressures and identify the range of possible impacts on the environment, we conducted a survey of Central Coast irrigated-row-crop growers during spring 2007. The results indicate that growers are experiencinga clear conflict, and some are incurring economic hardships because their practices to protect the environment have resulted in the rejection of crops by buyers. In addition, some growers are being encouraged to or are actively removing conservation practices for water quality, and most growers are taking action to discourage or eliminate wildlife from and adjacent to croplands. These actions could affect large areas of land on the Central Coast and,as indicated by growers, they are likely to increase over time.Appendix D.

Consumer concerns are heightened, national legislative efforts to develop mandatory, enforceable food safety standards are underway, and growers are under increasing pressure to comply with a complex array of food safety requirements and environmental regulatory obligations. The coordinated management ( co-management ) of food safety and environmental protection is being challenged by conflicts arising between these priorities, placing the agriculture industry in the difficult position of having to develop reasonable foodsafety standards and risk reducing actions based on an insufficient body of science to guide those efforts. Successful co-management must be informed about both the drivers and on-the-ground impacts resulting from the challenges confronting the agricultural industry. The Resource Conservation District of Monterey County, in collaboration with conservation organizations and agricultural industry groups, conducted a mail survey of Central Coast irrigated row crop operations to obtain aclearer understanding of the drivers and impacts of this conflict. This survey was developed to: Better understand the key drivers presenting obstacles to co-management within the production,marketing, distribution and retail chain; Determine which farming operations are experiencing the most pressure as a result of the conflictingdemands; and Assess if and how the on-the-ground impacts of these challenges have changed over time. In the spring of 2009, the survey plus two follow-up post cards were mailed to all 647 known irrigated row cropoperations on the Central Coast (San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, San Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties). We received 178 completed surveys (27.5% response rate). Leafy green growers, large operations and conventional operations were most likely to experience co-management challenges. In addition, some organic operations and operations that produce strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and artichokes were facing similar challenges. The survey also found that respondents who sell their produce to processors or national or international buyers were most likely to experience challenges to co-management. Respondents who sell to grower-shippers reported similar experiences, but the survey suggests that some of the competing requirements coming through grower-shippers were originating from buyers higher up the market chain (processors and national/international buyers). In the current climate of zero tolerance for risk, co-management efforts are facing significant obstacles. The survey data suggest that the use of the Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement \"Metrics\" and food safety programs employed by national or international buyers and processors were most likely to present obstacles. The survey also suggests that food safety professionals conducting in-field audits were having a strong influence on co-management efforts. Respondents encountered potential obstacles to co-management as a result of in-field riskAppendix E. Executive Summaryfromthe 2009 Grower Survey FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION assessments that identify food safety concerns associated with environmental features and the requirement that corrective action is taken as a conditional requirement to be able to sell the produce grown in proximity to the features of concern. Respondents who sell to processors and national or international buyers experienced more pressure from the auditors representing these companies that may result in challenges to co-management.Respondents were in a challenging position needing to balance steps to ensure safe food with environmental protection goals. The sometimes seemingly incompatible demands between food safety and environmental protection and subsequent actions taken to address food safety concerns associated with environmental features have the potential to result in negative environmental impacts. The data suggest there was a reduction in the use of the less environmentallysensitive practices since 2008. As the agricultural community refines its approach to protecting food safety, the in- field dynamic between food safety and environmental protection will continue to evolve. Respondents were investing significant resources into efforts to ensure food safety and protect the environment. Growers also were bearing the majority of costs and losses as a result of conflicts between food safety guidelines andenvironmental protection. Economies of scale appeared to be a relevant factor placing smaller operations at a disadvantage and potentially increasing their financial susceptibility to costs associated with increasing regulationsand challenges to co-management. The results of this survey contribute significantly to our understanding of some of the drivers and points of influence creating challenges to co-management for food safety and environmental protection. Based on these findings, it isclear that efforts to promote co-management will require open dialogue and collaboration amongst the agriculturalindustry (including handlers and buyers), food safety scientists and private companies, human health and environmental regulatory agencies, and environmental scientists and organizations.

Individual buyer and auditor company names have been removed and noted generically as BUYER or PRIVATE AUDITCOMPANY. Names of specific landscape features are redacted. Acreage is described in four groups: 200-500 acres, 500-1000 acres, 1000-3000 acres and > 3000 acres. The term \"grower\" has been used to refer to the interviewee throughout, though some interviewees may be managers of food safety or other aspects of farm management. Interviewees were selected from several counties in the Central Coast region. Grower 1 (> 3000 acres, assorted vegetables and lettuce, mostly conventional). Approximately 97% of their operation is conventional and 3% organic. They grow a variety of vegetable crops as well as lettuce, including romaine, and cabbage for FIVE BUYERS On Food Safety Standards The LGMA standards seem reasonable and doable to grower. There have been some costs associated with the LGMA due to the required fee and increased paperwork and water testing. However, most of the food safety measures theyalready had in place due to demands from their buyers. The BUYER standards, on the other hand, are \"so extreme they are barely manageable.\" Now OTHER BUYERS are copying BUYER and starting to use similarly extreme standards because they have to compete. Grower says, \"They are playing catch-up.\" \"They are so far on the sideof caution, just to minimize liability.\" BUYER has strict rules about amphibians. They refused to take crops from a whole ranch that is about 1800 feet long because there was a pond with tadpoles in it on one end of the ranch. Normally, this grower would have just added copper sulfate to the pond, but the pond was right by their organicfields so they didn't want to. So they could not sell anything from that ranch to BUYER. Grower says, \"It was ridiculous.\" Grower applies the LGMA standards to all ranches and all vegetable fields. This is because the areas where certain crops are grown change frequently. Overall, food safety has been expensive requiring four full-time employees for paperwork and audits and two people to check bait stations regularly. Food safety management has cost them about $38 an acre. Grower does not think that food safety pressure is still escalating, but rather that standards are more stringently enforced now. Grower tells a story of how, last year, an auditor representing a buyer said they would takecrops a half-mile from domesticated animals (even though their standards require a one mile buffer), but this year on the same property they said they would not take the crops. They claimed that now they \"could more accurately measure the distance.\" Grower added, \"it is not like they invented new ways of measuring distance anytime recently.\" His experience has been that food safety measures from these companies are not negotiable. Grower has made some changes even before being told to do so because grower knew that there would be problems otherwise. One time, five acres of cropland were rejected due to animal intrusion and they lost about $17,000 in one shot. The LGMA audits seem fine and they get good marks. Grower would not say they are terribly consistent, though. Some auditors are \"more picky than others.\" Auditors from processors and buyers are not consistent at all and it can depend on the market. The auditors \"change their minds depending on the market.\" For example, growerdescribes how once some pigs ran through his field of lettuces. When BUYER came to harvest half of it they markedAppendix F. Summaries of Grower Interviews fromMarch-April2009 AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org97SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION off about 40 feet on all sides of the pig tracks and harvested the rest. They came back for the rest of the field the next week, but in the meantime a hurricane had hit Mexico and wiped out the crop down there. They were short on produce and cut within two feet of the same pig tracks, totally violating both their own and the LGMA standards. Grower is frustrated by these events and says, \"and they say it is not market-related!\" Grower describes another incident that happened to someone grower knows. BUYER came to harvest and flagged off a corner of the field where there were animal tracks and harvested the rest. Then later, for a field at the same location, they rejected 20 acresof crops because of the same tracks, just because the market had changed and was flooded (they did not need the produce). Grower explains why the growers are powerless in these situations, \"there is a short list of people you cangrow for and some of them own the land you farm.\" The larger impacts to farmers and the farming community include more stress and costs, and some growers say they have had enough and retire early. \"It is causing moresoul-searching.\" Grower thinks that new food safety standards might make food safer because everybody is doing something about it now. The most important thing is to bring the baseline up a bit. Now everyone is more conscious about things. On the Environment Grower has made buffers and rearranged crops to meet buffer requirements. They did not have conservation practices, but were planning to, and buffer requirements made them decide not to. They have stopped using pondsfor irrigation, but have not filled them in. They have not put in fences, but have about 2000 bait stations and thousands of mousetraps. They would have to install three to four miles of fence, so fencing is not economical. Theyhave taken out a bunch of grasses and weedy vegetation and removed trees to reduce foreign object contamination complaints. Grower explains that BUYER is \"paranoid about frogs.\" As described above, they refused crops from an entire ranch due to tadpole presence. Therefore, they treat almost all of their ponds with copper sulfate to avoid such scenarios. \"It is expensive to use copper sulfate, but they put it in all ponds and ditches.\" Grower states that copper sulfate is intended to reduce bacteria as well as to eliminate amphibians. Grower is not sure about the environmental impacts of copper sulfate. Grower thinks, \"it probably breaks down pretty quickly and is probably not an issue.\" BUYER'S auditors told grower to remove vegetation from along a creek because it could harbor wildlife. Grower refused because \"the area is already erosion prone and it would be a disaster.\" They still take crops from those fields, so it must be ok for now. Grower says, \"there is no question that these standards are impacting the environment.\" Grower says that the LGMA standards aren't as bad as the private company standards. They are trapping all of the mice, and sometimes birds get in the traps. Grower is not sure how all this impacts the food chain and the foxes and coyotes. His perception of wildlife has changed. Before, grower thought that animals were nice to see, and now they only portend a big problem. They are currently paying their neighbors to not have horses and goats on their land just so they don't have to have big buffers. Grower says food safety standards (both LGMA and private standards) put them in a hard place regarding practices for water quality and erosion control. Grower explains, \"the processors say you can't plant grass without a big buffer, but to have the big buffer you have to take so much land out of production that it would cost so much money. It is not possible.\" Not being able to use their tailwater, they have to dump more water downstream now. Grower explains they can't even use it for dust control. Grower shares, \"the water quality farm plan has not dictated anything. Although it is a thought-provoking exercise, it doesn't really influence our practices.\" However, grower recalls how after hearing about pesticide levels in [name redacted for anonymity] creek they decided to keep their tailwater out of the creek and actually set aside two acres of land in order to sprinkle back the tailwater onto the land rather than put it into the creek. Grower states, \"and this is land that could be being used to grow crops and costs us $1200/acre in rent.\" AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org98SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND REGION Grower 2 (grower and grower-shipper, >3000 acres, leafy greens, vegetables, conventional) Grows iceburg lettuce, romaine lettuce, red and green leaf lettuce, celery, chard, kale and a variety of vegetables. They function as a grower and also a grower-shipper. They sell to THREE BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards Grower thinks that pressure regarding food safety seems to be leveling off now. Grower does not think that new food safety standards are putting any growers out of business. They apply the LGMA standards to everything they grow,even broccoli and cauliflower. \"It is easier to treat all of the fields the same.\" They have to use even stricter standards for their buyers. The CDFA audits have not really affected them. They have found a few things that were minor. The CDFA auditors are not all that consistent. \"The newer auditors seem to be a bit overzealous.\" Grower thinks that the water sampling measures are \"overboard.\" Food safety standards are expensive because of the costs for personnel and the paperwork. \"There are so many audits.\" The LGMA has added costs through water testing requirements. They have only lost a little bit of land dueto buffers. TWO BUYERS have extreme requirements. \"Their buffers are too big.\" They also have a \"huge fear of amphibians... they see any tadpoles and they say to get rid of them.\" They have lost up to $17,500 at one time due to animal intrusion. Although grower has heard of it happening, s/he has not experienced any auditors changing their standards based on the market. On the Environment Grower has removed vegetation and trees in response to auditors' comments to keep fields clean. The auditorsrepresenting the buyers were making demands prior to the LGMA. They would give grower a list of prohibited blocks of land from which they would not take product with an explanation of why it was prohibited. For example, the document would say, \"too close to trees,\" \"too much vegetation nearby\" or \"near ponds and reservoirs.\" BUYER, to whom they sell heads of lettuce, is the strictest. Ponds are a big problem. \"We used to have ponds with fish and tulle that were nice to see, and now we have to clean them out.\" They use copper sulfate on two ponds they have and filled in another reservoir by bulldozing it over. \"It was too much of a pain to manage.\" Grower reports that they have not put up any fences, but have gotten depredation permits from Fish and Game for pigs. They also havelots of bait stations in their fields. Grower thinks that the LGMA rules do conflict with water quality efforts. They farm on pretty flat land and have never installed any conservation practices, but have removed other vegetation and trees. They removed willow trees and eucalyptus. Grower knows of one farm located on steep slopes that had to get rid of its conservation practices due to food safety issues with their auditors. Grower thinks that BUYER standards really conflict with environmental efforts. Grower's perception of wildlife has changed a bit, \"maybe.\" Grower likes having wildlife around and seeing wildlife, \"but not in my fields.\" In his/her fields, wildlife has become a problem. They have cannons and noisemakers in order to keep wildlife away. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org99SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Grower 3 (grower-shipper, 1000-2000 acres, leafy greens and vegetables, all organic) Grower # 3 runs a large organic vegetable business that grows over 40 different vegetables. Grower is a grower- shipper and sells to FIVE BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards The buyers requested they use PRIVATE AUDIT COMPANY to have audits a couple times every year. Now they alsohave the CDFA auditors for the LGMA. They had to sign the LGMA when Canada said it would not take any produce that was not certified by the LGMA. The standards that the buyers require do not exceed those of the LGMA, but it is starting to sound as if they might in the future. BUYER really wants them to use Global GAP standards. The CDFA auditors seem pretty consistent so far. They have turned down pre-harvest requests from their buyers. The LGMA requires more paperwork and that fields look cleaner. Fences have been costly, and the overall load on the operation has increased because of monitoring and inspections. Grower says, \"small farmers can't survive if they are having to implement all of this stuff. They can't afford to take the costs and spread it through the operation. I haven't heard of anyone going out of business, but they can't comply with certain standards.\" On the Environment For the LGMA standards, they have had to take out vegetation to make 30 foot buffers around fields and have hadto clear out brush to put up fences. The fences are designed to keep deer out. They also use noise at night, like talk radio, but it doesn't seem to work. They created setbacks from all waterways. They had and continue to have conservation practices. They put in hedgerows and have been able to keep those. They just tell the auditors that it is essential to have beneficial insects, even though the auditors don't like it. They had to take their buffer strips out. Grower says, \"if you don't follow the LGMA rules, you lose your crop and can't sell it. If you take out the conservation practices, you lose nothing.\" Grower does not think that the standards are based on science. \"There is no science to back them up. They say remove vegetation, but I have seen studies showing that filter strips have just the opposite effect [reducing chances of contamination].\" Grower goes on to explain, \"Well they don't actually say remove it, but they say you must have a buffer around it if you want to keep it or you can't plant around it. So we have to take out the strips. That is business.\" The CDFA auditors do tell them they can't harvest fields with too many animal tracks in them. So they have to keep wildlife away. Grower says that the LGMA standards have definitely impacted the environment and conflict with environmental efforts. Grower says that fencing off the land cuts off wildlife movement and that taking out filter strips will increase erosion and runoff. \"The LGMA definitely contradicts with water quality, but food safety puts you out of business faster, so you have to follow those rules.\" Grower's view of wildlife has not really changed because s/he has always tried to keep them out of the fields. Grower says, \"my attitude about wildlife hasn't changed, but our management has changed because it has been forced on us. Deer and wildlife don't carry E. coli, cattle and people do.\" AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org100SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S REGION Grower 4: (grower, 500-1000 acres, lettuce and artichokes, conventional) Grower # 4 grows artichokes and bulkhead lettuce - all conventionally grown. Grower does not do any shipping. On Food Safety Standards: The only standards impacting grower are the LGMA standards. Grower does not sell to any buyers who require additional standards. BUYER has its own auditor, but grower also complies with the LGMA standards for now. Grower has applied the LGMA standards to all of his fields (leafy greens or not), but has less pressure to follow standards with the artichokes. Grower believes that pressure regarding food safety is still increasing, since grower is being asked to do more things all the time. Grower believes that the LGMA auditors are fairly consistent with theirremarks. Grower has not experienced BUYER switching its standards or any rejections based on market conditions,but grower has heard of it happening. Adopting the LGMA has required some adjustments, but has not been too bad. Grower thinks that a few measures, such as monthly water tests, are a bit overboard. Putting up fences has been the most costly piece in addition to the loss of cropland through the creation of buffers. Grower thinks that food safety measures are especially hard for small growers who have less staff and resources. Grower believes thatfood safety standards as required by the LGMA are probably making food safer overall. On Environmental Impacts: Grower has taken out vegetation, \"all kinds and any kinds,\" in a 40 foot buffer zone around fields. Grower has also installed deer fences around fields. The auditor did not tell grower to install the fence, but grower installed it due to problems with animal intrusion and fear of crop rejection. One time grower lost $50,000 due to raccoon and deer tracks in a field. Grower does not use bait stations. Grower has never installed any conservation practices for water quality beyond using cover crops in the winter. Grower has no waterways or ponds on the land grower farms. Grower believes that the LGMA standards definitely conflict with efforts to reduce erosion and protect water quality. Grower sprays all vegetation to keep the fields clean and says that doing so will increase erosion and run-off. Grower is sure that there is more erosion from the fields now. \"You can see all the new sources of erosion just from driving around.\" Grower does not believe that his/her perceptions of wildlife have changed and still likes wildlife. \"I put up all the fences because I don't want to shoot the deer.\" Grower 5 (1000-2000 acres, growers, lettuces and vegetables, conventional and organic) They are growers and do not do any shipping. They produce a variety of vegetables and lettuces. They sell to FIVE BUYERS.On Food Safety Standards: They try to apply the LGMA standards to all of their crops. Grower thinks that, overall, food safety pressure is leveling off a bit, or at least it is less hectic than before because everyone is getting used to it and accepting it as part of the process of farming. The CDFA auditors come a couple times each year. They also have audits from TWO PRIVATE AUDIT COMPANIES and auditors from the shippers. CDFA takes notes on conditions and does not make any suggestions or give advice. They note proximity to standing water and other things and follow the rules of the metrics. Grower says that animal harborage has not been a problem for CDFA auditors. Other auditors from shippers AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org101SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION and third party certifiers give instructions on what should be done to mitigate problems. They have told them to put in bait stations and remove vegetation. They have been asked to remove vegetation around wells. Grower says that the LGMA is not a problem and is actually improving as the metrics are refined. Grower says, \"the real problem is the arms race between shippers, who are probably getting pressure from retailers.\" Grower describes how, in many cases, one shipper with new requirements forces you to retool the whole operation because it is easier to standardize everything. They had to hire a new person to deal with food safety, and that was costly. The shippers' requirements are \"too much\" and require larger buffers that are difficult to make. Grower says, \"One auditor for BUYER said they would not take crops within two miles of a compost pile, even though the same compost goes on the fields.\" Grower thinks that small farmers are not going to be able to meet all of the demands because they won't have enough time to produce all of the documentation that is required. \"If it isn't written down, it is like it didn't happen.\" The LGMA auditors seem consistent with their comments (they do not reject fields, only send reports to the main office), but the shippers' auditors do not seem consistent. They had a contract with BUYER for processed lettuce on two fields. The first field was ready to harvest but was rejected due to animal intrusion (deer tracks). The second field was not mature yet, but it too was rejected it too because it was in close proximity to the deer tracks. At this time, the market was \"in the dumps.\" They disked the first field but left the second one, hoping to find another buyer. When the market picked up, however, BUYER called back and wanted the second field it had previously rejected.Another time when the market was bad, BUYER rejected a field that had bird poop on it. They said it had rained too much that they could not see where the poop was and flag it off. However, other times when they could not identify where birds had pooped, BUYER still took the crops. On the Environment: They have worked with the RCD to install conservation practices. They have a total of seven locations with grassed waterways and/or catch basins. Grower says, \"the auditors [for BUYER] said these were possible harborage for wildlife and wanted us to either get rid of them or put buffers around them.\" They called up the boss at BUYER and told grower what the auditor said and that they would not install a buffer or fence or remove the waterways and catch basins. BUYER still bought the crops. Grower says, \"any standing water is a concern and needs to be crystal clear.\" They use chlorine and copper sulfate, which grower says is pretty expensive. They treat the ponds now before the auditors even say anything because they know if it is murky and not clear, it will be a big issue. They try to get rid of most standing water by pumping it out. They can't use reservoirs anymore and filled a couple in. They have also filled in ditches, but not grassed waterways. Their biggest and oldest grassed waterway is now \"a huge liability,\" and they are considering removing it. \"It has a history as an audit topic and they have to argue about it every time.\" Grower says it is also a lot of work to keep out unwanted vegetation and keep it mowed and clean. They have hired a night watchman who drives around all night making noise to scare away wildlife. They have not put up any fences, but do have depredation permits. They have bait stations with poisoned bait and traps according to different auditors' requests. Last year, they placed the bait and traps everywhere as a preventative measure and as \"eye candy for the auditors.\" This year, they are only putting them up when requested. They do a lot of things \"preemptively\" because they know that auditors will be unhappy with things. Their \"preemptive\" measures include bait stations, grass and brush removal, tree trimming and the application of copper sulfate to ponds. He thinks that food safety standards from shippers and processors are impacting the environment. \"More pesticides are being used for vegetation and rodents. We would not be putting copper sulfate in the ponds if we didn't have to. We have to because if we don't we would definitely lose the contracts and lose our business.\" There is more erosion now. \"We had a hillside with annual grasses and shrubs and knew it would be a problem, so we disked it, and now we have 'rill' erosion down the hillside that is filling up our ditches.\" There are also impacts on wildlife. They did AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org102SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION not want to put up fences, so they got depredation permits to appease the auditors. They have to use the permits a bit or else they might be taken away, but they don't want to kill the deer. Grower is not sure if the LGMA makes it harder to protect or improve water quality, but grower says that the shippers' requirements definitely conflict withwater quality goals. Regarding water quality, grower says, \"we are not quite back to the way it was 15 years ago, but we are definitely going backwards, with more pollution coming from the ranches.\" Grower says that his/her perception of wildlife has definitely changed, \"I hate to say it, because I am more of a nature lover than most of them. I liked wildlife being around, but now I view it as more of a pest than before. Other people used to shoot a coyote, when I thought about how it was eating squirrels and other pests. Now I see a coyoteand think how much money it could cost me.\" Grower says that food safety requirements and water quality effortsput them in a difficult position. \"Many practices for water quality directly conflict with the 'scorched earth' requirements for food safety, but food safety wins because it affects if we stay in business.\" Grower says that water quality is important too, but can't compete. Grower says that if they want to stand up to their buyers' standards it could make them look like a \"black sheep.\" \"It is hard to fight against food safety. It is like fighting against world peace. But all the stuff we have to do is not for food safety. It is just an excuse to do other things, and the concept is being used by the buyers.\" Grower 6 (grower/shipper, 500-1000 acres, lettuces and vegetables, conventional and organic) Grows romaine, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, endive, escarole, radicchio, and fris\u00e9e. They mostly function asa grower but do a little bit of shipping as well. They are about 90% conventional and 10% organic. They sell toFOUR BUYERS On Food Safety Standards: Grower says they apply the LGMA to all crops because it is easier to have one set of standards. CDFA conducts audits for the LGMA. The auditors have a checklist that they have to stick to. There are no surprises because it is all based on the metrics. They seem to be very consistent and do a good job. They don't give any suggestions or advice. Theywould simply write that there was too much vegetation in proximity on the report. They will look for wildlife intrusion and if they find it, they do not do anything and might not even note this in their report. If something iswrong, the LGMA people will send them back the report and give them a time frame in which to address the problem, but they don't tell them how to fix it. The CDFA auditors don't look for amphibians. They stick to their checklist. If they try to deviate, this grower tells them it is not on the checklist, and they drop the issue. Grower says the LGMA rules are \"reasonable and seem to be working.\" Grower says, \"the LGMA is no problem, it is like an open book test. You know the rules and it is crystal clear.\" Grower says the shippers have more strict standards than the LGMA. They call for bigger buffers from waterways and animals. They have some room for negotiation regarding water-testing schedules. Grower thinks that pressure regarding food safety seems to be leveling off a bit. Grower thinks that the LGMA is getting \"well refined\" and that most of the buyers are using the LGMA (except for processors). Grower explains how TWO BUYERS' standards go above and beyond the LGMA with bigger buffer zones, rules about amphibian presence (\"they are paranoid about amphibians\") and thorough inspections of waterways. Grower thinks that BUYER is now coming around and getting their standards closer to those in the LGMA, except as far as buffer zones are concerned. All of this has been costly, but mostly in terms of personal time, as grower spends about half a day each week on food safety. Overall, it is probably not forcing anyone out of business, but it is time consuming. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org103SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Grower says that auditors for the shippers \"absolutely\" are inconsistent and change their minds. Grower describes one experience grower had where BUYER said it would not take any crop from a ranch due to \"the potential for amphibians.\" So they made a deal with someone else to harvest it. But after the other company came and said itwas clean, BUYER changed its mind, bought it from the other company and harvested it. Grower says, \"When themarket is good, they will take it. Their own standards are flexible, and if it is clean they will take it.\" Grower says, \"On the other side, if the market is bad, they will find an excuse not to take it. BUYER rejects whole fields. Food safety is used as a tool not to accept some crops due to market conditions.\" On the Environment They have fenced around their organic ranches whose crops they sell to BUYER. It is the only place they have any wildlife presence. They also have a depredation permit for wild pigs. Processors want to see clean ponds and no amphibians, so they use copper sulfate. Grower's catch basins present a problem and must be treated for amphibians.On most of his ranches, they do not have much wildlife. Although they have wildlife near their organic ranches, they tell the food safety auditors that it is part of the organic standards and they can't try to control wildlife. The auditors then go back to using the LGMA standards for their organic fields and flag off areas where there has been animal intrusion. On the conventional fields, the buyers request that bait stations be put up. They are no longer allowed to use their reservoirs because they could attract wildlife. Without being told to do so, in general they keep all of the ranches cleaner because they know auditors will be looking at them. If frogs are present, they will be prohibited from growing for processors in certain blocks, not matter how much copper sulfate they use. Grower thinks the processors' standards impact the environment. Grower says, \"I am not happy about using copper sulfate. I would rather coexist with the frogs.\" On some of the ranches with really bad amphibian problems grower has let the leases go. Grower says, \"You can't control Mother Nature- when frogs want to cross your field, they are going to cross your field.\" Grower also thinks that, in general, cleaner ranches will have more runoff. Grower explains that his organic fields are near some steep slopes that they keep planted with vegetation through the winter. Grower says that if this were a conventional farm, there is no way they could keep that vegetation, and its removal would result in a lot of erosion. Regarding organic operation, grower says, \"we don't want it to be sterile- we want the good insects around.\" They have grassed waterways and catch basins near the organic fields, but none near the conventional. When the auditors complain grower just tells them, \"Sorry, it is part of the system.\" However, they suggest grower removes them almost every day, and it is a constant problem. However, Grower says, \"If we didn't catch the tailwater, it would just flood over into other fields.\" Some buyers won't take crops from this field, but grower has found other buyers with \"less stringent standards.\" Grower is not sure if the LGMA conflicts with efforts to improve water quality. Grower explains that his fields were all already pretty clean before the LGMA. The other standards have greater impacts. Grower says that his perception of wildlife has changed. \"Wildlife use to be free to roam as long as there was no crop damage. Now all the organic ranches are fenced off because wildlife means you lose money.\" Grower says that growers do put poison out for birds and that has been going on for years, partly to reduce what the birds eat when crops are germinating. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org104SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY REGION Grower 7 (Grower/shipper, 1000-3000 acres, vegetables, lettuce, spring mix, organic and conventional) Grower for a big shipper . They grow almost all vegetable crops and lettuces, including spring mix. About 25% of their production is organic. They sell to grocery store chains and also to processors including THREE BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards: They try to apply the LGMA to all crops, because that is what their customers want. Grower says, \"the LGMA audit is just an audit. They don't do any advising and they are fairly consistent. Some of it depends on if the auditor is having a good or bad day. But it is black and white and you know what to expect.\" Grower says the CDFA auditors are not looking to reject your fields. If they find any wildlife intrusion or tracks, they simply want to see how you handle it, \"Do you flag it off right, are you documenting everything.\" Grower says that they don't tell you how to fix any problems; they just write it up on the report and do not consult. While the LGMA is alright, grower says that the \"real problem is not everybody is on the same page and want other requirements. These companies are all trying to be one step ahead and it needs to all be the same.\" Grower says that other auditors representing differentprocessors and customers are totally different. They come in and say, \"You need to do this and do that.\" Grower saysthat the salad plants are the worst and those that buy heads of lettuce are not too worried. Grower says that theirdemands are not negotiable. Grower reports that processors are definitely inconsistent with their standards. \"If they need a crop bad, they will take it. For example, just yesterday they changed the date on an old audit and used it because there was not time to do a new one that the customer wanted.\" Grower says that in other cases, \"they will look the other way.\" Growerexplains that once the processor banned a ranch, but then when they really needed product, they bought from thatranch anyway. On the Environment: Salad plant auditors tell grower, \"This tree is too close, you are too close to the river, too close to cows.\" Grower says that they say, \"If you remove this, then I will approve it.\" They have been told to increase buffers, cut down trees AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org105SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION and remove brush. Grower says that, due to BUYER, they cut down about 3000 Eucalyptus trees. BUYER told grower that the trees provided too much habitat and had to go in order for them to buy product. They have also removed big oaks and cypress trees. They are required to use bait stations, so they do. They have fenced along the river to keep out deer and pigs. They use blue tablets of copper sulfate in all of their ponds. Grower says that the processors \"don't like frogs.\" They treat all standing water for all crops. Most ponds need to hold tailwater, but if they are unnecessary, they just fill the reservoir. They are not allowed to use the reservoirs anymore so they justbulldoze them over. He says that they use cover crops to reduce erosion in the winter where there are steep slopes. They don't have any grassed waterways. Grower thinks that all of the demands for fences and for keeping birds out are overkill. The environmental impacts include \"impacts to squirrels, field mice, and birds -and the fencing cuts off pathways.\" Grower thinks that food safety conflicts with water quality goals in some places where you are not allowed to line the banks with vegetation due to possible wildlife habitat. Grower says that the food safety issues have definitelyimpacted his view of wildlife. \"I used to see a fox and thought it was cool. Now I see a fox and it pisses me off, and I want to shoot it and bury it with a backhoe. This is all because of food safety.\" Grower 8 (grower, 500-1000 acres, lettuce and vegetables, conventional and organic) They grow asparagus, alfalfa and romaine, green leaf, red leaf and head lettuce. They are just growers and do not do any shipping. They sell to THREE BUYERS. They have about one tenth of their land in organic or transition to organic production. On Food Safety Standards: They apply the LGMA to all crops except alfalfa. The CDFA auditors come a couple times each year. Their auditors have mostly consistent except for one instance, when an auditor was looking into his shed and examining equipment not even used for leafy greens. It seems to grower like the auditors are getting better. The first year, the auditors were not as consistent, and now they stick to their check-list. The CDFA auditors have never brought up any issues regarding wildlife and wildlife habitat. Grower says that BUYER have standards that are pretty much in line with the LGMA. BUYER is much more stringent regarding their water testing and the proximity of crops to creeks and ditches. Grower explains that they used to grow crops for processing, for TWO BUYERS, but their standards were so severe that they got out of the processing business and now only grow commodity crops. That changed everything. Grower thinks that food safety demands are leveling off. \"We are learning more and backing off of certain areas.\" Grower says that companies and buyers are still ramping up and \"want them to be more and more sterile.\" Grower thinks that lawsuits are driving this. Grower personally has not recently experienced any inconsistency with the buyers. Grower does not sell to processors anymore, however. Grower says they used to have problems when they sold to BUYER. \"We were in a processing deal with BUYER and got out because their excuses were due to the market, not food safety. In a good market, they would trip over themselves for garbage crops.\" On the Environment They have never had a whole field lost to intrusion and do not have any depredation permits. BUYER wants bait stations up, and they did this the first year and put up stations all over. But now they only put them up if there is a problem. They installed a barrier fence last year. They have not had to remove much vegetation. They were told to AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org106SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION remove some shrubs and trees but refused to. BUYER still took the crop. Grower explains that they are in a good position because they have great ground and are really good growers. Therefore, they can negotiate with buyers andfind other buyers if one is being too strict. For them, grower says that food safety does not conflict with water quality. Grower says that because they are a top grower they have more power. They have had grassed waterways in for 15 years and the auditors are used to it. If the new auditor has a problem, grower calls up the boss, and if they don't want their product, they find another buyer. Grower says they are in a pretty good situation. Grower says his perspective of wildlife has changed a bit over the years. Overall, though, grower likes wildlife and says, \"Farming will never be sterile, so don't try to make it that way- there is not that much you can do.\" Grower 9: (grower, 1000-2000 acres, lettuce and vegetables, conventional) Currently grows lettuces, artichokes, cauliflower, broccoli and celery. They sell their artichokes to BUYER and the other crops to FOUR BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards They apply the LGMA standards to every crop. All of their shippers require the LGMA standards for all vegetable crops, even those not eaten raw. They have only had one CDFA audit so far. The auditor stuck to the checklist anddid not do any advising. Grower cannot say if the CDFA auditors are consistent because they have only had one audit. All of the shippers go beyond the LGMA in their own way. They are stricter regarding flooding and the widths ofbuffers. One of the shippers, BUYER, now requires that Global GAP standards be met. Food safety pressures arestill ramping up and have not leveled off yet. The shippers are definitely inconsistent with food safety standards. Grower says that although farm has not personally experienced this inconsistency, knows that it exists. The LGMA paperwork and documentation is really burdensome. Regarding shippers and buyers' standards, grower says, \"Everyone is trying to one-up each other, especially in retail. They all want to claim to have the safest food.\" On the Environment They have ranches right along the [ name redacted for anonymity ] river. This is a problem regarding animal intrusion, because the shippers won't take their crops where there is animal intrusion. They lost 10 acres of crop, about $32,000 worth, from one incidence of deer intrusion. They have had to build fences all along the river, and more will be added. There is a fence between their fields and a wildlife refuge as well. They have been asked to remove riparian vegetation along the river, but they told the auditors (representing a shipper) that \"it is protected riparian vegetation and we cannot remove it.\" The shipper still took the crops. Other auditors representing shippershave asked them to remove trees, and they comply when the landlord will allow it. They have depredation permits for deer, but fences are more effective. The fences are very expensive, though. \"It cost us $100,000 to fence off a 180 acre ranch.\" Bait stations are used in the winter, and traps are used during harvest season for rodents. They cannot have amphibians and use frog fences where needed. They cannot have any standing water. They don't use copper sulfate, because they don't have any more standing water. Grower says that food safety is definitely negatively impacting the environment. The fencing impacts wildlife migration. They have to have everything clean and all the ditches clean, which means \"less grasses and lessfiltration.\" Grower says there is probably more runoff now. Grower says that all of their perceptions of wildlife AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org107SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION have changed. \"It used to be cool to see deer and a fawn out in field. They didn't eat that much crop- but now they are public enemy number 1. Whole fields and ranches can be rejected due to deer.\" Grower says they need to prove that deer don't carry E. coli O157:H7. \"They need to take deer off the list; they don't carry it.\" Grower says that the deer standard is overkill. Grower also says that there is a lot of conflict between the Ag waiver program and the LGMA and shippers' standards. Grower 10: (grower, >3000 acres, lettuce and vegetables, conventional and organic) They grow head lettuce, leaf lettuce, romaine, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions, pumpkins and strawberries. They sell FIVE BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards They apply the LGMA to all of their crops and even try to apply them to strawberries. They have had a total of 14 CDFA audits for the LGMA. They have not all been consistent, especially early on. Some of the auditors were \"more diligent than others.\" They are now getting better at sticking to the list, but they can all interpret the list differently. Grower says, \"wildlife and vegetation are not an issue with the CDFA, because all of the shippers have much higherstandards that we were already following.\" The CDFA auditors do not give suggestions or advice; they just ask questions and take notes. The shippers' auditors do give suggestions or tell them what they need to do in order for them to be able to buy their crops. They say, \"You can't grow for us in this field,\" or \"You need bigger buffers around this field.\" All of them have standards beyond the LGMA with bigger buffers and more water sampling. They will either flat-out reject the crops or tell them to change something in order for them to be able to buy the crops. Grower doesn't think any ofthis is really making food any safer. They didn't find anything in their tests before and do not find anything now either. The shippers are definitely inconsistent regarding what makes crops acceptable or not. Once they knew a shipper who had too much romaine at the moment. The shipper rejected a whole ranch's worth of romaine for vague food safety reasons. But someone else took the crops right away- there was no problem with them. Grower says, \"The market drives the standards. If the market is really good, it is amazing what they will turn their heads to.\" On the Environment They are asked to clear brush and put up fences along the [ name redacted for anonymity ] river. They were not directly asked to put up fences, but they had crops rejected due to deer intrusion. Seeds from cottonwood treeswould get into the romaine, so they had to cut down a bunch of the trees. They have removed a lot of grass and shrubs because the auditors like to see clean fields. They have also removed a lot of saplings. Most all of their ponds and reservoirs have been bulldozed over because they were a problem. Frogs have not been a big issue for them, since they don't have water bodies around anymore. Their catch basins were mostly all bulldozed. They have bait stations everywhere. They don't use traps, only bait or nothing. Grower says, \"They have been really good at eradicating the squirrels.\" On their strawberry fields they have bird traps. They also use bird blasters - noisemakers - and shoot blanks in order to scare away the birds. They do have depredation permits for deer. They have lost up to $250,000 in one incident from deer intrusion. They also have pig traps. They do have one old catch basin that used to have reeds in it. They had to put copper sulfate in it. Grower says that there are definitely environmental impacts resulting from the food safety standards, both the AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org108SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION LGMA and the shippers' standards. They have had to fence whole ranches and are \"clearing habitat and poisoning ponds.\" Grower says that there is more run-off due to less vegetation. Their CCOF auditor suggested they plant some vegetation around their organic ranch that is hillier and prone to erosion. Grower responded, \"Yeah right. That is not possible with food safety rules.\" They used to have grassed waterways, but had to kill all of the vegetation due to food safety standards. Grower says that people are putting out bird poison illegally. Grower says the LGMA definitely conflicts with the Ag Waiver program. All of their water is going into the river, and they cannot use catch basins and vegetation, so more water is going into the river. Grower says, \"People can't do these practices anymore because they are not allowed to have grasses.\" With the LGMA, although they are technically allowed to have grasses, \"the buffer requirements for the LGMA make it unreasonable to installconservation practices.\" Grower says that you have to have a buffer of at least ten feet on each side and that \"tenfeet along a mile and a half is a lot of land that could be farmed.\" Grower says if you need the buffer on both sides that is at least 20 feet out of production on each side. That is not practical for business. Some people are using hay roles to reduce erosion instead of grasses. The standards from their shippers really conflict with the Ag waiverprogram. They are telling them to remove habitat and vegetation and have even larger buffer widths from potentialhabitat. BUYER's standard is 50 feet from potential habitat. Grower says that their perceptions of wildlife arechanging a bit. While they never really wanted to see wildlife in their fields before, \"now they are more aggressiveto keep it out at all costs.\" Grower 11 (Grower, 500-1000 acres, lettuce and vegetables, conventional) Grow iceberg lettuce, broccoli and radicchio, green beans, broccoli and cauliflower for seed and organic romaine and broccoli. They sell their produce TWO BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards They apply the LGMA metrics to all of their crops because the shippers demand it. They have only had one CDFA audit and so cannot say if CDFA audits are consistent. The audit went fine, and the auditor stuck to the checklist. Grower did give a bit of advice and took a little \"artistic license\" during the audit, but they did not have anyproblems. All of the shippers have their own pre-harvest audits. Grower says, \"When all this first started, we had neighbors with horses and could not use 200 acres due to the new buffer requirements. Now we have to use that land for growing seeds. We grew on that land for years with no problems. It is perfectly good land.\" They have had parts of fields rejected due to dog tracks and lost over $1000. Grower thinks that the water testing required by the LGMA is a bit overboard. The shippers say they have to have these standards for consumer confidence and that they \"have to do it for the customer.\" But grower thinks, \"It is not making food any safer- if it has, it is insignificant.\" Grower thinks the real problem is the mechanical harvesting of greens. \"It is done at night in the dark and people can't see what they are harvesting.\" Overall, grower says food safety pressures seem to be leveling out a bit. They have not experienced their shippers being inconsistent with food safety standards, but grower has friends that have. Grower says BUYER does it to growers all the time. Grower explains that when the market is really good, BUYER will buy crops from people that don't even following their year-round food safety program. That makes everyone who does follow the program really mad. One other grower that grower knows told BUYER that grower would sue them if they were to do that again. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org109SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION On the Environment Grower is told to keep wildlife out by his shippers, but says, \"I don't know if you really can keep wildlife out.\" The shippers tell grower to keep all of the field borders clean and to \"make the environment inhospitable to wildlife.\" Grower says, \"Wildlife are just trying to exist- so we just make it so there is nowhere to hide, drink or eat around here.\" They used to have grasses in the ditches to reduce erosion, but now they keep the ditches sprayed and clean to keep wildlife out. Grower admits that now they have more erosion. They put copper sulfate in their ponds because the shippers say they must have a pond policy. Grower states that copper sulfate is used for water quality, to allow more light in to kill bacteria. Grower says they don't really have frogs around here. Grower says that there are considerable environmental impacts. \"Everything we do is an environmental impact.\" Grower says they are making things \"cleaner\" on the fields, which is causing more erosion and run-off. They used to have grassed areas and grassed waterways \"that were beautiful\" and now they have a \"scorched earth policy.\"They got some free engineering from the RCD or the NCRS and had a tailwater system installed. It was really efficient, with up to 90% efficiency. Grower says, \"Now it is worthless, because we are not allowed to use it. Now we have to waste a bunch of water.\" Grower says that both the LGMA and the shippers' requirements conflict with water quality practices and the Ag Waiver. Grower says, \"They are exactly opposite. If you plant grasses to reduce non-point source pollution (whichis important), it flies right in the face of food safety standards.\" Grower explains, \"The buffer zones make it unreasonable to have grassed areas.\" They can't afford to take 50 feet out of production for the buffer zones, so they keep the ditches clean. Grower says that grower has always liked seeing wildlife because grower is a hunter and an outdoorsman. Grower doesn't personally feel any different about them, but his \"responses are different.\" Grower doesn't get angry at squirrels, but in contrast to prior years, s/he now responds by putting out more bait stations. Grower 12 (grower, 200-500 acres, lettuce and herbs, conventional) Grows red lettuce, green lettuce, head lettuce, endive, and butter lettuce, all conventionally. grower sells to THREE BUYERS. On Food Safety Standards They have PRIVATE AUDIT COMPANY come out on behalf of several shippers, so they apply the PRIVATE AUDIT COMPANY standards to everything they grow. Grower says the PRIVATE AUDIT COMPANY standards \"encompass the LGMA standards.\" The CDFA auditor has only come once so far, so grower cannot say if CDFA auditors are consistent. The auditor used the checklist and did not deviate from it too much. They did not do any advising. The other auditors are different. Grower has auditors from TWO PRIVATE AUDIT COMPANIES and TWO BUYERS. All of these auditors do advising, grower says. They want everything to be sterile, \"but nothing is a guarantee, they just want something to hang their hat on.\" Grower is frustrated and says that \"microbiologists working for these big companies are making the rules, but they have no idea about farming and the realities of the farm environment.\" Grower thinks that food safety pressures are still increasing and are not leveling off yet. What grower finds \"most disturbing\" is how retailers pressure the shippers into having these standards and the growers have to pay for it all. Grower thinks that food prices should go up to incorporate the increased costs of food safety. He says that shippers are definitely inconsistent and change their standards due to changes in the market. Grower explains that if a shipper is short on lettuce, or if they can get a good price for it \"they have a tiny buffer around a AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org110SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION gopher hole.\" Grower says that when the market is bad, or if they have too much product \"they flag off huge areas or reject entire fields for no reason.\" Grower says that the shippers are really ruthless. Grower describes what growercalls \"harvesting blight\" - when crops are rejected at harvest for no apparent reason. Food safety is used as an excuse in many cases. On the Environment He has been told by his shippers to put out bait stations. They used to have about 100 and now they have around 1000. They also installed a three-foot high fence along the creek to keep out rodents. They were told to remove vegetation along the creek that could serve as habitat and harbor wildlife. They cleared out a huge section of the creek. \"We probably took out about 90 truck loads of brush from along the creek.\" TWO PRIVATE AUDITCOMPANIES told them to remove it. They don't have any depredation permits for deer. They have a few reservoirs that they were treating with copper sulfate but have switched to ozone because it is less expensive, grower thinks. The auditors are really concerned about frogs, but they don't have any on his farm to speak of. Grower says that the LGMA does conflict with the Ag Waiver and water quality programs. They don't have any conservation practices, but grower explains, \"We would like to.\" Grower says, \"Grassed waterways and food safety don't mix.\" Grassed waterways would be habitat for rodents and amphibians. \"Shippers and buyers want a sterile condition and this conflicts with practices for water quality and wildlife.\" He thinks there are definitely environmental impacts from new food safety standards. \"We are cleaning out trees and brush- making it sterile. The grasses removed increase run-off. We have hillsides with no grasses now and I have to push the soil back up the hill. We used to have grasses, but they said it harbored wildlife.\" Grower says that hisperception of wildlife has changed. When grower sees a deer now, grower really wants it to keep off of the property because there are serious financial consequences - whole fields can be rejected. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org111SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION PART 1: Response to Request for Information Regarding On-farmFood SafetyManagement Standards Quote below provided by Mike Burness, Vice President, Global Quality and Food Safety, Chiquita Brands International/Fresh Express, July 27, 2009 \"The Fresh Express buffer zone is several hundred feet from grazing cattle. In regard to other wildlife, the goal is to minimize potential animal intrusion to prevent possible pathogenic contamination. Fresh Express consistently works with its growers, one-on-one, to identify possible contamination risks, and requests them to develop relevant solutions. These solutions may vary based on time of year/season, crop, exact location of the field, surrounding flora/fauna, proximity to water sources, and so on. Fresh Express takes a customized rather than one-size-fits-all approach. With respect to flooded ground, Fresh Express inspects the ground prior to planting to ensure appropriate mitigation at that early stage, with flooding being one of the criteria that is assessed. Here too there are variables that would be taken into consideration in determining a length of time before re-planting. Generally, a few months would be considered sufficient. With respect to overall environmental sustainability, our goal is to take a proactive stance regarding Ag practices that are designed to mitigate potential pathogenic contamination within the context of a sincere respect for the land, wildlife and eco-system. Fresh Express values food safety and believes that food safety and environmental conservation are not competing values. They are both vitally important. To that end, Fresh Express works closelywith regulatory agencies on conservation efforts. As an example, it is currently working with USDA researchers onagricultural conservation and in California works with the California Department of Fish and Game.\"Appendix G.

The supply chain after harvest varies for different products. After harvest produce may be processed in the field or beyond, sold to retailers or food service outlets or directly to consumers. Some products are cooled and transported, others are sold in local markets. Most fresh produce will be stored for some period of time before consumption. Contamination may occur at any point along the field to fork supply chain. Sources of contamination for fresh produce include the following: feces (animal or human):soil, irrigation water; inadequately insects; including (nematodes, slugs, flies); run-off from livestock operations; water used to agrochemicals; harvesting equipment; transport containers; wash and rinse water; sorting, packing, cutting and other processing equipment; ice for cooling product;transport vehicles; improper packaging, cross contamination with other foods and water used in hydrocooling. Improper storage, packaging or display temperatures may all lead to bacterial growth and increased risk. Note that this list is intended to display the many potential sources of pathogens and their proliferation, not to imply that they are all important factors in Central Coast fresh produce contaminationepisodes. List compiled from Harris et al.(2003) and Doyle and Erickson (2008). Foodborne illness outbreaks result from contamination by several kinds of pathogens, including bacteria, helminths, protozoans, coccoid parasites and viruses (Harris et al., 2003). This report focuses specifically on Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7, which are among the pathogens considered serious public health risks associated with fresh produce (Beuchat 2006, Altekruse et al.1997, Tauxe1997, Francis et al.1999). The reason for this focus is the national level of attention on foodborne disease that occurred during the 2006 E. coli O157:H7 contamination of fresh produce from the Central Coast region. Pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli O157:H7, typically cannot persist for long periods of time in the environment. This is due to the fact that they are adapted to a different environment (e.g., the gut of warm- blooded animals,), where sufficient nutrients are provided and the environmental conditions are well-suited to their survival. In the soil or water environment, it is unlikely that they will encounter conditions that are optimal for their survival and/or reproduction, thus limiting their persistence. Terminology relevant to pathogen hosts and vectors Pathogen vectors include any agent that helps move the pathogen from a reservoir toward a point of contamination. There may be many vectors that move a pathogen through the environment or the supply chain before it is ultimately in contact with food products. Pathogen vectors include animals, humans, insects, water and any other organism or material able to move the pathogen toward a contamination site. Reservoir hosts serve as a source of the disease agent to vectors, but usually are not adversely affected. Reservoir animals typically are vertebrates such as mammals and birds. Incidental hosts are vertebrate animals infected with a disease-causing agent that are not essential to theAppendix H. Crop Contamination AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org114SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION development and transmission of the agent. For example, humans can be infected with West Nile Virus (and may suffer severe illness or death), but we are not essential to the development and transmission ofthe virus. (Hill and MacDonald, 2008 at http://www.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/glossary.html#v) Me thods of killing pathogens in fresh produce Because fresh produce is often consumed without a \"kill step\" (a step in food preparation that will kill anypathogens not removed by washing) avoidance of contamination is paramount. Attempts to kill many important pathogens, including E. coli O157:H7, with chlorine wash water are only partially effective (Takeuchi and Frank, 2000). New technologies using calcinated calcium, ozone or irradiation are currently under investigation (Fonseca and Ravishankar, 2007). While they may one day be a practical way to reduce pathogen contamination of fresh produce, important questions about consumer acceptance of treated product, effectiveness, cost, effect on produce nutritional quality and practicality of widespread use remain. Source tracking to help understand processes of contamination A number of techniques for characterizing pathogens and help identify sources of contamination have been developed (Cooley et al., 2007; Yan and Sadowsky, 2007; Guan et al., 2002; Gentry et al., 2006). With the development of microbial source tracking techniques, which allow researchers to attempt to matchcharacteristics of pathogens from contaminated produce with characteristics of pathogens from different potential contamination sources at the field level, re-constructing the pathways of contamination hasprogressed considerably. SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Rationale for selecting studies for inclusion in wildlife table. The table was compiled using data collected in a previously published review of the potential role of wildlife in contamination of fresh produce (Stewart and Berretti, 2006). Further input was solicited from advisory committee members, particularly from scientists actively researching the potential role of wildlife in contamination of fresh produce. Database searches were used to find supporting documents when an individual indicated that they thought there was information regarding the prevalence of a given species, but could not provide a reference. As stated in the report, we primarily focused on E. coliO157, with some consideration of Salmonella to broaden the report's focus to include a second major pathogen of concern in fresh produce. When Salmonella (or other known food-borne illness pathogens, e.g., Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium spp.,Giardia duodenalis, Shigella, Yersinia ) were also tested in a given study, the results were included. The focus was primarily on prevalence of pathogens in wildlife species, specifically those that the CDC identifies as animals of significant risk \u2014- wild pigs and deer. The report notes the risk presented by domestic animals that the CDC includes in its list of animals of significant risk (e.g., cows, sheep, goats), but does not focus on them. When a study that provided data regarding prevalence in a wildlife species also included prevalence in domestic animals, the results were included. Prevalence data in the table is most extensive for cows, as much of the research on pathogen prevalence has focused on them. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the Web of Science/All Databases. Key word searches were done for \"Escherichia. coli O157 deer\". Also, the 2009 survey results indicate that growers have been told that rodents, amphibians and birds are a risk to food safety. These terms were searched in the same database with key words \" Escherichia. coli coli O157 frog\". A total of 176 hits were found. After duplicate references were deleted 130 references remained. An additional search list of 130references compiled by a UC Davis graduate student was cross referenced to ensure that no relevant material was missed. Web of Knowledge/ All Databases, last search January 20, 2010: Wildlife Escherichia coli O157 (47 hits) DeerEscherichia coli O157 (57 hits) Wild Pig Escherichia coli O157 (18 hits) RodentEscherichia coli O157 (15 hits) BirdEscherichia coli O157 (31 hits) Amphibian Escherichia coli O157 HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Decisions to include or exclude studies were made as follows: Studies of prevalence in wild animals being kept in non-native setting (e.g., zoos, pets, semi-domesticated herds) were not included. The exception to this was inclusion of samples collected from animals at wildlife rehabilitation centers. Such studies were included provided the methods stated that the samples were collected within a short period of time after arrival (three days or less) and that cages were sanitized between animal housing. In general, studies that reported results for pooled samples for which species included was not known were not included. Exceptions were made for flies which are typically tested in pooled samples. When methods failed to eliminate risk of cross contamination of samples, studies were not included (e.g.,samples collected from traps or feeding station and site not cleaned between sample collections). If the animals tested were likely to be kept in a much different condition than those typically found in a farmenvironment, results were not reported (e.g., stray dogs with diarrhea in Trinidad). Unless a study was judged by experts in the field (consulted as members of our technical advisory committee, or as peer reviewers for the manuscript in preparation) to be landmark study, studies testing for pathogens in meat were not included. Because the compilation of the data represents what is possible in terms of animals shedding E. coliO157 and other pathogens in their feces, studies including samples collected from other environments (e.g., outside the U.S.) were included. Studies reporting virulence factors detected in samples tested for E. coliO157 were not included. Any references that met the above criteria but did not appear in the results of database searches, but were located by other methods (directed by researchers, found as citations in other works) were included. Additional detail and citations for pathogens in wildlife Many studies, particularly with reference to birds, require careful interpretation because samples are taken from fecal deposits of unknown age, origin and exposure to contamination after deposition (e.g., Craven et al., 2000). Some mammal samples are collected without full knowledge of the age, likelihood of contamination (or disappearance of pathogen) post deposition (e.g., Hancock et al., 1998). Contamination of fecal material by dust (common in livestock environments in which Craven et al.samples were collected) is possible (Miller et al., 2008). There is evidence that E. coliO157:H7 in some fecal material may actually increase after deposition (Feare, et al., 1999), and that environmental conditions influence the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in fecal material (Wang et al., 1996). A single study may be widely cited as justification for a food safety guideline. In some cases, careful review of the research methodology and the authors' conclusions show that they do not support the guideline as developed (e.g., Gray et al.2007; Jay et al.2007). Studies conducted in laboratory settings using levels of imposed contamination far greater than are likely to occur in field settings must be interpreted with great caution. What is possible to create in laboratory settings may not reflect what is likely to happen in field conditions. Kudva et al.(1998) caution that E. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org117SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION coliO157:H7 may survive longer in laboratory studies meant to mimic field conditions than it does in actual field conditions. Notably lacking from the data set is adequate consideration of the prevalence of pathogens in reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Salmonella transfer from pet reptiles and amphibians is common (Richards et al., 2004), but these are reptiles kept in environments completely unlike those found in field settings; extrapolation of this data is inappropriate in the absence of further study. Many current food safety measures guide growers to minimize the presence of frogs (RCD, 2007; RCD 2009). Pathogens and filth flies While not generally classified as wildlife, flies may be important vectors for some pathogens. Filth flies (fliesthat breed in feces and other organic refuse) have been found to carry E. coliO157:H7 and Campylobacter in a turkey raising operation (Szalanski et al., 2004), Salmonella in a greyhound dog kennel (Urban and Broce, 1998) and E. coliO157:H7 on cattle farms (Iwassa et al., 1999). Ongoing research is examining the potential for these insects to transmit human pathogens to produce (see Appendix K). In discussion of the importance of dispersal data, flies provide a good example. Some food safety standards call for a minimum distance from cattle operations (Schmit, 2006). The above studies all verify that flies may be capable ofvectoring pathogens of concern, but they give no specific information on distances the flies are likely to travel. Without this information, distances from animal operations prescribed by safety standards to reduce fly contact are speculative. Additional details from Jay et al.2007 study described in Part III Defined the study area in an area from which contaminated spinach had been implicated in a recent E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. Established two trap sites in the area and collected fecal samples from live caught feral hogs. Also tested cattle feces, cattle water troughs, surface waters, sediments, well water and collected fecal samples from several other wild (bird, coyote, deer) and domestic (dog, goat, horse, sheep) animals from the area determined to be a home range for the feral swine captured in the traps. Used remote-sensing cameras and field observations to estimate population size and movement patterns offeral swine. Details of the environment that help gauge risk of cross contamination from sources to produce were noted and discussed. For example, it was noted that while the crop production area was separated from the 2,000 range cattle grazing area by a wire fence, swine could access the crop field via gaps under the fence created by erosion and rooting behavior. Swine were observed in the crop field, as were tracks and feces. Landscape features relevant to the movement of surface waters were noted, and it was determined that risk of contamination by surface runoff from range land was minimal (due to topographical features). Irrigation water drawn from a well was negative for E.coli O157:H7, but personal communication from anindividual familiar with the site revealed that an older agricultural well at the ranch might be vulnerable to surface water contamination. In addition to the extensive documentation of the landscape in which the contamination event is thought to have occurred, the authors provided information regarding the specific strains of E. coliO157:H7 detected in each source, giving further evidence to help detect the path by which it may have moved. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org118SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Concluded that the avenue of contamination remains unclear. Further, they acknowledge that the feral swine, and other animals in the test area, may be sentinel species (indicators of contamination) rather than primary sources of it. Additional details from Cooley et al.(2007) study described in Part III. used an evolving methodology (Multi-Locus Variable-number-tandem-repeat Analsysis (MLVA)) to trace potential fate and transport of E. coliO157:H7. Fecal (including wild pig), soil, sediment, plant and water samples were collected from a wide study area, with specific collection sites noted. Water samples were collected by allowing a collection vessel to remain in the water source for a period of five days rather than a composite sample at one time. Tracing the individual strains of E. coliO157:H7 through the landscape samples, the authors conclude that contamination of produce almost certainly involves multiple sources and methods of transport. Supplemental Information About Pathogen Prevalence In Cattle Cows carrying pathogenic bacteria may not display symptoms, but may still shed the pathogens in manure (Wray and Davies, 2000; Sargeant et al., 2000). Herd management for animal health may not fully control pathogen reservoirs. Since as little as 10 to 100 cells ofE. coli O157:H7 can lead to infection (Armstrong et al.,1996; Nataro and Kaper, 1998), even low levels of pathogen shedding in manure leads to risk for surrounding fresh produce growers. While animals carrying E. coliand other pathogens may not be immediately threatened, elimination of the pathogen is generally a goal of good animal husbandry and is critical to minimize contamination of beef products (Pedersen and Clark, 2007). Soon after the first E. coliO157:H7 outbreak was recognized, cattle were identified as a critical source for the pathogen (Montenegro et al., 1990; Cobbold and Descmarchelier, 2000; Kobayashi et al., 2001; Yilmaz et al., 2002). Whether cows are the primary reservoir for the bacteria, or an incidental host is not fully understood (Hancock et al., 1998). Though other farm animals have been shown to harbor E. coli O157:H7 including poultry (especially chicks), lamb, and pigs (Chapman et al., 1997; Beutin et al., 1993; Johnsen et al., 2001), the guts of ruminant animals (cows and sheep) are thought to be the most important source of E. coli O157:H7 (Brabban et al., 2004). Pooling data from 23 separate studies, the USDA estimated that within herd prevalence of E. coliO157:H7 for cattle of all types (calves, beef and dairy) ranges from 1.3%-9.5%, while the percentage of herds with at least one infected animal ranges from 22-100% (USDA, 1997). According to the USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System 1996 Dairy Study, 30.9% of dairy cattle being culled (going to slaughter) were shedding E. coliO157:H7 (Wells et al, 1998). Dairy cattle also frequently carry other important pathogens. In a 2002 study of dairy herds, 7.3% of cowsshedSalmonella spp., with 31.3% of herds sampled having at least one cow shedding Salmonella spp. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org119SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND REGION Campylobacter was isolated in 51.4% of cows sampled, and was found in at least one cow in 97.9% of the herds (USDA/APHIS, 2003). In beef cattle, as many as 80% of feedlot pens tested positive for E. coliO157:H7 (Khaitsa et al., 2003). Seasonal differences in pathogen loading are commonly observed. Some estimates state that 30% of all cattle in U.S. shed E. coli O157:H7 in their feces, and during the summer this may be as high as 80% in feedlot animals (Elder et al., 2000; Zschock et al., 2000) Veterinary and animal science experts are currently exploring a range of management variables that may impact pathogen prevalence and persistence in animals. Among these variables are: diet, sanitary practices, birds in feedlots/dairy farms, use of pharmaceuticals, etc. (Brabben et al.2004; LeJeune and Wetzel, 2007; Reinstein et al., 2009; Wells et al.2005) Epitopix LLC, a Minnesota veterinary pharmaceutical company, has received a conditional license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to develop a vaccine that shows promise for use in beef cattle to reduce the prevalence of cattle shedding E. coliO157:H7 (Finz, 2009). Supplemental Information About Cattle Production in the Central Coast Region Cattle ranching is an important land use in the Central Coast with over 2.7 million acres of rangeland inthe region and over a million acres of rangeland in Monterey County alone (Central Coast County Crop Reports for 2007). In 2007 there were over 1,800 cattle operations in the Central Coast region with over 250,000 cattle and calves (US Census of Agriculture 2007, Central Coast County Crop Reports for 2007). These operations include both cow calf and stocker cattle grazing operations. Stocker grazing cattle has increased in Monterey County over the past 10 years (Monterey County Crop Reports 1997, 2007). Cattle in the Central Coast are often transported in from other areas in the Western U.S. for winter grazing. There are a total of 11 dairies in the Central Coast region, distributed among the counties as follows: San Benito (4), Santa Clara (1), Santa Cruz (1), Monterey (3), San Luis Obispo (1), Santa Barbara (1), and San Mateo (0). Source:http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/dairy/pdf/Annual/2008/stats_2008_year_report.pdf There are only a few feedlots in the Central Coast region. Supplemental Information on Manure and Compost Raw manure is no longer applied to cropped fields in the Central Coast region. In the Central Coast region, several composting operations use manure from regional feedlots, dairies, and other livestock operations. Both organic and conventional crop growers in the region use compost. Regional landscapers and golf courses also use compost. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org120SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Regulation and monitoring of compost processes and finished product Compost products are regulated by the Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle). Composting operations regulatory requirements are described in Chapter 3.1 of Title 14, Natural Resources\u2014Division 7, CalRecycle. Required monitoring of the production process focuses on temperature and aeration status of the composting materials, while certification of the finished product includes testing for pathogen content. Certification of finished product is available via the US Composting Council Seal of Testing Assurance (STA) program. (See http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Regulations/Title14/ch31a5.htm#article6 for further details.) Organic growers must use compost that is produced and certified according to the standards described in the National Organic Program (NOP Section 205.203(c)(2)). The Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) certifies materials as appropriate for use in organic production systems by similar monitoring of production conditions and testing offinal product. Compost products that have passed review according to NOP standards may use an OMRI ListedTM symbol. Finished product is not certified as \"organic\", but rather is registered as Allowed (for unrestricted use) or Regulated (when certain restrictions such as time to crop harvest may be required). (See http://cwmi.css.cornell.edu/compostfs2.pdf for more information.) Potential for contamination of properly processed compost material exists when equipment used to load or store fresh manure is subsequently used with finished product. To minimize this risk, education of compost processing facility employees is essential (Dr. David Crohn, personal communication). AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org121SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION 2008 Central Coast Cattlemen's Grazing Lands Non-point Source Approach Excerpts from unpublished document: Statement of Purpose:As a result of increased surface water quality monitoring, certain water bodies on the Central Coast have been deemed impaired for a variety of constituents. Some constituents such as pathogens or sediment have been assumed to be associated with cattle grazing activities. Subsequently, in 2006 The Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) began dialog with the Central Coast Cattlemen regarding their impacts to water quality while simultaneously conducting an active assessment of the potential for water quality impacts due to grazing and livestock operations.In response to discussions with RWQCB, and as the Central Coast Cattlemen take seriously their land stewardship mission; this document was created as a basis for the application of appropriate grazing management measures for California's Central Coast region rangelands with respect to protecting or enhancing the region's water quality. The primary goals of these measures are to: 1.Maintain and or enhance the quality of the region's water resources, stressing prevention rather than costlyfixes and monitoring. 2.Stress voluntary participation through education, technical assistance, incentives and emphasize the benefits of such an approach. 3.Reduce conflicting regulatory authorities, fees and permit requirements in order to encourage implementation of management measures that will produce net water quality and other environmental gains. 4.Focus implementation and monitoring at the ranch and/or watershed level. 5.Encourage research to assess water quality impairments, determine causes,and develop appropriate monitoring techniques and solutions. 6.Balance legal requirements with the need for site-specific flexibility and economic feasibility for rangeland managers. 7.Identify gaps in information that may prove critical for taking a science based and economically sustainable approach to protecting water resources, particularly with respect to pathogenic loading. Measures for managing nutrients and potential pathogenic contamination from livestock: 1.Most importantly, keep 100% of the soil covered 100% of the time. Though this may not be possible, it isa critical management goal if biologically active soils are to be produced and losses of nutrients are to be minimized. For purposes of definition, \"covered soil\" means that if a raindrop were to fall it would hit plant material before it hit the soil. 2.Time of use, relative to season, vegetation growth, crop production patterns and weather, can be very effective and of minimal cost in preventing pathogen movement onto crops. 3.Communication between farmers and livestock mangers can be effective to this end as well. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org122SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION 4.Keeping livestock from loafing and over utilizing areas immediately adjacent to cropland can effectively reduce the deposition of manure, help minimize soil compaction and maintain healthy plant communities in order to maintain infiltration and filtering capacity. If supplemental feeding is utilized during the fall and winter months, feeding should occur away from sensitive areas in order to reduce the deposition of excessive fecal material, soil compaction and loss of vegetative cover/filtering capacity. 5.The installation of alternative drinking sources, where feasible, can be extremely effective for minimizinglivestock use of sensitive areas and streams. The development of springs and seeps away from sensitivecrops and providing for additional impoundment and troughs can help minimize livestock use and thusreduce the risk of pathogenic contamination. 6.Salt and mineral supplements should be placed in locations and at distances adequate to protect sensitive areas. 7.Use of sensitive habitat by wildlife, particularly wild pigs, should be monitored. During the dry season, pigs like to wallow in streams and wet areas and may be drawn from rangelands into irrigated crop landon a seasonal basis, depending on water availability and foraging opportunities. Hunting pressure ortrapping may be effective at moving pigs away from sensitive areas or where there is concern about their access directly into cropland. 8.While expensive and impractical in many Central Coast rangeland settings, the use of fencing may be anappropriate alternative for excluding livestock from areas directly adjacent to sensitive crops, and to createbuffers between areas of particular concern and livestock. Alternatively, the appropriate selection of cropsless sensitive to pathogenic contamination in those areas impacted by wildlife or adjacent land uses can also minimize risk. 9.Pens or small pastures used to confine livestock that are in close proximity to sensitive crops, particularly those used during periods when there is significant hydrologic activity, should be located in areas where they have drainage that provides adequate filtering capacity to protect sensitive areas. 10.Application of inorganic fertilizers on rangeland is not commonly practiced throughout the Central Coast. However, if fertilizers are applied, timing of applications and consideration given to runoff patterns should dictate appropriate use. AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org123SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Value of non-crop vegetation and wetlands to improve water quality Using non-crop vegetation for \"bioassimilation\" of pollutants is held to be the most sustainable, cost- effective, and ecologically sound approach to address problems of diffuse pollution from agricultural activities (Osborne and Kovacic 1993). Vegetative buffers such as filter strips, vegetative barriers, and buffer strips can slow, retain, and metabolize pollutants (Dabney et al.2006). Buffers restrict pollution by reducing movement, increasing sedimentation, increasing uptake by plants, and increasing microbial activity (Locke et al.2006). Buffers less than 1 m wide can trap significant amounts of sediment (Van Dijk et al.1996, Blanco-Canqui et al.2004). Vegetative buffers retain nitogen through both vegetative biomass uptake and bacterial denitrification(Haycock and Pinay 1993). A review of studies on vegetative buffers indicates that reduction of nitrogen ranges between 40-100% in subsurface water and between 73-98% in surface water (Osborne and Kovacic 1993) Vegetation can reduce pesticide release through uptake by plants, microbial activity in the root zone of plants, extraction of contaminated water, and by reducing the movement of water through the soil(Karthikeyan et al.2004). Vegetated buffer zones have been found to effectively remove 39-71% of pesticides from surface runoff,depending on the type of pesticide (Syversen and Bechman 2004). Grassed waterways have been shown to reduce runoff and sediment delivery by up to 97% (Fiener andAuerswald 2003a), and to reduce soil mineral nitrogen content by up to 84% (Fiener and Aueswald 2003b). One study found that grassed waterways can reduce agrochemicals present in runoff water by up to 56% (Brigset al. 1999). Vegetation in waterways may be especially important for reducing pesticide concentrations: studies have shown that a greater retention and absorption of pesticides occurs in vegetatedcompared to non-vegetated waterways (Moore et al.2002). Case studies in the U.S. indicate that constructed wetlands can remove up to 68% of nitrate-nitrogen and 43% of phosphorous from agricultural drainage water (Woltemade, 2000). Another study shows that constructed wetlands can reduce total phosphorous by up to 41% (Uusi-Kamppa et al.2000). Wetlands trap sediment and nutrients, although there may be limits to the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous they can retain. Microbial actions in wetlands can also convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, thereby reducing water quality issues (Schaafsma et al.2000, Hey 2002).Appendix J. SupplementalInformation Relating HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Efficiency of nutrient trapping depends on the rate of flow, residence time, and the vegetation present (Zedler 2003). The vegetation in constructed wetlands may also be important for the attenuation of chemical pesticides (Milam et al.2004; Tate et al., 2008; Knox et al, 2008). Contamination in overland flow may be reduced by filtration through perennial forage and/or grasses. One study tested the effectiveness of E. coli filtration through vegetated buffers on cattle grazing lands in California (Tate et al.2006). Scientists used known quantities of E. coliand measured transport in surface water run-off. Although the efficiency of filtration depends on water flow, soil type, and slope, they found that vegetative buffers are an effective way to reduce inputs of waterborne E. coli into surface waters. Buffers already used for environmental practices may be specifically designed to reduce E. colitransport. A review of 40 field trials indicates that vegetative systems within waterways, basins, or ditches can achieve significant pollution reductions, including pathogenic bacteria (Koelsch et al.2006). Other studies indicate that fecal coliform reductions greater than 90% are regularly observed from vegetated treatment systems (Kadlec and Knight 1996). Value of non-crop vegetation and wetlands to reduce pathogens in water Constructed wetlands have been demonstrated to be highly effective in reducing the presence of pathogenic bacteria and are used in sewage and agricultural wastewater treatment. In a wetland, pathogens are removed through filtration in dense vegetation, sedimentation of particles carrying pathogens, microbial competition and predation, high temperatures, and UV et al.2003, Nokes et al.2003, Greenway et al.2005). Large as well as small-scale constructed wetlands can reduce levels of fecal coliforms by up to 97% (Nokeset al.2003). Scientists have tested the effectiveness of constructed wetlands at removing specific pathogenic bacteria. Within a 23-52 hour wetland residence time Salmonella levels can be reduced by 93-96% (Hench et al. 2003). One study reported a 96% reduction in Salmonella in wastewater from a pig farm after passing through a constructed wetland (Hill and Sobsey 2001). Constructed wetlands have been shown to remove 95% of pathogens and indicator organisms (Greenway 2005). Surface-flow constructed wetlands with a high diversity of macrophytes can reclaim water and produceeffluent meeting microbial standards for agricultural irrigation (Greenway et al.2005). Heavily vegetated wetlands also have a higher removal rate of harmful bacteria compared to non-vegetated wetlands (Nokes et al.2003). Vegetated treatment systems which are primarily used to enhance environmental quality, may be designed specifically to reduce harmful pathogens in agricultural settings. For example, constructed wetlands can be designed with specific depths, flow, and vegetation to maximize the removal of pathogens (Greenway et al. 2005).

Ongoing and Suggested Research SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL Study Objective: We hypothesize that vertebrate populations function as a key source of E. coli O157:H7 (EcO157) contamination of watersheds where leafy greens and other leafy vegetables are grown; that climate, landscape attributes, and irrigation practices correlate with increased risks of EcO157 and commensal E. coli contamination; and in-field contamination of leafy greens plants with EcO157 relates to combinations of production practices and environmental risk factors in the Central California Coast, specifically, the San Juan Valley region. The major objectives of thisproject are to (1) quantify environmental loading by vertebrate sources, especially feral swine, (2) characterize the predisposing conditions for hydrological transport of EcO157 and E. coli to leafy green fields, (3) identify the in- field mechanism(s) of contamination of leafy greens, and (4) develop and disseminating educational materials forgrowers of fresh produce and the livestock community about microbial water quality, potential impacts on down- stream stakeholders, and effective good agricultural practices for improving water quality and produce food safety. Study Approach: To conduct an in-depth longitudinal study that identifies the key biotic and abiotic processes that sufficiently load, then hydrologically link and disseminate, primary environmental reservoirs of EcO157 within and between leafy greens fields, resulting in bacterial contamination of this raw agricultural commodity. For each node (vertebrate sources, water, soil, leafy greens) of the system, the cooperator will collect a detailed set of co-variates that will be used to identify critical control points, points of environmental amplification, and management practices that eitherelevate or decrease the risk of in-field contamination and dissemination of EcO157 on leafy greens. Samples collected, will be analyzed by the ARS lab for presence of EcO157 and strains isolated will be genotyped by Multi- Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) Pulsed Field Gel Electrophorsis (PFGE) for purposes of source-tracking information, and thus, pinpointing the mechanisms that link and disseminate vertebrate sourcesof EcO157 within and between fields of leafy greens.

An important next step would be to expand beyond the study of pathogens to include ecological impacts of on-farm management practices. This research would add support to concerns about how management practices impact not only food safety but also ecological health. Management changes also generate myriad economic costs and benefits. In addition to researchsuggested by Bianchi et al.(2008) this report illustrates the need for research to explore additional topics and questions: Environmental impacts of on-farm management practices. For example: What are the impacts on fish, mammals, birds, and other wildlife? What are the impacts on the quantity and quality of freshwater? What are the impacts on human health via soil, water, and air? Do management practices interact to create synergistic effects? What are the impacts at the larger scale, e.g., watershed and landscape? What changes to the design and implementation of conservation practices can maximize contribution both to food safety and environmental goals? Economic impacts of on-farm management practices. For example: What are the direct and indirect costs of various practices? What are the direct and indirect benefits of various practices? How do costs and benefits vary over the short- and long-term? How are costs and benefits distributed? AnInitiativeofThePewCharitableTrustsatGeorgetownUniversitywww.producesafetyproject.org128SAFEAND SUSTAINABLE: CO-MANAGINGFOR FOOD SAFETY AND ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION Liability and Litigation and Insurance Insurance has traditionally been a means to spread risk throughout an industry or market. According to food safety attorney Bradley Sullivan of Lombardo & Gillis, the insurance industry has reacted to the trend of extending liability along the distribution chain (Pers. Comm.). As liability and litigation have moved increasingly toward farms, insurers have raised premiums charged to growers, included exceptions and restrictions for contaminated produce in coverage written, and have stopped underwriting policies to insure growers they perceive to present high liability risk. Some insurance companies have stopped offering insurance to the California produce industry. A lack of affordable coverage represents a potentially lethal blow to growers, given that they must maintain coverage in order to borrow capital and otherwise run a business. Self-insurance, higher \"retentions\" (akin to \"deductibles\" in personal insurance lines) and industrycombining to form their own \"insurance carriers\" are possible reactions to changes in policy availability. Although liability and litigation reached the growers, they may extend further. Many growers lease lands owned by others. These owners may face litigation risk for what occurs on lands they own but do not manage. Irradiation and Possible Legal Implications On August 22, 2008, the FDA issued new regulations allowing for irradiation of spinach and iceberg lettuce.The new regulation came in response to a petition by The National Food Processors Association on behalf of The Food Irradiation Coalition. The FDA rule provides for the \"safe use of ionizing radiation for control of foodborne pathogens, andextension of shelf-life, in fresh iceberg lettuce and fresh spinach.\" (FDA 2008). Public acceptance of the technology is not clear, and security, volume, and cost issues abound. Also, scientificquestions remain about how eliminating all microflora may potentially exacerbate contamination \"downstream\" of irradiation. The FDA ruling is likely to have long-term implications. On one hand, it represents movement toward a much-desired \"kill step\" for foodborne pathogens that could reduce illnesses and lawsuits. On the other hand, approval of irradiation for certain leafy greens may exert de facto pressure on growers/handlers to use the technology or subject themselves to legal risk. Illustrative Examples of Inconsistencies in Food Safety Standards (From grower interviews in 2009) Grower 1 states that auditors from processors and buyers are not consistent: the auditors \"change their minds dependingonthemarket.\" He describes how some pigs ran through his field of lettuce. When the processor came to harvest half of it they marked off 40 feet on all sides of the pig tracks and harvested the rest. They came backAppendix L. SupplementalInformation on Co-Management and ECOLOGICAL HEALTHIN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRALCOAST REGION for the rest of the field the next week, but in the meantime a hurricane had hit Mexico and destroyed the crop there. The buyer was short on product and cut the lettuce within 2 feet of the same pig tracks, violating their own standards as well as the LGMA standards. He explains why the growers are powerless in these situations: \"there is a short listofpeopleyoucangrowforandsomeofthemownthelandyoufarm.\" Grower 2 says auditors for the shippers are inconsistent and change their minds on what is acceptable. He explains one experience he had where a large processor said they would not take any crop from a ranch due to \"the potential for amphibians.\" So they made a deal with someone else to harvest it. But later the same processor changed their mind and harvested it anyways. He says: \"whenthemarketisgoodtheywilltakeit,theirownstandardsare flexible and if it is clean they will take it.\" He says:\"on the other side, if the market is bad they will find anexcusenottotakeit.Foodsafetyisusedasatoolnottoacceptsomecropsduetomarketconditions.\" Grower 3 had a contract with a large processor for lettuce on two fields. The first field was ready to harvest but was rejected due to animal intrusion (deer tracks). The second field was not mature yet, but they rejected it as well because of its close proximity to the deer tracks. At this time the price for lettuce was low and the market was flooded. They disced the first field but left the second one to find another buyer. However, the market suddenly improved and the same processor called back wanting to harvest the second field they already rejected. Grower 4 says that processors are inconsistent with their standards: \"iftheyneedacropbad,theywilltakeit.\" He says that in certain cases: \"theywilllooktheotherway.\" He explains that once the processor banned a ranch, but then when they really needed product they bought produce from that ranch anyways. Grower 5 has not recently experienced any inconsistency with the buyers because he does not sell to processors anymore. He says they used to have problems when they sold to a large salad processor: \"Wewereinaprocessed deal with XX and got out because their excuses were due to the market not food safety. In a good market theywouldtripoverthemselvesforgarbagecrops.\" Grower 6 shares that once a shipper rejected a whole ranch for vague food safety reasons. She knew from someone who worked there that the shipper had too much product and was looking for excuses to reject the crops. Then someone else took the crops right away- there was no problem. She says: \"themarketdrivesthestandards.Ifthe marketisreallygooditisamazingwhattheywillturntheirheadsto.\" Grower 7 says that shippers change their standards due to changes in the market. He explains that \"if a shipper isshortonlettuceortheycangetagoodpriceforittheyhaveatinybufferaroundagopherhole.\" He says \"when the market is bad or they have too much product they flag off huge areas or reject entire fields for noreason.\" He says that food safety is used as an excuse in many cases. Industry Movement into Value Added Products Produce industry employees indicate that water used to wash lettuce or other greens in the processing plant is in many cases used to wash multiple batches, thereby potentially contaminating a larger volume of product and potentially leading to more illnesses per outbreak. Bacteria can enter into leaf tissue during washing making the leaves impervious to later surface washing. Processing can damage leaves, and damaged leaves are associated with increased risk of human pathogen contamination (Gorny et al.2006). CALIFORNIA'S REGION Estimating a Connection between Pocessed Product and Foodborne Illness Outbreaks. Any effort to demonstrate a link between processed product and outbreaks of foodborne illness must take into account numerous important considerations: It should examine a long time period, going back at least to 1996 when the CDC's modern surveillance system began, and preferably ten years farther. It should plot annual variation rather multi-year average to see if the lines move in tandem (possible correlation). It should extract the subset of annual foodborne illnesses attributable to leafy greens and the portion caused by bacteria of particular concern such as pathogenic E.coli. It should analyze annual per capita trends, specifically pounds of leafy greens consumed per 100,000 people, and foodborne illnesses per 100,000 people. It should plot and compare annual percentage changes. It should explore potential differences in the way consumers treat bagged product, for example eating it after the expiration date or being more able to identify the source of an illness because the container came with a company name printed on it. Even if future research were to incorporate these suggestions and take several other appropriate steps, attempting to demonstrate a causal relationship between bagged product and foodborne disease outbreakswould remain a complex commissionedthisreportfromTheNatureConservancyandisresponsibleforitscontent.
