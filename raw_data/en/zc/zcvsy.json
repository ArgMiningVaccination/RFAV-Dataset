Each individual summary includes the request number; topic/issue; summary of the applicant's request as written by the applicant with occasional non-substantive editorial changes made by CMS; and CMS' final HCPCS coding decision. All new coding actions will be effective July 1, 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The HCPCS coding decisions below will also be included in the July 2023 HCPCS Quarterly Update, pending publication by CMS in the coming weeks at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets/HCPCS -Quarterly -Update For inquiries regarding coverage, please contact to the insurer(s) in whose jurisdiction(s) claim(s) would be filed. Specifically, contact the Medicaid agency in the state in which a Medicaid claim is filed, the individual private insurance entity, t he Department of Veterans Affairs, or, for local Medicare coverage determinations, contact the Medicare contractor in the jurisdiction the claim would be filed. For detailed information describing CMS' national coverage determination process, refer to information published at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/DeterminationProcess and https://www.cms .gov/Center/Special- Topic/Medicare -Coverage- Center . CMS has a long-standing convention to assign dose descriptors in the smallest amount that could be billed in multiple units to accommodate a variety of doses and support streamlined billing. This long- standing policy makes coding more robust, and facilitates accurate payment and reporting of the exact dose administered, as only 999 units can appear on a claim line for Medicare fee- for-service using the CMS -1500 form. In addition, CMS will use the generic or chemical name if there are no other similar chemical products on the market. If there are multiple products on the market with the same generic or chemical name, and a unique code is warranted based on the statutory definition of \"single source drug\" in section 1847A(c)(6) of the Social Security Act , CMS will further distinguish a new code by using the brand name or manufacturer name (for example, see application number HCP220517FAENJ). CMS generally creates codes for products themselves, without specifying a route of administration in the code descriptor, as the re might be multiple routes of administration for the same product. Drugs that fall under this category should be billed with either JA modifier for the intravenous infusion of the drug or billed with JB modifier for subcutaneous injection of the drug. The dose descriptors assigned to codes established in this quarterly coding cycle are in alignment with these policies. 2 Final Determinations for the First Quarter 2023 Drug and Biological HCPCS Applications. 1.

The form of S UNLENCA \u00ae that is the subject of this application is administered by a healthcare provider through subcutaneous injection and is supplied in a dosing kit containing 2 single -dose clear glass vials, each containing sufficient volume to allow withdrawal of 463.5mg/1.5mL (309mg/mL) of lenacapavir . The applicant describes multistage, selective inhibitor of HIV -1 capsid function that directly binds to the interface between capsid protein subunits in hexamers and inhibits HIV -1 replication by interfering with multiple essential steps of the viral lifecycle, including capsid -mediated nuclear uptake of HIV -1 proviral DNA (by blocking nuclear import proteins binding to capsid), virus assembly and release (by interfering with Gag/Gag -Pol functioning, reducing production of capsid protein subunits), and capsid core formation (by disrupting the rate of capsid subunit association, leading to malformed capsids). The recommended dosing of SUNLENCA\u00ae begins with one of two initiation options followed by once every 6- months maintenance dosing. For option 1, day 1 includes 927mg taken by subcutaneous injection (2 x 1.5mL injections) as well as 600mg taken orally (2 x 300mg tablets); then day 2 includes 600mg taken orally. For option 2, day 1 includes 600mg taken orally; then day 2 includes 600mg taken orally; then day 8 includes 300mg taken orally; then day 15 includes 927mg taken by subcutaneous injections. The maintenance dosing includes 927mg taken by subcutaneous injection every 6 months (26 weeks) from the date of the last injection. CMS Final HCPCS Coding Decision Establish a new HCPCS Level II code \"Injection, lenacapavir, 1 mg\" 21 - HCP221228MYGB8 Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Pemetrexed. Applicant's J9305, 10 mg\" Summary of Applicant's Submission Pfizer, Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Pemetrexed (ditromethamine) for i njectio n. Pemetrexed was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) pathway on June 10, 2022. According to the applicant, e xisting codes do not accurately represent Pemetrexed for injection. According to the ap plicant, to be i n alignment with the CMS coding decision for NDA 505(b)(2) -approved products after October 2003, single source products not rated as therapeutically equivalent to a reference- listed product in an existing code should receive a unique HCPCS Level II code. Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic, non- squamous non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have a creatinine clearance (calculated by Cockcroft -Gault equation) of 45 mL/min or greater. Pemetrexed is dosed on day 1 of each 21 -day cycle at 500 mg/m 2 as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 10 mi nutes by a healthcare professional for treatment in the following indications: Prior to and in combination with cisplatin for the initial treatment of NSCLC in patients , and for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. As a single agent for the maintenance treatment of NSCLC in patients , and until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after 4 cycles of platinum -based first - line chemotherapy. As a single agent for the treatment of NSCLC in patients , with recurrent , metastatic, non -squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy , and until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Initial treatment, in combination with cisplatin, of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma whose disease is unresectable or who are ot herwise not candidates for curative surgery , until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Pemetrexed's limitation of use is that it is not indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Pemetrexed is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder in single -dose vials to be reconstituted for IV infusion. Each 100 mg vial of Pemetrexed for i njection contains 100 mg Pemetrexed (equivalent to 157 mg pemetrexed ditromethamine), and 106 mg mannitol. Each 500 mg vial of Pemetrexed for i njection contains 500 mg P emetrexed (equivalent to 783 mg pemetrexed ditromethamine), and 500 mg mannitol. Additional premedication and concomitant medications to mitigate toxicity should be administered as outlined in the prescribing information. Pemetrexed for i njection disrupts folate -dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies show that P emetrexed enzymes involved de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate- binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, Pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. 22 CMS Final HCPCS Coding Decision1 Establish \"Injection, pemetrexed ditromethamine , 10 mg\" 1 Revised on May 23, 2023 to revise the long descriptor for J9323. 23 Sincalide Injection - HCP230103LTYT6 Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Sincalide injection . Applicant's suggested language: J XXXX, \"Sincalide injection, extended life\" Summary of Applicant's Submission Maia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Sincalide. Sincalide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) on November 22, 2022. Sincalide injection is a cholecystokinin analog indicated in adults to stimulate gallbladder contraction, to be assessed by various methods of diagnostic imaging, or to be obtained by a duodenal aspiration sample of concentrated bile for analysis of cholesterol, bile salts, phospholipids, and crystals. can s timulate pancreatic secretion in combination with secretin prior to obtaining a duodenal aspirate for analysis of enzyme activity, composition, and can accelerate the transit of a barium meal through the small bowel, thereby decreasing the time and extent of radiation associated with fluoroscopy and x- ray examination of the intestinal tract.

Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) on June 10, 2021. Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection is indicated as adjunctive therapy in pediatric and adult patients for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia and associated encephalopathy in patients with deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle. Sodium phenylacetate and s odium benzoate are metabolically active compounds that can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine in the liver and kidneys to form phenylacetylglutamine, via acetylation. Phenylacetylglutamine is excreted by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The nitrogen content of phenylacetylglutamine per mole is identical to that of urea (both contain two moles of nitrogen). Two moles of nitrogen are removed per mole of phenylacetate when it is conjugated with glutamine. Similarly, by acylation, benzoate conjugates with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys by glomerular f iltration and tubular secretion. One mole of hippuric acid contains one mole of waste nitrogen. Thus, one mole of nitrogen is removed per mole of benzoate when it is conjugated with glycine. Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection must be dilute d with sterile 10% Dextrose Injection (D10W) before administration. The dilution and dosage of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection are determined by weight for neonates, infants, and young children, and by body surface area for larger patien ts, including older children, adolescents, and adults. Sodium phenylacetate and s odium benzoate is administered as an injection. Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection 10% per 10% is a clear and almost colorless solution supplied in a sterile, non- pyrogenic, single -dose glass vial. Both sodium phenylacetate and s odium benzoate solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature and room lighting conditions . CMS Final HCPCS Coding Decision It is our understandi ng there are very little to no Medicare claims volume or utilization for the drug approved under this NDA. The reference listed drug for this application is Ammonul. Amm onul is approved under an NDA and there are several ANDAs that are therapeutically equivalent. We have noticed none of these products have a unique HCPCS Level II code. We welcome information from the applicant , other manufacturers of related NDAs/ANDAs , and other insurers who are currently paying for this product or associated NDAs to demonstrate a claims processing need for a unique HCPCS Level II code. We will be accepting feedback on establishing a new HCPCS Level II code in an upcoming biannual public meeting. 25 Lidocidex - HCP221122V2EJB Topic/Issue Request to establish a new HCP CS Level II code to identify Lidocidex Applicant's Submission Nubratori RX submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify Lidocidex .

Information for submitting questions to the FDA's TRG to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to identify H EMGENIX\u00ae Submission CSL Behring, LLC, submitted a request to establish a new HCPCS Level II code to HEMGENIX\u00ae (etranacogene dezaparvovec -drlb). HEMGENIX\u00ae was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Biologics License Application (BLA) pathway on November 11, 2022. The applicant stated that this is the first and only one -time gene therapy for adults with hemophilia B. HEMGENIX\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of adults with Hemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) who currently use Factor IX prophylaxis therapy, or have current or historical life -threate ning hemorrhage, or have repeated, serious spontaneous bleeding episodes. HEMGENIX\u00ae can be administered only once. According to the applicant, HEMGENIX\u00ae (etranacogene dezaparvovec- drlb) is an adeno -associated viral gene therapy for intravenous infusion after dilution. HEMGENIX\u00ae results in an increase in circulating Factor IX activity, increasing blood levels of Factor IX and thereby limiting bleeding episodes. A single intravenous infusion of HEMGENIX\u00ae results in cell transduction and increase in circulating Factor IX activity in patients with Hemophilia B. HEMGENIX\u00ae is a non -replicating recombinant adeno - associated virus stereotype 5 (AAV5) containing a codon- optimized DNA sequence of the gain-of-function Padua variant of human Factor IX, unde r control of a liver -specific promotor 1. The AAV5 vector carries the Padua gene variant of Factor IX to the target cells in the liver, generating factor IX proteins that are 5x -8x more active than normal. These genetic instructions remain in the target c ells, but generally do not become a part of a person's own DNA. Once delivered, the new genetic instructions allow the cellular machinery to produce stable levels of factor IX. The recommended dose of HEMGENIX\u00ae is 2 x 10^13 genome copies per kilogram (kg) of body weight, or 2 milliliters (mL) per kg body weight, administered as an intravenous infusion after dilution with 0.9% normal saline. T he patient's dose is calculated as follows: HEMGENIX\u00ae dose (in mL) = patient's body weight (in kilograms) x 2. HEMGENIX\u00ae is administered as a single -dose intravenous infusion through a peripheral venous catheter. HEMGENIX\u00ae is supplied as a customized kit to meet dosing requirements for each patient . Each kit includes at least 10 (ten) vials and up to 48 (forty - eight) vials, and each vial contain s 10 mL of HEMGENIX\u00ae . The total number of vials in each kit corresponds to the dosing requirement for the individual patient depending on the patient's body weight. Each kit delivers the pertinent therapeutic dose to the patient based on his/her weight. The vials are for single -dose only. According to the applicant, there is no other product with the same chemical formulation or mechanism of action as HEMGENIX\u00ae and thus there is no existing code that adequately describes t he product. The applicant suggests the code should be in the J7XXX series, where coders look for blood clotting factor products. 51 CMS Final HCPCS Coding Decision Establish a new HCPCS Level II code J1411, \" Injection, etranacogene dezaparvovec- drlb, per therapeutic dose\" . Due to the unique programmatic needs within the hospital outpatient settings , this code will be effective April 1, 2023. 52 HCPCS Level II Codes for Various FDA Approvals under the 505(b)(2) or Biologics License Application (BLA) Pathways and Products \"Not Otherwise Classified\" - HCP220517FAENJ CMS has been reviewing its approach for establishing HCPCS Level II codes to identify products approved under the 505(b)(2) NDA or the BLA pathways after October 2003. These products are not rated as therapeutically equivalent to their reference listed drug in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Orange Book 2, and are therefore considered single source products. Also, this effort will help reduce use of the not otherwise classified (NOC) codes. In order to conform with the general approach used for the assignment of products paid under section 1847A of the Social Security Act (the Act) to HCPCS codes as described at the following CMS link: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenI nfo/Downloads/051807_coding_an noucement.pdf. CMS is making several code changes, including manufacturer specific codes to identify products approved under separate 505(b)(2) NDA or BLA pathways. Since the products are approved under separate 505(b)(2) ND As and are not rated as therapeutically equivalent by the FDA in the Orange Book, they are single source drugs based on the statutory definition of \"single source drug\" in section 1847A(c)(6) of the Act. Because these are single source drugs, there is a pr ogrammatic need for each product to have a unique billing and payment code. In cases where certain products meet the statutory definition of a \"multiple source drug\" in section 1847A(c)(6) of the Act, CMS will remove the brand name of the drug from any existing HCPCS code as needed as it will accommodate any associated generic product(s), if approved and marketed, that are rated as therapeutically equivalent. Due to the complexity and nuanced nature of the differences between each product, we encourage providers to rely on the Average Sales Price (ASP) HCPCS- NDC crosswalk 3 to identify the correct billing and payment code for each applicable product. CMS Final HCPCS Coding Decision 1. Establish twenty -seven new HCPCS Level II codes to separately identify products approved under the 505(b)(2) NDA or the BLA pathways after October 2003, and not rated as therapeutically equivalent to a reference listed product in an existing code. 2. Revise or delete existing HCPCS Level II codes, as needed, to separately identify multiple source drugs and single source drugs.
