This study will be testing whether the administration of a complementary therapy (individualized homeopathy) to a patient undergoing chemotherapy treatment is feasible and whether this treatment can lessen the fatigue symptoms of adults. The study will also test whether the n-of-1 study design is feasible in this population. |Condition or Title:||An N-of-1 Study Receiving Chemotherapy| |Study Start :||December 2013| |Actual medicine | The study medication will be administered in one of two forms: (1) 3.5 mm diameter lactose/sucrose globule to be administered sublingually; or (2) 3.5 mm diameter lactose/sucrose globule dissolved in 250 ml spring water and administered orally. The medication will be administered as either 1 globule sublingual or 5 mL oral remedy/water up to 3 times per day. The dosage regimen is varialble at the discretion of the study clinician. | Other: Homeopathic medicine | Intervention must begin within 5 days of chemotherapy cycle completion. Intervention will continue until the next cycle of chemotherapy. The initial consultation will involve a verbal interview between the homeopath and the participant. The practitioner will then choose a single homeopathic remedy that will focus on the reduction of fatigue. Only one homeopathic remedy and potency will be administered at a given time. The participant will be asked to take the study medication at least 30 minutes before or after taking other medications, food and strong smelling substances. | Placebo Comparator: Unmedicated lactose/sucrose globule | The placebo will be administered in one of two forms: (1) 3.5 mm diameter lactose/sucrose globule to be administered sublingually; or (2) 3.5 mm diameter lactose/sucrose globule dissolved in 250 ml spring water and administered orally. The medication will be administered as either 1 globule sublingual or 5 mL oral remedy/water up to 3 times per day. The dosage regimen is varialble at the discretion of the study clinician. | Other: Unmedicated lactose/sucrose globule | - Frame: 7 days Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item, multi-dimensional, self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following 5 dimensions: 1) General Fatigue, 2) Physical Fatigue, 3) Mental Fatigue, 4) Reduced Motivation and 5) Reduced Activity. - EORTC-QLQ-C30 [ Time Frame: 7 days ]The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item multi-dimensional questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients in the following four domains: functional scales; symptom scales; global quality of life; and single items.
