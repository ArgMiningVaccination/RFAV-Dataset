Later (specify) Any other findings required by other provisions of law as precondition to adoption or effectiveness of rule? Yes No If Yes, explain : Purpose: The d epartment is amending the rules listed below to assure nursing homes are not obstructed from offering the COVID -19 vaccine to residents and staff because of clinical interference from required tuberculosis (TB) testing. Current state rules specify that nursing homes administer TB testing to residents and staff within three days of employment or admission, unless the person is excluded from testing under the ru les. T he amendment permits the nursing home to defer TB testing if the person is in the process of receiving the COVID -19 vaccine, or if receiving the vaccine is of greater benefit and less risk than performing TB testing before administering the vaccine. The amendment does not permit the nursing facility to defer TB testing for reasons other than the COVID -19 vaccine, and requires the nursing home to complete the TB testing as soon as the COVID -19 vaccine recommendations permit. The rules also require scre ening for signs and symptoms of TB for those persons who are deferring TB testing. Citation of rules affected by this order: New: None Repealed: 74.34 RCW EMERGENCY RCW 34.05.350 the agency for good cause finds: That immediate adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare, and that observing the time requirements of notice and opportunity to comment upon adoption of a permanent rule would be contrary to the public interest. That state or federal law or federal rule or a federal deadline for state receipt of federal funds requires immediate adoption of a rule. Reasons for this finding : The threat of COVID -19 to our most vulnerable populations is significant, especially f or those receiving long -term care services in their homes and congregate settings, such as long -term care facilities. Vaccin e for COVID -19 is now available and vaccinating nursing home residents and staff is a high priority due to the heightened risk of COVID -19 in the nursing home setting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued recommendations about the co -administration o f the COVID -19 vaccine and TB testing products. The CDC recommended that TB testing occur prior to COVID -19 vaccination, or if the vaccination process is underway or the vaccine is a higher priority than determining TB status, to defer TB testing until aft er the COVID -19 vaccination process is complete. Current nursing home rules require testing of nursing home residents and staff within three days of employment or admission. These rule amendments permit deferment of TB testing until the vaccination process is completed, in accordance with the CDC guidance.
