(Hons) Biomedical Science started as an interdisciplinary cou rse at University of Delhi. The course has been very successful in terms of the career options taken up by the students after graduation over the years. The cou rse in its annual mode prior to 2009 and in the semester mode after 2009 has been structured to reinforce the basic exposure that students get in the higher secondary school and to gradually bu ild on this knowledge-base. The proposed syllabus has taken advantage of the credit system to gradually make the trans ition from simple to complex concepts relevant to the interdis ciplinary nature of undergraduate program in Biomedical Science. In structuring the course two poi nts have been considered primar ily: one the load on the student in each course is reduced in comparison to w hat was existing and to offer a comprehensive skill and the knowledge base for the students keeping in mind, the employability of the students. The Core courses of the first two semesters are introductory courses in organic chemistry relevant to biology, biology of the cell, th e basic building units of an org anism, human physiology a glimpse at the orchestrated functioning of organ systems and the basic principl es of genetics as seen in nature. At the end of the second year, a stude nt will have basic knowledge of cell biology, genetics, bioorganic chemistry, human physiology, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, basic molecular and immunobiology. Alon g with this they will have hands -on training in medical lab techniques, epidemiological data analysis, tools used in fore nsic science and modern biology under the Skill enhancement (SE) courses . In the second year the students would build on what is introduced in the I & II semesters; for in stance building on basic bioorganic chemistry the students will learn more about pr oteins, the work-horses of th e cell running the biochemical factory. The concepts in phar macology, toxicology, pathology and biophysics are vital to Biomedical Sciences and these are introduced in the final year of the course . In the third year the courses include more complex concepts of mech anisms of achieving regu lated functioning of the biological systems, biophysical principles of biological systems, human genetics, genome organization, medical biotechnology and biochemist ry and some of the recent excitement in biology and the application of bioinformati cs in Biomedical Science as part of Discipline specific elective (DSE) courses along with project work. One or two papers in the final year therefore have a longer list of learning material to be drawn from different sources; however the actual length of the material fo r reading/teaching is minimal. Th is also introduces the students to resources for self-study. The Generic elective (GE) courses are designed to give the essential exposure to the interdisciplinary nature of Biomedical Scie nces. For biosafety, biostatistics, into one paper, bioinformatics, IPR, pathophysiology combining human physiology in the context of diseases, tools and model organism in biomedical research are part of GE courses. The syllabus before you is the joint effort of all the teachers involved in teaching Biomedical Science in University of Delhi.

B.Sc (Hons) Biomedical Science 44 Semester VI BMS 602: Toxicology Preamble: Different types of poisons have been k nown to humans since ages. Even in early times when science was in its infancy, curious peopl e such as \"Paracelsus\" could predict \"Every substance is a poison and, it is the right dose of the substance which differentiates remedy from poisons\". This thought is fundamental even to modern toxicology and pharmacology. There is an increasing use of chemicals in the modern soci ety and hence, toxicology is becoming a more important subject to study wi th the passage of time. Mode rn toxicology is a vast, multidisciplinary subject encompassing various other basic fields of science. The present course content is designed to provide th e basics of toxicology. Relevant importance has been given to those topics which can build a strong foundation in the subject , based on which, facts can be assimilated during subse quent higher studies.
