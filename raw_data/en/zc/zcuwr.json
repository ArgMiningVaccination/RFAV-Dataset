Choosing from these providers can improve your experience and save you time and money. A Network of Providers You Can Trust Providers in The Empire Plan network are thoroughly evaluated when they join the network. The Plan's Medical/Surgical Program administrator, UnitedHealthcare (UHC), verifies that they have the proper level of education, certification, professional experience and insurance to provide services. The evaluation also includes reviewing federal and state sources that monitor license sanctions and drug enforcement certificates, checking for board certification and examining any history of fraudulent or abusive billing practices. Ongoing re-evaluation ensures network providers continue to meet these standards for participation. An Enhanced, Simplified Experience Providers who participate in The Empire Plan don't just agree to accept certain payment rates for covered services. They agree to be held to certain standards when interacting with Empire Plan patients (such as appropriately charging copayments and applying coinsurance) and to work with UHC directly on claims, appeals and other administrative tasks. UHC also works with network providers to improve health outcomes and encourages them to take advantage of electronic medical record and electronic prescribing systems. Save Time and Money Using participating providers can greatly reduce your out-of-pocket expenses and help contain premium costs. When you choose a participating provider, the provider files the claim and you pay only your copayment(s) for covered services. If you choose a nonparticipating provider, you will need to submit claim forms and pay a higher share of the cost. Other Things to Consider When Choosing a Provider Once you narrow down possible options, check the provider website and call the office to ask questions. Pay attention to the office staff as well as how your questions are answered. If your doctor isn't available, who will you see? Which hospital(s) are they affiliated with? Do they offer any weekend or evening appointments?What's New This Empire Plan Report summarizes the changes to your benefits and coverage under the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) and The Empire Plan.

Get the Highest Level of Care by Choosing MHSU Network Providers Similar to the Medical/Surgical Program, choosing to receive mental health and substance use treatment from one of more than 138,000 Empire Plan Mental Health and Substance Use (MHSU) network providers offers you the highest level of care, while also saving you time and money. Network providers have been credentialed by the MHSU Program administrator (Beacon Health Options) to ensure they meet the highest standards of education, training and experience. According to program data, some of the benefits of choosing a network provider instead of receiving treatment from an out-of-network provider include: Higher success rates Lower readmission rates More frequent use of medication assisted treatment (MAT) for patients seeking substance use treatment Additional levels of support and treatment options after network facility stays for substance useCall the Clinical Referral Line for Guaranteed Access to Network Benefits Calling The Empire Plan before receiving services for a mental health or substance use issue, including treatment for alcoholism or opioid misuse, can help ensure you receive a referral to a network provider and locate a provider who is accepting new patients.

Effective January 1, 2023 , the maximum out-of-pocket limit for covered, in-network services under The Empire Plan is $9,100 for Individual coverage and $18,200 for Family coverage, split between the Hospital, Medical/Surgical, Mental Health and Substance Use and Prescription Drug Programs, as specified in the chart below. Your out-of-pocket costs, such as copayments for covered in-network services, will not exceed the limit. Once you reach the limit, your copayments will be reimbursed. 2023 Maximum In-Network Out-of-Pocket Limit Prescription DrugsAll Other Covered In-Network Services, Combined Individual Coverage $3,200* $5,900 Family Coverage $6,400* $11,800 * Does not apply to Medicare-primary enrollees. If you have any questions about your maximum out-of-pocket limit for prescription drugs, call The Empire Plan and choose the Prescription Drug Program (see Contact Information , page 14). If you have any questions about your limit for all other covered in-network services, choose the Medical/Surgical Program. NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 5Benefits Focus: Labs and Testing Laboratory tests and other diagnostic tests provide information to your doctor that can help them detect a condition, determine a diagnosis, plan treatment, check to see if treatment is working or monitor a disease over time. They are one of the primary tools that a provider uses to evaluate your condition and help keep you healthy. Participating Laboratories The Empire Plan network includes two national providers of laboratory services, Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp) and Quest Diagnostics. For current locations and to schedule an appointment, visit them online or call: administrator, UnitedHealthcare, also contracts with independent labs. You can locate these providers by using the online Medical/Surgical Program directory, calling The Empire Plan toll-free number or using the printed Participating Provider Directory for your area. When you choose a participating lab, your out-of-pocket expenses are lower. You pay only your copayment (if applicable) at the time of your visit. When Copayments Apply If you have lab work performed during an office visit or urgent care visit, a separate copayment may apply in addition to your visit copayment. Certain laboratory services are not subject to copayment, including well-child care, prenatal care and visits for preventive care. Additionally, you will not pay a separate copayment for lab services performed on the same day as surgery at a participating outpatient surgical location. Prospective Procedure Review for Certain Imaging Tests In addition to laboratory tests, your provider may recommend diagnostic imaging tests to help diagnose your symptoms. The Empire Plan Benefits Management Program includes Prospective Procedure Review, which requires you to call for advance approval of the following outpatient elective (nonemergency) high-tech imaging procedures: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic (MRA), computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan and nuclear medicine tests. To Start the Review Process Call The Empire Plan and choose the Medical/Surgical Program (see Contact Information , page 14), then press or say 3 to reach the Benefits Management Program. To expedite the review, your provider's office may call the Benefits Management Program directly. You (or your provider) will receive a notification number during the initial call when your request meets the medical review criteria. Within one business day of the request, both you and your provider will be sent a confirmation letter from UnitedHealthcare's vendor if the test is approved. For reviews that have not met medical criteria or when all required information is not available, additional communication with your provider may be necessary before the review can be completed. Here are a few helpful reminders about the Prospective Procedure Review: Emergency services do not require a notification call. Inpatient services do not require a notification call, although an inpatient hospital admission does require a call to the Plan's Hospital Program administrator. Completing the review process does not guarantee benefits. Payment of benefits is determined upon receipt of the claim and is subject to plan benefits and patient eligibility. If you do not receive written confirmation from the Plan, call the Benefits Management Program before you go ahead with the procedure. Note: If the Medical/Surgical Program Administrator determines that the procedure is not medically necessary, you may choose to proceed with the procedure. If it is determined through retrospective review that your procedure was not medically necessary, you will be responsible for the full cost of the procedure. You will receive no cost-sharing benefits. There are penalties for not complying with Prospective Procedure Review requirements. See your Empire Plan Certificate for more information. NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 6Stay Up to Date on Preventive Care and Health Screenings During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, many put off scheduling preventive care and health screenings. If you were one of these people, it's time to get back on track. Keeping up with your annual checkups and screenings may help find issues early \u2014 when health conditions are typically more treatable. Be sure to schedule your routine health exam and ask your doctor about what screenings are right for you. When your participating provider recommends preventive care services for you that meet federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established criteria (such as age, gender and risk factors), those services are provided at no cost when you use an Empire Plan participating provider or network facility. Note: Select vaccines administered at a CVS Caremark vaccine network pharmacy are covered under the Prescription Drug Program. Recent Changes Guidelines for the following preventive care services have recently been updated. Shingrix\u00ae Vaccine - Effective July 1, 2022 , this herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine is covered with no copayment for enrollees aged 19 and older. Prediabetes Prevention - Effective January 1, 2022 , screening and preventive interventions for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults aged 35 to 70 who are overweight or obese are covered in full. Prediabetes preventive services include medical nutrition therapy or counseling, individual preventive medicine counseling and behavioral counseling or therapy. Effective August 1, 2022 , a certain strength of Metformin may be covered with no copayment for eligible members. For a current list of covered preventive care screenings and vaccinations, refer to the Empire Plan Preventive Care Coverage Guide , which will be mailed to your home with the 2023 At A Glance in December. It will also be available on NYSHIP Online. You can also receive reminder emails about preventive care exams and screenings if you have a myuhc.com account. If you don't already have an account, you will need either your Empire Plan ID number and group number from your benefit card or your Social Security number and zip code to register.Vitamin D Testing Vitamin D plays a key role in maintaining good bone health and it can be obtained from dietary sources or by skin exposure to the sun. However, recent studies have indicated that there is not enough evidence to recommend preventive screening for vitamin D deficiency in the general population. As a result, the medical guidelines for coverage of vitamin D testing were changed, effective March 1, 2022 . Diagnostic vitamin D tests for you or your dependent(s) are covered only when medically necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of a condition associated with vitamin D deficiency. A maximum of four tests per year will be covered. If you require vitamin D supplementation, your provider can either recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) product or write a prescription, depending upon which is appropriate for you. Prescription vitamin D products, which are more potent than OTC supplements, are covered by the Plan and subject to copayment. If you have questions about vitamin D diagnostic testing, call The Empire Plan and choose the Medical/ Surgical Program (see Contact Information , page 14). New Empire Plan Benefit Card In compliance with federal law, new Empire Plan benefit cards will be issued to you and your covered dependents for 2023 that include deductible and out-of-pocket maximum information. The card will continue to list The Empire Plan toll-free number and other important information to aid with claims submissions. Please be sure to use the new card and securely destroy the old one. Before you receive services from a new provider, check that they participate in UnitedHealthcare's network for The Empire Plan. If you have questions about your Empire Plan benefit card, contact your Health Benefits Administrator. For questions regarding your Empire Plan benefits, call the Plan and select the prompt for the appropriate Program (see Contact Information , page 14). NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 7Reproductive Choice and Plan Benefits The Empire Plan covers a full range of reproductive access services. Benefits are available under the Medical/Surgical Program for therapeutic and elective pregnancy interruption (abortion) services when provided by a health care professional. Abortion services are available in New York State up to and including 24 weeks of pregnancy. After that point, an abortion can be performed if the health of the mother or pregnancy is at risk. Services received from a participating provider are covered at no cost, while those received from a nonparticipating provider are subject to deductible and coinsurance. Since the FDA approved the pregnancy termination drug mifepristone in 2000, medication abortions now account for more than half of all abortions in the United States. A single dose of the medication is used in combination with misoprostol, which is taken 24 to 48 hours later. The two-drug regimen can be used through 70 days (10 weeks) of gestation, dated from the first day of the last menstrual period. Mifepristone is typically provided at the facility initiating treatment and is covered through the Medical/Surgical Program, but it recently became available through the Prescription Drug Program as well. There may be state-specific dispensing and other laws that restrict access to these medications. These restrictions apply to the dispensing of medication where a member resides, not where the pharmacy is located. As of the date of this publication, neither CVS Specialty nor CVS Caremark Mail Service Pharmacy dispense mifepristone. Talk to your doctor or call The Empire Plan toll free at 1-877-7-NYSHIP (1-877-769-7447) and select option 4 for the Prescription Drug Program for more information on these medications. Separate from pregnancy termination medications, emergency contraception (aka \"Plan B\") products are also covered through the Prescription Drug Program. These products delay or prevent ovulation and are most effective if taken within three to five days after unprotected intercourse. They are available for purchase without a prescription at retail pharmacies and health centers such as Planned Parenthood or family planning clinics. To obtain emergency contraception products under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) zero copayment benefit, a prescription is required. All generics for the emergency contraception brand product Plan B One-Step are covered at Tier 1 with no copayment per PPACA requirements for females or members capable of pregnancy age 12 to 59 years. The brand product Plan B One-Step is covered at a Tier 3 copayment plus the ancillary fee. The Plan also covers a variety of other contraceptive, or birth control, options. Benefits are available at no cost to you when you use a participating provider for a tubal ligation procedure or contraceptive devices that require health care professional intervention. Vasectomy services are covered under both the Participating Provider and Basic Medical Programs subject to deductible, coinsurance or copayment as applicable. Empire Plan Participating Provider Directory Changes Due to a new federal mandate for 2022, the printed Participating Provider Directories now include digital contact information (a website or email address) for network providers and facilities that have shared this information. The network for mastectomy prosthesis providers has been expanded in New York State and providers have been identified in the printed Participating Provider Directories. They are listed in the Prosthetics & Orthotics pullout section of the NYS directories and are also included in the online directory. Online and Printed Directories To find an Empire Plan participating provider online, go to NYSHIP Online (see Contact Information , page 14). From the homepage, select Find a Provider and scroll to the appropriate Program. You can obtain a printed directory by returning the Participating Provider Directory request postcard you receive in the mail. If you would like to receive a directory for a different state or region than the one based on your home zip code, simply write the name of the version you would like on the line provided. For New York, Florida, California and Texas, please also specify the county. You also can get a directory by calling The Empire Plan and choosing the Medical/Surgical Program (see Contact Information , page 14). A directory will be mailed within two to four weeks of your request. In addition, customer service representatives can assist you with locating a participating provider. NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 8NYSHIP Forms and the NYS Gender Recognition Act By the end of the year, the New York State Department of Civil Service will update NYSHIP enrollment forms in compliance with the NYS Gender Recognition Act and expanded NYS Civil Rights Law requirements that all forms issued by New York State agencies include a third gender option when gender or sex information is collected. In addition to F for female and M for male, NYSHIP enrollees and dependents can select X, which represents a non-binary or non-conforming gender. To newly enroll a dependent who identifies as non-binary in coverage, you will need to fill out the NYSHIP Health Insurance Transaction Form for NYS & PE Employees (PS-404). Proof of identity is required to enroll; however, such proof is not required to match the gender provided on the PS-404. If you wish to change the gender currently listed on your NYSHIP enrollment record for yourself or an enrolled dependent, you will need to fill out a new PS-404. To change your own gender on record, enter your personal information in the Employee Information section of the form. Then, in Box 12, indicate that your information has changed in Box 3. To change the gender of an enrolled dependent, fill out their personal information in the Dependent Information section (Box 14) and check the change (\"C\") box to the left. No proofs are required to accompany the PS-404 when you submit a request to change gender information on your NYSHIP enrollment record. However, if there is an accompanying name change for yourself or a dependent, you are required to submit new proof of identity. Examples of acceptable proofs would be copies of either court records documenting the name change or government issued identification such as an updated driver's license. You should submit the completed form PS-404, along with copies of any required proofs, to your Health Benefits Administrator (HBA) or the Business Services Center (BSC). The personal information that you submit to your HBA, such as gender, is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and may only be shared under limited circumstances for the purposes of administering health insurance benefits. To access the PS-404 and other NYSHIP forms, visit NYSHIP Online (see Contact Informatio n, page 14) and select the Forms tab from the homepage. Other NYSHIP forms that will be updated similarly include the NYSHIP Application for Domestic Partners (PS-425), the NYSHIP Statement of Disability for Dependents (PS-451) and the M/C Life Insurance Transaction Form (PS-934). NYSHIP Retiree Health Insurance Eligibility for Tier 5 and 6 Retirement System Members Provisions of the 2022-2023 NYS Executive Budget reduced the minimum service requirement for Tier 5 and 6 members of the New York State and Local Retirement System (NYSLRS) and the New York State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System (NYSLPFRS) to be vested for a pension from 10 to five years of creditable service. Employees who are vested have earned enough service credit to qualify for a pension benefit once they meet the minimum age requirements established for their tier. While this change reduces the amount of time necessary to satisfy one eligibility requirement to continue NYSHIP health insurance in retirement (item 2 below), NYS employees must meet all three eligibility requirements. They are as follows: 1. Complete the minimum benefits-eligible service requirement determined by the date on which you last entered State service (10 years if hired after April 1, 1975), 2. Satisfy requirements for retiring as a member of a retirement system and 3. Be enrolled in coverage through an employer that participates in NYSHIP. Thus while this change impacts eligibility for a State pension benefit, it does not shorten the 10-year minimum benefits-eligible service requirement to continue health insurance as a NYS retiree. See your General Information Book for more information about continuing your NYSHIP benefits in retirement. NYSHIP Information NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 9Previously Eligible Dependents In 2022, the Employee Benefits Division issued a NYSHIP policy clarification regarding the application of waiting periods for dependents who were previously eligible for NYSHIP coverage. A late enrollment waiting period is now waived for previously eligible dependents when a request to add them to coverage occurs at the same time as the addition of a new dependent to coverage due to a qualifying event. A qualifying event could be a newly eligible dependent, such as a newborn child or a new spouse, or a loss of other coverage for a previously eligible dependent. For example, you may newly add your spouse or domestic partner to coverage when adding your newborn child, without a late enrollment waiting period. This policy applies to new enrollments in coverage, changes from individual to family coverage or the addition of dependents to existing family plans. Exceptions apply if the dependent has their own NYSHIP coverage and is enrolled in the Pre-Tax Contribution Program (PTCP) or another program for employees of a NYSHIP Participating Agency (PA) or Participating Employer (PE) that affords similar pre-tax benefits. In this case, the dependent would be required to wait until the next PTCP Election Period or annual pre-tax election period (for PAs and PEs) to cancel their coverage and be added to your NYSHIP coverage as a dependent.All requests for coverage must be made within 30 days of the qualifying event. Requests made more than 30 days after the qualifying event will be subject to late enrollment waiting period rules. For late enrollments, coverage will begin on the first day of the fifth payroll period following the payroll period in which you apply. If you apply on the first day of a payroll period, that payroll period is counted as part of the waiting period. More information about dependent eligibility, when coverage begins and the PTCP can be found in your General Information Book . Continuing Coverage for a Dependent with a Disability If you have a dependent with a disability on your NYSHIP family plan, you may be able to extend coverage for them beyond when they would normally become ineligible due to age. You may cover your dependent with a disability who is age 26 or older if the child: Is unmarried Is incapable of self-sustaining support by reason of mental or physical disability Acquired the disabling condition before they would otherwise have lost eligibility due to age To apply for continued coverage for your dependent with a disability, you must first contact your HBA (usually located in your personnel office or the New York State Business Services Center [BSC]) prior to your child's 26th birthday (or 19th birthday for an \"other\" child with a disability) to begin the review process. You and a treating physician must both complete the NYSHIP Statement of Disability for Dependents (PS-451) form and submit it along with medical documentation of the child's disabling condition to the Plan administrator (see contact information on the form). You will be notified by your HBA if the application has been approved. NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 10After the initial application, you will be asked to complete the PS-451 form and provide medical documentation to recertify the child's disability periodically based on Social Security Administration guidelines. If a dependent is also an \"other\" child, you will be required to resubmit the NYSHIP Statement of Dependence for \"Other\" Children (PS-457) form every two years (at minimum). To avoid lapses in coverage, be sure to submit your application at least two months prior to when the dependent would otherwise become ineligible for coverage. If coverage does lapse due to a late application, The Empire Plan is not responsible for claims submitted during that time. See your General Information Book for more information on enrollment and effective dates of coverage. 2021 Certificate and Amendments The Empire Plan Certificates along with the accompanying Certificate Amendments have been updated for the following groups: Active employees of New York State designated Management/Confidential; Legislature or who are represented by CSEA, DC-37, NYSCOPBA, PBA or UUP: Both the Certificate and Amendments are effective January 1, 2021 and the Amendments , which detail benefits changes since the printed 2019 Certificate was issued, have been included in the updated online Certificate . Note: Both the Certificate and Amendments are only available online; printed copies are not available at this time. Active employees of New York State represented by PIA or APSU; and judges, justices and nonjudicial employees of the Unified Court System: Both the Certificate and Amendments are effective January 1, 2021 and the Amendments detail benefits changes since the 2014 Certificate was issued. A printed copy of the Certificate was mailed to enrollee homes in 2022. Note: The Amendments have been incorporated into the new printed version and are only available online as a reference. Certificates and Amendments are being developed for PEF and are scheduled to be published and mailed to your home as soon as they are completed. You can access the Certificates and Amendments on NYSHIP Online (see Contact Information , page 14). From the homepage, select Using Your Benefits and then Current Publications. Summary of Benefits and Coverage The Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) is a standardized comparison document required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It is designed to improve health insurance information so you can better understand your coverage. Some terms used in SBC are defined in the Uniform Glossary , a non-customized companion document to the SBC. To view the SBC or the Uniform Glossary for The Empire Plan, visit www.cs.ny.gov/sbc and choose your group. To request a copy, call the Plan and choose the Medical/Surgical Program (see Contact Information , page 14). NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 11Annual Notice of Mastectomy and Reconstructive Surgery Benefits The Empire Plan covers inpatient hospital care for lymph node dissection, lumpectomy and mastectomy for treatment of breast cancer for as long as the physician and patient determine hospitalization is medically necessary. The Plan covers all stages of reconstructive breast surgery following mastectomy, including surgery on the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance. The Plan also covers treatment for complications of mastectomy, including lymphedema. Prostheses and mastectomy bras are covered. Call The Empire Plan and choose the Medical/Surgical Program (see Contact Information , page 14) if you have questions about your coverage for implants, breast forms or other prostheses related to breast cancer treatment. Empire Plan Benefits Management Program requirements apply. See your Empire Plan Certificate for more information. Keep Your Enrollment Record Up to Date It is important for you to keep us up to date with changes in your life to ensure you receive timely and appropriate information about your health insurance coverage. Your coverage through NYSHIP is a valuable benefit, but it is also costly to provide. By keeping your information up to date and only covering dependents who are eligible, you help to keep costs down for both yourself and the Program. Inform your Health Benefits Administrator (HBA) in writing of any changes to your enrollment record (address, adding or removing dependents, marital status changes) in a timely manner. Note: If you are divorced or your marriage has been annulled, your former spouse is not eligible for coverage as a dependent as of the date of the divorce, even if a court orders you to maintain coverage. Your HBA is usually located in your personnel office or the New York State Business Services Center. You may also make certain changes, such as your address, by going to MyNYSHIP \u2014 Enrollee Self-Service at www.cs.ny.gov/mynyship , a secure portion of NYSHIP Online. See your NYSHIP General Information Book for more information on enrollment changes and applicable deadlines. Ineligible Dependents If you fail to inform your HBA of dependent eligibility changes, you may be responsible for repaying all health insurance claims for ineligible dependents as early as the date they became ineligible. Intentionally withholding information regarding the ineligibility of dependents may constitute fraud and may be turned over to the appropriate enforcement agencies for investigation.Reminders NY Active Empire Plan Report - 10/22 12Safeguard Yourself Against Health Insurance Fraud Health insurance fraud and abuse are expensive and potentially harmful crimes. Fraud and abuse losses increase your health insurance premiums and contribute to rising out-of-pocket expenses, such as copayments and deductibles. While The Empire Plan monitors provider billing practices and enrollment records, your awareness of fraud and abuse and careful monitoring of your benefit usage is critical to protect yourself and the Plan from illegal activity. Here are some simple steps you can take to protect yourself and the Plan: Securely destroy old benefit ID cards and report lost or stolen cards. Notify your HBA whenever your or your dependents' eligibility changes. Never give your Empire Plan identification number to anyone except your physician or health care provider. Do not share medical or insurance information by phone or email unless you initiated the contact. Monitor your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statements for suspicious activity. If anything looks incorrect or unusual, call The Empire Plan immediately. Never sign a blank insurance claim form. Keep accurate records of all health care appointments, including names of the physicians or providers you saw, the date/time of the appointments and the services provided. Do not allow anyone except your appropriate medical professionals to review your medical records or recommend services. Avoid a provider of health care items or services who tells you that they know how to get your Plan to pay for an item, equipment or service that is not usually covered. Be suspicious of providers who charge copayments or services covered in full by your Plan, routinely waive copayments or coinsurance for services or use pressure or scare tactics to sell you high-priced medical services, diagnostic tests or supplies. Count the number of pills dispensed when you fill prescriptions. Avoid pharmacies that fill your prescription for fewer days than your doctor has prescribed. Be wary of unsolicited referrals to out-of-state addiction treatment facilities. Instead, contact the MHSU Program's Clinical Referral Line or your primary care provider for a referral to a state-certified treatment program.
