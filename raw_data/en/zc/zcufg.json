Our natural mattress is made with 100% natural and organic materials that have earned GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certification. The natural and organic materials we use are sustainably sourced and ethically produced, so you'll get luxurious comfort in a safe mattress and know that it was made responsibly. Mattress materials vary widely in quality and safety. If you buy a poorly made mattress with questionable substances (including some from popular memory foam mattress brands), it can be difficult to pinpoint all of the health pitfalls potentially caused by its sub-par components. However, you can sleep safely and soundly knowing that your Birch mattress is made from completely natural and organic materials. Our mattresses are GREENGUARD Gold certified and eco-INSTITUT certified, which means we rely on the highest quality materials to make your mattress. When it comes to our mattresses, our top priorities are your safety, your comfort, and maintaining the high quality of our materials. The organic wool in our Birch Natural Mattress and Birch Luxe Natural Mattress is ethically sheared from New Zealand sheep and provides natural, hypoallergenic insulation and support for your mattress. Along with our other organic materials, this natural wool is of the highest quality and sourced both ethically and sustainably. Across the mattress industry, fire retardants are used as a preventative to reduce flammability in the event of a fire. Conventional mattresses often contain dangerous flame retardants and elements like mercury, pesticides, silica, phthalates, and formaldehyde, some of which create off-gassing emissions. (You'll find these in polyurethane foam and memory foam applications.) Be mindful when you're researching mattress brands, because even outside of traditional mattress manufacturers, not all new \"Bed in a Box\" mattress companies take care to avoid unnecessary treatments. Because Birch's FR layers are made from 100% organic wool so you can rest easy knowing that your mattress is environmentally sound, made of natural materials, and free of dangerous retardants. Bottom line: our natural latex mattresses are safely made with low VOCs (volatile organic compounds), natural adhesives, and breathable Talalay latex. With Birch, you can trust that you'll be sleeping with premium sleep products made with natural, certified organic, eco-friendly, and sustainably sourced and produced materials. You can rest easy with our 25 year warranty on this certified natural and organic mattress. See what thousands of well-rested Birch customers have to say.
