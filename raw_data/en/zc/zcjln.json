Davis, MD, MAPP, Serigne M. Ndiaye, PhD, Gary L. Freed, MD, MPH, and Sarah J. Clark, MPH Background: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was recommended by June 2000 for administra- tion to all US children <23 months old and to children at high risk for pneumococcal disease 24 to 59 months old. We sought to identify physician characteristics associated with adoption of the recommen- dation within 1 year. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional mail survey from April to July, 2001, of 788 family physi- cians (FP) and 833 pediatricians (PD) in 24 states. We measured whether physicians had adopted PCV7 recommendations, their expectations of the effectiveness of PCV7, the number of vaccine injections theywould consider administering at 1 visit, and barriers to administering multiple injections. Results: Response rate was 60%. Overall, 87% of to believe PCV7 will be effective in preventing pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis, as well as >25% of cases of otitis media. In multivariable logistic regression analyses of adoption of PCV7, FP who have higher pro-portions of African American patients and patients on Medicaid, see greater numbers of newborns,work in practices of >4 physicians, and are willing to consider administering at least 4 vaccine injec- tions at 1 visit are signicantly more likely to have adopted PCV7. Concerns about vaccine cost andreimbursement were the most commonly cited factors in physicians' decisions not to adopt PCV7recommendations. Conclusions: One year after PCV7 was recommended, nearly all pediatricians and a majority of family physicians had incorporated this vaccine into their practices. Barriers to higher rates ofuptake\u2014especially among family physicians\u2014must be addressed to achieve immunization goalswith this new vaccine.

Prior stud-iesindicatethatadoptionofnewchildhoodvaccinerecommendations is associated with physician fac-tors such as specialty, proportion of Medicaid pa-tients, practice ownership, beliefs that parents ornurses will object to the new vaccine, and adher-ence to national vaccine recommendations. 13-21 We conducted a national survey of family physi-ciansandpediatricianswithin1yearaftertheinitialrecommendations for PCV7 were issued to inves-tigate physician factors associated with adoption ofPCV7. Methods DesignThe study was a multistate, cross-sectional mailsurvey of pediatricians and family physicians whoprovide primary care to children /H113495 years of age. The study protocol was approved by the Institu-tionalReviewBoardsoftheUniversityofMichiganMedical School and the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (CDC). Sample Random samples of 788 family physicians and 833pediatricians were drawn from the American Med-ical Association (AMA) Physician Masterle by acontracted vendor (Medical Marketing Services).TheMasterleisthemostcomprehensivelistingofphysicians in the United States and contains bothmembers and nonmembers of the AMA. Sampling was conducted in 24 states, selected fortheirgeographicdiversityandvaccinenancingstrategy regarding PCV7, obtained from the Na-tional Immunization Program of CDC. States thathave a \"Vaccines for Children (VFC)-only\" strat-egy (AR, CA, IN, MS, NJ, NV, PA, UT, VA, VT,WI, WV) purchase vaccine only for children whoqualify for VFC (Medicaid beneciaries, the unin-sured, Native Alaskans and Native Americans, andunderinsured children receiving vaccine at ruralhealth clinics or federally qualied health centers).In states with \"enhanced VFC\" strategy (GA, MD,MI, MN, NY, OK, TX), the state purchases vac-cineforVFC-eligiblechildrenaswellasforunder-insuredchildrenseeninprivatepractice.Inuniver-sal purchase states (ME, NC, NH, NM, WA), thestate purchases vaccine for all children, regardlessof insurance status. Sampling was conducted fromeach state proportional to physician representationin the Masterle. Excluded from the samplingframe were physicians /H1135070 years old and resident physicians. Survey Instrument Two separate survey instruments were designed: 1for physicians who had adopted PCV7 recommen-dations for children /H110212 years old and 1 for physi- cianswhohadnot.Severalquestionswerecommonto both, allowing direct comparison of multiplephysician characteristics and attitudes betweenadopters and nonadopters. Physicians' specialty,gender, year of graduation from medical school,and board certication status were obtained fromthe AMA Masterle. Survey Administration Before mailing, survey items were pilot-tested withfamilyphysiciansandpediatricians.Thesurveywasinitially mailed with a personalized cover letter anda $3 incentive in April 2001. Nonrespondents werecontacted with additional letters and surveys inMay and June, 2001. Data Analysis All responses received by the study closure date ofJuly 15, 2001, were included in the analysis. Allanalyses were conducted using SAS (version 6.12;SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Tests of signicance inbivariate comparisons were computed using likeli-hood ratio /H9273 2, except in cases of zero values in 1 or morecells,whereFisher'sexacttestwasused.Vari-ables associated with adopting PCV7 in bivariateanalyses were entered into 2 separate multivariate 364 JABFP September-October 2003 Vol. 16 No. 5copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Administration at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months of life was less common (34%), and a few physiciansused a combination of visits at other months toadminister PCV7 (5%). Approximately 95% of physicians who adminis- terPCV7atthe2-,4-,and6-monthvisitsreportedthat they administered /H113504 vaccine injections at the 2-month visit. In contrast, 93% of physicians whoadminister vaccines during extra visits gave /H113493 in- jections at the 2-month visit. More than half (58%) of physicians who had adopted PCV7 said they had made no changes intheir typical immunization schedule as a result ofadding the vaccine. In contrast, 22% said that theynow more often give combination hepatitis B/Haemophilus influenzae , type b vaccine, 14% said that they administer hepatitis B vaccine at birthand/or 1-month visits more frequently, and 12%reported that they now postpone either measles/mumps/rubella or the varicella vaccine until 15months or later to give PCV7. For older children aged 24 to 59months, phy- sicians who had adopted PCV7 differed in theirapproaches to recommending PCV7 for groups ofchildren at increased risk for pneumococcal disease(Table 2). Almost all who administered PCV7 rec-ommended the vaccine for immuno-compromisedchildren, but there was substantial variation in pat-ternsofphysicianrecommendationregardingotherhigh-risk categories. Physicians were signicantlymore likely to recommend PCV7 for children withrecurrentotitismediaandthoseindaycarethanforchildren of the same age who are not in a desig-nated risk category. In contrast, overall physicianrecommendations for African American children were not signicantly different from recommenda-tions for standard-risk children. Family Physician Factors Associated with Adoption of PCV7NearlyallPDinthissamplehadadoptedPCV7,sophysician factors that distinguish PCV7 adopters(ADOP) from nonadopters (N-ADOP) are only for FP respondents. Practice characteristics of FP ADOP appear in Table 3. In general, FP who were in larger prac-tices, cared for more newborns annually, and hadpractices with higher proportions of African Amer-icanchildrenandMedicaidbeneciariesweremorelikely to have adopted PCV7. In addition, femaleFP are more likely to have adopted PCV7 thanmale FP (78% vs 64%; P/H11021.05). No differences among FP working in states withdifferent vaccine nancing strategies for PCV7 orin practices with different types of ownership orafliation. Attitudes and prior clinical experiences associ- ated with physicians' adoption of PCV7 fell into 3categories: comfort with multiple injections at 1visit, anticipated effectiveness of PCV7, and theinfluence of experiences with rotavirus vaccine. FPADOPweremorelikelythanN-ADOPtoconsidergiving 4 or more vaccine injections at 1 visit (86%vs 35%; P/H11021.001); 49% of N-ADOP said they would consider giving only 3 injections at a visit,and 16% administer 2 or fewer. ADOP were lesslikely to be concerned that multiple injectionscould cause adverse effects (26% vs 43%; P/H11021.01).Table 2.

In separate multivariable logistic regression models, we compared the relative importance of several factors associated with the adoption ofPCV7 by FP. The results of the models are shownin Table 5. Among practice characteristics, thenumber of newborns seen annually was the mostinfluential factor predisposing to PCV7 adoption.Amongphysicianattitudesandclinicalexperiences,the number of injections a physician would considergiving at a single visit was of greatest importance.Table 3.

Similarly rapid rates of adoption of anewly recommended vaccine into practice havebeen documented previously, but not on a nationalscale. For H. influenzae, type b, vaccine in 1986,uptake by pediatricians within 6 to 8 months was 86% and by family physicians was 61% in a NewMexico sample. 23Two-year uptake of universal hepatitis B recommendations was 90% among pe-diatricians and 64% among family physicians in 9states by 1993. 15In contrast, pediatrician incorpo - ration of varicella vaccine into practice within 1 to2 years in a Washington state sample was only44%. 24 Although childhood vaccination rates are af- fected by multiple factors including family andhealth system issues as well as physician behav-iors, 25,26physicianadoptionofnationalrecommen - dations is essential to the success of immunizationinitiatives.Recentdataindicateaclearlinkbetween early physician incorporation of vaccines into rou-tine practice and subsequent achievement of na-tional immunization goals.

Downloaded from dren, children and communities realize more rap- idly the reductions in morbidity and mortality as-sociated with use of the vaccine. A recent exampleof rapid uptake leading to pronounced reductionsin preventable disease is the Hib vaccine. 28 Prior studies have reported that family physi- cians as a group adopt new childhood vaccinerecommendations more slowly than pediatri-cians. 14,15,18-21We found the same pattern in this nationalsampleregardingPCV7.Ourndingsalsoillustrate that attitudes regarding the administra-tion of multiple vaccine injections at a single ofcevisit distinguish PCV7 adopters from nonadopters,similar to ndings reported by Kimmel et al 21 among family physicians regarding polio vaccine.Physicians who perceive fewer barriers to multipleinjections\u2014eg, parental concerns, fears of adverseevents, or their own concerns about pain from somany injections\u2014are more likely to have adoptedPCV7. A small minority of physicians who are notcomfortable with 4 or 5 simultaneous injectionsevidentlyfeelstronglyenoughaboutthebenetsofPCV7 to schedule additional ofce visits. Addi-tional visits will require more efforts from parentsandphysicianstobesuccessful;thedegreetowhichthis strategy may increase health care costs is notyet clear. Although physicians remain concerned about thedegreetowhichinfantstodayare\"pincushions\"from today's immunization schedule, our ndingssuggest there has been an evolution in physicians'sense of how many injections parents will tolerate.When universal hepatitis B immunization was rec-ommended in 1991, about one-quarter of physi-cians believed that the majority of parents wouldobject to 3 injections at 1 time. 13By the time Woodin et al11characterized \"pincushion\" con - cerns in 1995, most physicians expressed concernsabout administering 4 injections at once. In ourstudy, 95% of physicians who have adopted PCV7administer 4 or more vaccines at the 2-month visit. Physician uptake of new vaccine recommenda- tions has been conceptualized as a process thatincludes 4 steps: awareness of recommendations,agreement with recommendations, the decision toadopt the recommendations, and nally adherenceto recommendations. 16Our prior work regarding PCV7 among physicians in 7 states suggested thatpediatricians and family physicians were aware ofvaccine recommendations immediately after theywere announced in late spring 2000. 8Data in thestudy reported here indicate that some physicians are not recommending PCV7 because they do notagreethatvaccinationisnecessarytoaddresspneu-mococcal disease. However, 87% of physiciansoverall have agreed with the PCV7 guidelines,adopted them, and are adhering to the guidelinesfor children /H1134923 months of age. Our multivariable model indicates that physician perceptions of theclinical effectiveness of PCV7 are less importantthan their comfort with multiple injections. Evenso, it is remarkable that one-third of family physi-cians who have adopted PCV7 in their practicesbelieve that the vaccine will prevent more than25% of otitis media cases\u2014much greater than the7% of cases prevented in clinical trials. 5 Physician adherence to harmonized PCV7 rec- ommendationsforolderchildren3islessconsistent, which may reflect differing levels of agreement among physicians about the characterization ofhigh-risk groups, such as children in day care andAfrican Americans. Higher rates of uptake amongfamily physicians who see higher proportions ofAfrican American patients and Medicaid benecia-ries may reflect the positive effects of the VFCprogram that provides government-purchasedPCV7 for all children on Medicaid, about 35% ofwhom are African American. 29 Physicians who have not adopted PCV7 in their practices expressed concerns about the cost ofPCV7 and lack of reimbursement from insurers.Given these concerns, it is somewhat surprisingthat the state vaccine nancing strategy regardingPCV7 was not associated with physician recom-mendationofthisvaccine.States'vaccinenancingstrategiesmaynotinfluenceoverallphysicianadop-tion of PCV7 but may affect whether physiciansadminister the vaccine to children without insur-ance coverage for the vaccine in their practices. Limitationstothisstudyincludeitsscopeandits timing. We may have over- or underestimated thePCV7 uptake rate if responders differ from non-responders in their adoption of PCV7. Our re-sponse rate was similar to those of other nationalmail surveys of physicians. 30,31In addition, this survey was completed before shortages of PCV7vaccine became apparent on a national level andACIPrecommendationswerechangedtoprioritizedoses among the youngest and highest-risk chil-dren eligible. 32How the shortage of PCV7 will ultimately affect rates of uptake is not yet clear.

Downloaded from In conclusion, our analysis offers insight into how PCV7 uptake might be improved further. Fu- ture efforts must focus on barriers perceived pre-dominantly by family physicians, addressing theirobjections to multiple vaccine injections and theirconcerns about vaccine cost and reimbursement.Uptake rates of newly recommended childhoodvaccinesinthefuturemaybeenhancedifstudiesofphysicians'perceivedbarriers\u2014bothingeneralandspecic to the new vaccine in question\u2014are con-ducted before consensus recommendations areissued, rather than after the fact. Nearlyhalfofallphysicianswhoprovideroutine health care to children in the US are family physi-cians, 33and their acceptance and adoption of im - munization recommendations are essential toprotect the health of the nation's children. Thebarriers that family physicians perceive may not beunique to PCV7, particularly as we anticipate therecommendation of childhood vaccines in the fu-ture that may be more expensive than PCV7. 34In fact, experiences with PCV7 uptake may be indic-ative of barriers that will become even more salientas more vaccines are added to the childhood im-munization schedule in the future.
