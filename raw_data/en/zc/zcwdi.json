However, not all pain is physical. Most pain and symptoms have an energetic root cause. There is a pattern of energy (a feeling or frequency) that is related to the creation of your symptoms. This misaligned energy becomes a blueprint, altering your physical health subconsciously. Until the energy signature of a pattern changes, no amount of action will fix or heal what is running under the surface. This is the real reason why you continue to suffer. To Heal a Pattern of Energy from the Root, you need to: 1. Understand the Pattern - it all starts with Awareness 2. Resolve the Pattern of Stuck Energy and Symptoms 3. Align with Wellness - create Flow and Ease! Believe it or not, your symptoms are actually present because your body is trying to HELP you to resolve this pattern of energy!
