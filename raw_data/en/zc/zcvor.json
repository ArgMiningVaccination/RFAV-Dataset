Enter any Narrative text below. [7500] 2014 was the first year (since the first few years of CHIP) that Alabama has had a Medicaid Expansion. The Medicaid Expansion that began in 2014 is due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, if there were any changes in the Medicai d program, they were new to CHIP and thus not reflected above. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 7 SECTION II: PROGRAM 'S PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND PROGRESS This section consists of three subsections that gat her information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section IIA captures data on the core set of children's health care quality measures. Secti on IIB captures your enrollment progress as well as ch anges in the number and/or rate of uninsured childr en in your state. Section IIC captures progress towar ds meeting your state's general strategic objective s and performance goals. SECTION IIA: REPORTING OF THE CORE SET OF CHILDREN 'S HEALTH CARE QUALITY MEASURES (C HILD CORE SET ) Section 401(a) of the Children's Health Insurance P rogram Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) (Pub.L. 111-3) required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to identify a core set of child health care quality measures for voluntary us e by state programs administered under titles XIX a nd XXI, health insurance issuers and managed care enti ties that enter into contract with such programs, a nd providers of items and services under such programs . CHIPRA also required the Secretary to publish changes to the Child Core Set measures beginning in January 2013. Three measures (Human Papillomavirus [HPV] Vaccine for Female Adolescents , Maternity Care - Behavioral Health Risk Assessment, and Medication Management for People wi th Asthma) were added to the Child Core Set in 2013 and one measure (Otitis Media with Effusion) w as retired. Three additional measures (Annual Pediatric Hemoglobin A1C Testing, Appropriate Testi ng for Children with Pharyngitis, and Annual Percentage of Asthma Patients 2 Through 20 Years Ol d with One or More Asthma-Related Emergency Room Visits) were retired from the Child Core Set i n 2014. Table 1 lists the Children's Core Set measures, their measure stewards, and a general des cription of each measure. Abbreviations replaced measure numbers beginning in 2013. Additionally, Section 401(a)(4) required the develo pment of a standardized reporting format for states that volunteer to report on the core set of measures. Th is section of CARTS will be used for standardized reporting on the Child Core Set measures. The Technical Specifications and Resource Manual fo r the Child Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures can be found at: http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Infor mation/By-Topics/Quality-of- Care/Downloads/Medicaid-and-CHIP-Child-Core-Set-Man ual.pdf Table 1: Child Core Set Measures Measure Abbreviation Measure Measure Steward Description PPC-CH Timeliness of Prenatal Care National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)/ Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) Percentage of deliveries of live births between November 6 of the year prior to the measurement year and November 5 of the measurement year that received a prenatal care visit in the first trimester or within 42 days of enrollment.

Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years (to the extent that data are available). In the first and s econd columns, data from the previous two years' an nual reports (FFY 2012 and FFY 2013) will be populated w ith data previously reported in CARTS; enter data i n these columns only if changes must be made. If you previously reported no data for either of those yea rs, but you now have data for those years, please enter the data in the appropriate column. Indicate the data were updated using the \"Did you update data for thi s measure?\" field. In the third column, report the most recent data available at the time you are submittin g the current annual report (FFY 2014). Additional instructions for completing each row of the table a re provided below. Beginning in 2011, the CARTS application requires s tates to provide information on why they chose not to report a measure(s) in Section IIA. T he CARTS user will be prompted to provide this information for each measure during data entry. If the CARTS User skips these questions during CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 12 the data entry process, he/she will be prompted to respond to them before being able to certify the Annual Report. If Data Not Reported, Please Explain Why: If your state cannot report a specific measure, ple ase check the box that applies to why data are not being reported for each measure. The user may selec t any applicable reason why data are not being reported, but must select at least one response as follows. Service not covered : Check this box if your program does not cover thi s service. Population not covered : Check this box if your program does not cover th e population included in the measure. If this box is selected, users will al so need to indicate whether the entire population or partial population was not covered under its pro gram. A detailed explanation is required if partial population is not covered. Data not available : Check this box if data are not available for thi s measure in your state. If this box is selected, users will need to explain why dat a are not available for reporting. Reasons may include \"Budget Constraints,\" Not Collected, \" and \"Other\". Small sample size : Check this box if the denominator size for this measure is less than 30. If the denominator size is less than 30, your state is not required to report a rate on the measure. However, the state will need to indicate the exact denominator size in the space provided. Other : Please specify if there is another reason why yo ur state cannot report the measure. Although the Child Core Set measures are voluntari ly reported, if the state does not report data on a specific measure, it is important for CMS to unders tand why each state is not reporting on specific measures. Your selection of a reason for not report ing and/or provision of an \"Other\" reason for not reporting will assist CMS in that understanding. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are repo rting, as follows: Provisional : Check this box if you are reporting data for a m easure, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any othe r way before you finalize them for the current CARTS reporting period. Final : Check this box if the data you are reporting are considered final for the current CARTS reporting period. Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report : Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reporte d in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the da ta. Measurement Specification: For each measure, the state should indicate whether a measure adheres to the Child Core Set technical specifications, based on HEDIS\u00ae or specifications d eveloped by other measure steward (e.g. CMS, CDC, TJC, AMA/PCPI), or \"Other\" measurement specifications. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, a n explanation must be provided. CMS encourages states to use the technical specific ations outlined in the Technical Specifications and Resource Manual for the Child Core Set measures. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example HEDIS 2014). This field must be completed only when a user selects the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification . \"Other\" Measurement Specification Explanation: The explanation field must be completed when \"Other \" measurement specification has been selected. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 13 Data Source: Data for the Child Core Set measures may come from several sources, including medical claims and medical records. For each measure, the state must i ndicate the source of data or methodology used to calculate the measure using the following options ( some options are unavailable for some measures): Administrative Data : Medical claims and encounter data or other admini strative data source (e.g., immunization registry, vital records,). If this box is selected, the user must then indicate whether the administrative data for a measure are coming fr om the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) or another administrative data source . Hybrid : A combination of administrative and medical recor ds data. If this box is selected, the user must then indicate whether the administrative data for a measure are coming from the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) or another adm inistrative data source. The user must also indicate whether the medical record data for a measure are coming from electronic health records (EHR), paper, or EHR and paper. Survey Data : The state should specify the survey used. Other : An explanation box is available for the state to specify the other source of data. Definition of Population Included in the Measure: Denominator : Indicate the definition of the population includ ed in the denominator for each measure by checking one box to indicate whether the data are f or the CHIP population only (Title XXI), the Medica id population only (Title XIX), or include both CHIP a nd Medicaid children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representa tive of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, the Medicaid population only, or t he CHIP and Medicaid populations combined), please further define the denominator, including those who are excluded from the denominator. For example, please note if the denominator excludes children en rolled in managed care in certain counties or certa in plans or if it excludes children in fee-for-service or PCCM. Also, please report the number of childr en excluded. The provision of this information is impo rtant and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators can be assessed acros s the states and over time. Date Range: Define the date range for the reporting period base d on the \"From\" time period as the month and year that corresponds to the beginning pe riod in which utilization took place and define the \"To\" time period as the month and year that corresp onds to the end period in which utilization took pl ace. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be differe nt from the period corresponding to utilization of services. Child Core Set Performance Measurement Data: In this section, report the numerators, denominator s, and rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the dat a, depending on whether you are reporting using the technical specifications provided by the measure st eward or another methodology. The form fields have been set up to facilitate entering numerators and d enominators for each measure. If the form fields d o not give you enough space to fully report on the me asure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. \"Additional Notes/Comments on Measure\" may be enter ed but is not required. Please note that some measures require reporting of multiple rates. The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple r eporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different hea lth care delivery systems), states must aggregate data from all these sources into one state-level rate be fore reporting the data to CMS. In the situation w here a state combines data across multiple reporting units , all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In th ese cases, it should report the state-level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individu al reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure.\" In the section on \"Definition of Population Incuded in the Measure,\" states should indicate whether st ate- level rates were calculated based on rates for mult iple reporting units, and if so, whether the rates were weighted based on the size of the measure-eligible population or other factor or were not weighted. Fo r additional guidance on developing a state-level rat e, please refer to the Technical Assistance Brief \"Approaches to Developing State-Level Rates for Chi ldren's Health Care Quality Measures Based on CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 14 Data from Multiple Sources,\" available at: http://medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Informati on/By- Topics/Quality-of-Care/Downloads/TA2-StateRates.pdf . Deviation from Measure Specifications If the data provided for a measure deviate from the measure technical specifications, please select th e type(s) of measure specification deviation. The typ es of deviations parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. When one or more of th e types of deviations are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources a mong health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different ag e groups, definition of continuous enrollment)Other (please describe in detail). Other Performance Measure : If the state selected \"Other\" in the \"Measure Speci fication\" section of the template, and is thus repo rting using another methodology, the user should provide a description of the measure, along with the numerator, denominator, and rate in the \"Other Perf ormance Measure\" section. If reporting with another methodology, and the form fields do not give you en ough space to fully report on the measure, please upload the information to the attachment facility, along with a brief description of the measure (e.g. \"data reported for individuals in the 18-64 age range\"). \"Additional Notes/Comments on Measure\" may be entered but is not required. Beginning in 2012, in an effort to reduce state bur den of reporting on the Child Core Set measures, CMS will calculate measures PDENT (Preven tive Dental Services) and TDENT (Dental Treatment Services) for states based on data submit ted as part of the EPSDT report (Form CMS- 416), and measure CLABSI (Pediatric Central Line-As sociated Blood Stream Infections) based on data submitted by hospitals to the National Healthc are Safety Network database. Clarification About Implementing the CHIPRA CAHPS R equirement Under 402(a)(2), which amends reporting requirements in section 2108 of the Social Security Act, requires Title XXI Programs (i.e., CHIP Medicaid expansion programs, separate child health programs, or a comb ination of the two) to report CAHPS results to CMS starting December 2013. While Title XXI Pro grams may select any CAHPS Child Medicaid survey to fulfill this requirement, CMS en courages these programs to use the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H Child Questionnaire with or without the Supplemental Questions Items for Children with Chronic Conditions to align with the CAHPS Child Core Set measure. St arting in 2013, Title XXI Programs should submit summary leve l information from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also enc ourage states to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's CAHPS Database. More information is available in the Technical Assistance fact sheet, Collecting and Reporting the CAHPS Survey as Required Under the CHIPRA: http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Infor Title XIX Programs: Reporting CAHPS survey remains voluntary f or Title XIX Programs. Title XIX Programs should submit summary level info rmation from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also encourage s tates to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's CAHPS Database. If a state would like to provide CAHPS data on both Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, the agency must sample Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (CHIP) pr ograms separately and submit separate results to CMS to fulfill the CHIPRA Requirement.

(If you r goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, t he state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides y our state with an opportunity to track progress ove r time. This section contains templates for reporting perfo rmance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well chil d care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previous t wo years' annual reports (FFY 2012 and FFY 2013) will be populated with data from previously reported dat a in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previou s years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reported no d ata for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the curren t annual report (FFY 2014). Note that the term performance measure is used diff erently in Section IIA versus IIC. In Section IIA, the term refers to the Child Core Set measures. In thi s section, the term is used more broadly, to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a part icular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goals\" a re state- specific, and should be listed in the appropriate s ubsections within the space provided for each objec tive. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data tha t were reported in Sections IIA or IIB. The intent of this section is to capture goals and measures th at your state did not report elsewhere in Section II. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided below. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to repo rt up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting wi thin a given strategic objective. All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHI P beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, thre e hepatitis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13 th birthday.\" Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given stra tegic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: New/revised: Check this box if you have revised or added a goal . Please explain how and why the goal was revised. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 102 Continuing: Check this box if the goal you are reporting is th e same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued: Check this box if you have met your goal and/or ar e discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are repo rting for each goal, as follows: Provisional : Check this box if you are reporting performance me asure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way before you finalize them for FFY 2014. Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported f ield is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify w hy the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final : Check this box if the data you are reporting are c onsidered final for FFY 2014. Same data as reported in a previous year's annual r eport : Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reporte d for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previous ly reported the data. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the object ives\u2014 objectives related to increasing access to ca re, and objectives related to use of preventative care\u2014 because these are the two objectives for which stat es may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specificati on. In this section, for each goal, please indicat e the measurement specification used to calculate you r performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HED IS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. I f HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must b e completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field must be complete d. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please specify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2011, 2012). This field must be completed only when a user select the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field m ust be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected, Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the s ource of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives rela ted to reducing the number of uninsured children an d CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whethe r you have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (sp ecify the other source). For the objectives relate d to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrative data u sed), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (spe cify how the two were used to create the data source), s urvey data (specify the survey used), or other sour ce (specify the other source).

If the data provided for a measure deviates from th e measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The typ es of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each typ e of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater de tail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected.. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources a mong health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different ag e groups, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took plac e . Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may b e different from the period corresponding to enrollme nt or utilization of services. Date Range: available for 2014 CARTS reporting peri od. Please define the date range for the reporting peri od based on the \"From\" time period as the month an d year which corresponds to the beginning period in w hich utilization took place and please report the \" To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for t he measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be differe nt from the period corresponding to utilization of services. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and d enominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other met hodologies. The form fields have been set up to CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 104 facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted ra te\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state-leve l rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health p lans, different health care delivery systems), Stat es must aggregate data from all these sources into one Stat e rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multip le reporting units, all or some of which use the hy brid method to calculate the rates, the state should ent er zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fiel ds. In these cases, it should report the state-level ra te in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes o n Measure,\" along with a description of the method us ed to derive the state-level rate. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow your state t o highlight progress and describe any quality-impro vement activities that may have contributed to your progre ss. Any quality-improvement activity described sho uld involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, a nd relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality-improvement acti vity is a state-wide initiative to inform individua l families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rat es. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substantia lly involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to dis cuss potential reasons for why progress was not see n and to describe future quality-improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set an nual performance objectives for FFY 2015, 2016 and 2017. Based on your recent performance on the measure (from FFY 2012 through 2014), use a combina tion of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explai n your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project futu re increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. I f the rate has been fluctuating over time, you migh t look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctua tions are not an artifact of the data or the method s used to construct a rate. You might set an initial targ et that is an average of the recent rates, with sli ght increases in subsequent years. In future annual rep orts, you will be asked to comment on how your actu al performance compares to the objective your state se t for the year, as well as any quality-improvement activities that have helped or could help your stat e meet future objectives. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other commen ts on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences b etween performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attenti on deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath ca re needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] ALL Kids has contracted with the University of Alab ama at Birmingham (UAB) for quality studies. Multi ple studies are in the design and implementation proces s. Several studies are in the submission and revie w process. A study entitled, \"Can Increases in CHIP Copayments Reduce Program Expenditures on Prescription Drugs?\" was published in Medicare & Medicaid Resear ch Review which examined the impact of copayments upon prescription drug expenditures. The results of this study show that copayment incre ases reduce program expenditures on prescription drugs per enrollee and may be a useful tool for con trolling program costs. 4.

Duration Measure of Selected Children, A ges 0-16, Enrolled in Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2014 The purpose of this table is to measure title XXI e nrollees' duration, or continuity, of public covera ge (title XIX and title XXI). This information is required by CHIPRA, Section 402(a). Reporting is required in 2014, with states identif ying newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2014 (January, February, and March of 2014). If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time , an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. NOTE: The first cohort of newly enrolled children w as identified in the second quarter of 2012 (Januar y, February, and March of 2012), was followed for 1 8 months (through FFY2013), and stopped. This new coh ort is required for all states in the second quarte r of FFY2014 (January, February, and March of 2014) for the purpose of measuring duration of public coverag e (title XIX and title XXI), similar to the measure ment of the first 2012 cohort. Instructions: For this prospective duration measure, please iden tify newly enrolled children in title XXI in the second quarter of FFY 2014, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2014 mu st have birthdates after July 1997 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensu re that they will not age out of the program at the 18 th month of coverage. Similarly, children enrolled i n February 2014 must have birthdates after August 1 997, and children enrolled in March 2014 must have birthdates after September 1997. Ea ch child newly enrolled during this time frame need s a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over time. If your eligibility system already has the c apability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's age at enrollment creates an age cohort that does not cha nge over the 18 month time span). Please enter the data requested in th e table below and the template will tabulate the pe rcentages. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero.

CHIPRA CHIPRA reporting re quirements in section 2108 of the Social Security Act, requires Title XXI Programs (i.e., CHIP Medica id expansion programs, separate child health programs, or a combination of the two) to report CA HPS results to CMS starting December 2013. While Title XXI Programs may select any CAHPS survey to f ulfill this requirement, CMS encourages these programs to use the CAHPS Health Plan Survey 5.0H C hild Questionnaire with or without the Supplemental Items for Children with Chronic Condit ions (CCC) to align with the CAHPS measure in the Children's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP. Starting in 2013, Title XXI Programs should submit summary level information fr om the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also encourage states to su bmit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's CAHPS Database. More information is a vailable in the Technical Assistance fact sheet, Collecting and Reporting the CAHPS Survey as Requir ed Under the CHIPRA: http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Infor mation/By-Topics/Quality-of- Care/Downloads/CAHPSFactSheet.pdf . If a state would like to provide CAHPS data on both Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, the agency must sample Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (CHIP) pr ograms separately and submit separate results to CMS to fulfill the CHIPRA Requirement. Did you Collect this Survey in Order to Meet the CH IPRA CAHPS Requirement?

CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 166 SECTION V: PROGRAM CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS 1. For the reporting period, please provide an over view of your state's political and fiscal environme nt as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] During FY 2014, the State Health Officer continued to lead transformation activities for the Alabama Medicaid Agency as well direct the Alabama Departme nt of Public Health (ADPH) in which ALL Kids is located. To meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act, ADPH implemented a new joint CHIP/Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system. Th is system interacts with the Federally Facilitated Marketplace and the Federal Data Hub. To ensure \"no wrong door\" application processing, eligibility determinations for both ALL Kids and Medicaid are p erformed by staff in both agencies. In addition, call center staff in both agencies provide informat ion on both programs and have the ability to assist the caller with completion of a telephone applicati on. Although state budgets were lean, CHIP received suf ficient state funding for FY 2014. Alabama CHIP has implemented all of the mandated Af fordable Care Act changes. However, the state chose not to implement the optional adult Med icaid expansion. Medicaid is currently preparing to transition to a new delivery/payment system of care. 2. During the reporting period, what has been the g reatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] The three greatest challenges faced by CHIP during FY 2014 were: Implementing the changes in eligibility and enrol lment mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Implementing the new, joint CHIP/Medicaid Eligibi lity and Enrollment System which interacts with the FFM. Meeting the increased demand in the area of custo mer service. 3. During the reporting period, what accomplishment s have been achieved in your program? [7500] Implementation of Affordable Care Act required ch anges. Implementation of a new, joint CHIP/Medicaid Elig ibility and Enrollment System and new paper application. Meeting vastly increased demands for customer ser vice assistance. Continued, beyond grant funding, Covering Alabama Kids and Families Project. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2014 167 4. What changes have you made or are planning to ma ke in your CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planne d. [7500] Continue to enhance and refine the new, joint CHIP/ Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment System and move forward with inclusion of the Medicaid Elderly and Disabled Program.
