All age-eligible guests (currently 12 and older) and all crew must be fully inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine (with both doses, if recommended by manufacturer) at least 14-days prior to their embarkation date. Crystal continues to be a leader in its response to COVID-19 with protocols based on the latest data and recommendations by health experts as the company was the first major cruise line to require a COVID-19 vaccine for both guests and crew in 2021 and now the first through 2022. \"Protecting the health and safety of our guests and crew is paramount to everything we do and extending our vaccination requirements through 2022 is the next important step to continue to safeguard the health and wellness of our Crystal Family,\" said Jack Anderson, president of Crystal. \"Our guests have overwhelmingly told us that vaccinations are critical for them to feel comfortable traveling and announcing this extension now will give them the information and reassurance they require as they look to plan future voyages with us.\" Guests will need to provide documented proof of vaccination at the time of check-in before boarding the ship. Children 11 and under who are not currently eligible for vaccination must be pre-approved after initial waitlist, are subject to capacity control, and must provide proof of valid travel insurance. Guests traveling with unvaccinated children will be subject to unvaccinated protocols when with their children. Once vaccines are approved for age-eligible children, Crystal will require they be fully vaccinated. All officers and crew across the Crystal fleet are fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to service as a requirement of their employment. Yesterday, Crystal River Cruises announced it will require 100 percent guest and crew vaccination through 2022 as well. The company will assess whether a booster shot for all guests and crew across the full fleet will be required once more information is available. The vaccine requirement augments the company's comprehensive Crystal Clean+ measures, including COVID-19 tests at embarkation for both guests and crew, temperature checks when returning from ashore, a nimble mask policy, social distancing guidelines, enhanced cleaning and disinfection measures and more. Additionally, Crystal's Ocean, River and Expedition ships feature 100 percent fresh, non-recirculated air in every single guest suite, stateroom and social space. Crew across Crystal's fleet of ships are also currently wearing masks in all public areas to provide yet another layer of guest protection. The Crystal experience affords each guest an abundance of personal space that is unrivaled in cruising. Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony are designed to offer nearly double the space per guest of similar-sized ships. Crystal Endeavor, at 100 gross tons and 10,000 cubic feet per guest and a guest space ratio of more than 100, has the largest space per guest of any ship at sea. Sailing innovative global itineraries to virtually every corner of the earth, Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity offer travelers unforgettable vacation experiences highlighted by Crystal's unique brand of personal touches and attention to detail as well as among the highest staff-to-guest ratios in the industry. Guest accommodations are appointed with plush amenities and state-of-the-art conveniences in all categories, with no inside staterooms and nearly all staterooms and Penthouses featuring private verandahs. The German-built 20,200 GRT Crystal Endeavor is the ninth ship in the award-winning cruise line's worldwide fleet and is the fastest and most powerful expedition ship in the industry. Luxuriously designed to offer discerning guests elegantly expansive private and public spaces, the ship accommodates just 200 guests in 100 well-appointed all-verandah, all-butler serviced suites, which are among the largest and most spacious in expedition cruising. A one-to-one staff-to-guest ratio delivers the personal and genuine service for which Crystal is known. A leader in unrivaled luxury cruising for 30 years, Crystal distinguishes its ships and its voyages with fine details and nuances that make a big impact for discerning travelers. The all-inclusive experience features award-winning entertainment; diverse enrichment options; acclaimed Michelin-inspired dining in multiple specialty venues; unlimited pours of fine wines, beers and premium spirits and an unwavering standard of genuine, personal service for each guest.
