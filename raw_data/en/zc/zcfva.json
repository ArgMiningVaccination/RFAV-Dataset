Trial design The study is designed as a multicentre, parallel-group, three-arm, single-blind, prospective, randomized (1:1:1 ratio) study. Participants More than 360 participants will be recruited from healthy people who vaccinate NCVs in 5 community healthcare centres in the Sichuan province of China and 1 university hospital (Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine). Inclusion criteria: Vaccinators meets the conditions of NCVs injection and have no contraindications to it. The details shall be subject to the instructions of the NCVs used and the statement of medical institutions. The first dose of NCVs injection shall be completed within 24 hours from the time of injection to the time of enrolment; No redness, swelling, injury or infection of the skin or soft tissue of both ears, which is not suitable for APA; No history of alcohol and adhesive tape contact allergy; 18-59 years old, regardless of gender; Those who were able to complete the questionnaire independently at the time of the first and second dose of NCVs and on the 3rd, 7th and 15th day after the first and second dose of NCVs respectively; Those who agree to participate in the trial and sign the informed consent, and can seriously abide by the precautions after the injection of NCVs and the requirements of traditional Chinese medicine auricular point plasters sticking and acupressure. Exclusion criteria: Those who are not suitable to be vaccinated because they belong to the contraindication or cautious population; Those who have participated in other clinical trials within 4 weeks before the start of this study; No chronic/habitual/persistent headache, Muscle or joint pain, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, retching or vomiting before the injection of NCVs, and no related diseases present (details of this item is listed in full protocol); Those who are in use or have received TCMAPA within 2 weeks before the trial; Pregnant or lactating women; Participants with other serious primary diseases and psychosis. Intervention and comparator Auricular point acupressure group: participants receive bilateral, symptom-specific TCMAPA in 5 auricular points (per side, 10 points bilateral) for 5 days, 3-4 times (about 1 min each time) of self-acupressure per day, after each NCVs injection (10 days in total). Sham auricular point acupressure group: participants receive bilateral, none symptom-specific, sham APA in 5 auricular points (per side, 10 points bilateral) for 5 days, 3-4 times (about 1 min each time) of self-acupressure per day, after each NCVs injection (10 days in total). Blank control group: Non-intervention blank control. The Hebei medical device Co. Ltd, Hebei, China manufactured the auricular point sticking plasters. Main outcomes Primary outcomes are all scores of visual analogue scale (VAS) based on subjective judgment of the participants included, including VAS score of pain at injection site, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, nausea, retching, vomiting and diarrhea. Time points for outcomes above are the same: Immediately after first and second injection of the vaccine (Baseline assessment); Three days after first and second injection of the vaccine; Seven days after first and second injection of the vaccine; Fifteen days after first and second injection of the vaccine. Randomisation Participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to each group by computerized random number generator, and independently in each sub-centre. Blinding (masking) Participants, information collectors and statistical evaluators will be blinded between APA group and sham APA group. No blinding in the control group. Numbers to be randomised (sample size) No less than 360 participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to each group. Trial Status Protocol version 2.0 of February 3rd, 2021. Recruitment is expected to start on February 18th, 2021, and to finish on March 12th, 2021.
