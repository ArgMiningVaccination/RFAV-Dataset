Integrative medicine is never to the exclusion of traditional medicine. It is simply adding and/or using alternative treatment options where appropriate. At the HCIM, we recognize all benefits that vaccines offer. We do require children in our practice to be immunized; however, we do work with parents to uniquely tailor vaccination schedules. We follow all traditional family practice guidelines and treatments. Dr. Rihmland is board certified in Family Medicine first and foremost. She is also board certified in Functional Medicine, Integrative Medicine, and Medical Acupuncture. Integrative Medicine (IM) is the direct connection between patient and practitioner and total wellness. It is a healing-oriented medicine that takes into account the whole person (mind, body, and spirit), including all aspects of nutrition and lifestyle. IM emphasizes the therapeutic relationship between physician and patient as partners in the healing process. It makes use of all appropriate therapies (conventional and alternative/complementary) to facilitate a much more effective healing response from the body. Integrative medicine neither rejects conventional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies without a critical eye. Good medicine is based on good science. It is inquiry-driven, open to new paradigms, and always seeking high-quality evidence of safety and effectiveness. Effective interventions that are natural, less invasive, and are known to cause fewer side effects should be used whenever possible. At The Health Center for Integrative Medicine in Washington, PA, we see patients of all ages, from newborns to the elderly (we call this womb-to-tomb care). We provide comprehensive family medicine in a compassionate, communicative, and supportive environment. Integrative medicine involves using the best possible treatments from both conventional and complementary/alternative medicine based on each patient's individual needs and condition. We are especially known to be persistent in our pursuit of answers and treatments for complex medical issues. We offer both in-office appointments as well as telehealth and E-visits. Our specialties include integrative and functional medicine for the whole family, women's health, acupuncture, thyroid issues, gut health, and more. In addition to any procedure you would receive at a family doctor's office, we also offer scar deactivation, acupuncture/gua sha/cupping, cryotherapy, joint injections, and more. We offer well-visits and problem-focused visits for patients of all ages. This includes pre-operative exams, physicals, gynecologic exams, and more. We offer immunizations and vaccines for all ages. Please note that all children of the practice must receive all immunizations set forth by the American Academy of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians. We understand that some parents may want to follow an alternative vaccine schedule, and we are more than happy to assist with this. 8am-12pm 1pm-5pm 7:30am-12pm 1pm-4:30pm 9am-1pm 2pm-6pm Closed Call [724-506-1293](tel:7245061293) for the answering service "}
