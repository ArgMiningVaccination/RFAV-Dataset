ESMO welcomes the WHO Global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem because cervical cancer can largely be prevented through HPV vaccination , and it can also be curable if detected early enough and adequately treated. In fact, vaccination , screening and treatment , are on WHO's list of cost - effective 'best buy ' interventions for cervical cancer within the 2013 -2020 WHO Global NCD Action Plan , and should follow WHO's recommendation to be safe, effective, of quality , and affordable . To achieve the goal of 90% treatment and care for cervical cancer cases , ESMO supports WHO's recommendation that it is paramount for countries to implement evidence -based clinical treatment guidelines which can improve patient outcomes and the efficient use of resources. We take this opportunity to raise awareness that ESMO develops, and regularly updates, almost 80 ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines , including guidelines on Cervical Cancer , and Supportive and Palliative Care . The ESMO Guidelines are freely availabl e on the ESMO website ( www.esmo.org ), together with accompanying Patient Guides written so that patients can understand them. We call on WHO Member States to fully integrate the WHO cervical cancer elimination strategy into national U niversal Health Coverage programs, in order to fulfill their commitment to implement the 2017 WHO Cancer Resolution and to reduce premature deaths from cancer by 25% by 2 025 and 33% by 2030 . ESMO continually does its part to support the dissemination of WHO information to its members across the globe . We will be proud to invite WHO to present its Global strategy towards eliminating cervical cancer as a public health probl em to the 30,000 cancer specialists worldwide who attend the annual ESMO Congress. Thank you. "}
