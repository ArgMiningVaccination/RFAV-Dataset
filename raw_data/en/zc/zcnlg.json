The Arkansas Department of Health is authorized by Act 999 of 2003 to grant individual exemptions from the immunization requirements. This packet contains an applic ation for exemption, which you have requested, or you may complete the online application at https://OnlineImmunizationExemption.ADH.Arkansas.gov/ . An application requesting an exemption must be submitted for each child. An application with a notarized signature of the parent or guardian must be submitted each school year to the Department of Health. Only a 2023 -2024 Immunization Exemption Application will be accepted for the 2023 -2024 school year. When approved, exemptions will be effective for the start of the Fall session in 2023 and go through the summer sessions of 2024. As part of the application, the law requires that the parent/guardian complete an educational activity when requesting an exemption. The required educational a ctivity can be met by reading the enclosed Vaccine Information Statements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These statements provide information about the required vaccines. On page 6 of this application packet, you are asked to sign that you have received and reviewed the Vaccine Information Statements, that you understand the risks and benefits of the vaccines, and that you still choose to request an exemption. This form must also be signed by a Notary Public. Please submit your com pleted application to the Arkansas Department of Health Immunization Section.

If your application is not complete, we will send you a checklist showing the reason(s) we were unable to process your application. You will then need to include the requested information and return the updated application for processing as soon as possible by fax, email, or mail; see page six of the application. After you have received your approval letter, you are responsible for notifying your child's daycare or school that your exemption request has been approved. You are responsible for retaining the original letter. A copy of the approval letter is to be placed in your child's file at the daycare or school. Release of information will be provided only to the custodial parent/guardian who completes this application and according to the notarized signature.

Sincerely, Jennifer Dillaha , MD Director and State Health Officer If You Choose Not to Vaccinate Your Child, Understand the Risks and Responsibilities. If you choose to delay some vaccines or reject some vaccines entirely, there can be risks. Be aware: Any vaccine -preventable disease can strike at any time in the U.S. because all of these diseases still circulate either in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world. Some of the vaccine -preventable diseases that still circu late in the U.S. include pertussis (whooping cough), varicella (chickenpox), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, which is a cause of meningitis), and influenza. These diseases, as well as the other vaccine -preventable diseases, can range from mild to sever e and life -threatening. In most cases, there is no way to know beforehand if a child will get a mild or serious case. When there is a vaccine -preventable disease in your community: It may not be too late to get protection by getting vaccinated. If there a re cases (or, in some circumstances, a single case) of a vaccine -preventable disease in your community, you may be asked to take your child out of school, childcare, or organized activities (for example, playgroups or sports). Your school, childcare facility, or other institution will tell you when it is safe for an unvaccinated child to return. Be prepared to keep your child home for several days and up to several weeks. Why vaccinate? Vaccines save lives and protect against the spread of disease. If you decide not to vaccinate your child, you put your child at risk. Your child could catch a disease that is dangerous or deadly. Getting vaccinated is much better than getting the disease. Vaccines work. They have kept children heal thy and have saved millions of lives for more than 50 years. Most childhood vaccines are 90 to 99 percent effective in preventing disease. And if a vaccinated child does get the disease, the symptoms are usually less serious than in a child who has not bee n vaccinated. Vaccines are safe. All vaccines used in the U.S. must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA will not let a vaccine be given unless it has been proven to be safe and to work well in children. The results are reviewed again by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians before a vaccine is officially recommended to be given to children. Also, the FDA monitors where and how vaccin es are made. The places where vaccines are made must be licensed. They are regularly inspected, and each vaccine lot is safety -tested. Page 2 of 6 What if you don't immunize your child? Your child will be left at risk of catching the disease. Vaccines were developed to protect people from dangerous and often fatal diseases. Vaccines are safe and effective, and the vaccine -preventable diseases are still a threat. Your child will be an infectious disease threat to others. Children who are not va ccinated can readily transmit vaccine -preventable diseases to others in their community. o Unvaccinated children can pass diseases on to babies who are too young to be fully immunized. o Unvaccinated children pose a threat to children and adults who cannot be immunized for medical reasons. This includes people with leukemia and other cancers, immune system problems, and people receiving treatment or medications that suppress their immune system. o Unvaccinated children can infect the small percentage of children who cannot reach full protection from a vaccination due to medical reasons. Your child may have to be excluded from school or childcare. During disease outbreaks, unvaccinated children may be excluded from school or childcare until the outbreak is over. Excluding children from school or childcare is for their own protection and the protection of others. Outbreaks may last for several days to several weeks. Therefore, exclusion can be a hardship for the child and parent. Your vaccination decision affects not only the health of your child, but also all of your family, your child's friends and their families, and your community.
