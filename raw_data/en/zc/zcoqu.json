Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specic, varying across time, place, and vaccines. It is influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience, and condence.\" Vaccine. 2015 Aug;33(34):4161-4. Epub 2015 Apr 17.

Atkinson, W, Wolfe, S, Hamborsky, J, McIntyre, L (Eds). Public Health Foundation, Washington DC 2009. Immunization is one of the most effective preventative health measures and has saved countless children from death or serious disability.\"The example that I use is an example which happened to my wife. She came into the ofce on a weekend day. She was helping the nurse give vaccines. She walked into a room. A mother was sitting with her four month old child waiting alongside of the wall. While my wife was drawing the vaccine through the syringe, the child had a seizure and went on to have the permanent seizure disorder, epilepsy. If my wife had given that vaccine ve minutes earlier, I think there are no amount of statistical data in the world that would've convinced that mother of anything other than the vaccine caused it. What else could it have been, right? I mean, the child was ne, they got this vaccine, and then they had epilepsy. What else could it have been?\" Paul A. Oft; American pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases and an expert on vaccines, immunology, and virology. He is the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine that has been credited with saving hundreds to thousands of lives every day.Franklin B ed. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. New York, NY: Macmillan Publishing Co, Inc; 2004 \"I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it, my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.\"Benjamin Franklin, a prominent early anti-vaccination campaigner, regretted his skepticism about vaccination after his 4-year-old son died from smallpox. In March 2015, we were struck by the rotavirus. I'll never forget the look of fear on my daughters' faces as they suffered intense pain and diarrhea that lasted for three weeks. I've no idea where we picked it up, but the horric experience proved that, even living in a highly vaccinated population, we were vulnerable. Thankfully, we pulled through with a combination of rest and rehydration. New York Post September 2016Andrew Jeremy WakeeldBritish former gastroenterologist and medical researcher. Fraudulent 1998 research paper in support of the now-discredited claim that there was a link between the administration of the MMR vaccine, and the appearance of autism and bowel disease. After the publication of the paper, other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakeeld's ndings or conrm his hypothesis of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism and GI disease. A 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identied undisclosed nancial conflicts of interest on Wakeeld's part, and most of his co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations. An investigation centered on Deer's numerous ndings, including that children with autism were subjected to unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies and lumbar punctures, and that Wakeeld acted without the required ethical approval from an institutional review board. http://www.csicop.org/si/show/vaccines_and_the_anti-vaccination_movement_an_interview_with_dr._paul_ofthttp://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/mapping-measles-vaccine-coverage-around-the-country http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/mapping-measles-vaccine-coverage-around-the-country Pediatrics 2004;114:187-195Pediatrics 2004;114:187-195Vaccines; Pseudo-Science of the Vaccine DoubtersEpidemiology http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm The prevalence of vaccine refusal is low, but not zero.Exemption from school immunization requirements for non-medical reasons is the primary measure of vaccine refusal in the United States Epidemiology; Pseudo-Science of the Vaccine DoubtersRates of Non-medical Exemptions from School Immunization, According to Type of Exemption and Ease of Obtaining One, 2006-2011.Increasing difculty of exception policy decreases opting out.
