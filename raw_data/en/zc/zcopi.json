It then provides solutions to correct problems with energy production to enhance performance and slow aging. It includes VO2 Max Testing. Perform Like a King Professional cyclist Ben King uses Phydos Clinic's Bio-Energy Testing to prepare for season. Bio-Energy Testing Bio-Energy Testing is one of the most innovative health and anti-aging assessments that we offer at Phydos Clinic. It utilizes technology from Korr combined with specialized computer software that precisely measures the capacity of your body to extract energy from oxygen. This testing can be performed on adults and teenagers. Enhancing Sports Training Testing provides athletes data to assist in determining optimal training loads and ideal daily caloric intake. Optimizing Biological Age Age is not a number\u2014it is a complex combination of factors that you have the ability to control to feel and look younger. Anti-Aging Programs Measuring mitochondrial function provides data to assist in slowing the aging process and improving energy. How It Works Every cell nucleus in the body contains special energy-producing structures called mitochondria. It is the mitochondria that use oxygen to burn fat and sugar creating chemical energy the body requires to carry on living. Bio-Energy Testing measures how efficiently the mitochondria are functioning. Proper mitochondrial functioning is critical to good health, and poor mitochondrial functioning is a root cause for nearly every disease, obesity, and even the process of aging itself. Data-Driven Personal Health Decisions Bio-Energy Testing determines: Your optimum carbohydrate intake Your optimum caloric intake Your lung function Your heart function Your overall strength Your optimum exercise levels Works by measuring oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Oxygen consumption directly determines mitochondrial efficiency. Carbon dioxide production determines fat metabolism. Optimum carbohydrate intake is determined by the ratio of oxygen consumption to carbon dioxide production. Overall strength is determined by the amount of work you are capable of per unit of energy produced. The Bio-Energy Testing analyzer sorts and analyses an enormous amount of data and calculates your energy production dynamics under both basal and exercise conditions. Bio-Energy Testing algorithms present the results of these calculations in a way that can have immediate clinical relevance. "}
