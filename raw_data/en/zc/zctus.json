Biological: Undiluted Francisella tularensis live 1x10^9 colony forming units (cfu)/mL] produced by Dynport Vaccine Company. Administered by scarification in the ulnar aspect of the volar surface (palm side) of the forearm midway between the wrist and the elbow. | Experimental: Group B (USAMRIID-LVS) | Single dose of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases Live Vaccine Strain (USAMRIID-LVS) product in one arm and normal saline (NS) control in the other arm on Day 0. | Other: Placebo | Normal saline will be administered to all subjects as a control and will be given at the same visit as the vaccine (Day 0). Biological: Undiluted Francisella tularensis live attenuated attenuated vaccine (approximately 1x10^9 cfu/mL) in use by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Administered by scarification in the ulnar aspect of the volar surface (palm side) of the forearm midway between the wrist and the elbow. - Safety: incidence of vaccine-associated serious adverse events (SAEs). [ Time Frame: Throughout the course of the study. ] - Immunogenicity: proportion of subjects that seroconvert (greater than or equal to 4-fold rise in antibody titer) as measured by a tularemia-specific microagglutination assay. [ Time Frame: Visits 7 or 8 post vaccination (Day 28 or Day 56). ] - Safety: incidence of Grade 3 or 4 laboratory values. [ Time Frame: Through Day 28 of the study. ] - Proportion of subjects that develop a positive \"take\" response, as assessed by the clinical site, defined as the development of an erythematous papule, vesicle, and/or eschar with or without underlying induration. [ Time Frame: By study Visit 5 (7-9 days post vaccination). ] - Take: proportion of subjects that develop a positive \"take\" response, as assessed by an independent blinded \"take committee,\" following review of photographs taken of the vaccination and placebo sites. [ Time Frame: Study Visit 5 (7-9 days post vaccination). ] - Safety: occurrence of solicited systemic AEs. [ Time Frame: Within 28 days post vaccination. ] - Take: difference in the proportion of subjects that develop a positive \"take\" response between the two vaccine groups as assessed by an independent blinded \"take committee\". [ Time Frame: Study Visit 5 (7-9 days post vaccination). ] - Safety: occurrence of solicited local adverse events (AE)s. [ Time Frame: Within 28 days post vaccination. ] - Immunogenicity: geometric mean titers (GMT) of peak microagglutination titer for each arm of the study. For each subject, the peak titer is defined by the maximum titer among all the available measures. [ Time Frame: Visits 6, 7 and 8 post vaccination (Day 14, Day 28 and Day 56).. ] - Take: difference in the proportion of subjects that develop a positive \"take\" response between the two vaccine groups as assessed by the clinical site.
