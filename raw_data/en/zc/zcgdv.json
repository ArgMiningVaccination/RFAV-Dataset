It's very different from her undergraduate days at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, where she majored in biomedical engineering. \"I liked engineering,\" Rosemarie said. \"It's hands-on problem solving that translates well to medicine. But I missed the human interaction.\" At Upstate, Rosemarie has finished clerkships in pediatrics, psychiatry, neurology and OB/GYN, and is currently in internal medicine. Family medicine and surgery await. Earlier this fall, Rosemarie was immersed in the five-week neurology clerkship, which included a different subspecialty each week. The stroke subspecialty included daily rounds on the neurology unit of [Upstate University Hospital](http://upstate.edu/hospital/). On a Friday morning, [Carmen Martinez, MD,](http://www.upstate.edu/search/?tab=people&ID=martcarm) assistant professor of neurology, led a team of eight to check in on several patients on 9E. Rosemarie was joined by classmates Emily Kellogg and Nathan Jones, plus a handful of medical residents and observers. The first stop was the room of a seriously ill patient. Fifteen minutes later, the team emerged and met privately with a family member to discuss the patient's prognosis. Outside the room of a second patient, Rosemarie briefed Dr. Martinez on the symptoms she had observed on \"pre-rounds\" earlier that morning. Emily and Nathan stood nearby, and other members of team listened or examined laptop screens on the portable workstations they wheeled from room to room. Dr. Martinez listened and offered her insights into what Rosemarie reported. The patient wasn't in her room at that moment (she was examined a short while later), so the team went to check on a newly admitted patient down the hall. Another physician met with the team in the crowded hallway to review the patient's brain scan images. The man had been brought in to the Emergency Department the previous day after becoming ill while grocery shopping. After consulting with the other physician outside the patient's room, Dr. Martinez explained why she was about to show the patient the images from his brain scan. \"We always show them the pictures, so we're on the same page,\" she said. Dr. Martinez met with the patient and went over his scan and his prognosis. She then watched and assisted as Rosemarie and Emily tested the patient's responses to applied pressure on his hands, arms, face, legs and feet. \"Getting to round on patients and challenge ourselves to think of differential diagnoses is always intellectually stimulating and enjoyable,\" Rosemarie said. \"(So) much more occurs in neurology than just strokes, like so many people think. \"It was incredible to see how much can be done for the patients and how caring the staff was to patients, their families and their colleagues,\" she said. \"For me, neurology was a return to a clinical medicine based rotation and a reminder of why I entered medical school.\" Rosemarie's first clerkship this year was pediatrics, which she thoroughly enjoyed, citing Drs. [Ann Botash](http://www.upstate.edu/gch/providers/group_list.php?provider_id=61&name=Ann+Botash) and [Khalia Grant](https://blogs.upstate.edu/withdistinction/2014/03/24/wait-was-worth-it-for-this-graduating-upstate-medical-student/) as great mentors. Rounding in the pediatric emergency department, Rosemarie was especially impressed by Dr. Grant, who showed \"no bias, and was just very kind and non-judgmental,\" she said. Other influences run deeper, to Rosemarie's family in Rockland County. An aunt is a Nurse Practitioner (Rosemarie shadowed her while an undergraduate) and another aunt and uncle are physicians. Her mother is a special education teacher who \"instilled a love of working with children and helping others,\" said Rosemarie, who's been a babysitter, camp counselor and Special Olympics volunteer. \"I've always loved caring for kids,\" she said. \"I've always "}
