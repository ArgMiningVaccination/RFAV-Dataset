Excitement, for example, can be mixed with anxiety and uncertainty about your future. You may also have many questions about your health and other issues. This care plan will make this time of transition easier - helping you know what to expect in the months and years ahead. The information is specific to colorectal cancer survivors including details on medical follow- up, recurrence, medical and non-medical side effects of colorectal cancer. Who Provides Care? C hanging health care providers once treatment is over can be challenging and unsettling. Many patients come to rely on their oncologist, for example, and are nervous about leaving his or her care. This transition is necessary, however, to ensure you are cared for in a timely manner. Depending on the situation, you may continue to see an oncologist for follow-up visits, but your long-term care should be managed by your local family doctor or nurse practitioner. Medical Follow-up M edical follow-up may include appointments with medical professionals, physical exams, and various tests (such as Carcinoembryonic Antigen or CEA). The main goal is to detect new or recurrent disease. Another goal is to determine the effectiveness of the treatments you have already had. Follow-up provided to patients treated for colorectal cancer varies depending on the stage and type of diagnosis. The BC Cancer Agency recommends the following guidelines and schedule for colorectal cancer follow-up based on cancer staging: All patients treated for colorectal cancer should have a detailed general exam, including a comprehensive history to determine if significant gastrointestinal symptoms exist. o History should include an assessment of nutritional status A complete physical examination should be conducted. o Physical exam should include attention to the left supraclavicular fossa, liver, abdomen and rectal evaluation o A perineal inspection and palpation should be conducted if patient has undergone an abdominoperineal resection Laboratory testing is not recommended for patients without symptoms except for the CEA tumour marker in patients who may be candidates for solitary metastasis resection. o If CEA is elevated, thoracic, abdominal and other imagining can be performed o If CEA is not elevated after 5 year follow-up, testing should be discontinued Your Colorectal Cancer Follow-up Schedule T he schedule below is based on the BCCA Colorectal cancer follow-up guidelines. The dates are a suggested timeline which your doctor may adjust to fit your needs. Procedure Recommended Schedule Target Date Year 1 Medical History/ Physical Exam CEA testing Every 3 months 3 months: 6 months: 9 months: 12 months: Colonoscopy Once in Year One Chest X-ray or CT Every 6-12 months Liver Imaging Every 6 months Year 2 Medical History/ Physical Exam CEA testing Every 3 months 1 yr + 3 months: 1 yr + 6 months: 1 yr + 9 months: 2 years: Chest X-ray or CT Every 6-12 months Liver Imaging E very 6 months Year 3 Medical History/ Physical Exam CEA testing Every 3 months 2 yr + 3 months: 2 yr + 6 months: 2 yr + 9 months: 3 years: Chest X-ray or CT Every 6-12 months Liver Imaging Every 6 months Year 4 Medical History/ Physical Exam CEA testing Every 6 months 3 yr + 6 months: 4 years: Colonoscopy Every 3-5 Years Chest X-ray or CT E very 6-12 months Liver Imaging O nce per year Year 5 Medical History/ Physical Exam CEA testing Every 6 months 4 yr + 6 months: 5 years: Chest X-ray or CT Every 6-12 months Liver Imaging Once per year Beyond *Adapted to the BCCA guidelines. Medical Side Effects T reatment for cancer is rapidly changing. With the development of new medications and therapies, it is hard keep up with all the long-term side effects. Further, every person is unique and so are the side effects that each will experience. Be an active participant in your care and share news of any changes in your health with a member of your health care team. This section covers common side effects. Treatment-Specific Side Effects Most cancer patients and survivors experience mild, short-term side effects - rarely all of them. Here are some common side effects from surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Nerve related side-effects: Numbness, tingling or pain in hands or feet Urination related side-effects: Frequent urination Having to wear a Pad Difficulty emptying bladder completely Bowel related side-effects; Incontinence Frequent or Urgent bowel movements Having to wear a pad Constipation Bowel blockage (resulting in pain, nausea, and/or vomiting) Sexual side-effects: Problems with erections and/or ejaculation (male) Problems with pain during sex and/or vaginal dryness (female) Other side-effects: Ostomy issues, skin and appliance problems Negative feeling about Ostomy appliance Unwanted weight gain or weight loss Skin changes (due to radiation or surgery) Hernia Trouble sleeping and/or mood swings Resources: For information on Bevacizumab related treatment side-effects from the BC Cancer Agency, please visit: www.bccancer.bc.ca/NR/rdonlyres/6058B58E-E540-4C29-9 4C0- 3E1A94FD1571/19258/Managementforbevacizumabsideeffec ts_1Dec06.pdf Fatigue Fatigue is one of the more common side effects of cancer treatment. Friends and family may expect your energy levels to return to normal once treatment is over. You, however, may feel exhausted for a while after treatment. Fatigue can have many causes and you should be aware of changes in your energy level. If you experience new or worsening symptoms talk them over with your doctor. Fatigue can also be caused by dehydration, diarrhea, anemia, fever, infection, nausea, vomiting, pain and depression. To help manage your fatigue, try planning your days in advance and avoid hectic schedules. If you are going to have a full day, be sure to set time aside to eat and rest between activities. Light exercise can also help improve energy levels and enhance your quality of life. Sudden or severe fatigue can be caused by an infection or it could be due to the cancer treatment you received. If you suffer from this type of serious fatigue, be sure to discuss it with your doctor. Memory, Concentration and 'Chemo-Brain' Serious memory or concentration problems are less common side effects of cancer treatment. Many survivors do notice minor changes, however, the sources of which are various. Chemotherapy, for example, can directly affect your brain causing lapses in memory and concentration - 'Chemo Brain'. Such problems can also be due to the fatigue and stress caused by the cancer treatments. In rare cases, they can also be a sign of a more serious problem, such as the spread of your cancer, and should be discussed with your doctor. Possible Causes of Memory Problems and 'Chemo Brain' : Medications Chemotherapy drugs that weaken your immune system (Immunosuppressive drugs), antibiotics, steroids, pain management drugs, nausea/vomiting drugs, and other cancer- related symptoms can affect your thinking and memory causing symptoms of 'Chemo Brain'. There is controversy regarding the cause of 'Chemo-brain'. Metabolic Problems Certain cancers produce hormones that affect the brain. The thyroid gland, if it is not working properly, can affect thinking and memory and cause a depressed mood. If the liver or kidneys are not functioning right, toxins can build up in the blood and lessen mental sharpness. Unhealthy Diet The lack of a well balanced, healthy diet also contributes to memory and concentration problems. Ostomy Care S ome survivors of colorectal cancer may have been treated with an ostomy (small opening in the abdomen that a healthy section of the intestines is connected to by creating an opening in the intestines to allow feces to exit the body. External appliances like bags and pouches can be attached to this opening (stoma) in order to collect feces. Because the digestive system has been altered, you may have some issues with certain foods and there will be a period of getting used to your new system. Everyone's experience may be different; however there are resources to support you through this process. Symptoms of Memory/Thinking Problems in Cancer: D ifficulty understanding complex information Easily distracted Exhausted by tasks requiring mental energy \"Chemo Brain\" Represents a Lack of Clear Thought: Not remembering what you are talking about Forgetting what you are doing Forgetting phone numbers you could recite easily prior to treatment Asking questions only to repeat them 15 minutes later For information and tips on memory & concentration see Appendix A Resources: U nited Ostomy Association -Mail info1@ostomycanada.ca Phone 1-416-595-5452 U niversity Hospital of Northern British Columbia, 1475 Edmonton street Prince George http://find.healthlinkbc.ca/search.aspx?d=SL072201 Phone: 250-565-2000 Potential Treatment Related Side-Effects My current side effects My side effect management plan 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3. Recurrence If you experience a second cancer in the same area a s the first, this is called a recurrence . When a recurrence of the original cancer occurs in a new area, it is called a metastasis . If the recurrence shows up in multiple areas, it is kno wn as metastases . R ecurrences are often grouped by the area in which they \"come back\". Local recurrence appears in the same area that was originally diagnosed. Regional recurrence appears in lymph node areas of the body that are adjacent or close to the first diagnosed location. Metastatic or Distant recurrence is when the cancer appears in another area. Relatively unique to colon and rectal cancers, is the distinction between \"liver only metastases\", and \"liver plus other distant metastases\". Occassionally \"liver only can be removed surgically, or ablated (e.g. radiofrequency ablation or radiation therapy). What is the chance I will have a recurrence? Your oncologist will evaluate your risk for recurrence which depends on factors such as your age, the stage of your cancer, and the treatment you received. Discuss these risks with your oncologist. The first three years after diagnosis are the most common for colorectal cancer recurrence. After three years, the chance of recurrence drops steadily. Adhering to follow-up schedules in the first 5-years after diagnosis is important. If recurrence occurs, early diagnosis is shown to lead to improved treatment and outcome. Signs and Symptoms of Recurrence If the following signs or symptoms occur, seek medical attention from your doctor as soon as possible : B lood in the stool or sputum Black or pale stool Jaundice Protrusion or sticking out of the stoma Blood or air in urine New lumps in the neck, groin or other region If you experience the following general symptoms for more than one week , discuss them w ith your family doctor. They could be a sign of colorectal cancer recurrence: Loss of appetite or unintentional weight loss Unexplained and/or constant new pain Cough Nausea or vomiting lasting several days Shortness of breath Pain in the abdomen or rectum Change in bowel habit (loose stool or constipation) Change in energy levels or abilities Signs and Symptoms to Watch for and When to Seek Adv ice Sign/Symptom Who to Contact 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3. Genetic Counseling S ome tumors are considered as hereditary cancer meaning they can be passed down from family member to family member. Talk with your doctor about hereditary cancer and whether genetic testing is needed for you or your family. The following criteria indicate the possibility of a hereditary cancer: Unusually early age of cancer diagnosis (<45 years of age for colorectal cancers) Multiple cancers in a single individual (i.e. colorectal and endometrial cancer) Clustering of the same cancer type in close relatives (i.e. mother and sister with colorectal cancer) Cancers occurring in multiple generations of a family Occurrence of rare tumors (i.e. retinoblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, granulosa cell tumor of the ovary, ocular melanoma or duodenal cancer) Geographic or ethnic populations known to be at high risk of hereditary cancers Resources: www.bccancer.bc.ca/PPI/Prevention/Hereditary/Default .htm Screening Recommendations T he following chart describes recommendations for the screening of family members of those diagnosed with colorectal cancer. It is of note that inherited colorectal cancer is specifically considered if a patient diagnosis includes: Disease before the age of 45 years Many cancers in several generations Several family members with colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps Patient Diagnosis Before age 60 After age 60 Patient and close family member with colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps Family Member Screening Recommendations Colonoscopy at age 40 (or 10 years before earliest diagnosis age) Fecal Occult Blood Test at age 40, every 2 years.

Additional information on this subject is included in the resource section. Living Beyond Cancer Y ou finally made it. You finished your treatment and are ready to continue with your life. Many patients and their loved ones expect life to return to normal. This expectation, however, sometimes brings disappointment. You have just gone through a physically, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually changing experience and the idea of life returning to the way it was before your diagnosis may be unrealistic. As time passes, your side effects and symptoms will lessen and you will be able to start returning to a more normal routine. It is important for you, and for those around you, to realize, however, that this takes time and not to expect that you will feel wonderful right away. You may want to ponder the journey you have just completed and how this finds you in a new situation. You may have to make some changes to daily living, work or how you spend your free time, but this is not necessarily negative. You are not alone and there are many resources and support services to help. Stress, Anxiety and Depression Stress Stress can affect you in many different ways - physically, emotionally and/or behaviorally. Review the list of symptoms below and ask yourself if any are having a negative effect on your life? When they affect your day-to-day living, you need to seek professional help. Physical Emotional Behavioral Muscle tension Cold sweaty hands Facial ticks Fatigue Tension headaches Indigestion High blood pressure Heart palpitations Back pain Jaw tension Nervous stomach Nausea Diarrhea Teeth grinding Appetite change Anxiety Fear Irritability Hopelessness Helplessness Impatience Depression Nervousness Feeling overwhelmed Loss of concentration Anger Sadness Disbelief Indifference Frustration Change in appetite Sleep disturbance Forgetfulness Physical violence Decline in productivity Social withdrawal Indecisiveness Misuse of alcohol-drugs Misuse of caffeine Misuse of tobacco Use of addictive methods of coping such as: Gambling Hoarding Excessive spending Exchange your Stresses U nderstanding the types of stress you are faced with can help you handle them better. For example, you may be able to deal with your stress level by \"exchanging stresses\". This means that you rank your stresses (make a list of your top 5 or 10) so that you are dealing with the most important ones. Ask yourself 'What is one thing on this list I can take care of today? What steps can I take to remove this stress from my list?' Decide on a step you can take to remove a stressor. This will help to avoid piling up all of your stresses until you are unable to cope. Sometimes the process of listing stressors also helps one to organize and de-stress. Develop a \"Tool Box\" for Dealing with Stress Once you have identified the types of stress in your life, you can begin to try different ways of dealing with them. These can then become part of a 'tool box' that you go to for help during times of stress. What are some of the common ways you already use to cope? New tools might include deep breathing and active relaxation. Learning about ways to reduce stress means that you can use these tools whenever you need to. You will learn what works best for you and to seek help from others when needed. Anxiety Ongoing physical problems associated with cancer can result in anxiety. Anxiety often stems from feelings of loss of control, feeling alone and/or uncertain about your health. These feelings can be handled by using helpful tools and seeking support when needed. Feelings of anxiety during treatment usually continue into survivorship despite the belief that when treatment is over the anxiety will lessen. Situations like returning to work and dealing with health benefits details are sources of anxiety for many survivors. We all experience anxiety at some time in our lives and there are ways to reduce and manage it. Identifying anxiety is the first step. From there, you can learn the cause of your anxiety and decide on ways to cope. Counseling, support groups and relaxation techniques can also be helpful. Anti-anxiety medication may be another option to talk over with your health care team. Managing your Anxiety Learning about the causes of your anxiety is the first step to help you to manage that which makes you feel anxious. Try keeping a diary of moments when your anxiety level increases so that you can identify things that make you anxious and then you can begin to measure your improvement. You may need to talk with a counsellor at the beginning. Try methods like deep breathing, muscle relaxation and others until you find what works for you. For more information on ways to deal with stress see Appendix B Sadness M any steps along the cancer journey can create feelings of sadness, for example, your views on how your family is affected by your cancer or if you will be able to return to your old job. It is important to work through your emotions and express them rather than keeping them to yourself. Identify supportive people in your life whom you feel will be helpful in sorting through your emotions with you. De pression Depression is different from sadness. The duration is longer and the symptoms are different and more serious. You may experience any number of these symptoms. Depression can reduce your quality of life. The stage at which you were diagnosed with cancer and treatment you received both have an effect on your risk of depression. If you feel any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a counsellor to learn how you can better manage them. You may just need someone to talk with who will help you explore your emotions and provide suggestions to help you cope.

(2011) Breast Cancer Survivor to Financial Survivor Rural and Remote. www.cbcn.ca/index.php?pageaction=content.page&id=658 2&lang=en Returning to Work F or some cancer survivors, returning to work offers the opportunity to resume 'normal' routines, to be back in control, to focus on other challenges, and to reconnect with friends and co-workers. Deciding When to Return to Work: Discuss with your health care team when would be best for you to return to work. The ideal time is unique to each individual. If your job is physically demanding, stressful or increases your chance for infection - such as nursing or child care - you may need to wait for a longer time before returning. Before Planning a Return to Work: 1. Discuss the physical and mental challenges you may experience with a health care professional and have that professional write a letter for your employer outlining the situation including possible solutions. 2. Discuss your follow-up care with a health care professional including how it may affect your ability to do your job. 3. Discuss flexibility and options with your employer including employee assistance programs, transitional plans and extended medical coverage. You can also ask for help from the human resources department, the return to work coordinator, union representative, and insurance vocational rehabilitation consultant if available. Once at Work: Once you have returned to work, you may face challenges that did not affect you before your diagnosis. Do not ignore these difficulties as your body may need more time to recover. Be sure to: 1. Take small breaks throughout the day and be realistic about your workload. Try not to be overwhelmed with work tasks. 2. Eat a healthy diet. 3. Know what time of day you have the most energy and adjust your routine and meetings to fit. 4. Be sure to book your follow-up medical appointments near the end of the day or the work week so that you have time to recover before returning to work. 5. Discuss any challenges with your employer including potential solutions. 6. Track employment issues. Although employment discrimination rarely happens to cancer survivors, be sure to protect yourself. A helpful resource is the BC Human Rights Coalition, www.bchrcoalition.org I f you would like information, support and counseling related to remaining at, or returning to work call the Provincial BC Cancer Agency Vocational Rehabilitation Counsellor at 1-800- 663-3333 extension 672189. Self-Image and Appearance C olorectal surgery can be a difficult experience for survivors. After undergoing colorectal surgery, many individuals have a hard time coping with their changed body image. Grief, fear, anger, resentment, depression and shock are all emotions that you may go through - and this is normal. These effects may change how you view your body and because they can happen so suddenly, it can be a lot to deal with in addition to the cancer and its treatment. Healthy lifestyle choices can help you to regain a sense of control and are also key to improving body image: 1. Healthy eating can help control your body weight and promote healthy skin, hair and bones. 2. Regular exercise, including aerobic exercise and weight training, can help increase muscle, reduce body fat and build strong bones. Such activity also boosts self- esteem and energy. It is important to discuss exercise with your doctor before starting any program. For more information on self-esteem see Appendix C Family Relationships Y ou may need to work at rebuilding your relationships with those who supported you during your cancer journey particularly if you feel less connected than before diagnosis. In many cases, family members do not talk about the effects of the treatment in effort to protect their loved ones. It is important that you talk openly about your experience. This will help bring back the closeness of your relationships so that you can work towards recovery together. The BC Cancer Agency Patient and Family Counseling are also available by phone at 1-800-663-3333 extension 2194 or in Prince George at 1-250-645-7330 . Spirituality C ancer may leave you with a new outlook on life. You might find yourself searching for meaning and wanting to make the best of the time you have. There are many ways to bring new meaning to your life and to help make sense of what you have gone through. Some people find their religion or faith helpful in this regard while others prefer to volunteer their time for various causes. You may decide to change your own priorities or try new activities like meditation or expressing yourself through art. Recovery includes making our experiences a part of who we are and who we have become. How to move forward every day: B e honest and caring with each other, laugh often Keep a regular time and place or outing when you don't discuss cancer Talk about each other's goals and dreams Find ways to exercise together Relax together and do activities that you both enjoy Try something new Resources: E mpower (2010).

After a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and its treatment, it may take some time for your energy level to improve and for symptoms you may have had to get better. You might find that some symptoms do not fully get better and that you have to use longer-term solutions to manage them. Use these eating tips and tools to help improve your health and help you in your recovery from treatment. These tips may help manage the symptoms from colorectal cancer or cancer treatments as well suggest foods to try if eating is difficult for you. This section also describes an eating pattern that aims to improve your health and manage other health conditions. That is because eating well also is important to keep you healthy and help to prevent or better manage other common diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. A healthy diet can also help you achieve or maintain a healthy weight. In addition, early research shows that lifestyle factors that you can control or modify such as diet, smoking, body weight and exercise can help to reduce your risk of recurrence. There are several websites listed at the end of Part 3 to help you find more help if needed. Managing Common Symptoms You may have had several side effects from your cancer treatment. Most of these symptoms will slowly improve over time after treatment is finished, but it can take weeks or months. Each person is different. Common symptoms that can last for a long time include fatigue, changes to normal bowel habits, and changes in appetite and body weight. In this section, you will find tips to help with some of the most common symptoms you may be faced with after treatment. Changes in appetite Changes to your appetite are common during, and at times after cancer treatment. Some people find that their appetite can vary and doesn't return to normal for quite some time. If your appetite is less than normal or you have dif ficulty maintaining a healthy weight S tay hydrated with high calorie and high protein fluids o Smoothies, milkshakes, and nutritional supplement drinks Choose foods that pack a lot of calories o Avocados, nuts and seeds and nut butters (such as peanut, cashew or almond), Greek yogurts, cottage cheese, and eggs Eat more when your appetite is at its best o If you feel best in the morning, have a bigger meal at that time Take the stress out of making meals by enjoying simple meals, using more ready- to-eat foods or making meals in advance and freezing portions. If you can, have friends and family help with grocery shopping, making meals, or cleaning up. Make mealtimes fun o Eat with others and try new recipes W eight loss Some people also lose weight during cancer treatment due to factors such as changes in appetite or factors that make eating more challenging such as a sense of taste, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. If you lost weight and were not trying to, now is a good time to look at how your diet can help you return to a healthy weight. Physical activity can help to manage stress and build muscle. Excess activity, however, can make it difficult to return to a normal weight. See your doctor if you are not able to maintain your weight. You may need help with symptoms or to be seen regularly by a dietitian. If your appetite is increased or you have food cravi ngs Medications, changes in your daily routine, and stress can cause your appetite to increase. For some people, this can also cause food cravings. Fill up on healthy choices o fruit and yogurt, veggies and dip, or hummus and pita Savor small portions of foods you are craving o Over-restricting can lead to over-eating Be mindful of why you are eating o Listen to your body's hunger cues If your appetite has decreased, or you need to retur n to a healthy weight Eat at regular times during the day o Even if you don't feel hungry or like eating much, try to eat something. It will help create a routine Make every sip count o 100% fruit juice, milk, smoothies and milkshakes give you fluid and calories Choose healthy protein choices o Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, nuts, cheese and yogurt are all good choices Choose healthy fats o Fats that are liquid at room temperature, such as vegetables oils, are better for heart health o Nuts and seeds are good sources of healthy fat Weight gain Y our body weight may have changed since your diagnosis. Unwanted weight gain is common in some cancer survivors and may also result in changes to your body composition such as an increase in fat mass and a loss of muscle mass. The cause of weight gain is unclear but likely results from a number of factors that create a change in eating habits or physical activity levels such as an increase in appetite, fatigue. At times weight gain is associated with the use of some medications or can occur if you have just stopped smoking. Weight gain may result from other factors such as fluid weight gain. Now may be a good time to think about how to make changes in your eating habits to attain a healthy body weight. Achieving a healthy body weight is one of the most important steps to take for people who have had colorectal cancer to improve overall health, manage other health conditions and possibly decrease risk of cancer recurrence. See \"Health Canada's BMI online calculator\" in the Resources at the end of Part 3 to find out if you are at a healthy body weight. Some people lose weight without trying after their cancer diagnosis and may find it difficult to maintain their weight. Others may gain weight or be at a stable but increased body weight. Weight loss is not easy for many people. Even if you cannot get your body weight within a healthy range, any amount of weight loss can still have health benefits for people who are overweight. As well, physical activity can help you meet your weight goals. Being physically active is also one of the best ways to keep unwanted weight off and maintain your goal weight. Strategies C hoose fibre-rich vegetables and fruits often such as peas, leafy greens, raspberries, pears, oranges and dried fruit o Eat them whole instead of as juice o Keep the skin on potatoes, sweet potatoes, and fruits with edible peels Quench your thirst with water Choose whole grain breads and cereals o Look for 100% whole grain as the first ingredient Limit portions of high calorie foods o Have only small portions of regular or high-fat dairy products, fried foods, store bought baking, desserts and convenience foods Keep Track o Keep a record of your food intake to help you stay on track o See \"EATracker\" in the Resources Section below for a free online tool Bowel Changes I t is common to notice changes in your bowel function during and after treatment for colorectal cancer. You may have loose or frequent bowel movements, diarrhea, incontinence, gas, bloating and/or constipation. No two people are the same and it is difficult to make suggestions that will work for everyone. As your bowels recover from your treatment, you may find that you can increase the amount of fibre in your diet. Start adding higher fibre foods to your diet slowly. Keeping a diary of what you eat and bowel function is helpful for many people recovering from colorectal cancer treatment. See the \"Keeping Track\" in the Resources section at the end of part 3. Ostomies Some people with colorectal cancer that have had surgery have an ostomy. This is a surgical opening between the bowels and the abdomen that allows feces (often called output) to leave the body and be collected in a bag or pouch. An ostomy allows the part of the bowel where the cancer was to be bypassed. Some people find that the foods they eat can change their output. Some people have trouble with very high fibre foods such as corn, beans, and cabbage, but everyone is different. By keeping track of what you eat and how you feel, many people with ostomies can learn which foods they tolerate and which ones they need to have smaller portions of or limit. Many people with ostomies can eat their regular diet. If you are losing weight and need help managing your bowels, speak with your doctor or a dietitian. In the weeks after you finish your treatment, you may need to adjust your diet while your bowels heal: Choose lower fibre fruits and vegetables o Fruits: peeled apples and peaches, bananas, melons and grapes o Vegetables: potato (no skin), asparagus, tomato, mushroom and zucchini Choose grain products that are low in fibre o Look for less than 2 grams of fibre per serving on the Nutrition Facts panel. Choose lower fat choices that are bland and not fried Drink 8-10 cups of fluid daily o Limit drinks with caffeine such as colas, coffee, or energy drinks Eat small portions often o Eat five or six smaller meals rather than three larger meals Fatigue F atigue is possibly the most common side effect among people recovering from a diagnosis of cancer or its treatment. It can take months or even years for you to feel like your energy level is closer to what is normal for you. In some cases your level of energy may vary and may improve, but may not completely return to normal for a number of reasons. As well, physical activity can help to manage fatigue. If you have other symptoms that make it difficult to eat enough, or you find it hard to keep your weight stable, talk to your doctor. Here are some tips if your energy level is affecting your eating: Look for easy-to-make choices when food shopping o Deli's often carry cut up fruit or vegetables, salads and to-go foods Soft and easy to chew foods take less energy to eat o Soups, stews, baked vegetable dishes and starches like rice or pasta Ask for help o Those who may have helped you out during your treatment are likely still able to, they just may not know you still need help o Some communities have meals-on-wheels type services that can bring a hot meal to your home for a reasonable price o Some grocery stores may also have a delivery service Eating Guidelines I f you do not have symptoms that make eating difficult and you are able to keep your weight stable, there are eating guidelines that are good for your health and may reduce risk of cancer recurrence. There has been a lot of research on diet and cancer prevention, but not as much on the role of diet in preventing cancer recurrence. Early research suggests that the same dietary patterns that reduce risk of cancer may also help to prevent it from coming back. Supplements (Vitamins, minerals, and herbal pills and powders) Many cancer survivors may want to know more about supplements and the role that these products may have in their health. Research that has looked at whether supplements are helpful for people who have had cancer has shown that supplements do not reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and, in fact, some may be harmful. It is best to get your nutrition through food. Information on supplements is easy to find on the internet, though not all of it is reliable. If you are looking for more information about supplements, please see the \" CAMEO Links\" in the Resources at the end of Part 3. If you have concerns that you are lacking in a nutrient, speak with your doctor or dietitian. Doctors can order tests to check if a nutrient is low in your blood. Dietitians can talk to you about your diet to see if you are getting enough of the nutrients your body needs. These guidelines are for cancer prevention but are a lso appropriate for reducing risk of cancer recurrence and are good for overall health: 1. Be as lean as possible without being underweight 2. Be physically active as part of everyday life 3. Limit energy-dense foods (such as processed or fast foods) and sugary drinks (pop and sweetened juices or drinks) 4. Favor vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans and lentils 5. Limit red meat (includes beef, pork, lamb, and goat) and avoid processed meat (smoked, cured or salted) 6. If consumed, limit alcohol intake to no more than 2 drinks per day for men and 1 drink per day for women 7. Limit salt intake by avoiding salt-preserved or salty foods 8. Aim to meet nutritional needs through diet alone. Dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention. Physical Activity P hysical activity is an important part of healthy living. It can improve how your body works, build your strength and fitness, and add to your quality of life. It can also help you better manage symptoms and reduce anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Further, physical activity can help with stress and weight management and improve your body image. Check with your doctor before increasing your physical activity. If you have anemia (low blood count), a weakened immune system, or problems with nerves that affect your balance, you may need to take special precautions. You should be aware that pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory medications, can mask pain related to physical activity. Injuries should be taken seriously and looked after right away. When beginning any form of physical activity, consider your starting level and set a timeframe with short and long-term goals. Exercise for Health recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity physical activity (e.g., jogging). The total minutes should be spread over at least 3 days per week (e.g., 3 days for 50 minutes or 5 days for 30 minutes of brisk walking). People who have been inactive for some time, however, should start with 10 minutes per day (or less) and increase as their fitness improves. As your fitness improves, you can increase your activity 10 minutes at a time. Measure your level of exertion based on your breathing. In moderate exercise, you should be able to talk in full sentences but not be able to sing. In vigorous exercise, you will only be able to talk in short phrases if at all. If you feel that you are working hard, you probably are. It is important to listen to your body and be aware of your how much it can take. Specific Recommendations Be sure to consult your doctor before participating in physical contact sports and weight training if you have an ostomy, as well as any exercises that might require intra-abdominal pressures (crunches and sit-ups). If you notice any signs of infection or hernia, discontinue your exercise program and be sure to see your doctor. If you exercise using resistance training and have a stoma, start with a low resistance and very gradually increase resistance over time so you do not get a hernia at the stoma. Whether you are starting a physical activity routine or getting active again after treatment, research indicates there may be a link between physical activity and lower chances of recurrence and better survival rates in colorectal cancer. It is important that you wait until full recovery from surgery before starting an exercise program. Heavy lifting for example can cause a hernia. Make sure to avoid bearing down and try to breathe normally and avoid holding your breath during exertion as this can cause added abdominal pressure. Exercise can have a tendency to speed up digestion and may lead to an urgent need to use the bathroom. Carry a back up set of clothes just in case. If you have an ostomy, talk with your Enterostomal Therapy Nurse, you might be able to wear different ostomy equipment suited for sweating, protection and securing of appliances. Always check with your doctor before starting an exercise program. Exercise and Healthy Living Y ou might find yourself anxious to return to good health after treatment. The recommendations for cancer survivors are the same as those for anyone wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. Small changes such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or walking a few blocks instead of driving, are great ways to introduce more activity into your routine. Make sure you get your doctor's okay before starting an exercise program. Research indicates that exercise benefits the heart, lungs and other organ systems and may help to reduce the risk of cancer and possibly its recurrence. Ease into any new routines to allow your body to adjust. This will also ensure that the changes become a part of your life and not just a phase. Strengthening T he length of time after surgery that will be safe for you to begin strengthening will vary based on the type of surgery received. Some people may be ready at 4-6 weeks, some may take up to 8 weeks. Discuss with your doctor when you can begin strengthening. Start with light weights, 1-2 pounds and gradually work your way up to 5-10 pounds. Start with the muscle group you feel most comfortable with doing 8-12 repetitions in one set about two times per week and step by step involve all major muscle groups. Whatever form of strength training you choose, the recommended guidelines are at least 2 days per week. Try to incorporate flexibility and stretching of the major muscle groups and tendons after your strength training as much as possible. Many other strengthening exercises exist and are highlighted in the online resource provided below, the Exercise for Health Guidebook is specific for breast cancer survivors (although the recommendations can be applied to other cancer types), and includes helpful tips, for example, goal-setting. Home and yard duties are also strengthening activities. Heavy weight training is anything more than 10 lbs. You should wear a compression garmet to reduce swelling if you have lympedema. You can buy these at medical equipment stores or pharmacies where trained staff will ensure you are fitted properly. If you experience swelling of the fingers while wearing your sleeve, (if applicable) you may also require a glove or gauntlet which can likely be purchased at the same store where you bought your sleeve.

Skin that has been radiated may remain sensitive to the sun after radiation treatment has ended. Tobacco Use T obacco use (including smoking and chewing tobacco) is the single most preventable cause of death, disease and disability. All tobacco users have a higher risk of numerous chronic diseases and tobacco use is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths. The harmful effects of smoking on health is widely known and there are several programs to help you quit. If you smoke, please ask your doctor for help in quitting. Provincial programs (British Columbia) exist to provide you with different stop smoking products free of charge. Visit www.health.gov.bc.ca/pharmacare/stop-smoking/ N orthern Health Tobacco Reduction Program - visit: www.northernhealth.ca/YourHealth/PublicHealth/School YouthHealth/TobaccoReductionPr ogram.aspx A lcohol A s the amount of alcohol a person drinks increases, the risk of developing cancer increases. Moderate alcohol consumption can even be good for your heart. To determine whether you should avoid alcohol completely, talk with your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks for your individual health needs. To reduce your risk of cancer, limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Women are recommended to limit alcohol to less than one drink per day. Men should have less than two drinks per day. One drink is considered to be: 350mL (12 oz) bottle of beer- at at 12% alcohol Be Sun Smart: U se sunscreen of at least SPF15. Check the expiry date on the bottle as old sunscreen will not protect you from sun damage Re-apply at least every two hours or after swimming or sweating Seek shade especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Cover yourself with clothing and wear a hat If you are outdoors on a sunny day in the winter, you still need sunscreen Healthy Living After Cancer Lifestyle change suggestions (ie. quit smoking, weight management) Suggested Programs 1. 2. 3. 1. 2. 3.

WAYS TO DEAL WITH STRESS C. SELF ESTEEM D. LISTING OF RESOURCES OTHER SURVIVORS HAVE FOUND BENEFICIAL E. RECOMMENDED READING LIST F. BC CANCER AGENCY, BC CANCER FOUNDATION, AND CANADIAN CANCER SOCIETY Appendix A . Tips on Memory & Concentration B oth daily mental and physical activity will increase memory and other mental functions. Training your brain by reading, doing puzzles, learning new skills and hobbies all help to strengthen your brain (think of it as mental housekeeping - unused brain power will collect 'dust'). Physical activity is also important as it increases your blood flow and triggers muscle groups and their various control centers in the brain. You can cope better with symptoms of memory and concentration by making sure you are well rested, paying attention, organized and writing reminder notes. Support groups can also help by learning of others' experiences by sharing your own. B. Ways to Deal with Stress S tart the day by putting yourself on your To-Do list. Make you a priority! Spend time doing the activities you love or try volunteering for a cause you believe in. Deep breathing and a ctive relaxation are healthy and helpful techniques for dealing with stress. Deep Breathing Use deep breathing for a calming effect before an event that makes you anxious. Deep breathing is a simple and effective way to relieve tension and increase comfort. It can make you more comfortable if you are experiencing episodes of pain, fatigue or nausea. This method can be used before you go to bed to help ease you into a restful sleep. You can practice deep breathing anywhere. Deep breathing technique: 1 . Place yourself in a comfortable position with legs and arms uncrossed 2. Take the palm of one hand on your chest; place the other on your abdomen 3. Breathe normally. Notice how your hands rise and fall with your breathing 4. Picture your stomach as a balloon as you do this 5. Concentrate on breathing from your stomach silently keeping count 6. Say to yourself 'relax' each time you exhale Try to practice this method for 5 minutes every day Muscle Relaxation By learning how to relax your muscles, you can activ ely lower your blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate. Progressive muscle relaxation is the tensing and then relaxing of each muscle group of the body, one group at a time. In a comfortable position, breathe slowly taking deep breaths. The idea is to tense one muscle group at a time and hold for 5- 10 seconds (if a part of the body is painful or tender, do not tense in that area). Release the tension and stay relaxed for 10-20 seconds. You can tense the areas of the body in any order and as much as you like. There are also tapes available that can guide you through this process. Examples of this method: clench hands into fists, flex biceps, tense abdomen, eyes (close tight, hold, and release), and arch your back to name a few. C. Self Esteem Lo w self-esteem can have a negative effect on all aspects of your quality of life. People who think poorly of themselves for long periods of time can still make simple changes to improve their self esteem. Here are four steps to start recovering your positive sense of self. Step 1: Identify the main sources Wh at lowers your self-esteem? A troubling environment at work or home? Problems in certain relationships? Once you identify the root of the problem you can start targeting your action plan for success. Step 2: Awareness of your inner voice P ay attention to your inner voice as you come across situations which make you say negative things about yourself. You will need to decide if you are being reasonable or if you are thinking about it in an unrealistic way. Were you thinking about any positive points or was your inner conversation mostly negativ e? Step 3: Challenge negative or unrealistic thoughts T he first thought that comes to your mind in these situations needs to be checked as to whether it makes sense. Your though process may be so fixed that it will be difficult at first. You need to question whether your view of situations that leave you with thoughts that lower your self-esteem are based on facts or just your own opinion. Step 4: Changing the way you evaluate yourself N ow that you have identified the root of your self-esteem issues, your increased awareness of your inner voice and negative thought processes, it is time to start taking a positive outlook. Thought processes that are counterproductive: A ll-or-nothing thinking . Pass or fail style of thinking. : \"If I can't do t his, I am a complete failure\". Mental Filtering perceiving only the bad side of every situation: \"I made a mistake and now everyone will think I'm incompetent\". Converting positives into negatives. You are unable to accept compliments or a chievements: \"I only succeeded because the task wasn't hard to do\". Jumping to negative conclusions. In the absence of any evidence, you still reach a n egative conclusion: \"My friend didn't return my call so they must be mad at me for something I did\". Mistaking feelings for facts Confusing your own opinion with facts: \"I feel usel ess therefore I am useless\". Self put-downs. Combination of overreacting to a situation and unde rvaluing yourself: \"I am not worthy of succeeding\". Thought processes that are realistic and constructive: Hopeful statements. Treat yourself how you would treat others. If you f eel confident you are capable of the task at hand, you are more likely to succeed: \"This isn't easy, but I can do it\". Forgive yourself. Nobody is perfect and mistakes happen, but he or sh e shouldn't change your opinion of yourself: \"I didn't do it right the first time, but that doesn't mean I am incapable of getting it right the second time\". Avoid unrealistic goals. If you are constantly placing demands on yourself a nd others that are not possible, you are only setting yourself up to fail. Focus on the positive. If you doubt your abilities and self-worth, remind yourself of your accomplishments and other aspects of your life of which you are appreciative. Re-label upsetting thoughts. If your inner voice is saying you can't do somethin g, think of a way to change the situation to make it more manageable: \"How can I make this less stressful?\" Encourage yourself. You need to compliment yourself. If you feel that s omething went well, take a moment to acknowledge yourself and use it to inspire your next task. D on't feel discouraged if you need to return to step one. Do this as often as you need to. Habits can be hard to break, but if you work at it, you will notice your self-esteem begin to improve and benefit from increased confidence in all aspects of your life. If you are unable to resolve self-esteem issues on your own, or if your self-esteem interferes with your daily functioning, seek professional help. D.
