While much has changed in terms of technology and sophisticated diagnosis and treatment options, our mission to provide patient-focused care has remained steadfast. Our multidisciplinary teams of physicians, nurses and other specially trained clinicians come together with a shared goal of providing the best possible personalized care to each individual and improving outcomes for cancer patients. We continue to push the limits of innovation with the latest treatments in immunotherapy and targeted therapy based on tumor genomics, building on the strengths of our nationally recognized molecular pathology and diagnostics laboratory. NorthShore's Kellogg Cancer Genomics Initiative is growing, as is our team of physician experts providing advanced surgical and clinical care. As we expand our successful model of care serving a growing numbers of patients, we remain dedicated to offering the most progressive and compassionate care. We are excited about expanding our multidisciplinary services to Swedish Hospital and look forward to developing our clinical and community partnerships with Northwest Community Hospital. Our academic affiliation with the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine not only helps train the next generation of physician leaders, but also allows our patients to continue to benefit from our shared clinical and research initiatives and collective expertise. NorthShore is certified by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) as a premier medical provider for practicing the highest standards of quality cancer care. We are beyond grateful to the many patients and families who support our efforts with charitable donations. These contributions are crucial, particularly in funding research initiatives and many patient support activities. We offer our sincere thanks to our donors, whose gifts make a real difference in patient outcomes and quality of life. This report offers a look at some of the highlights of the past year. We thank you for your interest in our shared mission to set new standards of care for cancer patients.Dr. Bruce BrocksteinOur 2021 Annual Report showcases highlights of our clinical and research initiatives.

By harnessing the body's own immune system to identify and eradicate cancer cells, immunotherapy is showing benefits for a growing majority of cancers while tumor genomic testing expands that reach beyond a cancer's site of origin. New advancements and better immuno therapy medications are in development giving hope to more and more patients. Nearly a third of Kellogg Cancer Center patients are treated with immunotherapy medications. Major institutional investments in p ersonalized medicine have enhanced our immunotherapy ca- pabilities: capital purchases and expansion in the NorthShore labora tory, launching the Kellogg Cancer Genomics Initiative (KCGI), and support of bioinformatics, to name a few. While the COVID-19 pandemic slowed progress on hiring a new immunotherapy program director, Kellogg Cancer Center Medi cal Director Bruce Brockstein, MD, and Head of Lung Cancer and Director of Quality Tom Hensing, MD, MS, continue to lead this effort with r enewed momentum. The Kellogg Cancer Genomics Initiative (KCGI) uses next-generation tumor sequencing to characterize the tumor muta tions for an initial group of 500 Kellogg Cancer Center patients with ad vanced or metastatic cancers where tumor genetics may help determine the best course of therapy. Testing identifies DNA alterations as well as genetic translocations and includes pharmacogenomics studies (genetic testing to determine an individual's ability to metabolize medication and therefore susceptibilities to side effects and effective-ness of medications). The genomic data is used to both refine diag-noses and identify precise molecular targets for specific treatment. While the study was initially delayed during the pandemic, patients are now being enrolled and the feedback has been tremendous. \"Our patients are very engaged and wanting to participate, and it's been gratifying and humbling to see how passionate they a re about want- ing to help people in the future,\" said Advanced Practice Nurse in NorthShore's Center for Personalized Medicine Annette Sereika. A unique program, the KCGI features a broad, multidisciplinary team and leverages NorthShore's outstanding bioinformatics and lab capabilities running cutting-edge testing in house.Immunotherapy Total Number of Patients and Doses KCGI: Cutting Edge Analysis of Tumor Tissue Advanced Practice Nurse Annette Sereika is a key member of the NorthShore Center for Personalized Medicine team and plays a major role in the Kellogg Cancer Genomics Initiative.Immunotherapy Total Number of Patients and Doses Number of Patients Number of Doses0100200300400500 2012 2013 2014 2015 4,000 Studying COVID-19 Antibody Response in Cancer Patients Knowledge about COVID-19 and va ccine response in cancer patients is scant, and a team of NorthShore physician-scientists led by Janardan D.

Prem Seth, PhD, who served as the Director of the Gene Therapy Pr ogram befor e his untimely death in August 2021, initiated the study and was critical in se - curing the prestigious Research Project Grant (RO1). The study aims to assess the effect of specific \"viral onco - lytics\" on augmenting immune checkpoint inhibitors to generate an impr oved immune r esponse to tumors that do not traditionally send signals to the immune system that something is wrong. These \"cold\" tumors have not been as responsive to immunotherapy as \"hot\" tumors in other parts of the body, including the lungs. Lung cancer has been one of the most responsive to immunotherapy, while breast cancer has been slow to respond. The development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of metastatic breast and other cancers is a ma-jor unmet need this research aims to address. Dr. Seth's longtime colleague Weidong Xu, PhD, will now lead this promising research at NorthShore.Todd Neihoff was just 37 years old when he was first diagnosed with Stage III colon cancer in 2017. Disappointed with the care he was receiving near his home in the Peoria area, Neihoff's wife Shawna made it her mission to find better options. \"They were basically telling us there was noth-ing else they could do, and I wasn't willing to give up,\" said Shawna Neihoff, whose online research led her to NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center and a team of physicians who have provided advanced treatment and a new lease on life for the Neihoffs. Dr. Ariel Polish (left) and Dr. Lauren Wiebe have given cancer patient Todd Neihoff a new lease on life.Immunotherapy, Compassionate Care Provides Healing and Hope The aggressive cancer spread to Todd Neihoff's pancreas, necessitating surgery with Melissa Hogg, MD, an expert in complex oncologic surgery. Neihoff also saw oncolo- gist Janardan D. Khandekar, MBBS, MD, as part of NorthShore's Center for Personalized Medicine, where they learned he carried a genetic mutation that was particularly responsive to immunotherapy. Groundbreaking immunotherapy treat-ments under the direction of oncologist Ariel Polish, MD, have now helped control Todd Neihoff's can cer while significantly improving his quality of life. \"The genomic analysis with Dr. Khandekar and the Personalized Medicine team really trans - formed his trajectory,\" said Dr. Polish. The Neihoffs drive three hours each way to reach NorthShore Evanston Hospital every three weeks for his treatment, but they are beyond grateful to have found treatment without the debilitating side effects of che - motherapy and a team of clinicians focused on his care. \"I used to have a backpack that I carried around with all his test results\u2014but when we came to Kellogg for care, it was like a breath of fresh air and I could breathe again,\" said Shawna Neihoff. \"I don't have to carry that backpack around, I know I can check all his test results on NorthShoreConnect, and I know that Dr. Polish and the whole team actually care about him.\" Todd Neihoff was amazed by how quickly he started feeling better with immunotherapy and had the energy to live life again. \"Within the first couple treatments, it just took off. I feel good now. I can get up every day and hang out with my grandkids and do the things I want to do,\" he said. Palliative care specialist Lauren Wiebe, MD, has also been a key player on Neihoff's clini - cal team helping control his pain. \"Dr. Wiebe is amazing. He is as close to 100% pain-free as he could be,\" said Shawna Neihoff. \"We are so thankful for everyone at the Kellogg Cancer Center. I know I wouldn't have my husband today if it wasn't for them.\" In Memoriam Dr. Prem Seth A pioneer and a role model, Dr. Prem Seth served as the Gene Therapy Program Director at NorthShore and held important leadership posi-tions at Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. Dr. Seth led a dedicated team of scientists working to develop breakthrough treatments for cancer. His work was supported by the NIH and the Amer - ican Cancer Society. He was a well-recognized international authority on gene therapy for cancer . In addition to many other roles, Dr. Seth served on the editorial board of several prestigious academic journals, including Cancer Gene Therapy and Human Gene Therapy. Dr. Seth pioneered the use of adenovirus-mediated gene targeting in developing new cancer therapy. In recent years, he developed novel oncolytic viruses that can selectively kill breast cancer cells and be used in conjunction with im-munotherapies. \"Prem's contributions to NorthShore and the larger medical community will make a difference for countless cancer patients,\" said Bruce Brockstein, MD, Kellogg Cancer Center Medical Director. \"We will miss his compassion, curiosity and genuine desire to improve the lives of others.\"NIH Funds Support Pioneering Research For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 Page 3 Katharine Yao, MD, Vice Chair for Research and Development, Department of Surgery, is leading several innovative research studies aimed at active ly preventing breast cancer and improving outcomes and quality of life for patients. Novel Mindfulness Study Anxiety and fear often follow a breast cancer diagnosis and can overwhelm some women to the point where it makes it difficult to understand their treatment plan. Dr. Yao's mi ndfulness study will evaluate how to help patients best move forward and tackle their new journey. Short, educational mindfulness video modules tailored to the newly diag - nosed breast cancer patient will address overcoming and coping with cancer and will be accessible online. Dr. Yao and her team will study the impact of the mindfulness videos on overall stress and anxiety, and will collect blood samples to examine stress biomarkers. David Victorson, PhD, Associate Professor of Medical Social Sciences at Northwestern University, is a key partner in this study. This study is supported i n part by a grant from the John Wayne Cancer Foundation. Improving Risk Assessment Developing a proven, data-backed ris k assessment score to help women deter - mine their individual breast cancer risk is an important strategy to help prevent breast cancer. The lack of a consistent way for primary care physicians and patients to evaluate risk has led Dr . Y ao to develop a new initiative to improve risk assessments\u2014\"Personalized Risk Assessment at NorthShore\" (the PRANS Study). Currently, most women are screened the same way for breast cancer, but we know that some women need different screening modalities than other women. In an effort to move toward personalized breast Knowledge about COVID-19 and vaccine response in cancer patients is scant, and a team of NorthShore physician-scientists led by Janardan D. Khandekar, MBBS, MD, is leading a study to learn more. \"Sequential Measurement of Immunologic Memory of Cancer Patients Following mRNA-Based Vaccine Administration\" has enrolled more than 100 patients with breast, gastrointestinal, lung and gynecologic malignancies. Participants are divided into two groups\u2014the first of which are receiving chemotherapy and screening, Dr. Yao and others are developing a comprehensive risk assessment mechanism specifically integrated in the NorthShore's electronic health record (EHR) system. This risk assessment mechanism will generate a risk score for every woman coming in for a screening mammogram and will help identify those at higher risk who may need more than just a mammogram for screening. NorthShore has one of the largest screening mammogra-phy programs in the region, conducting more than 80,000 mammograms annually . W e also have a robust EHR system, Epic, that is used by a majority of other academic health systems across the country. These enhance-ments make the breast centers at NorthShore an ideal environment to create best practice for personalized breast cancer screening. A Phase I pilot study of this project will use NorthShore screening sites to collect risk fac - tors and validate the risk model in Epic. As the study pr ogr esses, Dr. Yao's team will also measure how the risk score impacts anxiety, attitudes toward screening, risk perception and decisional satisfaction.Studying Universal Genetic Testing for Breast Cancer Patients While it is standard of care to offer genetic testing to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who meet set criteria, new evi-dence is emerging that these guidelines may miss a gene mutation in a significant number of women. The American Society of Breast Surgeons issued new guidelines stating all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients should undergo genetic testing re-gardless of family history. However, many breast surgeons are not comfortable with ordering genetic testing, and it is not clear whether all patients will have access to uni-versal genetic testing. Dr. Yao is working closely with Catherine Pesce, MD, to collect physician opinions on universal genetic testing for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. This study is supported by a NorthShore Breast and Ovarian Cancer Research Pilot Award. Dr. Pesce and Dr. Yao will use these findings to inform national guidelines and to develop educational ma-terials to help surgeons learn how to order genetic testing. Research to Transform Breast Cancer Care Studying COVID-19 Antibody Response in Cancer Patients the second who may be treated with hormonal therapy or observa-tion only. Data collected will help provide information related to cancer patients' response to treatment and susceptibility to COVID-19 and to gain insight into the potential benefit of adjunctive treatments such as monoclonal antibodies or antiviral medications. Oncologists Bruce Brockstein, MD, Teresa Law, MD, Thomas Hensing, MD, MS, and Robert Marsh, MD, are co-investigators. Patient response and participation have been enthusiastic. Dr. Katharine Yao leads innovative research aimed at advancing breast cancer prevention and treatment.Page 4 For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112A family history of heart disease led George Vollkommer to carefully monitor his health, including undergoing cardiac scans to check the condition of his heart. While Vollkommer's heart was in fact in good condition, the scan showed a small nodule on his lung. As lung nodules are fairly common, his physician suggested he do another scan in a few months just to be safe. The nodule grew quickly and Vollkommer was referred to thoracic surgeon Seth Krantz, MD. Following a more detailed PET scan, Dr. Krantz suggested surgery to remove the suspicious growth, which turned out to be very early stage lung cancer. A 67-year-old never smoker, Vollkommer considered himself very lucky to have his cancer detected so early and removed with virtually no chance of recurrence. \"It was small, but aggressive. I trusted Dr. Krantz. Early Detection Key to Treating Lung Cancer I've been going to NorthShore forever and I felt better after talking with him,\" he said. \"They took it out, no chemo\u2014boom, I was done.\" Dr. Krantz performed a small surgical biopsy of the lung, and on-site pathology confirmed in real time that it was cancer, prompting him to do a lobectomy, removing a small section of the right lung. The minimally invasive surgery is performed robotically with 3D cameras, and all lymph nodes in the area are also checked to assess whether patients are essentially cancer-free. \"The surgery went well, and the nurses and everyone at Evanston Hospital were great,\" said Vollkommer, who recovered quickly and returned to a regular exercise program. \"I'm all for preventive medicine. I want to make sure I'm around for my wife and family.\" Wanting to do everything possible to ensure that his cancer would not return, Vollkommer had his home tested for radon, which is a leading cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers, and found that it was five times above acceptable levels. He has since had his home reme - diated and continues to monitor the radon levels on a daily basis. \"I wish we could find more early lung cancer through screenings,\" said Dr. Krantz, who is hopeful this will be the case as NorthShore's lung cancer screening program continues to grow. A Kellogg Cancer Center nurse navigator currently works with primary care physicians to help refer appropriate patients for screenings. She then works with those patients who are diagnosed with lung cancer. Two large, randomized, controlled trials have shown that low-dose CT screening for those at risk of lung cancer is very successful at diagnosing early-stage cancer when it is most treatable, and NorthShore has been an early adopter encouraging those who are eligible to get screened. Eligibility requirements for lung cancer screening include: 50-80 years old; a \"20 pack-year\" history of smoking history, meaning one pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 years; and a current smoker or has quit within the last 15 years. Patients are advised to check with their insurance plan to ensure screening coverage. Research has shown that a combination of medication and behavioral therapy can be the best way to help a smoker successfully kick the habit. And often the timing for successful quitting is linked to an acute incident, like a cancer diagnosis. The Kellogg Cancer Center team is working to help more smokers quit, offering all new cancer patients a referral to an appointment with one of our five specially trained, certified tobacco treatment specialists. The smoking cessation program at Kellogg Cancer Center began about 10 years ago with one certified specialist. It has continued to grow exponentially with a larger team seeing more and more patients each year , in both new and follow-up sessions. There is compelling evidence that continued tobacco use after a cancer diagnosis de - creases survival, reduces treatment efficacy, increases/pr olongs treatment toxicity and increases the risk of recurrence.

For patients, there are obviously big ben efits in terms of convenience and flexibility. But there are challenges for the clinical team that no longer has eyes on patients during treatment. Side effect management can also be an issue as patients may not be spending regular time at the Kellogg Cancer Center where there is ample opportunity to talk with nurses, pharmacists, physicians etc. \"If they don't call us, we don't know what kind of side effects they may be having,\" said oncology pharmacist Shannon Hartman, PharmD. \"It puts a lot of responsibility on the patient.\" Kellogg Cancer Center's specially trained oncology pharmacists started a pilot program in 2014 for patients on a commonly prescribed breast cancer drug that often resulted in side effects, calling patients on a regular schedule to check in, monitor their experience, answer questions and offer support. Thanks to philanthropic support, there is now a half-time oncology pharmacist dedicated to the oral program. Oncology pharmacist Diane Chon, PharmD, has expanded the pro gram to now cover patients on approximately 20 different chemotherapy medications. The monitoring has been built into the Epic electronic health record (EHR) system so all healthcare providers can access the information. As soon as one of the prescriptions is sent, an oncology pharmacist reviews the order to ensure there is no potential drug interactions with any of the patient's other medications. A pharmacist also reaches out to the patient for an initial phone consult to answer questions and explain the critical importance of adher - ing to the medication schedule. The patient is called on a monthly basis\u2014or more often if needed to assess for side Oral Chemotherapy Monitoring Improves Patient Experience effects\u2014to see if there is a need for a dose adjustment or a visit with the Kellogg Cancer Center clinical team. Oral chemotherapy patients also are given a direct line to call with questions. The oral chemotherapy program is a multidisciplinary effort. The oncology collaborative nurses complete a pre-assessment of patients prior to starting any oral chemotherapy. They also do one-to-one patient teaching to ensure patients are aware of side effects and resources that are available. The nurses also help monitor patients' adherence with their treatment plan, which is all recorded in their EHR. \"We're very excited to have this in place and are continuing to increase the number of medications added to the monitoring program,\" said Hartman. \"We believe that adherence has signifi-cantly improved since we started the monitoring program.\" Data around patient satisfaction and interventions is collected and will contin-ue to be tracked as the program grows.

Kellogg Cancer Center Oncology Nurse Prac - titioners Maggie Keller and Sara Reynolds are among the talented gr oup of scholars in the current course who are working jointly through Honoring a Visionary A true pioneer, Janardan D. Khandekar, MBBS, MD, has helped establish North Shore as a recognized leader in the field of personalized medicine. His compassion and expertise have brought innumerable benefits to cancer patients for more than four decades. Dr. Khandekar was the founding Head of the Division of Medical Oncology and drove early innovation and expansion of the Kellogg Cancer Center. As Director of Innovation and Education at the Mark R. Neaman Center for Personalized Medicine, he continues to be a driving force for education and research that will set new standards and improve outcomes in cancer care today and for future generations. He is a mentor to countless physicians through the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has authored or co-authored 116 peer-reviewed papers and more than 60 other publications. The exploration of new and novel ideas has been a hallmark of Dr. Khandekar's career, and the Neaman Center for Personalized Medicine expands his legacy of innovation. Using patients' unique DNA to tailor clinical care, identifying new molecular markers on tumors as targets for treatments, and using pharmacogenomics to select the best drug therapy based on a patient's genes are among the advances benefiting NorthShore patients. The Janardan D. Khandekar, MD, Personalized Medicine Innovation Fund will provide crucial support to spark further innovation in patient care, research and education, expanding the boundaries of knowledge at NorthShore and beyond.

What at first looked like lymphoma was ultimately diagnosed as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or HLH, an exceptionally rare and aggressive inflammatory condition that can occur in people with serious infections. Louis credits her diagnosis, and ultimately her survival, to NorthShore oncologist Alla Gimelfarb, MD. Louis had significant blood count abnormalities, tumors across her abdomen, liver failure and a host of other complications as her sys - tem was ravaged by HLH. She underwent four different biopsies, each one coming back negative despite scans that all looked like cancer, explained Dr. Gimelfarb. The condition is so rare that most physicians will see at most one or two cases in their career. NorthShore hematologists are highly attuned to the unique diagnostic criteria for this condition and were able to make the diagnosis here in a timely fashion. \"It is a very complicated diagnosis as it can look like a million other things that all need to be ruled out,\" said Dr. Gimelfarb. Treatment for HLH is chemotherapy and high-dose steroids, which fortunately put Louis on the path to full recovery despite some pretty rough side effects. The tumors shrank and the chemotherapy also decreased the cata - strophic inflammatory response, explained Dr. Gimelfarb.\"It was scary. We knew I was very sick. There were times I couldn't walk or eat anything,\" recalled the mother of four. \"But I knew Dr. Gimelfarb did absolutely everything she could for me. I never felt lost or like I was just a number to her. She explained everything to me and never left me in the dark.\" Dr. Gimelfarb's expertise, coupled with a very collaborative and multi-disciplinary team at Kellogg Cancer Center literally saved Louis' life. \"She started responding immediately to the treatment, Lifesaving Care and we knew we were on the right track,\" said Dr. Gimelfarb. \"It was a slow recovery. She was very, very sick, but she was a trooper and she powered through it.\" \"Just like all our cancer patients, she got incredible care at Kellogg,\" said Dr. Gimelfarb. \"Our nurses are incredible, and the whole team came together for her.\" \"I feel like I would have died if I had been somewhere else, and I do think Dr. Gimelfarb is a rock star,\" said Louis. \"I'm very thankful.\" Dr. Winchester Honored by American College of Surgeons Longtime Kellogg Cancer Center surgeon David P . Winchester, MD, FACS, FACR, Emeritus, received the Distinguished Service Award from the American College of Surgeons (ACS)\u2014its highest honor. Dr. Winchester retired after a lengthy career that included leadership roles at NorthShore and academic leadership positions at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The award recognizes Dr. Winchester's vi- sion and dedication in developing a national accreditation program related to the align-ment of the highest standards and quality of care in the treatment of breast cancer and rectal cancer. In July 2009, NorthShore's Breast Health Program was the first in the Chicagoland area to be granted accredita-tion from the National Accreditation Pro-gram for Breast Centers.The ACS Board of Regents Honors Com-mittee selected Dr. Winchester for this dis-tinction \"in appreciation for his exceptional and continuous service as a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and his role as Medical Director for the College's Com-mission on Cancer (CoC), the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the National Cancer Database (NCDB), and the ACS Cancer Research Program (CRP),\" according to the award citation. Dr. Winchester is considered a natural leader who possesses integrity, vision, and a stead-fast commitment to the College's initiatives and principles. He serves as a role model to surgeons everywhere \"to always do the right thing for patients,\" the citation notes. Dr. Alla Gimelfarb's excellent diagnostic skills helped save patient Deshanna Louis from a rare and life-threatening condition. Dr. David P. Winchester was honored for his vision and dedication to the highest standard of care for breast cancer patients.Page 8 For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112Swedish Hospital's Integrated Cancer Care program helps patients overcome the physical and emotional challenges associated with a cancer diagnosis with specific fundamental fitness and other complementary treatments offered through the Galter LifeCenter. The medical fundamental fitness program offers patients a way to learn about lifestyle changes in an interactive, supportive environment focused on cardiovascular exercise, strength training, nutrition and more. In addition to weekly sessions, patients are offered a two-month membership to the Galter LifeCenter. \"We get such positive feedback on the program,\" said oncologist Jeffrey Cilley, MD. \"Everyone who does it loves it and wishes they could do more.\" Patients are taught how to create their own workouts and how to set small goals that can make a big difference. They have access to a variety of medical and fitness experts, including personal trainers with specialized oncology experience and training. Personal trainers help develop individual customized exercise and wellness programs to help fight depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain and injury and promote overall wellness. \"We know that when you exercise, there's generally less of a sense of fatigue,\" said Dr. Cilley. \"The program also helps patients feel like they have more of a sense of control as they cope with cancer treatments.\" Integrative therapy including acupuncture and massage, is also offered at the Galter LifeCenter, which is conveniently located close to the cancer center at Swedish Hospital.Nurse navigators play a critical role for newly diagnosed cancer patients, helping them navigate their new realm and serving as an important source of support and informa-tion throughout their journey. As NorthShore begins to integrate oncology services with its newest partners, collaboration between nurse navigators at Kellogg Cancer Center, Northwest Community Hospital and Swedish Hospital has helped streamline processes and identify ways to improve patient experiences. \"Our goal is to achieve standard and effi-cient transitions throughout NorthShore on-cology sites, which will ensure an excellent p atient experience,\" said Kellogg Cancer Center Director Linda Green. \"At our global navigator meetings, everyone is happy to share expertise, resources and problem-solving with their colleagues to ensure seamless connections.\" For lower-volume clinical programs, it's an easier referral now from one site to another for medical oncologists, radiation oncolo-gists or surgeons, and the collaboration is also beneficial in helping patients looking for second opinions. As navigators are now connected, it eases handoffs when patients transfer from one NorthShore hospital to another for oncology care. Nurse Navigators Collaborate for Optimal Patient Experience \"We're all le arning from each other and try ing to implement best practices together,\" said Rhea Trbojevic Executive Director of Cancer Services at Northwest Community Hospital.Educational resources and support groups are also shared across the system, offering patients a broader range of vital support services.

Psychosocial support for patients and their families is focused on navigating complex emotional challenges that arise from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. Psychosocial support is provided by a dedicated and com - passionate team of oncology social workers with decades of experience in the field. Thanks to generous funding from Carole Levy, Kellogg Cancer Center welcomed a new psychologist to the team in 2021. Elizabeth Ka cel, PhD, is a clinical health psychologist who brings years of specialized training in patient care, education and research to the Kellogg Cancer Center community. Her family's experience with the compassionate care provided at the Kellogg Cancer Center 15 years ago inspired her to become a psy - chologist who could give back to the cancer community. As part of the psychosocial support team, Dr. Kacel is helping expand services available to patients. Dr. Kacel provides comprehensive psycho- logical services for patients and families with cancer at any point along the care continu-um from diagnosis through end of life. Initial psychological evaluations are used to develop personalized treatment plans for stress management and coping during the natural ups and downs of the cancer experi-ence. Dr. Kacel works closely with patients, families, social workers and healthcare providers using scientifically supported approaches to optimize wellbeing and cancer survivorship.Psychosocial Services Support the Cancer Journey \"It is truly an honor to come full circle, returning to the community where it all began, to become a part of the outstanding psychosocial team and to work along-side the dedicated healthcare providers at Kellogg Cancer Center,\" said Dr. Kacel.\" Dr. Elizabeth Kacel brings additional expertise to the Kellogg Cancer Center psychosocial team. Carol Rosenberg, MD, the founder and director of NorthShore's Myra Rubenstein Weis (MRW) Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program, pre-sented at the American College of Surgeons Quality and Safety Confer ence. The pr esentation, Building an Ecosystem of Post- Treatment Care, highlighted NorthShore's model of cancer survivorship care delivery, which combines survivorship care planning and support of survivors with both individualized and group interventions. The national conference showcases methodologies and programs that serve as examples for meeting Commission on Cancer (CoC) standards. Dr. Rosenberg initiated the MRW LIFE Program\u2014 the first of its kind in the Chicago region\u2014in 2006 and has directed its growth and evolution support - ing cancer survivors. In the study, mor e than 1,000 Highlighting Quality and Safety Survivorship ProgramsDr. Kacel is a graduate of Northwestern University. She completed her doctoral de-gree at the University of Florida and her post-doctoral fellowship at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. survivors who participated in the LIFE Program's exemplary individualized survivorship care planning visit were surveyed about post-treatment concerns and a model aimed at targeted and enhanced survi - vorship services was developed. Targeted interventions including enhancements to the cornerstone individualized survivorship visit; consultative services including specialty survivorship c are services in rehabilitation, nutrition, cardio- oncology, gyne cologic/women's sexual health and smoking cessation; and group education aimed at promoting self-management are among LIFE's holistic approaches to survivorship care. \"It was an honor to have NorthShore's program representing quality and safety standards on a national stage,\" said Dr. Rosenberg.Page 10 For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847)
