Use our detailed product descriptions as a guide to figure out which herbs, plants, and flowers are appropriate for your magical intentions. Herbal magic is a natural approach to perform witchcraft, from making potions to employing dried herbs in rituals. Herbs can be utilized in a variety of ways to help a witch set the purpose throughout the entire process of casting a spell or preparing a ritual. Magical herbs, roots flowers, minerals, and zoological items for use in that have historically been used for prayer or spellwork. Whether it be a love spell, a protection spell, or an herbal talisman, spellwork requires the uses of specific herbs and plants. Many are also used in the creation of anointing oils in the Christian tradition. Each herb or plant usually has a medicinal use and a magical use, although some are not used for consumption at all (be sure to check for warnings.) That being said, the herbs used in witchcraft and in hoodoo sometimes have completely different uses. So, be sure to check the magical properties of the herb you are interested in, depending upon how you intend to use it. Roots, hence the name 'rootworker' are an important staple in Hoodoo. Zoological items, such as Coon bones or alligator feet, are usually found in Hoodoo but not in witchcraft.
