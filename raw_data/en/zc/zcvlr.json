Background[ ] Vance and his wife Vikki were \"master criminals\" before the [Great War](/wiki/Great_War). The player character can hear the story of Vikki and Vance by consulting [Primm Slim](/wiki/Primm_Slim) in the [Vikki and Vance Casino](/wiki/Vikki_and_Vance_Casino). Slim's account implies that Vikki and Vance were in fact small-time white-collar criminals. According to Slim, Vance had acquired this high-quality, mint-condition 9mm machinegun at some point, but never fired it. The weapon is missing from its display case in the [Vikki and Vance Casino](/wiki/Vikki_and_Vance_Casino), having been stolen by [Sammy](/wiki/Sammy_Wins) and [Pauline Wins](/wiki/Pauline_Wins).

First and foremost, it does more damage, the damage-per-second is higher, and it has a drum magazine with a greater capacity. Aesthetically, it is in pristine condition with wood or Bakelite grip panels, lacks a stock, and has a different Express-type iron sight. Its high rate of fire, common ammunition, and high DPS makes it a valuable weapon to one skilled in Guns. Durability[ ] Vance's 9mm submachine gun can fire a total of about 3745 standard rounds, the equivalent of 63 reloads, from full [condition](/wiki/Equipment_condition#Fallout:_New_Vegas) before in V.A.T.S.| |- Weapon name (gun, energy or explosive)||- Action point cost| |- Damage per attack (damage per projectile)||- Damage per action point| |- Damage per second||- Weapon spread| |- Area of effect damage||- Magazine capacity (shots per reload)| |- Effect damage & duration||- Durability |- % multiplier||- weight ratio| |- Critical damage||- Skill Critical effect mods attached| [9mm submachine gun](/wiki/9mm_submachine_gun_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)) Location[ ] Despite the weapon being missing from its display case, [Primm Slim](/wiki/Primm_Slim) does not notice. With a high enough Science skill (50), however, one will gain a dialogue option to reveal that the weapon was taken to [Wins hideout](/wiki/Wins_hideout), where it can be found inside the safe with a Very Hard lock. The lock can be picked or with a high enough Speech skill (55), one can convince the Wins to provide the combination. Related quests[ ] Behind the scenes[ ] Vikki and Vance are a reference to the real world [Bonnie and Clyde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde). The combination of the safe is 05-23-34, the date the crime duo was killed in real life. Bugs[ ] Sometimes the magazine may not be where it should; it will hover near the end of the gun. [verified] - Reloading the gun will fix this, as will drawing the gun out and then re-holstering. Switching weapons may also fix this bug with this weapon and others. Sounds[ ] | | "}
