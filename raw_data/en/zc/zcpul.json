These programs include the John R. Evans Leaders' Fund (JELF), the SSHRC-administered Canada Research Chair (CRC) Program, the Partnership Development and Partnership Engage Grants & Insight Grants competitions, and NSERC's Discovery Research Programs. Fifty new and renewed Canada Research Chairs were awarded at 45 Canadian research institutions, ten at McGill. Of these ten, four New and six Renewed CRCs were awarded. With the addition of this newest cohort, McGill currently has 179 active chairholders (Tier 1 and Tier 2). McGill was also awarded two Partnership Engage Grants and one Partnership Development Grant. In addition, thirty McGill research projects received funding through JELF for innovative tools and infrastructure. Lastly, 147 McGill research projects received funding through the NSERC's Discovery Research Programs. The total investment for McGill research is $42.5 million. \"McGill is grateful for the Government of Canada's significant investment in research through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Canada Research Chairs Program, the John R. Evans Leaders Fund, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,\" said Martha Crago, Vice-Principal, Research and Innovation. \"With this vital support, our scholars are empowered to pursue research in areas that will benefit our environment, the economy, and communities in Canada and around the world.\" From plant growth to genomics: McGill's 10 Canada Research Chairs make an impact The Canada Research Chairs Program is driving a national effort to make Canada one of the world's top countries for research and development. To achieve this objective, the Government of Canada awards up to $311 million per year through the program to attract and retain a diverse cadre of world-class researchers to Canada. McGill's new Canada Research Chairs are working on complex global research challenges - for example, developing predictive models and responses to the climate crisis (Prof. Jennifer Sunday), uncovering the intricacies of human vascular disease (Prof. Rhain Touyz), optimizing clinical practice in stroke rehabilitation (Prof. Aliki Thomas), and using machine learning to advance genomic medicine and improve Canadian patient care (Prof. Yue Li). Renewed Chairs will continue to advance their research programs over five or seven years, including renewed Chair in Biomechanics of Plant Health, Anja Geitmann, who was also recently awarded a prestigious Human Frontiers in Science Program grant. \"I am proud to congratulate McGill's new and renewed Canada Research Chairs on this important recognition for their work,\" said Christopher Manfredi, Provost and Vice-Principal (Academic). \"Together, they embody the spirit of academic leadership, propelling Canada's research landscape forward and shaping a brighter future for all.\" There are two types of Canada Research Chairs: Tier 1 Chairs, awarded to outstanding researchers acknowledged by their peers as world leaders in their fields, are valued at $200,000 annually for seven years with one opportunity for renewal; Tier 2 Chairs, valued at $100,000 annually for five years and renewable only once, are for exceptional emerging researchers, acknowledged by their peers as having the potential to lead in their field.See list of McGill's CRC recipients below. Research made by collaboration: Partnership Engage and Development Grants Partnership Engage Grants (PEG) provide short-term and timely support for partnered research activities between researchers and single partner organizations from the public, private or non-profit sector. Partnership Development Grants (PDG) provide support over one to three years for teams working in formal collaboration between postsecondary institutions and/or organizations of various types in the social sciences and humanities. Professor Robert David (Desautels Faculty of Management) and Assistant Professor Christine Stich (Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Occupational Health) received PEGs totalling more than $24,000 each. With the support of the PEG, David will partner with Farmers' Markets Ontario (FMO), the only provincially recognized association of farmers' markets in Ontario. Farmers' markets are an important outlet for local food products, yet farmers at times struggle to gain access to these markets while non-local products are often widely available. A lack of transparency often ensues, and consumers may be unable to discern local from non-local products. David's project aims to develop knowledge of how an industry association such as FMO can define, maintain, and communicate the boundaries of what it means to be a farmers' market, and ultimately, promote local growers and consumer access to local food. Stich has partnered with Dans la rue (DLR), a non-profit organization that supports youth at risk of or experiencing homelessness in downtown Montreal. Their project aims to better understand how DLR's services, such as an emergency shelter and a day centre offering music and art workshops, influence youths' well-being and, ultimately, their trajectories out of homelessness. Designed as a community-based participatory research initiative, the project prioritizes issues identified by community participants and pays attention to power differentials between groups and individuals at all stages of research. The recipient of a $200,000 Partnership Development Grant, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Fleury, Professor in the Department of Psychiatry, will examine homelessness and housing stability in Montreal. Together with a multidisciplinary team and key stakeholders in Montreal, Fleury is researching the challenges and issues related to the residential stability and social integration of individuals experiencing homelessness across different permanent housing models. By comparing the impact of private, social, and community-based housing on user outcomes from the perspective of both users and administrators, the study can provide insights to improve the implementation and selection of housing models that will best meet the needs of users and promote their recovery. Investing in researchers' infrastructure needs: The John R. Evans Leaders Fund Thirty McGill researchers received grants totalling $10 million through the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)'s John R. Evans Leaders Fund. The recipients also received matching funds from the Quebec government for their research endeavours for a total research investment of over $20 million. The JELF helps universities attract top talent in diverse fields of research by providing them with the highly specialized research infrastructure they need to excel. \"I would like to thank the CFI and the Government of Quebec for their generous investments in world class research and innovation through the John R. Evans Leaders Fund,\" said Martha Crago, Vice-Principal (Research and Innovation). \"Through this Fund, McGill's talented researchers can acquire the cutting-edge tools and infrastructure they need to embark on ambitious projects across disciplines, including tackling climate change through machine learning, and advancing the critical work of vaccine development. My congratulations are extended to all the researchers who received funding today.\" Among the thirty researchers who received funding through the JELF is Udunna Anazodo, Assistant Professor and William Dawson Scholar in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery. With the grant, Dr. Anazodo and co-investigator Professor Pedro Rosa Neto, of the Department of Psychiatry, will acquire an ultra-high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) device that will be integrated into a whole-body ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system to study astrocyte dysfunction, a significant biological process related to Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. This world-first ultra-high-resolution PET/MRI system dedicated to brain imaging will enable novel discoveries in neuroscience across biological scales, at unparalleled spatial precision. For researchers, nature can provide guidance to design functional materials in a sustainable manner, offering solutions to pressing environmental challenges. With JELF funding No\u00e9mie-Manuelle Dorval Courchesne, an Associate Professor in Chemical Engineering and a Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Biologically-Derived Materials, will acquire state-of-the-art spectroscopic and imaging tools to study marine mussels, and specifically their byssus - a material featuring a tough, self-healing fibrous core covered by a hard yet flexible coating - at the nanoscale. The research findings can be applied to creating sustainable polymers, developing wearable devices, and advancing tissue engineering techniques. The devastating impact of COVID-19 on health and the economy has underscored the importance of basic research and domestic vaccine capacity. With JELF support, Paul Wiseman, Professor in the Department of Chemistry, and co-applicant Brian Ward, Professor in the Department of Medicine, will focus on vaccine development, specifically how plant-made virus-like particle (VLP) influenza vaccines interact with the immune system.
