Think you might be drawn toward the role of the spiritual healer? Here are some commonly asked questions that might help you out, if you want to dive deeper and do some work let me know. Many of my clients are meant to do healing work as they step into their calling. What does a spiritual healer do? Spiritual healers come in many shapes, forms, and modalities. However, overall, a spiritual healer's focus is on the non-physical realm: the Soul, Spirit, and energetic layers of a person. Most spiritual healers focus on helping a person reconnect with their [Soul](https://lonerwolf.com/what-is-a-soul/) by clearing away old energy, identifying inner blockages, and channeling healing energy. They may choose to work with ancestral trauma, past life issues, chakra imbalances, [soul loss](https://lonerwolf.com/soul-loss/), or anything that is causing unhappiness and disharmony. How to become a spiritual healer? There are many courses out there offered to certify you and sharpen your skills, however, this is not necessary to become a spiritual healer. Spiritual healing is an innate calling that comes from the Soul: it can't be handed to you on a piece of paper. Many people study intensively by themselves - however, with that being said, a formal study can help to hone these innate talents. To become a spiritual healer, focus on what subjects and topics you're drawn to - that is your path. Let me know if you might like to explore more. Can anyone be a spiritual healer? Yes and no. Spiritual healing is an inborn gift. If you're a highly sensitive and naturally compassionate person, chances are you are a born healer. But spiritual healing doesn't suit everyone - even those with the innate gift. To be a spiritual healer, you need to have done a lot of inner work (working through your own wounds), have a high level of integrity, and be a grounded person. Some people find spiritual healing too overwhelming and intense, so keep that in mind when pursuing this path. >>> As a healer, the best possible place you could start is with yourself. As the proverb goes, \"Physician, heal thyself!\" Starting from within first is the best way to ensure that you have enough energy, passion, and love to give to others. I recommend exploring how mindfully connected you are to yourself and what family of origin healing may still need to be done to clear yourself energetically to support others.
