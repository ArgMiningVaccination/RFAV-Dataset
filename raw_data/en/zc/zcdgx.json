Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) is a citrus fruit. It has been used for weight loss. It has also been used for other conditions, but with limited evidence. Grapefruit is a source of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, pectin, and other nutrients. People use the fruit, oil from the peel, and extracts as medicine. Drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented. Before adding it to your diet, check with your healthcare provider if you take medications. People commonly take grapefruit by mouth for weight loss, asthma, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Grapefruit is a source of vitamin C, fiber, potassium, pectin, and other nutrients. People use the fruit, oil from the peel, and extracts as medicine. Drug interactions with grapefruit juice are well documented. Before adding it to your diet, check with your healthcare provider if you take medications. People commonly take grapefruit by mouth for weight loss, asthma, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. How effective is it? There is interest in using grapefruit for a number of purposes, but there isn't enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful. Is it safe? When taken by mouth: Grapefruit is commonly consumed as a food or juice. Grapefruit products are possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine. But it is possibly unsafe for postmenopausal adults to take grapefruit in large amounts. If you take any medications, check with your healthcare provider before adding grapefruit to your diet or using it as a medicine. Grapefruit interacts with a long list of medications. A heart muscle disorder (cardiomyopathy): Drinking grapefruit juice might increase the risk for abnormal heart rhythm. People with this condition should consume grapefruit juice in moderation. Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions: Drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice might increase hormone levels and therefore increase the risk of hormone sensitive conditions. People with hormone sensitive conditions should avoid grapefruit. Irregular heartbeat: Eating large amounts of grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice might worsen irregular heartbeat. Don't use grapefruit if you have this condition. Postmenopausal adults: Postmenopausal adults should avoid drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice. It's been linked with an increased risk of breast cancer in these patients. If you take any medications, check with your healthcare provider before adding grapefruit to your diet or using it as a medicine. Grapefruit interacts with a long list of medications.
