Sabino Recovery offers a clear route from active addiction to recovery. We provide risk-free detoxification services with a focus on your convenience. A team of highly qualified medical specialists evaluates and oversees the detox process, and a 24-hour nursing staff is available to assist you. When you're ready to start your recovery, we'll help you manage the symptoms of withdrawal and give your body what it needs to recover properly. Drug detox may be made more comfortable and safer when used in conjunction with certain medications (when necessary). (This page describes detox for drugs other than opiates. For information on opiate detoxification, visit our \" [Opiate Detox\"](https://sabinorecovery.com/opiate-detox/) page.) Our medical director conducts a pre-admission evaluation on all of our residents. Based on this evaluation, we create a recovery strategy that's tailored to your specific requirements and the symptoms you're experiencing. People in active addiction should avoid going \"cold turkey\" on their own. Detox is both a physically and emotionally taxing process. Without proper oversight, detox is frequently needlessly painful when there is no professional guidance or continuity of care. At the very least, detoxing without medical supervision is a health hazard. When it comes to benzodiazepines, we strongly advise anybody considering quitting to get assistance first, since medication-assisted therapy may be necessary (MAT). Without medical care, you may suffer the following mental and physical withdrawal symptoms: - Nausea - Vomiting - Hallucinations - Seizures [Anxiety](https://sabinorecovery.com/anxiety-treatment/) - Gastric issues - Bone and joint pain - Overwhelming cravings - Suicidal thoughts In some cases, withdrawing from particular drugs can even be fatal. We are here to help you avoid the negative effects of withdrawal, and you can trust us to bear with you through this acute phase of your struggle. We can start detox as soon as you are able and motivated to begin recovery. From there, we can receive you and begin the formal detox process. This vital phase of your treatment can be outlined in three easy stages. Step 1: Meet With Our Clinicians Upon admission, each resident is seen by a board-certified clinician. They are uniquely qualified to analyze your needs and choose an appropriate detox plan. Our professionals are highly trained in the area of addiction medicine. In order to get the optimum results, all treatment plans are closely evaluated. An important part of this evaluation is figuring out what symptoms you're experiencing. Residents will experience different levels of withdrawal symptoms based on a variety of conditions, including: - Length of time using the substance - The average amount used - Frequency of use - Mental health and medical history - Poly-substance use (mixture of alcohol or other drugs in combination) - Gender - Weight - How the substance was administered Detoxification is a complex process, and each client is unique. We draw from a world of medical and holistic knowledge and experience to tailor the proper treatment to each client. Modern medicine has made it possible to reach detoxification with a minimum amount of discomfort. The next step for us is to create an environment that allows for the best possible experience. Step 2: Recharge in a Safe and Comfortable Environment The medical director, qualified nurses, and resident managers of Sabino Recovery supervise the detox process. You'll have just one task at hand: feel better. During this time, we urge you to put your worries aside and let us take care of you. We create a setting in which the greatest thing you can do is unwind and focus on yourself. Rest assured, we've got this. You'll start to feel better quickly after receiving all the nutrients your body requires. Small preferences, such as a companion or a quiet spot, might aid in the healing process. All the elements, down to the blankets and room temperature, help with regenerating and recharging. Step 3: Begin Your Personal Recovery Clients transfer into residential treatment and join our close-knit community after finishing [detox](https://sabinorecovery.com/how-do-i-know-if-i-need-detox/). It's time to embrace real sobriety with a clear head and a driven heart. We shine a light on a route to long-term, stable healing for a brighter future. Your tailored treatment plan serves as a road map for you to follow as you embark on your journey of self-discovery and change. Opportunities for development and enjoyment are more plentiful than they seem during detox. They may be found around every turn. Our goal is to treat the full person since the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual elements all demand care and balance. Once your whole being is awake, you can go on the most gratifying trip of your life. Every day, we fulfill our purpose with the help of individuals who understand the issue and have the best answer. Treating the Whole Person At Sabino Recovery, our goal is to treat our residents as a whole person. In addition to the typical features of a mental health program, we offer the widest range of holistic, naturopathic, trauma-centered, and allopathic therapies for residents to explore. Drug dependence can change the circumstances of life. One can forget who they are and what they love. We listen to your needs and history to find what modalities can change your situation and help your recovery from drugs. It is all about finding what works for you. Our program is not just trauma-informed, it is trauma-focused. This is all part of taking you as you are and tailoring a treatment plan that will help you discover a new, freer way of life - from detox to graduation and beyond.
