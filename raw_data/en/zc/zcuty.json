It is done via a complex system that supports the recognition of self and elimination of non-self. The front line of our immunes system is our skin, GI tract and respiratory tract. Making sure these systems are optimized is essential. Immune system dysfunction can be the result of overactivity or underactivity. For example, an overactive immune system leads to many autoimmune disorders. Because of a hyperactive immune response, your body can unintentionally injure normal healthy cells and while eliminating invaders. In essence, your immune system turns against you. Conversely, an underactive immune system makes people more vulnerable to infections, which can be life-threatening in severe cases. With our well-balanced methods of immune system boosting San Jose & Palo Alto patients can more closely approach optimal health and well-being. Although complex, one of the first lines of defense of the immune system is the Natural Killer (NK) cell. Of all of the immune system soldiers, NK cells are the most aggressive. NK cells bind to a viral infected cell or cancer cell and release toxins to destroy the invader. Unfortunately, NK cell function, power, and activity fluctuate throughout our lives. When our NK cell function is down, our response to invaders declines, leaving us more vulnerable to illnesses. With age, significant impairments have been reported in the mechanism of NK cells. As can be expected, they seem to get 'tired'. Re-energizing this cell type can be an important way to rejuvenate our immune system. At Illuminate Wellness, our Palo Alto / San Jose Immune Boosting protocols support NK cell activity. This treatment plan includes ingredients that combine the best of modern and homeopathic medicine using supplements and peptides to specifically work on rebuilding your immune system. We recommend combining our Illuminate boosting protocols with [FastVitaminIV](/illuminate-wellness/iv-nutrient-therapy/) once or twice a week and [Ozone Therapy](/illuminate-wellness/). \"I had my Brazilian Butt Lift in 2017 with Dr. Boudreault and I couldn't be any happier with my results.
