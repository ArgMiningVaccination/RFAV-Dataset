Key Features of Prospector for Providers 9 Full-text Search and Analysis of Unstructured Notes Further augment your protocol design by performing full -text search in unstructured notes, then seamlessly include search results in your study. This capability also allows review of individual note documents. Natural Language Processing Concepts Optum leverages its internal NLP capabilities to enrich Prospector with additional structured terms from unstructured data including measurements (LVEF, FEV1), biomarkers* and genomic tests*Rapid Data Processing Prospector processes site data in seconds to identify patient counts for each criteria of a study protocol, saving you time when building complex studies Intuitive Protocol Creation Quickly and easily create key study criteria using Prospector's flexible classification of diagnoses, procedures, labs, medications, etc. and search -as-you-type features without knowledge of specific codes or programming Support for Complex Study Criteria Create complex study criteria with date/event anchoring including relative dates, latest, earliest and number of encounters/occurrencesPatient Level Detail Gain granular insights by drilling down to the individual patient level for an interactive view of the entire patient's medical history. All Prospector features are supported by a security model, which provides seamless role-based access to HIPAA compliant sets of data based on user's privileges. This allows for studies within a site, HCO, or multiple HCOs. data Prospector Demo Features and functionality \u00a9 2022 Optum, Inc. All rights reserved. Confidential property of Optum.
