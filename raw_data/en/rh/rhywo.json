The following rule, 410 IAC 7-24, Reta il Fo E stablishment more hensive approac h to pr otecting the c onsumer from contaminated foo d and foo dborne illness. Foodborne illness in the United States is a majo r cause of perso nal distress, prev entable dea th and avo idable economic burden. The Food and Drug Administ ration (FDA) 2001 Model Food Co de estimates that 76 millio n people become ill from microo rganisms in foo d resulting in as many as 5,000 needless deaths every year . For ma ny victims, foo dborne illness results o nly in discom fort or lost time from the job. Fo r some, especia lly prescho ol age children, o lder adults in health ca re fa cilities, and those with impa ired immune systems, foodborne illness is mo re serio us and ma y be life threate ning . The a nnual cost of foodborne illness in terms of pain and suffering , reduced pro ductivity, and medical co sts is estima ted to be in the billio ns of dollars. Acco rding to the Centers fo r Disea se and Prev entio by the mishan dling of food occurre d most often within the retail segme nt of the food indus try, suc h as re staurants , marke ts, c amps, c hurches , where ready-to-e at food is prep ared and pr ovided to the public for c onsumpti on. Viral p athogens are now the le ading c ause of these outbreaks. It is a shared respo nsibilit y of the foo d industry and the go vernment to ensure that food prov ided to the consumer is s afe and does not bec ome a vehicle in a disease outbre ak or in the tr ansmission of communicable disea se. This shared respo nsibility extends to ensuring tha t consumer expectatio ns are met a nd tha t food is unadulter ated, prepared in a clean en vironment and honestly prese nted. Accor dingly, the provisions of the rule provide a system of prevention and overlapping safeguards desi gned to minimize foo dborne illness, such as ensuring empl oyee hea lth, industry ma nager knowledg e, safe foo d, nontoxic and easily cleanable equipment and acceptable levels of sa nitation for re tail food es tablishment premises. The rule addr esses c ontrols for risk factors identi fied by t he Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention as contributors to foodborne outbre aks that have bee n investigate d and confirmed. Those factors are unsafe sources , poor personal hygi ene. It further es tablishes fi ve (5) key pub lic he alth interve ntions to protect consumer he cation, employee he alth contr olling hands as a vehicle of c ontamination, time and tempera ture pa rameters fo r controlling path ogens, and the consumer advisory. The rule is de signed to em phasiz e the areas of food safety that are c onsidered critic al and i f not properly followed a re more likely tha n others to result in a food contamination, illness or other env ironmenta l hea lth hazard. E ach section in the rule describes which subs ections are criti cal, non-critic al or swing (m eaning it could be eithe depe ndin g on the circums tances ). display and cro the insp ectio n repo rt form a nd the proper metho d of utilizing the r ule as it relates to citing of violations obser ved duri ng an inspection. The menu categories are listed as a means of understanding the degree of risk ass ociated with the incre ased level of food handling. In the future, the r ule is anti cipate d to undergo revisi on more f reque ntly with the object ive of staying abre ast of curren t scie nce and in ds. Also reme mber that this publi cation is not the actual rule that appe ars in the Indiana Adm inistrative Code. E very possible step has been taken to ensure its acc uracy, but if there are any questi ons, the n it is rec omm ended that you refer to this source for verification. iTABLE OF CO NTENTS PAGE (S): PREFACE ........................................................................................................................ ...Public health pr otection ..................................................................................... ......................... 19 Section 107... ....Prerequisite f or operation ................................................................................... ......................... 19 Section 108... ....Acce ss allow ed at reasona ble times after due notice .......................................................... ........ 19 Section 109... ....Ceasing ope rations, reporting, a nd resum ption of ope rations .................................................. ...20 Section 110..... ..Requirem ent for facility and opera ting plans ................................................................. ............. 20 Section 111.......Contents and specifications for facility and operating plans ................................................. ......20 Section 112... ....Food equipm ent: certification a nd classific ation............................................................. ........... 21 Section 113... ....Mobile retail ................... 21 Section 114... ....Variance ..................................................................................................... ................................. 21-22 Section 115... ....Conte nts of .................... 22 Section 116.......Preve nting health haza rds: provisions for conditions not a ddresse d........................................... 22 117.......As signm ent of supervisio n ibility..................................................................... 118... ....Dem onstration of knowle dge................................................................................... ................... 23 Section 119... ....Duties of the pers on-in-charge............................................................................... ..................... 23-24 Section 120.......Responsibility to require reporting by employees and ap plicants ...................................... 24-25 Section 121... ....Exclusi ons and restrictions .................................................................................. ....................... 25 Section 122... ....Rem oval of exclusi ons and restrictions ....................................................................... ............... 26 Section 123.......Responsibility of a food employ ee or an applicant to re port to the person-in-c harge ................. 26 Sectio n 124.......Ob and specim en anal ysis......................................................................................................... .....26-27 Section 125... ....Regulatory authority restriction or e xclusi on of food em ployee ............................................... ..27 Section 126... ....Restrictio n or exclus ion or der............................................................................... ...................... 27 Section 127... ....Release of a food em ployee fr om restricti on or exclusion ..................................................... .....27-28 ....Hand cleani ng and drying procedure ........................................................................... ............... 28 Section 129... ....Whe n to wa sh hands ........................................................................................... ........................ 28 Section 130... ....Whe re to was h hands .......................................................................................... ........................ 28 Section 131... ....Hand ....Personal clea nliness Section 133... ....Hand ............................................................................ ................... 29-30 Section 136.......Eating, dr inking, or using tobacco ........................................................................... ................... 30 Section 137... ....Disc harges from the eyes, nose , and m outh.................................................................... ............ 30 Section 138... ....Effective ness of hair restraint .............................................................................. ....................... 30 FOOD ........................................................................................................................... ........................ 31-51 Section 139..... ...............................................................................................
