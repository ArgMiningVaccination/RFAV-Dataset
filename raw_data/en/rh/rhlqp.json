Plants have formed the basis of medical treatment for much of human history, and their use in the prevention and treatment of illness is still very much a part of healing today. Using herbs to prevent and treat illness is the most ancient form of medicine, and in fact remains the most common form of medicine in use today. The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the global population rely at least partially on herbal medicines for their primary health care needs, and the use of herbal remedies is so widespread that most people do not even realise that they are using them. For example, common herbs and spices added to food may aid the digestion, and most people know that dock leaves will ease a nettle sting, and that putting vinegar on a wasp sting will relieve the pain. We offer a Herbal Medicine Foundation course as the perfect way to learn about this fascinating subject so you can learn the fundamentals and put what you have learned into practice. This accredited course is ideal for beginners who want to use herbal medicines at home or therapists who want to prescribe some basic herbal medicines in their clinic alongside their main therapy.
