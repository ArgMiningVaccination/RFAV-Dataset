Mao, MD, MSCE, Rana Leed, MPH, Marjorie A. Bowman, MD, MPA, Krupali Desai, MD (Ayu), MPH, Manuel Bramble, BA,Katrina Armstrong, MD, MSCE, and Frances Barg, PhD, Med Purpose: Hot flashes (HFs) are a particularly common and distressing symptom among breast cancer survivors (BCSs). Given its low rate of side effects, acupuncture shows promise as a therapeutic ap- proach for HFs, but little is known about BCS's decision making about the use of acupuncture. Thisstudy seeks to identify attitudes and beliefs about using acupuncture for HFs by BCSs. Methods: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual framework, we conducted semistructured interviews among women with stage I-III breast cancer who had nished primary treat- ment and were currently experiencing HFs. Interviews were taped, transcribed, and coded. We used amodied grounded theory approach to analyze the data. Results: Twenty-ve BCSs (13 whites/12 African American) participated in the study. Respondents stated that their intended use of acupuncture for HFs would be dependent on (1) expected therapeuticeffects (eg, pain relief, energy); (2) practical concerns (eg, fear of needles, practitioner experience,time commitment); and (3) source of decision support/validation (eg, family members, physicians, self).Although constructs in the TPB accounted for many decision factors, respondents identied 2 majorthemes outside of the TPB: (1) viewing acupuncture as a natural alternative to medications, and (2)assessing the degree of HFs as bothersome enough in the context of other medical comorbidities to trig-ger the need for therapy. Conclusion: BCSs expressed varied expected therapeutic benets, practical concerns, and decision support, emphasizing the \"natural appeal\" and symptom appraisal as key determinants when using acu-puncture for HFs. Incorporating these factors in counseling BCSs may promote patient-centered commu-nication, leading to improved hot flash management and quality of life. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012;25:323-332.)

Downloaded from tic estrogen withdrawal that can lead to onset or worsening of HFs. Compared with women withoutbreast cancer, BCSs experience HFs of greater fre-quency, severity, and duration. 3Previous studies have shown that HFs also are correlated with in-somnia, fatigue, reduced libido, and poor quality oflife among BCSs. 3,5-7After treatment, as many BCSs return to their primary care physicians(PCPs), 8management of HFs is a common issue faced by both parties.1 Treatment of HFs in BCSs has proven difcult because of the limitations and side effects of con-ventional therapies. Estrogen replacement, themost effective treatment for HFs, 9has been found to cause new cancer events in BCSs10and is now generally avoided.9Safer, nonestrogen therapies recently have - ever, the effectiveness of these treatments has beenmoderate at best, and many of the therapies canhave unpleasant toxicities such as insomnia, weightgain, or sexual side effects. 21Furthermore, a recent study found that paroxetine may decrease the ef-cacy of tamoxifen and increase breast cancer mor-tality. 22As a result, some women are reluctant to take medications to control their HFs and seeknonpharmacologic interventions. 23,24 BCSs are known to use complementary and al- ternative medicine (CAM) extensively.25-27Prelim - inary studies suggest that acupuncture may reduceHFs in BCSs, with fewer side effects than conven-tional pharmacologic therapies, 28,29and use of acu - puncture has been shown to reduce HFs in BCS bygreater than 50%, both during the day and atnight. 29Acupuncture is associated with improved sleep quality among postmenopausal women30and has been shown to continue to reduce HFs for aslong as 6 months after treatment. 31Despite prom - ising early results, evidence of acupuncture's ther-apeutic effects remains inconclusive, given the un-equivocal benet compared with sham controls andstudy design limitations. 32,33Like decision making for cancer treatment, BCSs often have a difculttime making decisions to manage HFs when severaloptions exist and evidence is not clear as to the bestoption. In this setting, an understanding of individ-ual patient attitudes and preferences are particu-larly important to help inform patient-centered de-cision making. Thus, we conducted this qualitativestudy to identify the specic attitudes, beliefs, andbarriers held by BCSs about making decisions touse acupuncture for HFs and general beliefs aboutacupuncture. We also explored how these beliefsdiffer for whites and African Americans. Methods We conducted open-ended, semistructured inter-views with women with stage I through III breastcancer who had nished primary cancer treatments(surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) and were cur-rently experiencing daily HFs. Participants wererecruited from an outpatient breast cancer oncol-ogy clinic in an urban academic hospital. Purpose-ful sampling was used to ensure the sample wasdiverse in race, age, and HF severity. Specically,we created a table to help guide enrollment so therewere approximately equal numbers of subjects en-rolled in the categories of white/African Americanand perceived HF severity (mild/moderate, severe/very severe). We analyzed the transcripts of alreadyenrolled subjects and then aimed to enrich specicdemographics (eg, women younger than 50 years)to capture a greater variation in the sample. Regu-latory approval was obtained through the Univer-sity of Pennsylvania's institutional review board aswell as the Abramson Cancer Center's Clinical Tri-als Scientic Review and Monitoring Committee. The interview guide was developed using the The- ory of Planned Behavior (TPB) 34as a conceptual framework. The TPB model contains 3 domains:attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, andperceived behavioral control that contributes to one'sbehavioral intention. 34This model has been used in numerous research settings to understand the deci-sions about specic health behaviors such as mammo-gram use 35,36and in the context of CAM re - search.37,38The interview questions were pilot tested and revised for clarity. Interviewers were all trainedand supervised in semistructured interviewing tech-niques by the study medical anthropologist (FB).Each interview lasted approximately 1 hour and wasrecorded and then transcribed by a professional tran-scription company. Participants also completed self-reported surveys to collect general sociodemographicand health information. De-identied transcripts were imported into QSR NVivo 8.0 software (QSR International Pty.Ltd., Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) to manage thedata.

Team members coded 5transcripts together to improve the reliability ofcoding and to standardize code denitions. Re-search assistants coded the remainder of the tran-scripts. Coding consistency was determined using afeature built into the software for this purpose.Transcripts and codes were discussed duringweekly team meetings. We achieved saturation onall major themes after 25 interviews. Results The study participants included 13 white women(52%) and 12 African American women (48%). Themedian age for participants was 57 years (range, 38 to79 years). Fifteen study participants (60%) had a col-lege degree or more, whereas 10 participants (40%)reported less than college. Eleven women (44%) re-ported entering menopause naturally, whereas thera-py-induced menopause (dened as menopause beingbrought on by either surgical or medical processes)was identied in 13 women (52%). Among the par-ticipants, 15 (60%) had used some form of CAM inthe past 12 months, and 10 (40%) had not. Further-more, only 4 participants had used acupuncture in the past for symptoms unrelated to HFs. Each participant'scharacteristics can be seen in Table 1. We identied 3themes related to decisions to use acupuncture amongBCS that t into the main constructs of the TPB: (1)construction of the effectiveness of acupuncture (at-titude); (2) practical concerns related to using acu-puncture (perceived behavioral control); (3) decisionsupport and conrmation (subjective norms). How-ever, 2 themes related directly to patients' nal deci-sions to use acupuncture were beyond the constructsin the TBP: (4) viewing acupuncture as a naturalalternative to medicine; and (5) symptom appraisal inthe context of other medical comorbidities.

Downloaded from cic prior knowledge of acupuncture's effective- ness for HFs. However, many individuals hadvarying levels of expected benets of acupuncturebuilt on their personal experiences or those oftheir family members/friends, mostly related tousing acupuncture to treat pain. Some drew fromthe exposure to mass media such as television andthe Internet. They generalized what they learnedabout acupuncture for specic conditions (eg,back pain) to a much broader perceived benet ofacupuncture. Several African-American womenrelied on acupuncture's long history and wide usein China as evidence that the therapy has beentested by time and therefore must have somebenet for them. African-American women werealso more likely to state that they had little ex-posure to acupuncture themselves or via familymembers than white women. Two white womenwith higher levels of education specied the needfor evidence generated from clinical trials tar-geted at HFs to aid their decision for using acu-puncture for HFs (see Table 2a). Practical Concerns Related to Using Acupuncture Some respondents stated that they would never useacupuncture because of their fear of needles. A fewrespondents wondered how acupuncture may affecttheir lymphedema (ie, will needling make theirlymphedema worse?) or other medical conditions.Two women stated that pills are easy to take andtherefore are a more desired choice compared withacupuncture. A number of women also listed nd-ing a credible practitioner, location of the practiceproximal to their residence, and the time commit-ment to the therapy as potential barriers to usingacupuncture (see Table 2, B). Decision Support and Conrmation The majority of the participants indicated that thedecision to choose a treatment modality for HFs isentirely theirs. Participants often cited 2 groups ofindividuals they turn to when they make decisionsabout medical care in general: (1) family members(spouse, partner, or adult children); and (2) physi-cians. Interestingly, although some BCSs, espe-cially white survivors, turn to their oncologists forissues related to symptom management, AfricanAmericans see their PCP as their main resourcewith the information to assist their decision makingabout treating HFs (see Table 2, C).Viewing Acupuncture as a Natural Alternative toMedicineWhen we asked why individuals may choose acupunc-ture for managing HFs, most responses were centerednot so much on what acupuncture is, but rather whatacupuncture is not, specically, not a medication. Thiswas true for all African American and most white re-spondents. Many of the women described medicationsas \"toxic,\" \"foreign,\" and having other side effects thatmay be worse than the HFs themselves. At the sametime, they endorsed using a treatment that is naturaleven when effectiveness is uncertain. Several African-American women stated that they were already takingmany medications for a variety of other conditions andthey would not consider adding another pill to manageHFs as a viable option; thus, they prefer a natural alter-native. African-American women used particularly emo-tional descriptors (\"I hate pills\") when discussing theiraversion to another medicine (see Table 3). Symptom Appraisal in the Context of Other Medical ComorbiditiesAnother main theme that emerged relates directly towhether an individual perceived her HFs as bother-some enough to initiate treatment of any kind.Women spoke specically about evaluating whethertheir HFs were severe or bothersome enough to war-rant another intervention in the context of their othermedical conditions. Although some individuals citedtheir HFs as tolerable, several African-Americanwomen with severe HFs considered treating othersymptoms (eg, back pain) as more important and inneed of more urgent treatment by acupuncture thantheir HFs (see Table 4). Discussion HFs are a bothersome symptom affecting hundredsof thousands of BCSs. In this study, we identiedattitudes toward and beliefs about using acupunc-ture for HFs, aspects of perceived behavioral con-trol, and social norms related to the intention ofusing acupuncture for HFs. As expected from theTPB, we found that patients constructed therapeu-tic benet and practical concerns in the setting oflimited knowledge about acupuncture. Althoughthey rely on family and physicians for treatmentinformation and decision support; survivors often\"own\" the nal decision. Beyond constructs in theTPB, we found that a desire for natural alternatives 326JABFM May-June 2012 Vol. 25 No. 3 http://www.jabfm.org on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from to medication was the main driver for survivors' intentions to use acupuncture. The primary reasonsurvivors would not want acupuncture for HFs was an appraisal that their HFs were not bothersome orurgent enough to be treated when they were expe-riencing other comorbid conditions.Several previous qualitative studies of factors affecting general use of CAM (rather than acupunc- ture specically) among BCSs 3 9-4 2have reported similar themes, such as that survivors believe thatCAM therapies have minimal side effects 39,41,42and can be used safely to complement conventional Table 2.

Downloaded from therapies.3 9-4 2Our study specically found that one of the major determinants of acupuncture use among BCSs was its appeal as a natural alternative.Studies also suggest that CAM often is used formanaging symptoms related to cancer and its treat-ments and for boosting the immune system. 39,41,42 Our study focused on HFs, a prevalent and both-ersome symptom experienced by BCSs, and re-vealed symptom appraisal of the severity of HFs tobe one of the primary reasons for acupuncture useamong BCSs. However, to our knowledge, no qual-itative studies have focused specically on under-standing the use of a single CAM modality amongBCSs to alleviate HFs. Furthermore, our studyincluded BCSs from both white and African-Amer-ican groups as well as different educational back-grounds and prior CAM experience. Our approachovercomes some of the sampling limitations of pre-vious research, such as including only CAM us-ers, 39mostly whites with higher socioeconomic lev - els,42or only Chinese participants.40 Given the fairly modest understanding of acu- puncture and a lack of specic knowledge of acu-puncture for HFs, an individual often relies on herfamily and consults her physician about the use ofacupuncture for HFs. Compared with whitewomen, African Americans tend to turn to theirPCPs for information about and decision supportfor symptom management. This is consistent witha previous study that found that African Americanswere more likely to endorse the delivery of survi-vorship care by PCPs. 8Our study underlines the importance of PCPs being knowledgeable aboutacupuncture as well as therapeutic options for man-aging HFs in the context of survivorship so theycan be well-equipped to facilitate decision makingby their patients. Although the TPB has been used to explain intentions to use CAM, 37,38we were interested to nd that it did not account for all the factors thatwomen described as affecting their intentions touse acupuncture. The TPB, like much of tradi-tional health behavior theory, is based on theunderlying notion of rational thought in whichpatients are assumed to be highly motivated tomaintain or return to a universally agreed-upondenition of good health. 43,44Rational health decisions are based on maximizing benets andTable 2.

Downloaded from minimizing losses or costs.45For example, the TPB posits that if a woman has a positive attitude about acupuncture (attitude), has no signicantbarriers to obtaining acupuncture (perceived be-havioral control), and has important others in hersocial network who advocate for using modalitiessuch as acupuncture (subjective norms), she willlikely intend to use acupuncture for symptomssuch as HFs. Despite this, we found that symp-tom appraisal and desire for a natural remedywere important determinants as well, eventhough they did not t into the TPB model.Many interventions operate under a similarpremise: that women will use a utilitarian modelfor making decisions about treating breast cancersymptoms. It is tempting to use traditional help-seeking models in research and practice becausethey explain much middle-class health-seekingbehavior. However, these approaches treat as ex-ternal to the model personal, cultural, and socialfactors that contribute to the meaning and expe-rience of cancer-related symptoms. We havemodied the original constructs in the TPB toinclude symptom appraisal and a subjective ap-preciation for treatment properties to capture theadditional elements that women used when mak-ing decisions about using acupuncture for HFs(see Figure 1). Our study is among the rst to explore demo- graphic differences in treatment decisions relatedto HFs by BCSs. African Americans seem to bemuch more willing to accept the empirical evidencefrom historic use as a rationale for their willingnessto try acupuncture. Although we observed that allAfrican American and most white patients endorsedacupuncture as a natural alternative, they arrived atthis idea from different paths. Compared withwhites, African-American women were much morelikely to voice concerns about existing polyphar-macy as a reason why another pill is not an optionfor them. At the same time, medical comorbiditiessuch as ongoing pain may also serve as a barrier tousing acupuncture for HFs for African Americans.Our ndings may reflect the clinical reality thatAfrican-American patients are likely to have greatermedical comorbidity, and often their decision ofusing a therapy for a condition is driven by multiplecompeting medical needs. Several limitations of our study need to be ac- knowledged. Our sample was of limited size anddrew from an urban tertiary medical center. Al-though these factors affect the generalizability ofthe ndings, we did reach saturation of topics (ie,no new themes emerged) by the 25th interview andthus feel condent that a larger sample size wouldnot have yielded additional information. We stud- ied decision making around intended use of acupunc-ture rather than actual use, so the factors may notfully capture the complexity of a true clinical decision.In addition, we conducted research from the perspec-tives of a PCP who practices integrative medicine(JJM) and a medical anthropologist (FB); thus, somedegree of bias may present in our interpretation of thedata. However, we often negotiated our differentworld views during research meetings. Finally, qual-itative research seeks to identify a range of issues thatare important among a group of people. It should notbe used to infer causation or to quantify the magni-tude of difference between groups in terms of beliefsor behaviors.Table 4.

Downloaded from Conclusions Because early detection and better treatments for breast cancer have decreased mortality rates, thesurvivorship period has become a new area of re-search and importance. PCPs and oncologists needa range of options for women who are experiencingdistressing HFs as a result of their breast cancertreatment. The evaluation of acupuncture for HFsis limited and ongoing; thus, the evidence base forit is limited, with conflicting results. 32This raises the dilemma for physicians to recommend for orrecommend against acupuncture. In a situation inwhich there is no clear winner, incorporating pa-tients' perspectives may lead to more satised de-cision making and outcomes. Our study found thatacupuncture may be more congruent with somewomen's preferences for natural approaches tosymptom management, thereby minimizing theneed for additional medication. Clinicians need tounderstand that perceptions about the attributes ofacupuncture are likely to vary according to racialgroup and symptom burden. When establishing theeffectiveness of acupuncture in the real world, re-searchers must account for this variation in theacupuncture interventions that they test. BecausePCPs play a critical role in decision support forcancer survivors, this understanding may help fa-cilitate patient-centered communication to assistpatients in choosing therapeutic options that areacceptable and lead to symptom reduction and abetter quality of life.
