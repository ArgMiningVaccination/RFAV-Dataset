Why You Need to Detox Our process begins by enhancing your body's natural detoxification abilities. This is a crucial aspect of good health and the key to sustainable weight loss. It's impossible for us to keep harmful toxins out of our bodies since our environment, including farming lands, food, water, and air, all contain a high level of pollutants due to industrialization. Fortunately, when it comes to naturally occurring toxins, your body can take steps to keep itself clean, and you can give your body a helping hand. However, when it comes to artificial chemicals, there are few processes in place to protect against them, and a deeper detox may be necessary. As toxin levels build up to a critical mass inside your body, you may experience fatigue, headaches, brain fog, weight gain, and more. Failing to eliminate high levels of toxins can also lead to severe illnesses that affect hormone balance, digestion, joint health, and proper mental function. Often, people dealing with these ailments will turn to medications for a solution, increasing their toxic overload and unwanted side effects. How We Can Help You Detox At VIDA Integrative Medicine, we offer advanced laboratory testing methods to identify the particular toxins and the appropriate detoxification options for our patients based on their specific results.
