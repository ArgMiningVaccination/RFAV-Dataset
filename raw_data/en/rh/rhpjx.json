ABSTRACT Background Harnessing the immune system to purposely recognize and destro y tumors represents a significant breakthrough in clinical oncology. Non- synon ymous mutations (neoantigenic peptides) were identified as powerful cancer targets. This knowledge can be exploited for further improvements of active immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines, as T cells specific for neoantigens are not attenuated by immune tolerance mechanism and do not harm healthy tissues. The current study aimed at developing an optimized multitarget vaccine using short or long neoantigenic peptides utilizing virus- like partic les (VLPs) as an efficient vaccine platform. Methods M utations of murine mammary carcinoma cells were identified by integrating spectrometry- b ased immunopeptidomics and whole exome sequencing. Neoantigenic peptides synthesized and covalently linked to virus- l ike nanoparticles using a Cu- f ree click chemistry method for easy preparation of vaccines against mouse mammary carcinoma.Results As compared with short peptides, vaccination with long peptides was superior in the generation of neoantigen- specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which readily produced interferon gamma (IFN-) and tumor- necrosis factor (TNF-). The resulting anti- tumor effect was associa ted with favorable immune re- polariza tion in the tumor microenvironment through reduction of myeloid- derived suppressor cells. Vaccination with long neoantigenic peptides also decreased post- surgical tumor recurrence and metastases, and prolonged mouse survival, despite the tumor's low mutational burden.Conclusion I and exome sequencing is an efficient approach for identifying neoantigenic peptides. Our multitarget VLP- b ased vaccine shows a promising anti- t umor effect in an aggressive murine mammary carcinoma model. Future clinical application using this strategy is readily feasible and practical, as click chemistry coupling of personalized synthetic peptides to the nanoparticles can be done at the bedside directly before injection. INTRODUCTION Driving the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy tumors represents a significant breakthrough in clinical oncology. Non- synonymous mutations were identified as powerful cancer targets. This knowledge can be exploited for further improvements of active and passive immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines. T cells specific for neoantigenic peptides are typically not attenuated by immune tolerance mechanism and do not harm healthy tissues. 1 Recent clin- ical trials have shown that de novo immune responses can be induced by vaccination with neoantigens in melanoma and glioblastoma patients. 2-5 The optimal peptide length for therapeutic cancer vaccines has been identi-fied in preclinical and clinical studies. Short peptides of 8-11 amino acids (a.a.) are the typical CD8 + T cell epitopes, while long peptides of 15-32 a.a. contain both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes.6 7 Neoantigenic epitopes can be predicted based on their sequence, expression, proteasome cleavage sites, peptide abundance, major histocom-patibility complex (MHC)- binding affinity and further physiochemical and structural features of peptide- MHC complexes. Long peptides are elongated at both ends with natural flanking residues that extend the repertoire of peptides binding to MHC- I to additional peptides binding MHC- II. Cyto - toxic CD8+ T lymphocytes have been intensely characterized and identified as key players in anti- tumor immunity . Furthermore, CD4+ T cells have recently emerged as important contributors in enhancing the immune response against tumors. 8 9 There exist many different vaccine platforms, based on mRNA, peptides/proteins, dendritic cells (DCs) or recombinant viruses. 10-13 Onco - lytic viruses have been developed since many years, leading to the approval of talimogene laherparepvec (T- V EC) to treat patients with metastatic melanoma.14 The success of this therapy is likely related to the immunogenicity on September 17, 2023 by guest.

The intratumoral injection route has also become promising for treating patients with virus- l ike particles (VLPs) that carry CpGs oligodeoxynucleotides but no antigen, whereby the rational is that tumor antigens are present in the tumors, making it unnecessary to be provided as vaccine. The quasicrystalline VLPs are multiprotein complexes with a highly defined repetitive surface geometry, mostly in the shape of an icosahedrons. 15 Epitope repeti - tiveness serves as a potent pathogen- a ssociated structural pattern (PASP) efficiently recognized by innate and adap - tive immune cells.16 The outer surface of VLPs can be deco - rated with antigenic peptides. Inside of the VLPs, one can package innate immune stimulators such as toll- l ike receptor (TLR) ligands for efficient cellular activation.15 VLPs built with bacteriophage Q protein (Q -VLPs) are highly immu - nogenic and very versatile for the production of vaccine candidates with antigens and innate immune stimulators. In our earlier studies and clinical trials, we showed that such VLP vaccines induced strong tumor antigen- s pecific T cell responses in preclinical models and melanoma patients. 17 18 Our Q (G10)- M elan- A vaccine was based on Q-VLPs packaged with G10, a TLR- 9 ligand inducing a potent interferon (IFN) response,19 and decorated with a long peptide derived from the Melan- AMart1 melanoma differentiation antigen. Chemical coupling of peptides to the Q -VLPs was performed using the (succinimidyl- 6 -((b- m aleimidopropionamido)hexanoate) SMPH bifunctional cross- l inker. Clinical trials showed that more than half of patients with stage II-IV melanoma generated strong tumor antigen- s pecific and in vivo functional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses.20 The tumors of some patients showed late loss of Melan- A expression, indicating that targeting of only a single antigen is problematic because of disease progression caused by antigen- l oss variants. Indeed, preclinical models confirmed that targeting multiple antigens is superior in generating CD4 + and CD8+ T cell responses that can success - fully infiltrate tumors, control tumor growth and avoid outgrowth of escape variants. 21 The current study aimed at developing an optimized anti- tumor vaccine using short or long neoantigenic peptides. VLPs were packaged with a TLR- 9 ligand and decorated with neoantigenic peptides discovered by peptidomic, genetic and transcriptomic techniques. V accines were composed of mixtures of four VLPs each with a different peptide, coupled by click chemistry permitting easy patient- individual vaccine preparation at the bedside. Our study provides proof of concept of an effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine that can readily be implemented for clinical use. MA TERIALS AND METHODS Production and purification of Q-VLPs The expression and production of the bacteriophage Q-VLPs were carried out as previously described. 22-24Cell lines and mice4T1 mammary were cultured in Gibco Dulbecco's Modified 6 \u00b5g puromycin was added to the culture medium as per A TCC instructions. When cells were 80% confluent, medium was aspirated cells were washed 3\u00d7 with 1\u00d7 phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) to remove excess 1\u00d7 ypsin was added and flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Cells were collected, resuspended in complete medium and kept on ice until use. Mycoplasma contamination was ruled out using Microsart AMP Mycoplasma Kit. Wild- type female Balb/cOlaHsd mice (8-12 weeks) were purchased from Harlan and kept in the animal facility at the University of Bern. 1\u00d710 6 cells were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the flank region under isoflurane anesthesia. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Swiss Animal Act (455.109.1\u2014September 2008, 5) of University of Bern. DNA sequencing and prediction of non-synonymous mutationsDNA was extracted using the commercially available Pure-link Genomic DNA mini kit (Invitrogen) as per the manu-facturer's instructions. The purity and concentration of the DNA of both cell lines were measured using nano-drop. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 machine using libraries prepared with a SureSelectXT Mouse All Exon capture kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA), to produce 150 paired end reads sufficient for a mean bait coverage of at least 150\u00d7. The sequence reads were aligned to the GRCm38.p6 mouse reference assembly using BWA- MEM V .0.7.17,25 and variants were predicted using the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices protocol (GATK V.3.7). A set of reference variants for mouse was derived from data generated by the Wellcome Sanger Institute Mouse Genomes Project (available at ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger. ac.uk/REL-1807-SNPs_Indels/). Somatic mutations (SMs) were defined as variants present only in the 4T1 sample, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were defined as variants present in both the 4T1 and EpH4- Ev samples. The functional effect of the predicted SMs and SNPs was determined by annotating the variants with snpEff V using the MHC-I binding peptides Anti- MHC- I monoclonal antibodies were purified from the supernatant of HIB 34.1.2 hybridoma cells (a gift from Angel Miguel Garcia- Lora, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Protein A-Sepharose cross- linked to Protein A-Sepharose 4B beads at a concentration of 5 mg of antibodies per 1 mL volume of beads at room on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C at 20 000 g for 50 min. MHC- I mole - cules were purified by incubating the cleared lysate with HIB antibodies cross- linked to Protein A-Sepharose 4B beads in affinity columns for 3 hours at 4\u00b0C. The affinity columns were washed first with 150 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) in 20 mM T ris- HCl pH 8, then with 400 mM NaCl in 20 mM T ris- HCl pH 8 and again with 150 mM NaCl in 20 mM T ris- HCl pH 8. The beads were washed with 20 mM T ris- HCl pH 8 and the MHC complexes were eluted by adding 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at RT. For the puri-fication and concentration of MHC peptides, Sep- Pak tC18 Sep- Pak tC18 96- well plates and the C18 wells were then washed with 0.1% TFA. The peptides eluted with 28% ACN in TFA. The peptide samples were dried using vacuum centrifugation (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at 20\u00b0C. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry Peptides were separated on a 450 mm analytical column (8 \u00b5m tip, 75 \u00b5m inner diameter , PicoTipTMEmitter, New Objective) with with an Easy- nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The separation was performed at a flow rate of 250 nL/min by a gradient of 0.1% formic acid (F A) in 80% ACN (solvent B) and 0.1% FA in water (solvent A). With a Q Exactive HF- X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), MS1 spectra were acquired from m/z=300-1650 with a resolution of 60,000 (m/z=200), an ion accumulation time of 80 ms and an auto gain control (AGC) was set to 3e6 ions. MS/MS spectra were acquired in a data- dependent manner on the 10 most abundant precursor ions with a resolution of 15,000 (m/z=200), an ion accumulation time of 120 ms and an isolation window of 1.2 m/z. The AGC was set to 2e5 ions. The dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s and a normalized collision energy of 27 was used. Identification of neoantigenic peptides from MS immunopeptidomic dataNon- synonymous SMs and SNPs were incorporated into the headers of reference protein Fasta as previ - ously described.27 Mouse GENCODE reference assembly V.GRCm38 from https://www.gencodegenes. org/mouse/releases.html) were pres - ence of 4T1- specific variants using genomic coordinates from the transcript annotations. Variants producing non- synonymous changes were identified and the corre - sponding a.a. changes were tagged with a unique ID and added to the header of the translated transcript sequence. We searched the immunopeptidomic MS data against the 4T1- specific customized reference database with MaxQuant V.1.5.9.4.28 The default settings were used except and in addition the following settings were included: variants were called from file, methionine oxidation and protein N- term acetylation were set as variable modifications and no fixed modification was set, enzyme specificity was set to 'unspecific' and peptide spectrum match false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.05 with no protein FDR. Binding affinity of the peptides to the MHC molecules was predicted by NetMHCpan V.4.1 software. 29 Binding motif deconvolution of 9- mer MHC- I peptides was per formed using the MixMHCp 2.130 31 with the default settings and deconvoluted motifs were manu-ally assigned as H- 2- Dd and H- 2- Kd. Verification of identified NeoAGTo verify the expression of the identified NeoAG, RNA from 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line, 4T1 established tumor and EpH4- Ev wild- type mammar y epithelial cell line were extracted using NucleoSpin RNA Kit and reverse transcribed using High- Capacity RNA- to- cDNA Kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Three primer pairs were designed of ~24 bp each, to amplify the mutated region leading to three amplicons of ~200 bp each. The PCR products were electrophoresed and after gel extraction, the amplicons with the expected size were purified using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit. Amplicons were then sequenced using Sanger sequencing with the primers used for PCR amplification. The results confirmed the somatic missense mutations in 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line and the established 4T1 tumors in Balb/c mice; however, these mutations were absent from the wild- type control mammar y epithelial cell line. Synthesis of neoantigenic peptides (short and long)The identified NeoAG in 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line were synthesized as short (15-16 a.a.) or long (32 a.a.) peptides using their flanking regions as listed in table 1. An additional lysine (K) and an azide group (N3) were added at the C- terminus of the synthesized peptides to facilitate Cu- free click chemistr y coupling. Neoantigenic short and long peptides are referred to as NeoAGS and NeoAGL, respectively. Neoantigenic MHC- I peptides (8 a.a. or 9 a.a. underlined), non- synonymous SMs (in bold). Production of Q(1668)-NeoAGS and Q(1668)-NeoAGL vaccinesThe naturally packaged single- stranded RNA (ssRNA) in Q -VLPs was digested as following: Q(ssRNA)- VLPs were washed 3\u00d7 with 20 mM HEPES (Sigma- Aldrich) using Amicon- Ultra 0.5 mL tubes 100 kDa molecular weight on September 17, 2023 by guest.

J Immunother Cancer 2022;10:e002927. doi:10.1136/jitc-2021-002927Open access cut- off (MWCO). RNAse A (Merck) was used to digest the ssRNA (1.2 mg/mL for each 3 mg/mL Q-VLPs) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours in a shaker at 400 rpm. The digestion of the ssRNA was confirmed by 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe dye for 30 min at 90 V. Q-VLPs were then re- packaged with backbone purchased from Invitrogen. The re- packaging was confirmed by 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe dye for 30 min at 90 V . The presence of Q(1668)- VLPs protein was detected by staining the 1% agarose with Coomassie Blue stain. Q(1668)- VLPs were then deri - vatized ester (DBCO cross- linker) (Sigma- Aldrich) in a excess. Amicon- Ultra 0.5 mL tubes 100 kDa MWCO were used to remove excess DBCO cross- linker NeoAGS or NeoAGL peptides by Pepscan BRESTO with the addition of lysine (K) and (N3) azide group at the C- terminus to facilitate their coupling to the derivatized Q (1668)- VLPs. The synthesized peptides were reconstituted in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added in a fourfold molar excess over Q(1668)- VLPs monomer. The vaccine was incubated 1 hour at RT and Amicon- Ultra 0.5 mL tubes 100 kDa MWCO were used to remove excess peptide. The coupling of the NeoAGS or NeoAGL to Q(1668)- VLPs was done separately for each neoantigenic peptide. The efficiency of the coupling was checked with SDS- P AGE (BIO- RAD).V accination of mice Balb/c mice were vaccinated after inoculation of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line as described in the Cell lines and mice section. Designed groups, vaccination doses and regimen were scheduled as described in the Results section. Briefly, we injected 1\u00d710 6 4T1 s.c. in the flank as previous studies have shown that this method possesses an increased localization of the primar y tumor, which makes it easier to be resected in surgery. Injecting 4T1 in mammary fat or orthotopically showed enhanced invasive growth pattern. The s.c. inoculation method of 4T1 results in metastases as per our primary data and as shown by other studies. 32 Vaccination using s.c. injection (over the shoulders, into the loose skin over the neck) started 3 days after cell line inoculation as summarized in table 2. Mice were followed every 2 days to assess tumor volume and general health score. Three doses (Prime-Boost-Boost) of the vaccine (40 \u00b5g each dose) were administered over 17 days (please refer to the Efficient coupling of synthetic NeoAG peptides by Cu- free click chemistry to VLPs section). Tumors in the control group reached the ethically maximal tolerated size of 1 cm 3 by day 17. For the experiment in the Long peptide vaccina-tion decreases post- surgical tumor recurrence and lung metastases, and prolongs sur vival section, primary tumors were resected on day 14 from all groups and 2 vaccine doses were administered weekly.

Splenocytes were collected 7 days later staining. Na\u00efve mice and a control peptide (CP) were used. Analysis of tumors T umors were measured every 3 days using a caliper using the formula V=(WxWxL)/2, V=final tumor volume in mm 3, L=tumor length and W=tumor width. On day 17, mice were euthanised as tumors in the control group reached the size of 1 cm 3. Tumors were collected in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin on ice. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were collected as following: tumors were dissected into pieces and smashed using 70 \u00b5M cell strainer, cells were washed during the process using DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 50 mL falcon tubes. Collected cells were added to 15 mL tubes containing 2 mL of 35% Percoll slowly . The tubes were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 25 min at R T to isolate TILs. TILs were then resuspended in 200 \u00b5L PBS (0.1% and 100 \u00b5L was transferred to 96- well v- bottom plates and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min.

RESULTS NeoAG identificationThe current study aimed at providing a proof of concept (POC) for the generation of a personalized VLP- b ased vaccine by incorporating tumor- s pecific NeoAG of mammary carcinoma. We have chosen the aggressive, highly metastatic and low mutational burden mammary carcinoma cell line (4T1). 11 The wild- t ype mammary epithelial cell line, EpH4- E v, was selected as germline reference cells. Both cell lines originate from Balb/c mice. NeoAG identification was performed by WES combined with immunopeptidomics (figure 1A). MHC- I binding peptides were eluted from 4T1 cells and were characterized by LC- M SMS. A 4T1- s pecific reference database that includes non- s ynonymous SMs was generated to match the MSMS data. In total, 2714 and 5077 MHC- I peptides were identified in the 4T1 mammary carci - noma cells grown in vitro and in vivo, respectively (online supplemental data 1). The peptides recapitulated the expected length distribution of MHC- I ligands, meaning the majority were 9 mers, and the 9- m er peptides were clustered into two groups, revealing the expected binding motifs of H- 2- Dd and H- 2- Kd (figure 1B-D ). Despite the low muta - tional burden of we identified four MSMS (figure 1E-H ). Thap3 (H75Y) and Sult2b1 (H299N) as shown in figure 1 and online supplemental table 1. Verification of NeoAG sequence and expressionWe performed RT- P CR to verify the sequence and expression of the NeoAG. RNA was extracted from the 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line, from 4T1 tumor in vivo and from the EpH4- E v wild- t ype mammary epithelial cell line as control. The results confirmed presence and expression of the non- s ynonymous SMs in 4T1 mammary carcinoma cell line as well as in 4T1 tumor in vivo in Balb/c mice. These mutations were absent in EpH4- E v cells (online supplemental figure 2). Efficient coupling of synthetic NeoAG peptides by Cu-free click chemistry to VLPsQ(ssRNA)- V LPs were expressed and purified as described previously.22 23 The integrity of Q (ssRNA)- VLPs was confirmed by electron microscopy (figure 2A). In a next step, Q (ssRNA)- V LPs were treated with RNaseA to digest the RNA that was naturally packaged during protein expres - sion in Escherichia coli .15 33 The empty particles were then re- p ackaged with the B- t ype CpGs 1668, a TLR- 9 ligand and potent activator of required for effective DC matura-tion and cross- p riming. The re- p ackaging is based on direct diffusion of CpG into Q -VLPs via its natural pores followed by binding to arginine repeats inside the capsid which in the natural virus are binding the viral genome. 34 The re- p ack - aging process of Q -VLPs with the CpGs was confirmed in a 1% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe dye ( figure 2B, top), and the presence of the VLP's capsid protein was assessed by staining the agarose gel with Coomassie Blue (figure 2B, bottom). In two previous and independent studies, we have shown that the bio- o rthogonal Cu- f ree click chemistry is an efficient, safe (non- t oxic) and fast method to chemically couple peptides of 14 a .a. to Q -VLPs21 or to the plant- d erived virus CuMVTT- VLPs.35 For several reasons, including ease of manufacturing and safety, this method is preferable over using the heterobifunctional cross- l inker SMPH when considering the development of a personalized cancer vaccine (see also the Discussion section). Short (15-16 a .a.) or long (32 a .a.) neoantigenic peptides were synthesized with an additional lysine (K) and an azide group (N3) at the C- t er- minus ( table 1) for coupling to Q (1668)- VLPs (table 2). The coupling efficiency was confirmed by SDS- P AGE followed by densitometric analysis. SDS- P AGE showed Q -VLP mono - mers (~14 k Da) as well as additional bands, indicating effec - tive coupling of the synthesized NeoAG to Q (1668)- VLPs (figure 2C). Densitometric analysis (1668) alone, Q(1668)- NeoAGS and Q (1668)- NeoAGL confirmed that the coupling was efficient (data not shown). Each NeoAG peptide (short or long) was coupled to Q (1668)- VLPs sepa- rately. To avoid possible outgrowth of any tumor escape vari-ants, we prepared the final vaccines as multitarget NeoAG vaccines ( figure 2D). The vaccine with the short peptides was termed Q (1668)- NeoAGS and the vaccine with the long peptides was termed Q (1668)- NeoAGL, each containing one of the neoantigenic peptides with mutations iden retrieved in two different MHC- I neoepitopes. The sequences and treatment doses are listed in table 2.

On day 3, day 7 and day 13, s.c. vaccinations were done with Q(1668)- NeoAGS, Q (1668)- NeoAGL or Q (1668) as control without peptides ( figure 3A). Vaccination with the Q (1668)- NeoAGS significantly (p= 0.0091) hindered tumor progression as compared with the Q (1668) control. Interestingly, the long peptide vaccine Q (1668)- NeoAGL showed better enhanced anti- t umor efficacy (p<0.0001) (figure 3B-D ). We also included a saline (PBS) control and no statistical difference was detected between mice that received saline or Q (1668) control (online supplemental figure 3). It is well known that infiltration of CD8 + T cells into the tumor correlates with better prognosis, which serves as an essential piece of evidence for effective immune responses in melanoma 36 37 as well as breast cancer.38 Furthermore, it has been suggested that the majority of immunogenic NeoAG in personalized cancer vaccines activate CD4 + T cells.39 Accord - ingly, we determined the density of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in each tumor. No significant differences were found for CD8+ (p=0.9759) or CD4+ (p=0.847) T cell infiltration between the control group and the group treated with the short peptide Figure 2 Ef ficient coupling of synthetic NeoAG peptides by Cu- fr ee click chemistry to VLPs.

Yet, a considerably increased CD8+ T cell infiltration was observed after long peptide vaccination ( figure 3E,F). The infiltration of CD4+ T cell was also increased after long peptide vaccination ( figure 3 G,H). To study the systemic effects of the vaccinations, we characterized CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood 15 days post 4T1 inoculation. We found no significant differences between the groups (data not shown). We also assessed MDSCs characterized by CD11b Hi Ly6CHi or CD11bHi Ly6GHi Inter - estingly, the percentage of CD11bHi Ly6CHi was significantly decreased in the group treated with Q (1668)- NeoAGS when compared with the control group (p=0.026). The long peptide vaccine Q (1668)- NeoAGL was even more efficient in diminishing this population in comparison to the control group (p=0.0002). In the tumor microenvironment, the long peptide vaccine reduced MDSCs and increased IFN- and TNF- production by T cellsBased on its superiority, we focused on the long peptide vaccine Q(1668)- NeoAGL. To explore whether the induced immune response is mediated by a single NeoAG or the multiple ones, mice were vaccinated with Q(1668)- or Q(1668)- NeoAGL-2 or multitarget vaccine Q(1668)- NeoAGL. Splenocytes of vaccinated mice were collected and stimulated with each corre-sponding NeoAG peptide, or with a combination of the four neoantigenic peptides for the group vaccinated with the multitarget vaccine. The results showed that vaccina-tion with the multitarget vaccine induced significantly increased TNF- production in CD8 + and CD4+ T cells in comparison to mice vaccinated with a single NeoAG (figure 4A,B). Significantly increased production of IFN- in CD8+ T cells but not in CD4+ T cells could also be detected in the group vaccinated with the multitarget vaccine (figure 4C,D). In order to characterize the intratumoral immune response induced by vaccination, we compared tumors from control mice with those after vaccination with the long multitarget peptide vaccine Q(1668)- NeoAGL. The results confirmed that long peptide vaccination can significantly hinder 4T1 tumor growth (p=0.0022) when compared with the control group treated with Q(1668) (figure 4E). T cell density was assessed in each tumor by flow cytometry. We found significantly enhanced intra-tumoral infiltration of CD8 + and CD4+ T cells (p=0.0005 and p=0.0035, respectively) (figure 4F,G), inversely correlating with tumor volume (p=0.0089 and p=0.0079, respectively) (figure 4H,I). Furthermore, we determined the production of IFN- and TNF- by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells after stimulation of T cells with a cocktail of the long peptides. Production of IFN- by specific CD8 + T cells was significantly increased (p=0.0022) (figure 4J). Despite a trend, the difference for TNF- production was not significant, likely related to the high heteroge-neity (figure 4K). When assessing specific CD8+ T cells producing both cytokines, a significant increase was found after long peptide vaccination as compared with control mice (p=0.0022) (figure 4L,M). The results also showed significant increase of IFN- or TNF- produc-tion in specific CD4 + T cells respectively) (figure 4N,O) after long peptide vaccina- tion compared with controls. This was also the case for the specific polyfunctional CD4 + T cells that simultane- ously produced both cytokines (p=0.0022) (figure 4P,Q). Finally, we also studied the effect of vaccination on intratumoral monocytic and granulocytic myeloid cells. Ly6CHi and the CD11bHi Ly6GHi cells were significantly decreased after long peptide vaccination (figure 4R,S ) indicating a decrease in myeloid- suppressor cells Long peptide v accination decreases post-surgical tumor recurrence and lung metastases, and prolongs survivalThe observed efficacy of vaccination with Q(1668)- NeoAGL in vivo promoted us to address whether the vaccine may be useful in a clinically relevant perspec-tive, namely, to prevent tumor progression after surgical resection of the primary tumor. To this end, 1 million 4T1 cells were inoculated in the left flank of the mice. T reat- ment with Q(1668) as a control or with the multitarget vaccine Q(1668)- NeoAGL was initiated 3 days later . Mice received 3 doses over 13 days and primary tumors were surgically resected on day 14, followed by 2 treatment doses weekly (figure 5A). Q(1668)- NeoAGL hindered 4T1 primary tumor progression as shown in figure 5B,C confirming our findings. By IHC, we investigated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration into the primary tumors (figure 5D). We found a significant increase (p=0.0229) in the numbers of peritumoral CD4+ T cells in the group vaccinated with Q(1668)- NeoAGL in comparison to the control group (figure 5E- top). The numbers of intra - tumoral CD4+ T cells were heterogeneous and showed a trend but no significant increase in the group vacci-nated with Q(1668)- NeoAGL (figure 5E , bottom, and online supplemental figure 6). After surgical resection of primary tumors, the weight of mice in the control group remained stable for 10 days (until day 24 of primary tumor inoculation) but started to drop sharply thereafter when all the mice of the control group had to be sacri-ficed at days 39-40 after primary tumor inoculation. The mice vaccinated with the multitarget Q(1668)- NeoAGL showed much less weight loss and remained stable after day 40 (for the surviving mice) (figure 5F). However, the weight loss in some of the immunized mice required that 20% of the mice had to be euthanised on day 42 and 20% on day 48, whereas the remaining 60% of mice continued completely healthy and had stable weight until the end of the experiment on day 66 (figure 5G). We measured the weight of the lungs of euthanised mice to quantify lung metastases. The results reflect extensive 4T1 lung metas-tases in the control group, whereas long peptide vaccina-tion resulted in significantly less lung metastases in the mice that were euthanised due to weight loss, and no lung metastases in the remaining 60% of the mice at the end of on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Analyzing the volume of the primar y tumor and lung weight revealed a significant correlation (p=0.0268) (figure 5J). To assess the role of CD8+ T cells in the effects of vaccination with Q(1668)- NeoAGL, we depleted CD8+ T cells. Three groups of mice were analyzed: a control group treated without tumor antigens (ie, Q(1668) alone), a group which received 3 doses of the multitarget Q(1668)- NeoAGL vaccine over 14 days, and a third group which received the same vaccination plus anti- CD8 monoclonal antibody. Efficient CD8+ T cells depletion of ~99% was confirmed in the third group by flow cytometry (online supplemental figure 5A). The effect of vaccination with Q(1668)- NeoAGL was significantly abrogated in the CD8+ T cell- depleted mice compared with non- depleted ones (p<0.0001) (online supplemental figure 5B). To further study the effect of CD8+ T cells depletion in the different groups, primary tumors were resected on day 14 and mice were followed for ~50 days without any addi- tional vaccination. Our results showed reduced survival in the control group and the CD8 + T cell- depleted mice when compared with the vaccinated group (p=0.0024 and p=0.0008, respectively) (online supplemental figure 5C). Therefore, the beneficial anti- tumor effect of vaccination with Q (1668)- NeoAGL depends on CD8+ T cells. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we developed a universal approach for a personalized cancer vaccine. We found efficient tumor control through activation and functional competence of both CD8 + and CD4+ T cells, associated with reduction of suppressive myeloid cells both in circulation and within tumors. The vaccine was based on the successful identifi-cation of neoantigenic peptides using mass spectrometry- based immunopeptidomics combined with WES and wet- bench validation. The advantage of this experimental approach relies on the fact that it only identifies peptides that are indeed naturally presented by MHC molecules on the sur face of tumor cells, thus avoiding the frequent epitope prediction failures by other techniques that do not rely on the physical identification of peptides. Indeed, our approach has been shown to enrich for NeoAG that are capable of controlling tumors in mice in vivo. 40 To avoid possible outgrowth of tumor escape variants, we produced a multitarget vaccine with four neoantigenic peptides. We synthesized short peptides corresponding to CD8 + T cell epitopes or long peptides, including both CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes. Using the bio- orthogonal Cu- free click chemistry, peptides were coupled to VLPs consisting of recombinant bacteriophage Q protein and loaded with the B- type CpG 1668. The applied chemical coupling has several advantages as compared with other methods such as using SMPH linker .21 SMPH may react with internal cysteine within causing their inac-tivation. Additionally, non- reacted SMPH on VLPs can be toxic and may complicate the Good manufacturing practice (GMP) process, in particular at bedside. Cu- free click chemistr y is a non- toxic method, as the azide group added to the C- terminal end of the synthesized peptides is metabolically stable and lacks any reactivity with other biological functionalities in human cells. Cu- free chem- istry has shown high selectivity in several studies, for example, for imaging, labeling and tracking cells in vivo. 41 42 A key advantage of this method is that it can be applied at the bedside, enabling easy and rapid produc-tion of personalized vaccines for each patient directly where and when needed. The short peptide vaccine significantly hindered tumor progression (p=0.0091) when compared with the antigen negative control vaccine. However, this vaccine did not enhance CD8 + nor CD4+ T cell infiltration into the tumors. Nevertheless, it significantly decreased (p=0.026) circulating MDSCs. The insufficient anti- tumor efficacy of the short peptide vaccine may be due to deficiency in activating CD4 + helper T cells that are often required to support the CD8+ T cells as shown in several studies.8 9 43 44 Indeed, vaccination with elongated peptides (by addition of natural flanking sequences) significantly increased the anti- tumor efficacy (p=0.0001). Additionally, long peptide vaccination elicited stronger T cell responses character - ized by increased percentages of polyfunctional specific CD8 + and CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, long peptide vacci- nation enhanced the infiltration of CD4+ T cells into the tumors. It is known that CD4+ T cells can license DCs via CD40-CD40L interaction, which enhances antigen presentation to and activation of T cells. 45 It may also be possible that CD4+ T cells themselves kill tumor cells.43 46 Probably more important is that tumor growth is inhib-ited by pro- inflammator y milieu generated by the effector cytokines, such as IFN- and TNF-, which are not only released by CD8 + T cells but also by CD4+ T cells. However, despite the dependence on CD4+ T cells, the anti- tumor efficacy remained critically dependent on CD8+ T cells as shown by strongly reduced protection on in vivo deple-tion of CD8 + T cells. There is general agreement that T cell vaccines must become more potent, particularly for the induction of CD8 + T cell responses, in order to increase the likelihood of clinical benefit. However, while CD4+ T cell responses are readily induced by the currently used cancer vaccines (eg, RNA, or free peptides mixed with adjuvants), CD8 + T cell responses induced by the majority of vaccines remain relatively scarce, 4 5 particularly when vaccine antigens must undergo processing and cross- presentation by DCs which is an important but relatively inefficient process. Conversely , the requirement for cross- presentation has the advantage that only DCs present the vaccine's MHC- I antigens to CD8+ T cells, favoring robust T cell priming and boosting, and avoiding tolerance induction.47 Immunosuppressive mechanisms are often responsible for the inefficiency of immunotherapy. Some of those mechanisms may be successfully hindered by therapies that appropriately activate T cell responses. Indeed, our long peptide vaccine led to significant reduction within on September 17, 2023 by guest.

Surgical resection is usually the first step in the clinical management of cancer. Subsequently, residual microtu-mors as well as circulating cancer cells may cause poten-tially lethal recurrence. 49 Immunotherapy is particularly necessary and potentially useful in patients who are at risk for subsequent disease recurrence and progression. Checkpoint blockade is often used in this setting. Alter - natively, or in addition, personalized cancer vaccines may be considered, as they have the potential to activate the immune system more specifically and may thus have a favorable efficacy/toxicity profile, provided that they achieve sufficient anti- tumor effects for providing clin - ical benefit. This can be well addressed in the 4T1 tumor model, because these tumors can spontaneously metas-tasize from primary lesions to lymph nodes, lung, brain and bone, resembling triple- negative stage IV human breast cancer .50 After surgical resection of the primary tumors, we found that our multi- NeoAG vaccine led to reduction of tumor recurrence and metastases formation. Therefore, the use of our vaccine in this setting may be promising. Vaccination alone may be insufficient to achieve satis- factory tumor control 51 calling for combination thera- pies. For example, we and others have shown previously that combining a multitargeting vaccine with anti- CD25 mAb treatment to inhibit regulator y T cells significantly improved the anti- tumor efficacy in challenging mouse tumors.21 52 We envision that combining our new vaccine with anti- CD25 mAb, anti- OX40 mAb and/or check - point inhibitors may further improve therapy efficacy. The identification of patient- individual NeoAG remains challenging but is technically feasible.27 53 Together, our approach represents a further step making the vision of personalized cancer vaccines more realistic. Clinical development is encouraged because the vaccine induces efficient anti- tumor responses and is practically feasible as it can be formulated at bedside and may , therefore, be broadly applied.
