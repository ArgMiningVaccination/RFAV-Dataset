The new study, published in Gut Microbes, indicated that the probiotic increased SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres in healthy volunteers when 28 days or more had elapsed from vaccination, thereby suggesting that probiotic supplementation may enhance the long-term protection against breakthrough infections. \"To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on different SARS-CoV-2 antibody classes, including virus neutralising antibodies in an antibody-na\u00efve cohort,\" said Robert Brummer, professor of gastroenterology and clinical nutrition and director of the Nutrition-Gut-Brain Interactions Research Centre at \u00d6rebro University in Sweden, where the study was performed. Study details The study included 159 healthy adults without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. The participants consumed either BioGaia Protectis (Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, 100 million CFU twice per day) + vitamin D3 (10 micrograms twice per day), or a placebo product that contained only vitamin D3 for 6 months. During the intervention period, 12 subjects were infected, and 17 were fully vaccinated and sampled 28 days or more postvaccination, said the researchers. Upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, the researchers found that the probiotic group had statistically non-significant increase in serum anti-S and anti-RBD IgG titers. In addition, in the subgroup of fully vaccinated individuals with more than 28 days postvaccination, the probiotic-receiving participants had statistically significantly higher anti-RBD IgA levels, compared to people in the placebo group. \"To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effects of probiotic supplementation on different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody classes, including virus-neutralizing antibodies, throughout the whole seroconversion event,\" wrote the researchers. \"Overall, these findings would suggest that L. reuteri DSM 17938 supplementation might increase the long-term efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against breakthrough infections via enhanced IgA response after vaccination,\" they added. \"This potentially could have considerable benefits for at-risk individuals and for the prevention of community outbreaks. However, as our study was not designed to investigate this question, this hypothesis should be tested in a larger cohort with fixed sampling times and a controlled postvaccination observational period.\" Source: Gut Microbes Volume 15, 2023 [10.1080/19490976.2023.2229938](https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2023.2229938) \"Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 supplementation trial\" Authors: R.A.
