Pickpockets often target tourists in public buses. If travelling by public bus: - keep your ID and valuables with you - avoid placing your bags in the overhead compartment or under your seat - avoid sleeping Police checks of passengers on public transportation also occur. Officers often use those checks to determine if foreigners have overstayed the 90-day visa exemption period. Always carry your proof of legal stay on your person. Taxis Official taxis are safe. They are orange at the airport and red with a yellow triangle on the side elsewhere in the country. - Use official taxis only booked ahead of time - Never board taxis at taxi stands or flag taxis in the street - Note the driver's name and plate number - Make sure the driver uses the meter - Never use shared taxis Air travel We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.

There is no vaccine available for Chagas disease. Animal precautions Some infections, such as [rabies](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/diseases/rabies) and influenza, can be shared between humans and animals.

During this period, even small tropical storms can quickly develop into major hurricanes. These severe storms can put you at risk and hamper the provision of essential services. If you decide to travel to a coastal area during the hurricane season: - know that you expose yourself to serious safety risks - be prepared to change your travel plans on short notice, including cutting short or cancelling your trip - stay informed of the latest regional weather forecasts - carry emergency contact information for your airline or tour operator - follow the advice and instructions of local authorities Useful links [Tornadoes, cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons and monsoons](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/hurricanes-typhoons-cyclones-monsoons ) [Large-scale emergencies abroad](https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/large-scale-emergencies-abroad) storm tracking and hurricane watches and warnings](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)- United States' National Hurricane Center Flooding The rainy season extends from May to November, sometimes January. Torrential rains and landslides occur frequently in the lowlands and mountainous areas along the Caribbean and in the Central Valley. Seasonal flooding often causes power outages. It can also hamper overland travel and reduce the delivery of other essential services. Roads may become impassable and bridges damaged. Earthquakes and tsunamis Costa Rica is located in an active seismic zone. Earthquakes and tremors occur regularly. Tsunamis are possible. A tsunami can occur within minutes of a nearby earthquake. However, the risk of tsunami can remain for several hours following the first tremor. If you're staying on the coast, familiarize yourself with the region's evacuation plans in the event of a tsunami warning. Volcanoes There are several active and potentially active volcanoes in the country, including: - Arenal - Po\u00e1s - Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja - Turrialba Eruptions may occur at any time. They sometimes lead to evacuations of surrounding areas on short notice. In the event of an earthquake or volcanic eruption: - pay careful attention to all warnings issued for national parks - monitor local media to stay informed of the evolving situation - follow the instructions of local authorities, including evacuation orders Useful links [Earthquakes](https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/rthqks-wtd/index-en.aspx)- What to Do?
