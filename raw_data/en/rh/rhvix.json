They're bound to make the occasion extra special, but not if they're spotty or caked with grime. Don't be nervous about washing these gorgeous but delicate glasses\u2014with this information from the cleaning experts at Molly Maid, you'll learn the best way to clean crystal. We'll also explain how to remove existing cloudiness and waxy residue, so the stemware gleams and shines during your upcoming holiday dinners. How to Clean Crystal Most crystal isn't dishwasher safe. If you're not sure about your glasses, err on the side of caution and wash them by hand. Follow these steps before using crystal stemware for the first time this year, as well as after each use throughout the holiday season: - Fill a sink basin or large plastic bowl with room-temperature water, a few squirts of mild dish soap, and two cups of white vinegar. - If washing in the sink, line the bottom of the basin with a soft cotton towel to protect the glasses. - Soak your stemware for about a minute. Then, gently wipe with a microfiber cloth if needed. - Rinse with tap water and dry immediately with a clean, lint-free towel to prevent spotting. - Store the stemware in a safe, enclosed location. How to Remove Water Spots from Crystal If your crystal glasses cloud up because of hard water residue, they won't create the wow-factor you're going for at your holiday meal. Produce flawless crystal and impress your guests by following these tips: - Warm two cups of vinegar in the microwave for two minutes. - Pour the vinegar into a plastic bowl and submerge the glasses inside. Soak for three minutes. - Remove the glasses from the vinegar and dry with a lint-free towel. - If any stubborn spots remain, dampen your finger and dip it in baking soda, toothpaste, or denture cleaner. Then, buff the spots away. - Rinse thoroughly and dry one more time to reveal a spotless shine. How to Polish Away Stubborn Residue If it's been a few seasons since the last time you used your crystal glasses, years of dust and grime may have settled on the surface. Removing this residue may require a stronger method. Here's what to try if a vinegar bath alone isn't enough: - Create a paste of \u00bd teaspoon salt and white vinegar. - Gently rub the surface of your crystal stemware, and let the paste sit for 10 minutes to dissolve hard residue. - Meanwhile, fill a plastic bin with warm water and one teaspoon baking soda. - Set the glasses in the water and pour white vinegar over them. The baking soda in the water will react with the vinegar, making it bubble and fizz. This chemical reaction should dislodge the grime clinging to the crystal. - Rinse the glasses and dry with a lint-free cloth to unveil the renewed beauty of your crystal stemware.
