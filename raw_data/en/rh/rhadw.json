Yes, it's calculable: The mass of all life forms on Earth - humans, animals, bacteria, fungi, even viruses. Scien tists have developed sophisticated ways to do the math. They arrived at the figure of one teraton as the dry weight of the biomass; that's a 1 with 12 zeros. The researchers say the weight of life appears to remain constant, but the composition of the biomass is undergoing rapid change. Human intervention is knocking our world off balance. 264951 004Can Algorithms Make Us Healthy? Big Data is the motor of our age. Inevitably, it is also being applied to healthcare. After all, the human body harbors no end of data: in cells, in DNA, in pro teins. In fact, the sheer volume of data is too large to be used for our health management. That's why scientists are working on algorithms aimed at helping us to better understand our bodies. The result could be a medical avatar for each and every person - an artificial-intelligence application that keeps a close eye on all our physical data and warns us when something's not right. 264951 005 Can We Dig Our Way Through the Earth? We have a pretty good understanding of the universe these days. But when it comes to the ground beneath our feet, the further down we try to look, the less we see. Ground exploration is expensive and technically challenging. But scientists have nevertheless managed to tease considerable insights from the stone and ice, the archive of our Earth. And now, researchers plan to go deeper than ever before: with the help of a powerful drilling vessel, they hope to penetrate the oceanic crust - and reach the Earth's mantle for the very first time. 264951 006What do Animals Talk About? Although we humans speak many different languages, we have always found ways to communicate with each other. In the old days with dictionaries, nowa- days with translation apps. What if there was an app to translate animal noises? Something to help us interpret the neighing of a horse, the trumpeting of an elephant and the mewing of a cat? Researchers say that the vocal language of animals is a window on their soul. If we can learn to decipher it, perhaps we might gain a deeper understanding of animals - and be better at protecting them too. 264951 007 Can Geoengineering Save the Climate?CO 2 emissions are heating up the planet and stoking climate change. It is so advanced that it cannot be halted through changes in individual behavior. What possible solutions are there? The science of geoengineering is developing and testing processes that could help us to slow and alleviate the impact of global warming. But they too come with their own set of consequences. How can geoengineering help us and, if it is to be effective, what are the prerequisites? 264951 008How is Migration Impacting Our World? There are many factors driving migration. Some of these are likely to be exacerbated in the future. For example, technological developments that oust people from the workplace, as well as demographic changes and economic crises that force people to seek employment elsewhere. And then, of course, there is climate change. Global interconnectedness also contributes to migration. It can rock political systems and has an economic impact. We look beyond the myths about migration and ask: Whom does it really benefit? 264951 009Could We Live on the Moon?\"That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" said astronaut Neil Armstrong, who in 1969 became the first man to set foot on the Moon. Half a century later, plans are afoot, involving several nations, to launch new missions to the moon. The goal now is for people to spend longer periods of time there. The question is how to make use of resources found on the Moon. Scientists are exploring ideas about how life on the Moon might be made possible with the help of sunlight, ice water and lunar dust.264951 010A World Without Slime?Many children are told that slime is disgusting - and continue to think that as adults. But scientists say slime has amazing qualities and is essential for life. Slime can slide and stick, close and open. It can trap and confuse pathogens. Slime has a particular physical state: it's a non-Newtonian fluid. And therein lies its secret. Researchers are exploring the capabilities of the slippery substances that are found throughout the natural world. 264951 011Is Cryptocurrency the Better Money?Cryptocurrencies have been sending shockwaves through the financial sector since their introduction. They have made some people millionaires and bankrupted others. What's the technology behind cryptos? Do Bitcoin & Co. have any advantages over traditional money? Why do they worry many economists? Red flags include extreme price fluctuations and the voracious energy consumption involved in crypto mining. Crypto advocates believe the new kind of money is here to stay. Whoever might be right, cryptocurrencies have triggered an intense debate about the nature of money and central banks. 264951 012Are Computers Prejudiced?Who gets the job? Who gets the loan? And who has to go to jail? Decisions on such questions are made by people, who can be swayed by bias. If these decisions were entrusted to artificial intelligence, would that guarantee neutrality? AI systems are already used in sensitive areas of this kind. But can we be sure that these systems are working without discrimination? Or are we expecting too much from computers? Could one even teach them moral conduct?

Moreover, our brain has a very close relationship with the objects that our hands touch or shape. Our ideas concerning our surroundings, separating the important from the unimportant, derive to a great extent from such hands-on experiences. Nowadays, however, many people spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer. Are we demanding too little of our brains? Documentary, 30 min., 2022, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264762 022 The Evil Within - Are We Natural Born Killers? Psychopaths can carry out gruesome acts without feeling sympathy or regret. There is evidence that genetic factors may have a role to play in such behavior. Recent research, however, has shown that many people with this predisposition never become violent. In other cases, the propensity for violence seems to lessen in middle-age and the capacity for remorse sets in. Some scientists say the capacity for lethal violence derives from our evolutionary past. Documentary, 30 min., 2022, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish; VoD, M, IFE, LR 264762 023 The Power of Gentle Touch Neuroscientific studies in recent years show that the human brain's response to gentle touch is surprisingly strong. It releases important messenger chemicals that boost a sense of psychophysical well-being. Your brain can tell if you're doing the touching or if someone else is. Touching ourselves, for example stroking an injured part of our body, can ease pain and even alleviate stress. The touch of others can strengthen social bonds and give us a sense of belonging. Crucial for these processes are special nerve cells with a hotline to the brain via the spinal cord neural circuit.

They've been corroding in the water for more than 75 years, all the while turning into ticking time bombs: scientists believe they contain up to 15 million tons of toxic oil. They pose a huge threat to beaches around the former wartime sites, endangering both biodiversity and tourism. It would be technically possible to pump out the oil - but difficult and expensive. The problem is mostly ignored, even though many of the sunken ships are already leaking oil. Experts warn that the wrecks are entering a critical phase: after corroding for so long in salty water, the slightest impact could be enough to breach their steel hulls.

But since the 1990s, the law stipulates that the right of a coastal nation to explore and exploit the sea's natural resources depends on the size of its continental shelf. Now, many countries are going all out to maximize their share of seas. They commission geologists, cartographers and biologists to deter- mine the size of their continental shelf in an opaque process with no channels for appeal.

Now physicist Ferenc Krausz has broken a new barrier. He's first to produce an attosecond pulse. An attosecond is an unimaginable 0.000 000 000 000 000 001 of a second long. The technique that Krausz used is based on Einstein's prediction of stimulated emission. The great physicist's hypothesis helped lay the foundations for the development of that incredibly versatile tool - the laser. 124665 006Juggling Ultra-Cold Atoms Though he's just 32 years old, Immanuel Bloch is already a professor of physics at the University of Mainz. He's an expert on a state of matter that was predicted by Albert Einstein - Bose-Einstein condensation. Immanuel Bloch has now taken things a step further. He has become the first to crack the Bose-Einstein condensation wave and regularly arrange several hundred of these special atoms into a glowing grid. In the future, grids like these could make up the basic elements of a new kind of supercomputer. 124665 007Cloned Atoms Through Teleportation For the first time ever, Rainer Blatt was able to transfer the state of one atom to another. Although the process is called 'teleportation', no matter is transported from one spot to another. Instead, information leaps the gap. To achieve his goal, Blatt made use of what Albert Einstein described as the 'spooky action-at-a-distance between particles'. The discovery is a scientific sensation, even though the teleporting distances crossed up until now have only been a few hundredths of a millimeter.124665 001Nuclear Medicine: A Formula and its Results When an atom in a radioactive element decays, then part of the matter that makes up its nucleus is transformed into energy. This is part of the proof that backs up Einstein's realization that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. Without Einstein's discovery that is expressed in the formula E=mc\u00b2, some later medical developments would not have been possible. Artificially produced radioactive substances known as radiopharmaceuticals play a major role in modern medical diagnostics and research. 124665 002Satellite Navigation - Einstein's Contribution to Galileo Time is relative - in the field of satellite navigation, Einstein's theory has practical applications.

European researchers now want to conduct an experiment in space to find out. 124665 004The Speed of Light - Part 2: Radar Satellite The speed of light also standardizes the exact length of a meter. That's important for large-scale surveys like those slated to be carried out by the radar satellite TerraSAR-X.

As early as 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen recognized that relativity theory did not rule out 'bridges' through space-time. Today, we call these hypothetical pathways 'wormholes'. Physicists nowadays admit that time travel through wormholes is at least theoretically possible, although journeys into the past or future have remained firmly in the realm of science fiction. 124665 008Cosmic Telescopes: Discovering Distant Galaxies According to a theory first put forward by Albert Einstein, a large body of mass curves space and the light that traverses it. Clusters of galaxies create what are known as gravitational lenses. Astrophysicist Joachim Wambsgan\u00df has spent years studying this phenomena in deep space. He searches and maps massive celestial objects such as galaxies that possess strong gravitational fields. These curve or bend the space around them, and force light from even more distant galaxies and objects into a curved rather than a straight trajec- tory. The process also 'bundles' the light, focusing and increasing its intensity. 124665 009Racing down Einstein's Paths Molecules in gas and fluids tend to behave in unor- dered and random ways. This phenomenon, first identified by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown and therefore named Brownian Motion, was also of great interest to Albert Einstein. In 1905, he published his studies on Brownian Motion. Today, his findings can help researchers solve many of the problems linked to the movement of particles. 124665 010Organic Solar Cells What a pain: the cell phone has to be charged at the mains every few days.

The body's own immune system is stimu- lated with what are known as checkpoint inhibitors in such a way that it attacks tumor cells more aggressively. As a result, even patients thought to be no-hope cases are given a realistic chance of survival. In other cases, the disease is at least temporarily kept in check.

The impact and the downsides make familiar reading: workforces in low-wage countries are exploited; production and shipping require astronomical amounts of water and energy, leaving a large carbon footprint; and 62 million tons of clothing are cleared out of the world's wardrobes every year - 80% of which ends up in landfill. The Slow Fashion movement aims to counter this trend, and it's finding more and more adherents. The movement encourages consumers to buy fewer, high-quality garments and aims to come up with some new ideas - for fashion with a future.

The non-profit organization allows companies that manufacture environmentally-sound forest products, primarily wood and its derivatives such as furniture and paper, to mark their goods with the FSC seal of approval. The seal is intended to reassure consumers that they can buy the products with a good conscience. But critics say the certifica - tion scheme is failing. For example, the seal is being used by companies processing illegally logged wood from primeval forests. A quarter of a century after the FSC was founded, virgin forests are still rapidly disappearing and indigenous communities continue to be displaced.

After all, farming and industry supply chains often leave much to be desired. Increasingly, savvy consumers are reaching for organic eggs, fair-trade chocolate or clothing that's produced without child labor. In response, more companies now claim sustainable, climate-neutral credentials and say they're striving to improve the working conditions of all those involved in the manufacture of their products. More and more of us are ready to pay more for goods backed by such pledges. But can we believe all the promises?

But this color allocation is neither natural nor traditional. It's actually an expression of a growing phenomenon: gender marketing. This is aimed at selling more products by dividing the market. As well as cementing gender clich\u00e9s, gender marketing also means women often end up paying more than men for products of similar value. The most extreme examples can be found in the fashion and cosmetics industries, but price differences even extend to toys and services such as haircuts. It's been dubbed the 'pink tax' - but does it have anything to do with our societal norms? And what can consumers do about it?

These humble beginnings in the German city of Jena were the foundation of the Zeiss technology company, which today operates worldwide. The production of glass with game-changing optical properties was one of the developments that helped Carl Zeiss create a company that valued scientific research highly, while never forgetting science's social impact. Zeiss microscopes have been used by more than 30 Nobel Prize winners. To this day, these instruments offer unrivaled image resolution, with lenses that can display structures one thousand times smaller than a human hair. Light microscopes allow living cells to be examined with extreme gentleness and speed. The Zeiss company was involved in the moon landing in 1969, and thus helped redefine the limits of what humans are capable of. Images of the historic event were captured using Zeiss camera lenses developed specially for space. These lenses were key to the later development of photolithography, which plays a decisive role in the production of microchips. Developments in extreme ultraviolet lithography led to Zeiss winning the German Future Prize together with the Fraunhofer Institute and the Trumpf company. The DW documentary delves into history of the Zeiss company and also examines current developments in the photonics sector, in which the firm is a key player.064953 Documentary, 01 x 30 min.,2022, HD; Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE \u00a9 picture allianceAGRICULTURE Farming for the Planet Agriculture is under pressure to feed a burgeoning global population. And it has undergone dramatic developments in this regard over the last 100 years. But increasing industrialization of the sector has negative consequences: it burdens the environment and replaces manpower with technology, providing fewer people with a livelihood. If these developments continue unchecked, then before long the food we eat will be controlled by large corporations, and food markets will be geared towards short-term profit - at the expense of non-renewable resources such as land and water, at the expense of the rural population and biodiversity. But this is not the only way forward. Sustainable agricultural approaches and an efficient smallholding economy can in the long term create equilibrium between food security and the utilization of natural resources.

In order to enable the Sikhs from India to make a pilgrimage to one of their holiest shrines, a \"peace corridor\" has been opened between the two countries. Sikhs constitute the fourth largest religious community in India, but find themselves are caught between India and Pakistan, between Hindus and Muslims. The majority of Sikhs worldwide live on the Indian subcontinent. The hostile relations between India and Pakistan since partition in 1947 meant that for decades Sikhs were unable to visit their holiest shrine. Despite ongoing political tensions - especially concerning Kashmir - 73 years after their separation, India and Pakistan have fulfilled a promise that was made 20 years ago: on the occasion of the 550th birthday of the founder of their religion, Sikhs in India can now use a new border crossing to make a pilgrimage to the mausoleum of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan - four kilometers behind the border. The Kartarpur Corridor was opened on schedule by the prime ministers of the two countries - albeit not in a joint ceremony. Both spoke of a new \"Peace Corridor\". The opening of the corridor on 9 November 2019, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, was no coincidence; Indian prime minister Narendra Modi directly compared the two historic events.

So far, 23 objects have been returned to Namibia, although only on loan. The renowned Namibian fashion and costume designer Cynthia Schimming, who was also involved in the project, has called for the works to be returned unconditionally. Many have asked that the same be done with the Benin Bronzes, some of the most renowned and controversial pieces in the Berlin collection. These masterpieces, which once adorned the royal palace in the Kingdom of Benin (in present-day Nigeria), were plundered by British troops as part of a punitive expedition in 1897. They were then sold on the international art market; many ended up in various European museums. They have become a touchstone for whether the Humboldt Forum will really break new ground and dare to enter into a cultural exchange on a level playing field. It was recently decided that part of the collection would be restitu ted, but some of the Benin Bronzes will be displayed at the Humboldt Forum. The question is how to do this appropriately. For Jonathan Fine, ethnological museums today need to make it clear that Europe's history is closely intertwined with colonialism: \"I think it would be a success if we take the idea of a forum at its word and think of the Humboldt Forum, not as a place that will give us answers to our questions, but will enable us to pose questions about the past and the present and to bring in more voices, wider voices and different perspectives on what those questions mean. Only in that way, I think, can we come to an understanding and find answers for ourselves about what 500 years of European colonization has meant for the world we live in.\" The Humboldt Forum in the capital Berlin is Germany's biggest cultural project. Intended as a place of dialogue, it houses exhibitions on the history of the German capital, as well as the Ethnological Museum and the Museum of Asian Art. And indeed, the ethnological collections have been the focus of many controversial debates. Many of the objects, acquired during the colonial period, are tainted with blood. What does this mean for the Humboldt Forum exhibitions? How should such works be dealt with generally? Amidst the contro- versy surrounding looted art, the discussion about provenance research and how to curate sensitive exhibitions, we joined the head of the Ethnological Museum, Jonathan Fine, at his workplace in Berlin and on an earlier trip to Cameroon. In 2017, Fine conducted research into one of the collection's most impressive objects, a royal throne from the Kingdom of Bamum. He was searching for answers: How did it come to be in Germany? Was it a diplomatic gift to the German Kaiser or a forced gesture of submission? Is it a case for restitution? If it were up to Cameroonian curator and art critic Bonaventure Ndikung, Germany would have to present Cameroon with an important artwork in return - as a true act of diplomacy. Another research project explores Germany's colonial past in Namibia. Official German acknowl- edgement of the Herero genocide didn't come until 2016. Many treasures looted during the colonial period are still in German museum collections. As part of the provenance project, researchers looked at the history, significance and artistic potential of 1,400 objects from Berlin's collections in cooperation with the Museums Association of Namibia. 364947 Documentary, 01 x 30 min.,2021, HD;Arabic, English, German, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFE WORLD ISSUES Stolen Soul Africa's Looted Art European museums 01 x 45 min., 2020, HD; Arabic, English, Spanish WW, VoD, M, IFEWORLD ISSUES 884903 Documentary, 01 x 45 min.,2018, HD;Arabic, English, d'etatin1973,andlivedinexilein WestGermany.A/f_ter the Escape Finding a Home in a Foreign Land WORLD ISSUES 864843 Documentary, 06 x 30 min.,2015, HD;English WW, VoD, Buthehasnochoicebuttokeepgoing.

Governments in war-weary Europe and the US continued to give credence to assertions by Reich Chancellor Hitler that he was committed to peace, and were slow to pay heed to his real aims as set out in the book.

To do this, the government in Washington turned to the movies. As a result, the Hollywood dream factory, focused on entertainment and profit, became a patriotic institution.

It was incumbent upon the German commander of the city, General Dietrich von Choltitz, to carry out this order. He had already played a role in the extermination of the Jews in eastern Europe. Nevertheless, he defied the orders of the F\u00fchrer, and became known as the Nazi general who spared Paris. But what do the facts tell us? Did von Choltitz have the military resources to carry out destruction on such a massive scale? Was his decision ethically motivated, or did he just want to save his own skin before the arrival of the Allied forces?

The annihilation of those they deemed inferior was just as much part of the grand plan as the establishment of homes for the birth and post-natal care of \"racially valuable\" and \"genetically healthy\" children, some of them the product of extramarital relationships between women and members of the SS. These children would be taken away from their parents and raised by families who were adherents of Nazism. The long-term goal was the formation of a kind of Nazi elite. The homes were run by an association called \"Lebensborn\", or \"Fount of Life\". More than 20,000 \"Lebensborn\" children were born in Germany and other European nations between 1936 and the end of the war. Their fate bears tragic witness to the Nazis' inhumane ideology.

The computer animation connects the dots - making the perils of the border region visible. For the first time, historians and television producers have created a detailed reconstruction of the no-man's land as it looked at the start of the 1980s, including new views of the border fortifications.

For a long time, many of the wrecks have been out of our reach, but with the help of modern deep-sea robots and hi-tech locating technology, their treasures are now within our grasp. But to whom do they belong? The finder? The country that owns the waters where the ship was discovered? The home nation of the original ship owner? Or UNESCO?

The discovery of his grave proved sensational because of the magnificent treasures buried with him. These included a chariot, gold jewelry and decorated banquet utensils. Some of the burial objects were of Greek and Etruscan origin, which means they must have been transported thousands of kilometers before being buried alongside the dead man.

It's hard to imagine humans ever settling in such an inhospitable place. But around five thousand years ago in today's Oman, people lived in the desert's few oases. Who were they? How did they adapt to the increasing aridity? The archeological excavation of a monumental tower in Salut tells us a great deal about their water management system. And finds from the Mudhmar temple complex show that water was also a key element in pre-Islamic ritual practices.

This makes it difficult to study their beliefs and practices, allowing plenty of scope for myths about mistletoe, magic potions and human sacrifice. Archeologists began a thorough investigation of the Celtic priests' status, roles and actions just a few years ago. Their insights challenge the portrayal of the Druids in popular culture as bearded wise men in white robes cutting down mistletoe with a golden sickle. Archeological finds in Europe paint a different picture and even suggest that Druids weren't just men.

Once the victims' bodies had rotted away, all that remained in most cases were cavities in human form. In the 19th century, archeologists filled these cavities with plaster, then chipped away the surrounding volcanic material, to create chilling \"sculptures\" of people at the very moment of death. But time has taken its toll on the casts and now researchers are looking to modern technology to preserve them. Ancient skeletons have also been found, and archeologists are taking samples of DNA, which they hope will reveal new information about the residents of ancient Pompeii.

Nicholas was said to have performed many miracles. After his death, his remains were taken to Italy and France. He became known as a protector of children and the patron saint of several European cities. As legend would have it, every year on December 6 he would take to the streets and give out presents and sweets to well-behaved children. The Dutch called him Sinter Klaas, and emigrants from The Netherlands took his story with them to America. In the 19th century, a group of writers and artists in New York City created the modern Father Christmas: a jolly, rotund old man with a white beard and a red coat who comes down the chimney with a bag of gifts. And this is how most of the world knows him today: An icon of pop culture and hero of consumerism.

With the Eternal City sweltering in temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius this summer it wasn't always \"cool.\" But nothing could stop these kids. 564675 120 Coffee - The Good, the Bad, Fair TradeMore than even beer, coffee is the most popular drink in Germany. Every German drinks about 300 liters of it a year. Many of them try to square enjoyment with a clear conscience by buying fair trade coffee. It costs more than normal coffee but the \"Fairtrade\" seal means that farmers in Africa or Latin America receive a greater share of sale proceeds than they would from normal coffee companies.564675 121Theologian, Archaeologist, Maverick - Dieter Vieweger Dieter Vieweger is a Lutheran theologian and an archaeologist. He has been Director-General of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology in Jerusalem since 2005.

Aged 22, his daughter, Meike, died of leukemia. He preached at the memorial service for the victims of the crowd disaster at the 2010 Love Parade in Duisburg. Then his wife was diagnosed with cancer. 564675 123 NoonSong - Concert and Church Service in BerlinNoonSong has been called \"thirty minutes of heaven.\" A choral concert, but also a church service. Thirty minutes of sacred music. Each NoonSong is unique. Every Saturday, it features beautiful a cappella singing selected from centuries of Christian music. The choral ensemble 'sirventes berlin', which includes some of Berlin's finest professional singers, performs at these events. 564675 124Building a Church - Catholics in CubaTwenty years ago, Pope John Paul II visited Cuba. He was the very first pontiff to do so in the island's history and his visit marked a thaw in the Communist regime's relations with the Vatican. In the optimism those days ushered in, the small Catholic parish in Guiteras, a suburb of Havana, planned to build a church. But it never got off the drawing board. Not until Pope Francis reignited the community's hopes and aspirations when he visited in 2015. PEOPLE564675 125 The Miracle of Flores - The World's Largest SeminaryThe churches of Europe are pretty empty generally. But in Indonesia, with its mainly Muslim population, Christian seminaries are overwhelmed with appli - cants. On a hill in the middle of the jungle on the island of Flores lies the world's largest seminary. More than 1000 students study at Ledalero, and at least 600 of them are candidates for the priesthood. 564675 126Provost in Jerusalem - A Lutheran in the Holy LandEmissary, pastor and director: Life in the Holy Land is a life full of tension for Wolfgang Schmidt - invigorating, but also exhausting.

Her mission is to serve more than 1,000 isolated communities along the world's longest river - villages where there is no hospital and no doctor. 564675 128Silent is the Grave - The Changing Landscape of German Cemeteries Burial sites in all cultures speak loudly of the prevai - ling values and beliefs of the societies that design them. Germany's cemetery culture is unique. But it is currently changing. Many Germans are no longer choosing the time-honored cemetery for their final resting place; more and more people are seeking alternatives to the traditional family grave. 564675 129 Helping People Help Themselves - 50 Years of Kolping International It started half a century ago with a campaign to provide vocational training for young Brazilians. Today the Catholic social services association Kolping International is a worldwide network with some 400,000 members in more than 60 countries. 564675 130 The Female Peacemakers - 50 Years of \"Religions for Peace\" Religions for Peace (RfP) is an association of people representing members of diverse religions in more than 100 countries.

This is Poland today - a country that had been crushed by Nazi Germany; its Jewish population almost entirely exterminated in Auschwitz-Birkenau and lesser-known German concentration camps. The revival of Jewish life here is little short of a miracle. 564675 132Oberammergau Passion Play - The Plague and Covid-19 The history of the Oberammergau Passion Play reaches back to the seventeenth century, when a plague known as the Black Death swept through Europe. In 1633 the residents of this Bavarian village vowed to present a play depicting the suffering and death of Jesus Christ every ten years if they were spared extinction. Oberammergau has kept its word for more than 400 years. But in the end, the village that the plague made famous had to bow to the corona pandemic. Bowed but not broken, the villa- gers are determined to fulfil their vow and stage the Oberammergau Passion Play in 2022. 564675 133 Religious Resistance - Christians Against Far-Right Vigilantes A vigilante group calling itself \"First Class Crew - Steele Boys\" takes over the streets of Steele each week, a suburb of Essen in western Germany. Sometimes the vigilantes are twenty-strong; other times as many as one hundred. Most of them are Rockers or Rowdies, and their presence strikes fear into the hearts of law-abiding residents. Steele is not even a dangerous area; the crime rate has been dropping steadily over the past ten years. But now these so-called militias have also started threatening anybody opposed to them - on the Internet and in public. For they are being met with courageous opposition from a counter-group calling itself \"Steele Stays Mixed.\" Residents, churches, clubs, political parties and unions have united to protest either in silent marches or with singing against the far-right.

The two female pastors from Eime, in the state of Lower Saxony, are a same-sex couple. With their Youtube channel \"Anders Amen,\" which roughly translates as \"Different, amen,\" they've always been controversial ministers. Their aim is to reconcile LGBTQ people and the church. 564675 137Eco-Friendly Monks - Plankstetten's Green AbbeyRunning a monastery these days includes having good business sense.

The parish priest, Father Franz Meurer, views building community as his top priority. Not just in the Church but in daily life. He has established a second-hand clothing store, a furniture and bicycle warehouse and a food bank - all open to everybody. 564675 139The Artist Who Saves ChurchesThe artist Moritz G\u00f6tze grew up in East Germany, in an atheistic environment. However, shortly after the collapse of communism in 1989 he helped turn a church ruin into a cultural center and conserved what was left of the historic building. 564675 140New Life in Old Walls - Village Churches Bearing Witness to History Anyone driving through eastern Germany may be surprised by the number of old churches east of the River Elbe. Almost every small village has one. Many of them are fieldstone churches built more than 800 years ago. 564675 141 New Light in old Walls - Windows for Tholey AbbeyThe small village of Tholey in southwestern Germany is home to the oldest monastery on German soil. Founded in the seventh century, the Abbey of St Mau- rice was plundered and badly damaged 1000 years later during the wars of the French Revolution, and only re-established in 1949. But local philanthropists have breathed new life into the old walls. The renova- tions carried out between 2008 and 2021 could make Tholey Abbey an international tourist destination. The highlight of the extensive works are the stained glass windows for the north and south aisles of the abbey church by Afghanistan-born artist Mahbuba Maqsoo- di, who lives and works in Munich, and the three choir windows designed by Germany's most famous living artist, Gerhard Richter. The art establishment are calling this the most significant project of its kind on the continent of Europe. 564675 134The Cup and the Covenant - Wine and CatholicismWine has been part of civilization for more than six thousand years. On religious holidays and on the Sabbath Jews pronounce a blessing over cups of wine. For the ancient Greeks and Romans wine also had symbolic significance; it was poured out in libations to the gods. The Book of Genesis names Noah as the first winegrower. After rescuing humans and animals during the Great Flood he is said to have planted the first vines on Earth. The parables that Jesus of Nazareth told are full of references to vineyards, grapevines and wine. The Catholic Mass, a religious commemoration of Jesus' death and resurrection, is based on his actions during the Last Supper, when the savior is said to have taken wine, blessed it, and given the cup to his disciples saying, \"Take this all of you and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant ...\" In this report we take a look at the cultural and spiritual significance of wine in the Catholic tradition. 564675 135Repaying the Desert - An Unusual Environmental Project In their quest to get close to nature two German women have made two fourteen-day tours into the Sahara.

Now they want to repay the Sahara. Together with 15 other desert enthu - siasts they are planting a palm grove in Morocco. PEOPLE564675 142 The Quest for Utopia - Grassroots Democracy in Venezuela The Cecosesola Cooperative Federation grew out of a practical necessity. Some fifty years ago, when a co-op member died, the other members foun - ded a funeral home. Cecosesola now comprises a federation of more than fifty cooperatives, mainly providing food and medical services to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. All 1,300 staff draw the same salary, and they reach their decisions by consensus without any hierarchical structure. The federation has no fewer than 23,000 active members in western Venezuela. They produce fruit and vege - tables in their regions and run wholesale markets. In addition, they treat many hundreds of patients in their clinics and provide midwifery services. 564675 143Church in the Living Room - Hoodie Ousts Cassock Max Bode and Chris Schlicht had envisioned Chris - tian ministry rather differently. These rookie pastors wanted to revamp the Lutheran liturgy: A sofa replacing the altar, a hoodie the cassock, and techno music the traditional organ-worship in the guise of a party. Corona put an end to their plans. But the two young ecclesiastical rebels from Bremerhaven rose to the challenge. With sensitivity and love they are transforming Church tradition in their town.564675 144 Heavenly Sounds - The Organ and its Fascinating Versatility No other country has as many organs as Germany. Of the organs in the country, 40,000 are church organs. The German Music Council declared the organ the \"Instrument of the Year\" for 2021. This film features the sounds of selected organs from all over Germany: from the oldest church organ in the world, located in Ost\u00f6nnen, Westphalia; to Berlin Cathedral's Late Romantic organ; to a flagship of contemporary organ construction, the organ of St. Martin's Church in Kassel. 564675 145 The Neinstedt Foundation - Love at Devil's WallThe Neinstedt Foundation provides education and support, accommodation and life opportunities, work and counselling, as well as practical care for people with disabilities.

Almost immediately the new Pope set about reforming the Vatican, vowed to confront and root out child abuse in the Catholic Church, raised his voice in support of climate activists and sought dialogue with other religions. 564675 147Bach's Successor - The Thomaners' New ConductorThe Swiss conductor Andreas Reize is the latest musician to join the Thomanerchor's prestigious list of choirmasters. He's the 18th musician to hold this post since Johann Sebastian Bach trained the famous Leipzig boys' choir between 1723 and 1750. The choir's main function is to sing at St Thomas' Church, Leipzig. However the greatest innovation is that for the first time since the Reformation a Catholic is conducting the choir in this famous German Lutheran church. In this report we sit in on the new conductor's first rehearsals and performances. We also take a look behind the scenes - at the life of the boy choristers. 564675 148Church Bells - Chimes between Heaven and EarthOften hidden from view, but impossible to ignore, church bells ring out from towering belfries. For centuries they have given a rhythm to human activity. Even today their unmistakable tolling summons people to prayer and to worship. More than any other artefact the church bell has become associated with the voice of Christianity. Dr. Kurt Kramer is a world- renowned campanologist. Affectionately known as \"Monsieur Bimbam\" he has examined and restored countless bells in the Archdiocese of Freiburg and far beyond its boundaries for more than 40 years. 564675 149Caring for Creation - Climate Protection in RwandaRwanda: A poor, landlocked country of 13 million people. In terms of climate protection this East African nation is a role model for the whole region, a powerful example of how a country that is only minimally responsible for polluting the atmosphere is doing an impressive amount to reduce its CO 2 emissions. One striking example is a pilot project promoting high efficiency kitchen stoves amongst Rwandan families. These eco-friendly stoves reduce wood consumption by 60 percent compared to traditional cooking fires. Rwanda's kitchen stove initiative is highly relevant, since 80 percent of all Rwandan families currently cook on an open fire. 564675 150Oberammergau - A Village and its PassionTwo thousand residents of a village in the Bavarian Alps are currently performing almost every day a pageant depicting the suffering and death of Jesus Christ. Even the cancellation of the Oberammergau Passion Play due to the Covid pandemic could not stop the villagers from fulfilling the pledge their forefathers made in 1633 to perform the play every ten years if they were spared the plague. The well- known German theatre personality Christian St\u00fcckl has directed this year's production. Overcoming some resistance, St\u00fcckl has included Muslims and unbaptised people in the cast. Married women have also only been allowed to play the female roles since 1990. PEOPLE564675 151 Prayer and Action - The Church and the WarChristians have a duty to welcome strangers. The gospels record Jesus as saying, \"I was a stranger and you invited me in.\" In response to the refugee crisis precipitated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Christians in Germany are helping in a number of ways. In our report we investigate the Church's response to the refugees' plight. Parish centres have been turned into shelters; in the Caf\u00e9 Ukraine in downtown Berlin the new arrivals are invited to discuss ways of making the best of their situation; concerts and prayer services offer them support and encouragement. 564675 152Cheers, and Amen!Father Wolfgang F. Rothe is no run-of-the-mill priest... and not only because he goes on whisky pilgrimages. While exploring Scotland's wild beauty this rebellious Catholic cleric also addresses the controversial issues facing his Church. Wolfgang F. Rothe tells us of an attempted rape by his bishop and that he was forced into silence by the Church authorities. However, instead of holding his tongue he is fighting for change in the Catholic Church: the ordination of women to the priesthood, gay marriage and a more honest approach to human dilemmas. 564675 153Ulm Minster - The Tallest Church in the WorldIn the very center of Ulm, a city in southern Germany on the River Danube, stands the tallest church in the world. Its 161.53-metre-high steeple bears witness to the city's glorious past as one of the most powerful and prosperous German cities in the Middle Ages. Begun in the late 14th century the church is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture and Ulm's most famous landmark. A backdrop for international sporting events, a popular tourist attraction, a training site for height rescues, a place for spiritual renewal: Ulm Minister is much more than simply \"the tallest church in the world\". 564675 154Cologne's Holy WomenIn the Catholic Church only the Pope can declare somebody a saint, but the process always starts with a popular movement - local people revering a person for their holy way of life. Christianity arrived in Cologne in the 4th century. Since then, a number of remarkable Christian women have left their mark on this western German city. Who are they? And how did they influence Church and Society? What inspiration do modern women draw from these role models? And what role are women today seeking in the Catholic Church?564675 155Successful Evangelizing - Revisiting AfricaWe accompany a 92-year-old woman on a journey from Germany to Tanzania - a pilgrimage to the country of her birth and a revisiting of German Protestant missionary work in East Africa.

Following the story of Ruth's father, Otto Hagena, through the memories of his now elderly daughter, our report focuses on German Protestant missionary activity in East Africa both past and present. 564675 156Phoenix from the Ashes - An Old Church in a New Role Two artists and a young Lutheran pastor had to use chainsaws and axes to uncover the ruins of an old church in former Communist East Germany. The site had been reclaimed by nature and trees were growing through the gaping roof. In the under - growth they discovered the tombstone of Friedrich Nietzsche's grandfather, who died in 1850. Moritz G\u00f6tze and R\u00fcdiger Giebler grew up in East Germany, where faith and religion were discour - aged by the Communist dictatorship. However, the two artists developed a strong interest in the pre-Communist history of their homeland. With their own money, donations and subsidies, they have saved the old church from final decay.

His biggest success was with the soundtrack to the movie The Piano. Because he rejected contemporary atonal music, he gave up composing in the 1960s and turned to music criticism. An encounter with Steve Reich led him back to composition. US composer Reich is a pioneer of a musical style that Nyman was the first to call \"minimalism\". Music written in this style consists of just a few melodies, rhythms and harmonies that are then perpetually repeated. Michael Nyman is undoubtedly the most important British exponent of minimal music.
