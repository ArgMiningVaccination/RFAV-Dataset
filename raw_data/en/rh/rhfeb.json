Treatment strategies are dependent on the severity of the problem and may involve antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy or counselling. However, complementary and alternative medicines, like homeopathy, are also frequently sought by patients with mental and emotional health issues as a supportive option alongside their conventional medical care. In fact, stress, anxiety, depression and grief represent a significant proportion of the problems that people seek homeopathic consultations for across Europe. The Mind-Body Link There is increasing evidence to support the idea that how you are feeling psychologically can have a direct impact on your physical health. Emotional stress caused by grief, shock, abandonment, mental exhaustion or major life changes can leave us drained and prone to illness. For example, stress has been linked to decreased functioning of the immune system and an increased risk of developing obesity, diabetes and heart disease. It is clear that mental and emotional health have a significant impact on physical wellbeing too: the mind and body are intimately linked. The Holistic Approach in Homeopathy Homeopathic medicine treats the person as a whole, rather than treating specific conditions in isolation making it well-suited to supporting the care and treatment of mental and emotional health issues. For a homeopath a named condition is not necessarily the most important thing to consider when deciding on a treatment strategy as homeopathy places equal importance on both emotional and physical wellbeing, especially in the context of your personal story. This holistic philosophy is one of the main differences between homeopathy and conventional treatment strategies. What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a form of holistic medicine based on the principle that like treats like, i.e. a substance which causes symptoms when taken in larger doses, can be used in small amounts to treat similar symptoms in another person. Homeopathy uses specially prepared, highly diluted substances, called remedies that are given mainly in tablet or liquid form. Prescriptions are tailored to each individual patient, according to their specific symptoms. Homeopathy has a robust safety record and homeopathic treatment is not associated with unwanted side effects. The idea that a substance can be damaging in large amounts, but beneficial in small amounts is not new to science. In fact this concept (referred to as hormesis) has been around for decades and is increasingly well documented in such fields as biology and toxicology. You may also already have come across the concept of treating 'like with like' in conventional medicine e.g. allergens such as pollen being used in minute doses to desensitise allergic patients or tinnitus aids which create a buzzing noise in the ear to cancel out the buzzing noise of tinnitus. In order to find a homeopathic remedy which matches you and your symptoms as precisely as possible, I need to get a thorough understanding of the exact symptoms you are experiencing. During a confidential, in-depth consultation, I will consider all aspects of your health including your past medical history, diet, lifestyle and personality type, as well as your current health problems. How can Homeopathy help with Mental and Emotional Health? Homeopathy can offer you extra support through difficult life events. If a more serious condition such as an anxiety disorder or depression does develop, you may wish to consider a course of treatment by a registered homeopath as well as seeking other treatments such as counselling or conventional medication. Several observational studies (which look at the results seen when patients receive homeopathic treatment under real life conditions) have reported positive results for homeopathy. For example, an audit of a UK homeopathic clinic revealed that more than 84% of patients reported an improvement in their anxiety and depression, alongside an improvement in their overall sense of wellbeing. There is also some preliminary evidence from small-scale trials that suggests homeopathy may improve patient's experiences of insomnia, mild nervous disorders and stress. However, large-scale trials are needed to fully test these positive results, especially in anxiety and depression. How Long Does Treatment Take? This depends very much on what condition you have and its severity, as well as the other individual characteristics of your case. For a long-standing condition a course of treatment may be needed. As a guideline, you can typically expect to see me once a month for three months to begin with. If further treatment is needed beyond this stage you may find that follow-ups are scheduled at progressively longer intervals. "}
