Additional Guidelines for Young Women Camps ................................ ................................ ................................ ...8 General Information ................................ ............. 11 GIRLS CAMP GUIDELINES 2 Overview There are several item s we need you to be aware of as your camp approaches. Please be advised that Mutual Dell Forest Camps , Confidence Courses, and the Forest Amphitheatre are built into the side of a Mountain. There is no parking close to these camps and it is necessary for campers and leaders to hike up into these areas. Some of the trails are steep and narrow. Girls need to be assigned to clean the restroom twice a day and they will need a Young Women's Leader with them every time. Please provide a schedule of who will be cleaning what bathroom and when to the Camp Host. Missionaries would like to do a short orientation f or your group at 11:00 am on the first day of camp at the CCC Amphitheater. Groups may be combined for this orientation. The Forest Service has instructed us that only 35 people from Mutual Dell can be at the Tibble Fork Reservoir at one time. This include s young women, leaders, priesthood and missionaries. This means that if you have 2 YW leaders and 2 Priesthood brethren and 2 missionaries , then you can only have 29 young women at any given time. When transporting to the lake do not leave the girls withou t transportation, if it rains and thunders they need to have a way to get to shelter or return to camp. Please understand that there is no communication back to the camp, so those transporting will have to remain at the lake including the vehicles pulling the canoes until activity is done. These vehicles will need a Forest Service 3 day use pass. We will also need 2 adult priesthood holders at the lake at all times. An adequate number of adult priesthood leaders should be at camp at all times to assist with security, participate in camp activities, and give blessings when appropriate. We have great training for the confidence courses. This will be done on the 1st day of camp right after orientation. Please send two YW leaders for this training. For any phys ically challenged girls, we have 3 campsite s designated, please let us know if your ward has physically challenged girls so we can assist in accommodating your ward. Bear's Lair, Maple Grove, Crystal Springs and most of the Lodge camps . Please be aware it is the ward's responsibility to provide transportation for these young women. Missionaries will assist where possible. Mutual Dell Camp is a mountain facility developed by the Stakes of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter -day Saints of North Utah County. It provides a setting in the mountains away from the world where the Young Women program can be implemented. The purpose of Young Women camp is: to help young women recognize and appreciate their identity as a daughter of God; to teach young women to feel and recognize the Spirit; to prepare young women for their future roles; and to help young women keep their baptismal covenants GIRLS CAMP GUIDELINES 3 (Young Women General Board Workshop, Fall 2003 ) *Note: This document does not define the Young Women Camp Program. Rather, it is intended to define the guidelines and procedures that have been established for the use and management of the Mutual Dell Camp. The Church Handbook of Instructions, The Young Women Camp Manual, For the Strength of Youth should be followed when attend ing the camp. Camp Guidelines Transportation and Parking Stakes and Wards may transport young women by private vehicles or bus. ( Church Handbook of Instructions , p. 280) Each driver must be a licensed, responsible adult 21 years of a ge or older. \"Partic ipants in Church activities should be covered by personal accident and health insurance.\" (Church Handbook of Instructions , p. 277) For Stakes, it would be a good idea to have the wards arrive at fifteen minute intervals. When driving private vehicles, aft er unloading, drivers will be asked to park in designated parking areas for the duration of camp. We will attempt to park trailers as close to the camps as possible however there is no guarantee. Mutual Dell has only two RV parking spaces and each RV will use three of your allotted parking spaces. Please note that parking is limited at Mutual Dell and when it is full, no other vehicles will be allowed into the camp. PLEASE CARPOOL. Participants Leaders and young women may arrive on Monday or Tuesday (the C amp Managers need to know when you plan to set up and start camp) and should depart not later t han noon on Friday. \"Young women and leaders are strongly encouraged to stay for the entire duration of the camp. Please limit late arrivals and early departures .\" The gate is closed each night to keep unwanted traffic from coming in and out. Gates close at 10:00 pm and opens at 7:00 am (Mutual Dell Advisory Council) Young men (under 21) , and single men are not permitted in camp when young women groups are in camp . Once the young women are in camp young men will NOT be allowed to assist in hauling supplies and setting up camp. Safety & Security The safety of the young women is the responsibility of the stake/ward leaders. An adequate number of adult priesthood lea ders should be at camp at all times to assist with security, participate in camp activities , and give blessings when appropriate. A \"Camp Church Activity Permission and Authorization\" form must be signed for each young woman. A signed copy of this form should be brought to camp for use by your stake/ward medical personnel. GIRLS CAMP GUIDELINES 4 \"Participants in Church activities should be covered by personal accident and health insurance.\" (Church Handbook of Instructions , p. 277) Only bring camping gear and items that you are willing to carry to the camp. We have wheel barrows and wagons for transporting items to camp and the Missionaries can haul some heavy items to camp in a trailer behind their ATV. They will not load nor unload th e trailer. Young women should be in their camp sites by 10:00 p.m. Lights should be turned out and young women quiet by 11:00 p.m. Walkie -talkies are encouraged for coordinating group activities in camp. Stake and Ward groups will need to provide their own. There are no public phones in camp. There is no cell phone coverage at Mutual Dell. For emergencies, there is a telephone available at the Dell Manager's cabin. Youth needing to use the phone must be accompanied by an adult. For Parents and Guardian s -To contact camp, the Stake President or Bishop should be contacted first. He or one of his counselors will then place the call to the camp. The phone number here at the cabin is 801 -851-2888. Please Note: the cabin is not always manned so some messages will go to an answering machine. Do to the size of the camps we can only accommodate emergency calls. Make sure that a nurse, doctor, or person with mature judgment and first -aid experience is in camp for the entire time. This individual should be trained in CPR and be prepared to treat typical and emergency camping related ailments and injuries. Medical supplies are to be provided by each stake/ward. The nearest hospital is 10 miles away i n American Fork. Have transportation available at all times in case of emergency. Emergency procedures are in place for the safety of all. Emergency procedures will be explained by the camp missionary host during the camp orientation meeting. o Accountability Checks - Young Women Leaders should do an accountability check on the whereabouts of each Young Woman and leaders. This should be done on a regular basis throughout the day. A minimum of morning, noon and night. o Emergency A bull horn will be sounded with 3 long blast if there is an emergency in camp. Stop immediately and go directly to the ball field. If there is inclement weather, you may be directed to another sheltered location. Do not return to your camp site for personal items or decide to evacuate by yourself. This may cause a group panic and may cause injuri es. We are working with the Nation Park Service , Lone Peak Fire Department, and the local home owners to evacuate all who are in danger safely. GIRLS CAMP GUIDELINES 5 o Fire. In the event of fire, all campers should assemble at ball field area near the entry roads. Follow the cam p host's instructions. Do not return to camping areas until instructed to do so.

Mutual Dell has a 6 -station confidence course located along the Nature Trail (Red Trail) . It consists of a \" Life Line \", \"The Wall\", \"Spider's Web\", \"Shark Island\", and \" Team Log\". The object at each of these stations is to encourage a team building experienc e. \"The Wall\" and \"Shark Island\" all require a trained Missionary to conduct these activities. Missionaries will train Ward or Stake leaders to designate at least one person to be responsible for conducting the activ ities at each of these stations. At least o ne Young Woman leader should accompany each group of 15 YW. (Our missionaries are trained to assist with the running of these activities, but the Host missionary couple need to know who wishes the help so we can assign it appropriately. Water Front (Tibble Fork). Per USFS directive, No more than 35 people from Mutual Dell at the lake at the same time. This includes Young Women, YW Leaders, Priesthood Brethren and Missionaries. Plan your groups for 90 minute inter vals to allow for transition between groups. The waterfront director, provided by Stake or Ward, is responsible for safety in the waterfront area. When at the waterfront, young women and leaders should obey the instructions of the waterfront director at al l times. The waterfront director gives instructions to each group for lake and canoe safety. The waterfront director will determine weather conditions that are unsafe for canoeing. Each stake/ward will provide adult leaders responsible for supervision and assisting the waterfront director during its waterfront time.

Water Safety Discipline should be maintained at all t imes. Activities must be well -organized and supervised. Realistic safety rules should be made and explained to all campers. The following guidelines will help you maintain safety during water sports: An adult trained in water safety should be present and i n charge during any water activity. One Young Women leader or priesthood brother, who is competent in canoeing and water safety must be in a canoe to assist distressed canoers. Consult the Parental or Guardian Permission and Medical Release form (see p. 8 9) to determine which young women have physical conditions that would limit their participation in water activities. Become familiar with the depth of the water and any possible hazards. Plan activities that are safe. Make sure that all participants in wat er activities use the buddy system. This means that they are assigned to someone of equal swimming ability to swim near and check with. Make sure that all young women can be easily observed during their activities. One or more lifeguards should be on duty, and a lifeline should be available on shore. Overnight backpack campsites are available for certification purposes only. They are p art of the National Park system and reservations for camping must be made with the Park Service They are not accessible by private vehicle.
