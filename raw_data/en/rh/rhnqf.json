While it is common to treat chronic pain with pharmaceutical treatments, an approach that has also shown great benefits is the use of integrative medicine, such as massage therapy, osteopathic and spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and yoga. The keywords \"integrative medicine,\" \"pain,\" \"chronic pain,\" and \"pain management\" with the use of the Boolean operators \"AND,\" \"OR,\" and \"NOT\" were used to identify relevant studies discussing the effectiveness of alternative medicine in the treatment of chronic pain. Massage therapy uses different forms of pressing, rubbing, and moving of muscles and other soft tissues, and has shown short-term benefits for chronic pain relief. Osteopathic and spinal manipulation is mainly used in treating muscles, tendons, and bone pain due to worn-out joints, torn ligaments, and more.

According to our review, acupuncture and massage therapy are effective for short-term treatment, lasting three to five months for chronic pain.
