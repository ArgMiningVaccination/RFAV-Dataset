The existing research has been limited by the sample collection and timing, cohort design, sample design, and lack of data on the preconception microbiome. This prospective, longitudinal cohort study will recruit 2000 Australian women, in order to fully explore the role of the microbiome in the development of adverse perinatal outcomes. Participants are enrolled for a maximum of 7 years, from 1 year preconception, through to 5 years postpartum. Assessment occurs every three months until pregnancy occurs, then during Trimester 1 (5 + 0-12 + 6 weeks gestation), Trimester 2 (20 + 0-24 + 6 weeks gestation), Trimester 3 (32 + 0-36 + 6 weeks gestation), and postpartum at 1 week, 2 months, 6 months, and then annually from 1 to 5 years. At each assessment, maternal participants self-collect oral, skin, vaginal, urine, and stool samples. Oral, skin, urine, and stool samples will be collected from children. Blood samples will be obtained from maternal participants who can access a study collection center. The measurements taken will include anthropometric, blood pressure, heart rate, and serum hormonal and metabolic parameters. Validated self-report questionnaires will be administered to assess diet, physical activity, mental health, and child developmental milestones. Medications, medical, surgical, obstetric history, the impact of COVID-19, living environments, and pregnancy and child health outcomes will be recorded. Multiomic bioinformatic and statistical analyses will assess the association between participants who developed high-risk and low-risk pregnancies, adverse postnatal conditions, and/or childhood disease, and their microbiome for the "}
