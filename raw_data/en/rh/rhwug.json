Dr. Gaul has been successful in guiding patients toward optimum health where a conventional approach has stalled or failed. During a first visit, Dr. Gaul reviews the Comprehensive Patient Profile that you have returned during your appointment and spends the time to really listen to what you need, perform any needed physical exam, and an assessment of which body areas are requiring assistance. She will evaluate your overall health and lifestyle, life experiences, your constitution and temperament, and emotional and spiritual health. Regular or specialized laboratory testing may be performed. An individualized treatment plan that includes a background picture of how your current health state is being created is formulated, with a 1 to 5 phase plan to start to correct the underlying conditions. The plans may include herbal, homeopathic, anthroposophic, nutritional or dietary interventions, physical medicines or a referral to other helpful therapies and practitioners. You can contact our Reception Staff to get further information about Dr. Gaul's approach. We can send you: - our Frequently Asked Questions that explains more about naturopathic care, our clinic, and what you can expect during your care with us. - \"Getting the Right Providers for Your Care\", an article by Dr. Gaul that will help you to choose the right practitioner to add to your team. - An article from Family Practice Journal that describes what to expect with Naturopathic Care - An outcomes study for Naturopathic Medical Care. Naturopathic Doctors look at all conditions as being potentially related manifestations of underlying common causes. As a result, many conditions in a patient can be mastered with a few key interventions, rather than using a symptomatic approach to each separate condition.
