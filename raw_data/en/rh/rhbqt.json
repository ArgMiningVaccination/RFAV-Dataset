Our earlier discoveries led to definitions of the Yin-Yang-like interplay of inflammation/immunity in the maintenance ofhealthorinductionandprogressionofnearlyallacute and chronic diseases including site-specific cancers (see below)1,5,8,20,24-26,41-47,49-52(Figure2). The immune surveillance theory of Burnet was based on a decade of extensive analyses and integration of data from several scientific disciplines such as devel- opmental biology, embryology, immunology, patho- physiology, and oncology of his era. Unlike the current reductionist approaches to cancer and vaccine sciences, Burnet realized that scientists like himself \" believe that at every stage in scientific development it is necessary to provide the best available generalizations as a guide to effective work, both in the application of knowledge toKHATAMI whole ...Thefailurein cancerisduenottoanyweaknessoftheorganismbuttoa change in the character of the cells rendering them in one way or another insusceptible to the normal control.

It should be noted that prior to vaccination of public with virus- contaminatedpoliovaccines,decisionmakersminimized, downplayed, ignored, and harassed a highly competent and concerned microbiologist (Bernice Eddy) at NIH who discovered that the polio vaccines had live and fil- terable viruses (eg, Simian virus, SV-40) and predicted thatcontaminatedpoliovaccinescouldcausecancerepi- demic.1,5,8,17The loss of many lives and numerous polio vac- cineinjuriesresultedinlawsuits againstNIH andDHHS and resignation of directors of NIH and DHHS, con- stituting little more than a slap on the hand!.1Despite this record, the power of the medical establishment over exclusivedecision-makingandoverpublichealthingen- eral increased to its current scary level.

Significant increased fundedprojectsfocusonisolatednumerouscellular and molecular aspects of inflammation-immunity forcancerresearchandtherapy;usingsite-specific tumor models, expensive specific technologies, and related networks. However, the reductionist approaches on the topic of inflammation created further confusion and ongoing debates on what inflammation does, whether it prevents cancer or it causes cancer,1,5,8,20,51(NCI/NIH scientific and legaldocuments,since1998). It is noteworthy that current literature in the field is flooded with hundreds of thousands of articles on the structures and substructures of numerous pathogens, their roles in experimental models of diseases; or numerous identified genetic mutations in cancer molec- ular tsunami to use specific expensive technologies for research, diagnosis or treatment and pathogen- specific vaccine technologies. However, peculiarly, except for our accidental discoveries that were estab- lished in 1980s, very little is known about how stimuli (immune disruptors, pathogens) systematically would induce initiation processes in altering immune response dynamics toward time-dependent and sequencing of genetic mutations and over- or under- expression of gene products provide evidence that individualpatientshavedifferentaverageratesofevolving mutations during examination and growth patterns of cancer mass. For example, patients with lung cancer demonstrate200-300mutationspertumor,whilepatients with esophageal or colon cancer present 50-100 DNA mutations per tumor.1,5,8,11,20,49The Cancer Genome Atlas (an NCI-funded project) identified thousands of gene mutations in too many site-specific cancers.

Abnormal or excessive activation or deactivation of genomic (exhaus- tion) of molecular components of the synchronized immune response dynamics; loss of electrobiology and skewed balance between tumoricidal (apoptosis, Yin or degeneration) and tumorigenic (wound healing, Yang, or regeneration) properties of immunity. The evolving mutationalpatternsandthenumberofmutationsatspe- cific cancer sites (cancer molecular tsunami) make such expensive projects, intellectually deceptive, worthless, and irresponsible and they are \"scientific/medical Ponzi schemes.\"1,5,8,10,11,49-51 Decision makers of such ill-conceived and dangerous therapeutic projects who often use a combination of chemotherapywithwholeorpartialbodyradiation,totally disregardtheimportantmolecularcompensatorymecha- nismsofimmuneresponsestowardinhibitorsofapoptotic factors(eg,monoclonalantibodies,growthfactors-kinasesinhibitors) against specific factors, enzymes or receptor molecules.1,5,8,20Other failed clinical trials include the use of hormone replacement therapy; finasteride (syn- PSA measurement for prostate cancer therapy and diag- nosis.1,5,8,10-12\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7Such therapies in an already immune- compromised patient often induce immune tsunami (cytokine storm) in tissues/organs and lead to relapse, fatigue,cachexia,sarcopenia,thromboembolism,multiple organfailures(MOFs),anddeath.1,8,10,11,20 The quality of blood (eg, fresh/young, frozen or old and storage procedures, using preservatives and dura- tion of blood storage) that are employed for transfu- sion or iron supplementation in therapy-induced ane- mia is also among factors that are often ignored or not reported in the literature.

Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected.SteveJobs The concept of vaccination, or rather immunization, forprotecting,promotinganddefendingindividualhealth against viruses, bacteria or parasites developed in the eighteenth century, well before the important theory of immune surveillance was developed, and before better hygieneorantibioticsimprovedpublichealthandreduced many preventable infectious diseases and increased longevity. The concept of protecting public health by immunization also existed before Rockefeller patent medicineandGatespatentvaccinesinvested agreatdeal in medical education to influence promotion of drug sale and to vaccinate the public with pathogen-specific vaccines in toxic media and associated debates and con- troversies.1,2,4,5,12,13,17,18,20-24,28,30-33,36-40,59-63,66-68,70,73,77,83, 93,94,96,97,110,111,116,128,136-144,146-150,156,158,160-166,168-172,174,175,181, 189-197,205,206,212 Seven/eightdecadesago,vaccineswereconsideredrela- tivelysafeandeffectiveinpromoting/boostingimmunity and preventing diseases when healthy children (2 years or older) were vaccinated with few dead/inactivated pathogens (eg, measles, mumps, diphtheria, smallpox) thatwerepreparedinsalinesolutions.Theoverallreview studies and/or comparison of of an acute inflammation (eg, responses to infective agents) are lymphocyte- derived clonal expansion, increased synthesis of pathogen-(or allergen) specific antibodies and mem- ory cells.1,5,8,12,20,24,25,41-47,49-52Synthesis of antibodies (eg, IgGs, IgE, IgA, IgM) and memory cells (B/plasma or T cells) are needed for priming the immune system (boosting immunity). Upon next exposure to similarly structured infective agents, the host's primed immune system unleashes appropriate and precise quantities of required neutralizing antibodies and pro-, and agents and also to repair and remodel infected host tissues (see above). Therefore, occasional exposures of healthy children to infective agents are expected to boost natural immunity and prevent many diseases throughout life.1,5,8,20Even occasional exposure ofhealthyadultstopotentpathogens(eg,meningococcal, coronavirus) is likely to protect the body from cardiovas- cular and respiratory diseases or cancer, if the victims successfully survive pathogen-induced cytokine storms (immunetsunamiorexaggeratedimmuneresponses)that areexpressedagainstsuchpathogens,1,5,20,24(unpublished observations). In brief, it takes approximately 2 years for newborn- infanttobeimmunologicallyindependentfrommother's immunity.

Segments of papilloma virus (types 6,11,18) and recombinant DNA technologies are used in media/incipient that has combination of Al, PS80, SIO2, Saponin.8,12,14,19,24,110,131-134,137-139,143Reviewof related data suggest that HPV vaccines and adjuvants are associated with mild or severe adverse reactions (VAERS), including autoimmune diseases, fibromyal- gia, tachycardia, ovarian failure, fatigue, without any benefits in preventing incidences of cervical and related cancers8,12,14,66,70,71,108,110,136,137-139,143 ,'.I n a comprehensive review14Giannotta and Giannotta described the mechanisms of adverse effects of vaccines (eg, HPV) and incipient in autonomic neuronal system and development and could over-stimulate immunity. According to manufac- turer'sinserts,governmentalorpublishedscientificdata, majority of pathogen-specific vaccines are prepared in media containing combinations of metals, chemicals- biological agents such as aluminum (Al, as hydroxide or phosphate salts), mercury (Hg, 20), glyphosate-herbicide,octylphenolethoxylateoroctoxynol- 10 (Triton X-100)], genetically engineered DNA/RNA, yeast extracts, fetal tissues and organ parts or frag- ments12,14,24,37,38,67,73,74,77,94,96,128,130-132,141,144,148,152,153,156,165, 167,168\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7'*********.Majorityofthesevaccineingredients arenotnaturalagentsanddonotparticipateinbiochemi- calpathwaysinhumanphysiology.Theseingredientsare additional foreign agents that overwhelm the immune system (see below).

Normally, copper ions are bound to carrier molecules and distributed via carrier proteins ('copper chaperones') for protecting/preventing tissue damage.36,72,84,85,91,92,153,183Excessamountofcopper(free) could be detrimental to respiratory chain reactions and generation of toxic hydroxyl radicals (HO0)c a u s i n g oxidative damage not only to mitochondria, but also other extracellular-intracellular proteins or nucleic acids and lipids (Fenton reaction) and tissue oxido-redox potentials.1,5,14,20,29,31-39,53,55,72,73,78,84,85,88-92,155,182,183Fur- thermore, copper and Zn+2(another trace element and Cu-mediated production of O 2/ROS. Related studies suggest that trace elements (Cu, zinc, Fe), influence regulations of transport of triglycerides in gastrointestinal tract and are important in the function of red blood cells and endoplasmic reticulum activities. While mechanisms of toxicities or interactions between Al or Hg and trace elements on biological pathways are not well understood, it is highly likely that tissues are sensitivetosuchmetalsinvaccines,particularlyaffecting tissue bioenergetics (Figures 3-5) .T h ep r e s e n c eo fA lo r detergents in vaccines could induce retardation/overload of mitochondria, causing elevated levels of Cu2+in tissues (eg, liver) that would lead to vaccine-induced respiratory or neuronal illnesses (eg, Wilson and other mitochondrial diseases).1,29,36,39,40,48,49,53-57,74,75,114,151,163,183 Injected vaccines containing Al or Hg, at various stages ofpregnancy,couldretardfetusgrowthanddevelopment involving important generation, utilization, or recycling ofglutathione-relatedpathways(GSH:GSSHandNAD+: NADH) and further altering oxido-redox potentials and incompletemitochondriaandorgandevelopment,growth impairment, immune and mitochondrial diseases after birth.1,5,90,102,114,117,118,151-155,163,182 Inadetailedretrospectiveepidemiologicalstudy,using automated Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), Young et al36 reported that vaccines containing Hg (thimerosal) were AluminuminVaccines:WhatEveryoneNeedstoKnow- www. westonaprice.org/health-topics/vaccinations/ Infant Immunity Part II: Aluminum, vaccines, and fetal brain development, with Dr. Suzanne Humphries www.youtube.com/watch? v=cdSCY7W-BUo and Infant Immunity with Suzanne Humphries and HilaryButler;afourpartseries... 2015 www.youtube.com/playlist?list= PLgH2vCx5associatedwithneurologicaldevelopmentaldisorders(eg, anaphylaxis, autism, ASD, tics, attention deficit disor- der, and emotional disturbances) in newborn (7 and 13 months old) perhaps, due to mitochondrial dysfunc- tion.

With its unique imidazole side chain, histidine plays critical roles in immune response dynamics, associated with renal, neuronal, ocular and gastrointestinal biolog- ical activities. There are up to 200 genes that mediate activities of histdine-containing proteins, such in (cate- cholamine, an alkali, a potent vasoactive agent) acts as a key element and the most versatile biogenic amine, havingdiverseandantagonisticpropertiesinmammalian physiology. Histamine present in all roles in human development, mucosal activities, vascular function and perme- ability, neuronal well as, growth of cancer mass.1,5,20,95,124,126,127,150,199-203 Resultsofouroriginalstudiesoninflammation-induced multistep tumorigenesis and angiogenesis led to recent hypotheses level release of tissue/cell growththatalterimmuneresponses,includinginduction ofautoimmuneandneurodegenerativediseasesortumori- genesisandangiogenesis.1,5,8,20,42-47,49,50,52 Summary of diverse biological activities that are affected by abnormal levels (deficiencies or excesses) of histidine-histamine in tissues, including altered nutritional intake, genetic mutations in production or metabolism of histidine or histamine are provided below1,5,20,41-44,46,79,95,105,106,109,124,126-128,148,152,172,176,177,200-203 (Figures4and5): a. Early immune cells (eg,MCs) and neu- ronalactivitiesafterbirth; c. DNA transcription involving Zn-imidazole (ECL) Inductionoftissuegrowth,tumorigenesis,angiogene- sis,andcancer; Among major histidine-histamine-associated diseases are histinemia, kidney disease, anemia, and cancers. Hitinemia is an inherited autosomal-recessive metabolic disorder where lack/impaired histidase activity cause an increased level of histidine and its metabolites in blood and urine and decreased uronic acid in skin and blood or elevated levels of histaminase (diaminase) activities and related metabolites and neurotransmitters such as L-dopamine and calcitonine.1,5,20,101,103,124,185,197-201 Rate of histinemia was shown comparable with another inherited metabolic disorder, phenylketonuria. Histine- mia is associated with defects in mild neurological disorders and slow-down of speech. Chronic kidney disease, in contrast, is associated with low histidine levels and impaired metabolites such as histamine. Fur- thermore, low plasma levels of histidine are associated with a higher level of histamine (perhaps increased allergies), oxidative stress and retardation of mito- chondrial energy, that also affect glomerular capillaries and filtration ability of kidneys and vascular/arterial endothelium associated with is involved in erythropoiesis, hemoglobin biosynthesis and protection of RBC in circulation and the damaging effects of ROS.1,14,17,20,26, 41-46,95,105,106,109,124,126-129,148,152,172,176,177,202,203,222Anemia is also associated with histidine deficiency and oxidative stress. The presence of Al in vaccines is likely to impair histidine metabolism, by interfering with iron-requiring proteins including transferrin, biosynthesis of erythro- poiesis and RBC or complement activation cascades and contribute to vasculature lesions (eg, vasculitis) and anemia1,5,20,47,72,75,82,222(manuscript in preparation) (Figure4).

Searching the truth in medical sciences, pioneers such as Pasteur, Rous, Metchnikoff, Ehrlich or Burnet employed highly intellectual logics by integrating and presenting credible discoveries of their era that stood the test of time. With limitedresourcesandintheabsenceofmoderntechnolo- gies,thesetruescientistsviewedinfectionsasfoundations of inflammatory chronic diseases. In the twentieth cen- tury,theselogical,commonsenseandfundamentalstud- ies have been drastically altered, abused, and replaced byreductionistandchaotictacticsbyprofit-power-seeker mentalities of decision makers who disregard medi- cal morality \"to do no harm\" in conducting medical sciences.1-10,17,18 The medical system seems to have lost its soul to the power of blood (dark) money in the 20th century.

Immunologically, investing in vaccination (even if vaccines were 'safe') will not reduce diseases or death. Vaccines further complicate the disease status of poor people who suf- fer from malnutrition and lack of hygiene. The fear- mongering tactics based on the threat of infectious (eg, measles, Ebola, HPV, meningitis, flu, coro- navirus) developed or developing countries are an over-exaggeration and cover-up for pushing and sell- ing drugs (vaccines) and controlling population growth.
