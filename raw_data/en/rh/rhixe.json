Licensed Acupuncturist located in Portsmouth, NH About Bendell Scott graduated from the New England School of Acupuncture in 2002 with a Masters degreee in Chinese and Japanese Acupuncture. Scott is also a diplomat of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and a Licensed acupuncturist in NH and NJ. Since graduation, Scott has worked full time as an acupuncturist for several multi-disciplinary offices as head acupuncturist as well as operating his own private practice. He has treated thousands of patients with varying conditions and he integrates that experience into each and every treatment. Scott's ability to heal began when he was young when he would find and push on sore points on his mother's back that helped alleviate her migraines. From that young age he was already interested in the martial arts and pressure (acu) points. Over time he became passionate about ancient healing traditions such as acupuncture and energy healing (medical Qigong) through these internal martial arts because the healing of others and self-healing represented the highest level of these Martial Arts. Scott continues to study and teach the Self-healing arts of Qigong, Neigong, Concsious Dreaming, and also the Internal Martial Arts of Taijiquan (TaiChi), Baguazhang and more. Through these ancient healing arts Scott has developed a more in-depth knowledge of how healing of the Body, Mind, and Spirit works and tends to integrate his knowledge of self-healing into his acupuncture sessions. Scott believes in the unlimited potential of our body and mind to heal and emphasizes that we all have this potential. When not at work, Scott enjoys spending time out in nature, practicing tea ceremony, and exploring new places.
