Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Research Sciences Program Element is budgeted in the Basic Research Budget Activity because it provides the technical foundation for long-term National Security enhancement through the discovery of new phenomena and the exploration of the potential of such phenomena for Defense applications. It supports the scientific study and experimentation that is the basis for more advanced knowledge and understanding in information, electronic, mathematical, computer, and materials sciences. This Program Element also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. The Math and Computer Sciences project supports scientific study and experimentation on new mathematical and computational algorithms, models, and mechanisms in support of long-term national security objectives. Modern analytic and information technologies enable important new military capabilities and drive the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Conversely, new classes of threats, in particular threats that operate in or through the cyber domain, put military systems, critical infrastructure, and the civilian economy at risk. This project aims to magnify these opportunities and mitigate these threats by leveraging emerging mathematical and computational capabilities including computational social science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and reasoning, data science, complex systems modeling and simulation, and theory of computation. The basic research conducted under the Math and Computer Sciences project will produce breakthroughs that enable new capabilities for national and homeland security. The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; Volume 1 - 1 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 2 of 36 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2022 Defense Research Projects Agency Date: May 2021 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0601101E / DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems. Other research could support field-portable electronics with reduced power requirements, ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip\", and new approaches to nanometer-scale structures, molecules, and devices. The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, and memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. The Materials Sciences project provides the fundamental research that underpins the design, development, assembly, and optimization of advanced materials, devices, and systems for DoD applications in areas such as robust diagnostics and therapeutics, novel energetic materials, and complex hybrid systems. The Transformative Sciences project supports research and analysis that leverages converging technological forces and transformational trends in information-intensive subareas of the social sciences, life sciences, and manufacturing. The project integrates these diverse disciplines to eliminate reliance on foreign sources for critical materials, improve military adaptation to sudden changes in requirements, threats, and emerging/converging trends, especially trends that have the potential to disrupt military operations or threaten National Security. Specific research in this project will investigate technologies to enable detection of novel threat agents (e.g., bacterial pathogens) and maintain warfighter health and improve recovery. This project also includes efforts to create innovative materials of interest to the military (e.g., self- healing materials). B.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 Title: Foundational Artificial Intelligence (AI) Science Description: The Foundational Artificial Intelligence (AI) Science thrust is developing a fundamental scientific basis for understanding and quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI technologies. Current AI technologies are challenged in handling uncertainty and incompleteness of training protocols and data. This has prevented the successful integration of AI technology into many transformative DoD applications. To address these limitations, the Foundational AI Science thrust will focus on the development of new learning architectures that enhance AI systems' ability to handle uncertainty, reduce vulnerabilities, and improve robustness for DoD AI systems. One focus area of this thrust is the ability to embed known physics, mathematics, and other prior knowledge to improve performance of AI systems, particularly for problem sets involving incomplete, sparse, and noisy data. Another focus area is the development of a model framework for quantifying performance expectations and limits of AI systems as trusted human partners and collaborators. A third focus area is the development of new tools and methodologies that enable AI approaches for accelerated scientific discovery. The technology advances achieved under the Foundational AI Science thrust will ultimately remove technical barriers to exploiting AI technologies for scientific discovery, human-AI collaboration, and other DoD relevant applications.

Title: Alternative Computing Description: The Alternative Computing thrust is exploring and developing new computational primitives for modeling and simulating complex systems. Despite decades of rapid advancement in electronic computing, there remain important national security relevant challenge problems that do not lend themselves to achieving tractable solutions under size, weight, and power (SWaP) constrained conditions. For example, simulation of complex nonlinear phenomena such as turbulence, fluid flow, and plasma dynamics can be challenging even using currently available high power computing resources. Building on technologies developed under the Advanced Tools for Modeling and Simulation thrust, also in this PE/Project, the goal of the Alternative Computing thrust is to develop novel architectural and algorithmic approaches to enable fast and accurate simulations for problems that are practically intractable using electronic computers. Approaches considered under this thrust include the following: (1) analog computing substrates for efficiently simulating systems governed by complex non-linear phenomena; (2) multi-functional spin-based devices for scalable, efficient neuromorphic computing; (3) computing approaches that exploit the capacity of nonlinear systems to simulate nonlinear dynamical systems; and (4) quantum enabled optimization of complex systems.

Title: Machine Common Sense (MCS) Description: The Machine Common Sense (MCS) program is exploring approaches to enable common sense reasoning by machines. Recent advances in machine learning have resulted in new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities in areas such as image recognition, task-focused natural language processing, and strategy games such as Chess, Go, and Poker. In all of these application domains, the machine reasoning is narrow and highly specialized, and the machine must be carefully trained or programmed for every situation. This program addresses the challenge of general machine reasoning on par with common sense human cognition. MCS is developing computational models that mimic core systems of human cognitive development that are grounded in perceptual, motor, and memory modalities; a simulated interaction and learning environment to support machine manipulation of grounded concept models; and common sense knowledge repositories to support AI system development. AI systems that are capable of human-like reasoning will be able to behave more appropriately in unforeseen situations and to learn with reduced requirements for training data. FY 2021 Plans: - Enhance core cognitive models with additional capabilities, such as spatial navigation at the cognitive developmental level of nine- to twelve-month old infants, and evaluate model performance on prediction tasks. - Develop core cognitive models with initial experience learning capabilities, and evaluate model performance against experience learning tasks. - Modify the simulation environment for evaluation of additional machine learning methods, cognitive capabilities, prediction tasks, and experience learning tasks. - Enhance common knowledge services to handle common sense phenomena of increased complexity, and assess performance of services against benchmark common sense challenge problem suites. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop core cognitive models with enhanced experience learning capabilities, and evaluate model performance against experience learning tasks requiring elements of intuitive physics, navigation, and models of intentional agents. - Enhance core cognitive models with additional capabilities, such as models of intentional agents used by twelve- to eighteen- month old infants, and evaluate model performance on prediction tasks.12.375 16.500 18.000 Volume 1 - 7 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 36 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 - Augment the simulation environment to enable evaluation of additional machine learning methods, cognitive capabilities, prediction tasks, and experience learning tasks, particularly for problems that require sensemaking, human-machine collaboration, or knowledge transfer. - Enhance common knowledge services to handle common sense phenomena of increased complexity, and assess performance on benchmark common sense challenge problem suites in environments with greater complexity, noise, and novelty. FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2022 increase reflects continued development of machine common sense technologies and the simulation environment, and additional work to refine techniques and assess of performance against benchmark commonsense challenge problem suites. Title: Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) Description: The Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program is developing techniques to defend against deception and other adversarial attacks on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. GARD addresses the need to defend against deception attacks, whereby an adversary inputs engineered data into an ML system intending to cause the system to produce erroneous results. Deception attacks can enable adversaries to take control of autonomous systems, alter conclusions of ML-based decision support applications, and compromise tools and systems that rely on ML and AI technologies. Current techniques for defending ML and AI have proven brittle due to a focus on individual attack methods and weak methods for testing and evaluation. Techniques developed under the GARD program will address the current limitations of defenses and produce ML and AI systems suitable for use in adversarial environments. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop a general framework for deception and related attacks on ML, and quantify the vulnerability of ML algorithm classes to an adaptive adversary. - Develop defenses that leverage multiple data sources to reduce vulnerability to adversarial inputs. - Extend evaluation framework for testing ML defenses for multi-sensor scenarios, and evaluate ML defenses in such scenarios. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop defenses against novel types of adversarial inputs, with particular interest in inputs that can be implemented in the physical world. - Develop and validate novel measures of attack strength, and integrate these measures into the evaluation framework. - Extend evaluation framework for testing ML defenses for adaptive scenarios, and implement and test ML defenses for use against an AI-enabled 8 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 36 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 The FY 2022 increase reflects continued development of ML defenses and an ML defense evaluation framework, and additional work to evaluate the effectiveness of ML defensive techniques against an AI-enabled adversary. Title: Young Faculty Award (YFA) Description: The goal of the Young Faculty Award (YFA) program is to encourage junior faculty at universities and their equivalent at non-profit science and technology research institutions to participate in sponsored research programs that will augment capabilities for future defense systems. This program focuses on cutting-edge technologies for greatly enhancing microsystems technologies, biological technologies, and defense sciences. The long-term goal for this program is to develop the next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in key disciplines who will focus a significant portion of their careers on DoD and national security issues. The aim is for YFA recipients to receive deep interactions with DARPA program managers, programs, performers, and the user community. Current activities include research in fifteen topic areas spanning from Machine Learning and Many Body Physics, to Wideband Transmitter-Antenna Interfaces and Multi-Scale Models of Infectious Disease Dynamics. A key aspect of the YFA program is DARPA-sponsored military visits; all YFA Principal Investigators are expected to participate in one or more military site visits to help them better understand DoD needs. FY 2021 Plans: - Award new FY 2021 grants for new two-year research efforts across the topic areas, establishing a new set of appropriate technologies to solve current DoD problems. - Continue FY 2020 research on new concepts for microsystem, biological, strategic, and tactical technologies; information innovation; and defense sciences by exercising second year funding and by providing continued mentorship by program managers. - Award Director's Fellowships for top FY 2019 participants to refine technology further and align to DoD needs. FY 2022 Plans: - Award new FY 2022 grants for new two-year research efforts across the topic areas, establishing a new set of appropriate technologies to solve current DoD problems. - Continue FY 2021 research on new concepts for microsystem, biological, strategic, and tactical technologies; information innovation; and defense sciences by exercising second year funding and by providing continued mentorship by program managers. - Award Director's Fellowships for top FY 2020 participants to refine technology further and align to DoD needs.17.000 17.000 17.000 Title: Human Social Systems Description: The social sciences provide essential theories and models that can enable deeper understanding of human social systems and behaviors relevant to national security such as humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and stability support missions, as well as tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the DoD. However, current limitations to the speed,17.500 26.250 15.000 Volume 1 - 9 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 36 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / 1R-1 DEFENSE RESEARCH SCI ENCESProject (Number/Name) CCS-02 / MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B. Accomplishments/Planned in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 scalability, and reproducibility of empirical social science research continue to hamper its practical use by the DoD. Additionally, current social behavioral models often fail to accurately interpret social behaviors because they do not sufficiently capture diversity of context.

Title: Analyzing Software to Protect against Evolving Cyber Threats (ASPECT)* Description: *Formerly Formal Methods at Scale (FMaS) The Analyzing Software to Protect against Evolving Cyber Threats (ASPECT) program will develop technologies to enable software developers to pose in-depth queries of code under development and sustainment in order to discover negative patterns, capture the semantic features of vulnerability classes, and characterize undesirable behaviors. ASPECT technologies will enable developers to generate the types of evidence required for confident certification, thereby improving software quality and assurance. At present, software faults and vulnerabilities are often unwittingly propagated throughout the software ecosystem because they are not easily discovered in codebases and because developers have strong incentives to re-use code and programming patterns. Moreover, searching for faults and vulnerabilities in software is impractical because these flaws are not manifest through the syntax of the source code but rather through the behaviors encoded in the software, i.e., in the software semantics. ASPECT will develop technologies for querying software at this deeper semantic level by developing modeling languages for the semantics of code and programs; representing code and programs in terms of their semantics; and identifying negative patterns, potential vulnerabilities, and undesirable behaviors. One major impact sought by ASPECT is the capability to efficiently and reliably find all semantically equivalent instances of a vulnerability, as such a capability would make the information that resides in vulnerability databases far more useful to software developers and certifiers. FY 2021 Plans: - Explore methods to analyze and query codebases across multiple dimensions for the presence or absence of semantic features. - Formulate approaches for querying codebases in a language-agnostic manner while also providing quantifiable metrics of analyzability to drive software improvements.

Building on emerging technical opportunities in machine learning and symbolic reasoning, AgAI will create technological foundations for the agile creation and evolution of AI-based capabilities. Emerging technical areas that are critical to AgAI include explicit domain models, harmonization of statistical and symbolic approaches, hybridization of multiple AI methods with techniques including game theory and optimization, and meta-cognition to support rapid improvement of the AI capabilities themselves. The AgAI program will also combine emerging techniques for mathematical modeling and for explanation to enhance reliability and traceability of the developed AI capabilities.

CWC aims to provide computers with analogous capabilities to sense and encode aspects of the physical world in a perceptual structure, and to use this structure to disambiguate language. To accomplish this, CWC will apply and extend research in language, vision, gesture recognition and interpretation, dialog management, cognitive linguistics, and the psychology of visual encoding.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronic Sciences project is for basic exploration of electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits, and processing concepts to meet the military's need for near real-time information gathering, transmission, and processing. In seeking to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last few decades, the project should provide DoD with new, improved, or potentially revolutionary device options for accomplishing these critical functions. The resulting technologies should help maintain knowledge of the enemy, communicate decisions based on that knowledge, and substantially improve the cost and performance of military systems. Research areas include analog, mixed signal, and photonic circuitry for communications and other applications; alternative computer architectures; and magnetic components to reduce the size of Electromagnetic (EM) and sensing systems.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ (A-PhI) program is reducing the complexity of atomic clocks and gyroscopes by using integrated photonics for position, navigation, and timing (PNT) applications. A-PhI will demonstrate that a compact photonic integrated chip can replace the optical assembly for trapped atomic gyroscopes and clocks without degrading the performance of the device. PNT is a critical resource for all DoD missions such as communications, navigation, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare. While PNT needs are usually met by using the global positioning system (GPS), GPS signals are vulnerable to a variety of disruption modalities and a fallback from GPS is essential. Currently, in the absence of GPS, tactical grade clocks and tactical/ navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units can provide GPS-like accuracy for the short term. However, longer-term GPS independent strategies are still desirable. A-PhI will enable long-term GPS independence and enable PNT accuracy better than GPS for short durations.

Electrical bandgap determines a material breakdown voltage, intrinsic charge carrier density, color (wavelength) of light emission, and impacts the maximum output power and operating frequency of a transistor made from the material. Consequently, wide bandgaps have considerable interest for the DoD due to the need for high operating temperatures, currents, voltages, and frequencies often required by emerging high power, agile Radio Frequency (RF) sources for radar, communications, directed energy, and electronic warfare. This program will overcome the fundamental materials and device challenges that currently prevent implementation of UWBG materials into power, RF, and optoelectronic devices and systems. These challenges include reliably manufacturing low-defect substrates, heteroepitaxial material growth, and high concentration p- doping. FY 2021 Plans: - Characterize low-defect density substrates and investigate epitaxial material growth. - Develop theoretical models of high-energy performance and avalanche breakdown in UWBG materials.

For instance, tighter integration could yield smaller radar systems, higher bandwidth communication over longer ranges, improved jam resistance, and more resilient EW systems. The M3IC program is divided into three technical areas: integration of magnetic materials and systems with semiconductor technology; accurate and efficient modeling of magnetic phenomena from the molecular to the component system level; and exploitation of magnetic phenomena in innovative component designs relevant to DoD EM systems. FY 2021 Plans: - Implement and optimize micro-magnetic codes and validate circuit models in industry-standard radio frequency circuit design tools. - Demonstrate improved performance of integrated miniature components by utilizing design tools developed in the M3IC program. Title: A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) Description: The A MEchanically Based Antenna (AMEBA) program seeks to develop efficient radio frequency (RF) transmitters operating in the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) and Very Low Frequency (VLF) ranges, for portable applications in underground and underwater communications. For classical antennas, the minimum antenna size for efficient transmission is related to the wavelength of the RF signal. This fundamental property prevents reducing the size of today's ULF and VLF transmitting antennas, which can be up to a mile in length. Whereas traditional antennas generate electromagnetic waves by driving current through a conductive material, AMEBA takes a novel approach, mechanically moving an electrical charge or magnet to generate electromagnetic waves at ULF and VLF. This mechanical coupling provides unique advantages over traditional approaches at these frequencies, most notably a greater than 1,000-fold reduction in antenna size. AMEBA will focus on developing both the materials and precision-controlled electromechanical systems required for an efficient transmitter system. This new capability would enable a range of applications including wireless communications for use over very long distances and short-range underground and underwater RF links.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Beyond Scaling Sciences project supports investigations into materials, devices, and architectures to provide continued improvements in electronics performance with or without the benefit of Moore's Law (silicon scaling). Within the next ten years, traditional scaling will start to encounter the fundamental physical limits of silicon, requiring fresh approaches to new electronic systems. Over the short term, DoD will therefore need to unleash circuit specialization in order to maximize the benefit of traditional silicon. Over the longer term, DoD and the nation will need to engage the computer, material, and mechanical sciences to explore electronics improvements through new non-volatile memory devices that combine computation, and memory, and new automated design tools using machine learning. Other memory devices could also leverage an emerging understanding of the physics of magnetic states, electron spin properties, topological insulators, or phase-changing materials. Beyond Scaling programs will address fundamental exploration into each of these areas. B.

Title: Outpacing Infectious Disease Description: Military readiness and national security depend on the health and well-being of military service members. Unfortunately, today's antivirals and vaccines are often circumvented by fast-mutating viruses that evolve to develop drug resistance. Military service members often deploy to areas with such diseases that require new protective measures to maintain readiness. The Outpacing Infectious Disease program is investigating fundamental methods for using biology as a technology to create adaptive therapeutic response mechanisms to outpace viral diseases such as enabling co-evolution and co-transmission of newly developed therapeutics to ultimately outcompete the pathogen. Key advances expected from this research include identifying methods to discover and develop new classes of dynamic therapeutics for fast-mutating viruses. This approach represents a significant departure from conventional antiviral therapies, which typically rely on static solutions and continuous re- formulation and re-development in attempt to keep pace with emerging strains and disease variants. Advances in this area may be applied to the mitigation of known, new, or emerging diseases that impact military readiness and pose a national security risk as a potential pandemic.

Powerful new approaches are needed to manage the rapid growth in available sensor data, to leverage advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to maintain the security of DoD information systems. The project therefore aims not only to create larger computing platforms but also to efficiently extract information out of large and chaotic data sets with embedded and low-size, weight, and power systems. Advances in these areas will allow DoD electronic systems to collaboratively manage scarce resources, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, and to adapt to new requirements and situations. Further, the resulting technologies, by being accessible to a wide range of application developers, will support new, sustainable computing systems for a broad spectrum of scientific and engineering applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2020 RF Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS) program is addressing the performance limitations of conventional radio frequency (RF) systems such as radar, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and communications. The performance of future RF systems in the DoD will be defined by their ability to adapt and respond to their environment in real-time. We currently lack both the algorithms and computational power to manage the volume of data and complexity of decision-making that will be required. RFMLS technology will develop machine learning techniques that are able to help manage this complexity, for example, by recognizing specific emitters or detecting anomalies in a cluttered environment. The objective of the RFMLS program is to both develop these foundational technologies and to apply them to relevant DoD systems.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY Adaptive Software (IDAS) program is developing technologies to represent the intent of software and its abstract constraints separately from its concrete instantiation, for the purpose of enabling rapid code synthesis and continual adaptation. Modern weapons platforms are increasingly dependent on complex software, increasing the risk of system failures and creating new attack surfaces for adversaries. Software engineers often manage complexity by choosing a particular option that fulfills the immediate needs of the development effort (e.g., by concretization). IDAS will develop techniques for deferring software concretizations until uncertainties are resolved, either at build time or during run time, for complex systems. IDAS technology aims to significantly reduce software development time and maintenance costs, thereby enabling DoD to acquire, sustain, and improve software-based capabilities more cost-effectively.

Title: Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) Description: The Securing Information for Encrypted Verification and Evaluation (SIEVE) program is developing technology to enable the creation of mathematically verifiable public statements derived from sensitive information that remains hidden. To accomplish this, SIEVE will produce advances in a cryptographic technique known as zero knowledge (ZK) proofs, which simultaneously enable mathematical verification of public statements while provably hiding the sensitive information from which the statement is derived. The advances produced by SIEVE will make it possible to verify statements substantially more complex than the current ZK state of the art supports, for example, statements about a software vulnerability that do not reveal details of how the vulnerability can be exploited.

Title: Dispersed Computing Description: The Dispersed Computing program is developing techniques to distribute computing tasks across network computing elements to enable more efficient utilization of enterprise and Internet-based storage, processing, and networking resources. At present, enterprises and Internet-based information technology service providers are increasingly adopting the cloud model, with data storage and computer processing concentrated in large data centers. This brings economies of scale and cost savings to storage and processing, but creates problems for the network and for latency-sensitive applications due to the need to backhaul data to (often distant) data centers for processing. The Dispersed Computing program is developing a dispersed computing architecture that results in more efficient utilization of storage, processing, and networking resources. A key enabler is the recent introduction by vendors of network elements that can be dual-purposed as computational elements. These dual- purpose network-compute elements make it possible to eliminate bottlenecks/chokepoints and to mitigate impossible backhaul requirements by opportunistically moving code to data, given network conditions and available network-compute elements.

Title: Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) Description: The Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program is developing the design, analysis and verification tools needed to allow systems engineers to design-in cyber resiliency and manage tradeoffs as they do other quality attributes when designing complex embedded computing systems. The current state of practice for cyber resilience utilizes penetration testing after system construction to drive post-design re-engineering. The CASE technical approach formulates cyber resilience as an explicitly engineered property, similar to other holistic properties such as safety, durability, and reliability now standard in systems engineering. The challenge of resiliency is that it cannot be established through conventional testing methods. CASE will focus on the following technical areas: techniques to derive resilience-related requirements before system design and construction; architectural design and analysis tools to design-in the derived resilience requirements while providing feedback to the human designer to allow for informed tradeoffs between resilience and other system design goals; tools to adapt existing software to support system-level resilience requirements; and inference engines, satisfiability solvers, and provers scalable to complex networked cyber-physical systems.

Title: Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) Description: The Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) program, addressing issues encountered in the Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program, budgeted within this PE and Project, will create methods and tools to recover succinct models of domain data abstractions and logic from source code, add enhancements to the models, and convert them to performant new component implementations verified to be compatible and secure. DoD has a critical need for replacing components of existing software with more secure and more performant code, including cases where a key performance or security benefit comes from moving parts of the software to new hardware, such as utilizing hardware accelerators, isolation enclaves, offload processors, and distributed computation. However, at present, replacing legacy software components with technologically superior ones for improved performance or security faces high risk that the new software, despite being proven correct according to a specification, will not be fully compatible with the existing larger environment. Moreover, verified software is currently written from scratch, starting with a formal specification, rather than incrementally added to a system as provably compatible enhancements. V-SPELLS will address these problems by combining novel concepts in verified programming with recent developments in domain specific languages (DSLs) and systems architecture. V-SPELLS technology will iteratively and interactively leverage automated program understanding to semi-automatically derive a DSL for the targeted component of a large code base, translate the code for the component into this DSL while concurrently inferring its specification within the larger environment, and then generate, optimize, and distribute executable artifacts across the system, creating and validating relevant proofs. V-SPELLS aims to enable piecewise, compatible-by-construction improvement of software components in legacy DoD systems, providing to incremental software (re)engineering the benefits of formal software verification currently available only to clean-slate development efforts.

Title: Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) Description: The Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program is developing automated systems to enable a black start recovery of the U.S. power grid amidst a cyber attack on the energy sector's critical infrastructure. The RADICS program aims to enable skilled cyber and power engineers to rapidly restore electrical service after an attack that challenges the recovery capabilities of the impacted organizations (e.g., utilities, balancing authorities, independent system operators, bulk power markets). The potential for a cyber-enabled attack on the U.S. power grid is a national security issue, as the ability of the military to deploy and project force is dependent on the effective and efficient functioning of civilian logistics and supply systems. The program will develop technologies to monitor heterogeneous distributed networks, detect anomalies that require rapid assessment, isolate compromised system elements, establish secure emergency communications networks, characterize attacks, and detect sensor spoofing. The technology development is coordinated with and will transition to U.S. Government elements responsible for the defense of critical infrastructure. FY 2021 Plans: - Test inoperability of a utility to utility radio communication network that would facilitate integration and coordination among independent and disparate organizations in a large-scale trans-regional black start scenario. - Collaborate with private industry, DOE, DHS, DoD, and other stakeholders to demonstrate enhanced capabilities for black start restoration of a power grid amidst a cyber-attack. - Harden and transition technology and capabilities to U.S. Government, National Guard, and industry.

Brandeis technologies can resolve the tension between maintaining privacy and being able to tap into the huge value of data. In the civilian sphere, there is a recognized need for technologies that enable the controlled sharing of information between commercial entities and U.S. Government agencies. Similarly, the U.S. military is increasingly involved in operations that require highly selective sharing of data with a heterogeneous mix of allies, coalition partners, and other stakeholders. Brandeis technologies are designed to work with the virtualization, cloud computing, and software-defined networking technologies now widely used in both civilian and military environments.6.620 - - Title: Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) Description: The Extreme Distributed Denial of Service Defense (XD3) program developed new computer networking architectures that deter, detect, and overcome distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks include both high- volume flooding attacks and more subtle low-volume attacks that evade traditional intrusion detection systems while exhausting server processing and memory. These attacks will accelerate as the Internet of Things (IoT) incorporates new classes of devices that in many cases will be deployed with inadequate security controls: attackers will conscript poorly defended IoT devices into their botnets.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project develops technologies to enable machines to function not only as tools that facilitate human action but also as trusted partners to human operators. Of particular interest are systems that can understand human language and extract information and reliably categorize content contained in diverse media; answer questions, reach conclusions, and propose explanations; and learn, reason, and apply knowledge gained through experience to respond intelligently to new and unforeseen events. Enabling computing systems with such human-like intelligence is now of critical importance because the tempo of military operations in emerging domains exceeds that at which unaided humans can orient, understand, and act. The technologies developed in the Artificial Intelligence and Human-Machine Symbiosis project will enable warfighters to make better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; intelligence analysts to make sense of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; software developers and certifiers to design, implement, evaluate, and accredit cyber-physical systems and other complex software-reliant systems with greater efficiency and confidence; and unmanned systems and semi-autonomous agents to perform critical missions in contested physical and virtual environments safely and reliably. This Project includes FY 2020 CARES Act funding in the amount of $.619 million to apply artificial intelligence (AI)-based models to rapidly screen, prioritize and test Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics for new COVID-19 drug candidates.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2020 Title: Description: The Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AAI) program seeks to go beyond commercially-driven advances in AI and to address important national security challenge applications. In particular, this program is focused on improving human-AI collaborations to mitigate current bottlenecks in DoD's ability to rapidly adapt and deploy new technologies and capabilities. If successful, research efforts under this program will significantly accelerate the pace of innovation in many important DoD domains while also reducing the time and cost associated with approval and certification processes needed to transition and deploy new technologies. One technical challenge to be addressed in this program is the need to assess current developmental, approval, and certification processes and identify tasks or sub-tasks amenable to greater automation with minimal human intervention. Other challenges include the need to develop social context aware AI systems and to ensure robustness of AI systems, particularly in novel and/or unanticipated situations.

Title: Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) Description: The Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence (AI) Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) program is developing AI and machine learning technologies to aid a human operator in understanding complex sequences of events in the world. For the purposes of KAIROS, an event is an occurrence that results in an observable and recognizable change in either the physical world or human activity. Events of particular interest to KAIROS are those that create changes that have significant impact on national or homeland security. The KAIROS program will develop automated systems that codify existing event-representation schemas and, when needed, create and codify new schemas to bring structure to complex event sequences and present these structured representations to operators. Given multi-media inputs, operators will use KAIROS technologies to identify subsidiary event elements, determine their temporal order, recognize complex event sequences, and link disparate events. KAIROS technologies aim to enable analysts and warfighters to understand unfolding events rapidly and accurately. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop and assess the capability for machine learning of complex schemas from large multimedia data sets. - Develop and evaluate the capability for matching unfiltered simple events from unconstrained large data sets to an initial schema library.13.000 21.100 19.000 Volume 1 - 79 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 30 of 36 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 - Develop and assess machine learning classifiers for categorizing the temporal and causal relationship between two simple events that are part of a complex event sequence. - Collaborate with transition partners to establish thresholds for mission utility for anticipating future events that are part of partially-observed complex events in operational data.

Title: Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) Description: The Active Interpretation of Disparate Alternatives (AIDA) program is developing a multi-hypothesis semantic engine that generates alternative interpretations of events, situations, and trends from a variety of unstructured sources where there are noisy, conflicting, and potentially deceptive data. At present, information from each medium is often analyzed independently, without the context provided by information from other media, with only informal comparison among competing hypotheses. The consequence of this can be inadequate interpretations, because alternatives are eliminated due to lack of evidence even in the absence of contradictory evidence. AIDA seeks to develop and demonstrate technology to automatically map information derived from diverse media into a common semantic representation, aggregate information, resolve ambiguities, discover conflicting information, and generate and explore multiple interpretations of events, situations, and trends. AIDA aims to provide decision makers a capability to understand alternative explanations for available information and to make contingency plans accordingly.

FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2022 decrease reflects the shift from development of techniques for generating multiple alternative interpretations from multimedia data to evaluations of techniques on real-world data. Title: Assured Autonomy Description: The Assured Autonomy program is developing rigorous design and analysis technologies for continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems to enhance system safety in uncertain environments. Currently, the state of the art for test, evaluation, verification, and validation is only applicable to non-learning systems operating in well-characterized environments. As a result, autonomous systems enabled by machine learning (e.g., deep neural nets for perception, reinforcement learning for control policies, and online model learning) lack rigorous safety assurance. Assured Autonomy is developing new techniques for modeling and system design, formal verification, simulation-based testing, and safety-assured learning to provide continual assurance of learning-enabled autonomous systems. The technologies being developed in Assured Autonomy will enable the DoD to more rapidly and efficiently deploy learning-enabled autonomous systems that can be trusted to operate safely in uncertain environments.

Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Description: The Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program is developing a new generation of machine learning techniques that are able to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future. AI is a critical enabler for U.S. military systems that will perform increasingly complex and sensitive missions. However, in order for developers, users, and senior leaders to feel confident enough to deploy and use AI-enabled systems, these systems must be able to explain their rationale, and their recommendations, decisions, and actions must be delivered in a way that military users can understand and trust. Today, most machine learning systems provide no explanations, or provide explanations that are at the wrong level of abstraction, not meaningful to a human user, or inconsistent with the full range of behaviors of the AI system. XAI is developing the tools necessary to build explainable AI systems, specifically with: (1) new machine learning techniques that produce human-interpretable models and (2) user interfaces that generate explanations from those models that are meaningful to end-users, using natural language, saliency maps, and other representations. XAI implementations will be developed and demonstrated in next-generation data analytics and autonomous systems. FY 2021 Plans: - Enhance explainable systems for robustness to increased machine learning task complexity. - Expand the cognitive model of explanation based on task performance evaluations. - Measure system explainability, accuracy, and learning performance against additional datasets and scenarios. - Select and integrate subsets of explainable model techniques in prototype systems for capability demonstrations coordinated with DoD and Intelligence Community (IC) partners.

Title: Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) Description: The Engineering Artificial Intelligence Systems Implementations (EAISI) program will create technologies and tools to support the development of viable and trusted systems that include AI and machine learning (ML) capabilities. Modern AI- dependent systems may include multiple AI components, drawing on a diverse set of AI-related techniques, ranging from ML to knowledge representation, search, planning, game theory, and optimization. Current methods for development of such systems remains primarily based on trial-and-error designs, with limited abstractions, architectures, and patterns. These developments can be costly, risky, and demanding of very high levels of expertise. To address this, EAISI will develop abstractions, patterns, architectures, assurance techniques, and iterative processes that facilitate the analysis and synthesis of complex systems that must rely on AI-based components and associated training data. One of the more difficult engineering challenges with AI is evaluation and assurance, since AI-based systems tend to resist traditional approaches to testing, inspection, and analysis. It is not possible to fully test an AI-based system for every situation it will ever encounter, so new techniques are needed for verifying and validating AI-based systems. EAISI aims to create software and systems engineering techniques, tools, and practices to facilitate the development of AI-based systems that are capable, trustworthy, affordable, and timely. FY 2021 Plans: - Formulate rigorous approaches for managing training data for AI-based systems, including provenance, security, and quality in the engineering of an AI-based system. - Devise approaches for testing, analyzing, and evaluating AI-based systems as means for gaining confidence in and validating those systems. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop prototype tools for managing training data for AI-based systems, including provenance, security, and quality in the engineering of an AI-based system. - Develop prototype tools for testing, analyzing, and evaluating AI-based systems including intuitive visualization techniques that give users a realistic understanding of the confidence that is warranted when validating those systems.- 7.300 9.800 Volume 1 - 83 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 34 of 36 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 - Devise a framework and associated interfaces for integrating prototype tools in an AI systems engineering development environment for use by developers and evaluators who are not experts in AI. reflects ramping up of the development of AI systems engineering technologies and their integration in an AI systems engineering development environment for use by developers and evaluators who are not experts in AI. Title: Counter Adversarial Artificial Intelligence Description: The Counter Adversarial Artificial Intelligence program aims to enhance the capability to detect, deflect, and diminish the effects of adversarial attacks on AI-based systems. Defense systems increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities such as machine learning and automated reasoning. These AI-enabled systems are typically engineered and optimized for environments where adversary systems are either static or strictly limited in terms of adaptive behaviors. Engagements between sophisticated AI-enabled systems are likely to become increasingly common going forward. Maintaining AI-superiority for the U.S. will require systems with higher levels of capability. Specific capabilities to be developed include recognizing when an adversary system is AI-enabled, identifying and modeling adversary AI capabilities based on empirical data, and creating counter-AI strategies including techniques to render adversary AI capabilities ineffective and/or deleterious. FY 2022 Plans: - Begin modeling the range of potential adversarial AI behaviors, including the nature of vulnerabilities in machine learning components and symbolic AI components. - Conceptualize AI systems with capabilities to detect, deflect, and diminish the effects of adversarial attacks. - Formulate approaches for recognizing when an adversary system is AI-enabled, identifying and modeling adversary AI capabilities based on empirical data, and countering adversary AI strategies including techniques to render AI capabilities ineffective and/or deleterious. FY 2021 to FY Artificial Intelligence Reliability and Traceability (AIRT) Description: The Artificial Intelligence Reliability and Traceability (AIRT) program will develop design-time and run-time technologies to ensure the correct functioning of AI-enabled systems. As AI deployment scales up, it becomes more important for machine learning (ML) systems to be explainable, which means providing rationale for classifications, characterizing confidence level of the classifications, and, as a consequence, conveying understanding of how the system will behave with similar inputs. Explainability, however, is not sufficient to ensure that ML systems meet reliability requirements, in the sense that the ML operates consistently with domain-focused predictive models, nor traceable, in the sense that there are mappings between the models and- - 15.000 Volume 1 - 84 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 35 of 36 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) 2021 FY 2022 the ML behaviors. AIRT will develop the test, evaluation, verification, and validation (TEVV) technologies that system developers need to ensure that AI-enabled systems will correctly perform their intended functions. The AIRT TEVV technologies will address the challenge of how to specify AI-related behaviors and then how to verify the specified behaviors using both analytic formal approaches, which emphasize mathematical modeling and reasoning, and traditional statistical-sampling based approaches. AIRT will also develop design principles for machine learning and related systems that enhance reliability and traceability without appreciable compromise to reasoning capability. Additionally, AIRT will develop traceability approaches that model the learning behavior of an AI component to enable developers, testers, and operators to gain detailed knowledge of how the AI system reached a computational state. The AIRT program aims to make the design and operation of AI systems more scientific and safe. FY 2022 Plans: - Formulate approaches for TEVV of AI-enabled systems to increase confidence in correct performance of intended functions. - Explore TEVV approaches that include means to specify intended AI-related behaviors and that combine analytic formal approaches, which emphasize mathematical modeling and reasoning, with traditional statistical-sampling based approaches. - Introduce traceability approaches akin to check-pointing and other roll-back techniques that can enhance knowledge of how an AI system reached a computational state. Control System Introspection Description: The Control System Introspection program seeks to develop machine introspection and learning technologies to characterize a damaged or modified military platform from its behavior, and update the control law to maintain stability and control. A platform equipped with Control System Introspection technologies will continually compare the real-time behavior of the platform as measured by on-board sensors with a learned model, determine if the current observed behavior of the platform differs from that model in ways that might compromise stability and control, and implement an updated control law when required. The current approach to handling platform damage or modification places the burden of recovery and control on the operator, whether the operator is human or an autonomous controller. In contrast, the Control System Introspection capability would aid operators in maintaining effective control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or have been modified in the field to address emergent requirements identified during operations. FY 2022 Plans: - Explore machine introspection and learning approaches for identifying the behavioral characteristics of a platform in terms of the transfer function and related control-theoretic models in real time. - Architect machine introspection and learning algorithms that can run in the background on platforms for which the available computational resources are limited.- - 10.000 Volume 1 - 85 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 36 of 36 R-1 Line #15Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / INTELLIGENCE in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2022 - Design and implement an operator-in-the-loop testbed for assessing integrated machine introspection and learning approaches for recovery and control of military platforms that suffer damage in battle or are modified in the field. FY 2021 to FY 2022 reflects program Title: Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) Description: The Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents (LORELEI) program developed technology to rapidly field machine translation and other language processing capabilities for low-resource foreign languages. The U.S. military operates globally, and frequently encounters low-resource languages, which are languages for which few linguists are available and automated human language technologies do not exist. Processing foreign language materials requires protracted effort, and current systems rely on huge, manually-translated, manually-transcribed, or manually-annotated data sets. As a result, systems currently exist only for languages in widespread use and in high demand. LORELEI took a different approach by leveraging language-universal resources, projecting from related-language resources, and fully exploiting a broad range of language-specific resources. The resulting capabilities can rapidly provide situational awareness based on information from low resource languages encountered during emergent missions such as humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, terrorist attack response, peacekeeping, and infectious disease response.4.000 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 139.824 178.162 193.274 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Tactical Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because it supports the advancement of concepts and technologies to enhance the next generation of tactical systems. The Tactical Technology Program Element funds a number of projects in the areas of Naval Warfare, Advanced Land Systems, Aeronautics Technology and Information Analytics Technology. The Naval Warfare Technology project develops advanced technologies for application to a broad range of naval requirements. Enabling and novel technologies include concepts for expanding the envelope of operational naval capabilities to include the entire sea column such as improved situational awareness over large maritime environments, ship self-defense techniques, novel underwater propulsion modalities, vessels for estuary and riverine operations, high speed underwater vessels, improved techniques for underwater object detection and discrimination, long endurance unmanned surface vehicles, methods and techniques for servicing assets throughout the sea column, and high bandwidth communications. The Advanced Land Systems Technology project is developing technologies for enhancing U.S. military effectiveness and survivability in operations ranging from traditional threats to military operations against irregular forces that can employ disruptive or catastrophic capabilities, or disrupt stabilization operations. Programs seek to break the relative symmetry of land combat to give U.S. forces a decided advantage in the current and future ground battlefield. The emphasis is on developing affordable technologies that reduce reliance on consolidated forward-operating bases and required lines of communication, and provide small units and individual warfighters with hyper-mobility and hyper-lethality. Aeronautics Technology efforts will address high payoff opportunities that dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced aeronautical and aerospace systems and/or provide revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military mission requirements. This includes advanced technology studies of revolutionary propulsion, vehicle, and launch concepts, sophisticated fabrication methods, and examination of novel materials and enabling technologies for aeronautic and aerospace system applications.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ 2021 FY System (MAD-FIRES) Description: The Multi-Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement (MAD-FIRES) program seeks to develop a point defense system against today's most stressing threats by developing a highly maneuverable, medium caliber, guided projectile, fire sequencing and control system capable of neutralizing large threat raids of high speed, highly maneuverable targets. Leveraging recent advancements in gun hardening, miniaturization of guided munition components, and long-range sensors, MAD-FIRES advances fire control technologies, medium caliber gun technologies, and guided projectile technologies enabling the multiple, simultaneous target, kinetic engagement mission at greatly reduced costs. MAD-FIRES seeks to achieve lethality overmatch through accuracy rather than size, thus expanding the role of smaller combat platforms into missions where they have been traditionally outgunned. MAD-FIRES, sized as a medium caliber system, enhances flexibility for installment as a new ship self-defense system. This phase of the project will end with testing against subsonic targets. The final phase of supersonic testing is funded in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02.

Title: Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) Description: The Urban Reconnaissance through Supervised Autonomy (URSA) program is developing and demonstrating new autonomous agents and techniques that support a Blue Force Commander in managing the complexity and ambiguity of urban spaces by rapidly identifying and discriminating among potential threats during missions ranging from minutes to hours. The program uses perception-enabled autonomous vehicles to manage complexity and interactions with populations to drive down the ambiguity between peaceful civilians and threats. The program seeks to create a system of autonomous ground and air platforms operating in conjunction with U.S. ground forces that monitor an area overtly to detect hostile forces and establish Positive Identification (PID) before any U.S. troops come into contact. Military units follow strict rules of engagement (ROEs) that prescribe an escalation of force appropriate with the level of hostilities and confidence that an individual is engaged in nefarious behavior. This program will establish a Legal, Moral, Ethical (LME) working group comprising multiple individuals (technologists, military, university professors, ethicists, legal experts) to develop an understanding of how escalation and/or de-escalation of force can and should be appropriately applied in the context of supervised autonomous systems. URSA is exploring scenarios and probing behaviors that will enable identifying innocent civilians and individuals who pose a threat to U.S. Forces, allies, or non-combat civilians. This mission requires the integration and maturation of novel sensors, and unmanned ground and air vehicles which leverage current techniques in perspective and reactive autonomy to navigate cluttered urban environments. URSA is developing new search and engagement behaviors to disambiguate human actions and serve as evidence that a potential target is a threat. It is implementing new dimensions of evidence such as the human reactions to these engagements to improve confidence in its decisions, and building a novel framework for escalating and de-escalating nonlethal force. FY 2021 Plans: - Continue to develop and increase the fidelity of the URSA Integrated Testbed (UIT) for iterative evaluation of expanding URSA system capability. - Develop test infrastructure for live URSA field demonstrations. - Begin evaluating system performance with incremental field demonstrations in increasingly complex and varying urban environments.

The Army intends to deploy autonomous robotic combat vehicles and optionally manned fighting vehicles to accomplish this objective. In order to meet the demands of an MDO environment, significant advances in perception, planning, and control algorithms are required to autonomously maneuver faster and more resiliently in complex and novel off-road environments. Maneuver environments are characterized by three-dimensional surfaces of highly compliant soils and vegetation, hundreds of positive and negative obstacle classes, no defined road networks or driving rules, and where use of terrain for survivability is critical. In order to achieve operationally relevant speeds and resilience to novel situations on the future battlefield, while simultaneously reducing the Soldier cognitive and communications burden and increasing battle space awareness, RACER will demonstrate game-changing autonomous ground combat vehicle mobility using a combination of simulation and advanced platforms. RACER will deliver autonomy algorithms using the latest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine-learning techniques, a code repository, an off-road simulation environment tailored for military off-road autonomy development, tactical route planning methods and field-demonstrated off-road autonomous capabilities. The culmination of the RACER program will be to demonstrate fully autonomous maneuver on a military Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in a variety of militarily relevant environments. FY 2021 Plans: - Complete assessment of sensors and detection techniques, size weight and power for demonstration vehicles. - Initiate assessments of off-road autonomy simulation technologies. - Initiate testing of off-road autonomy algorithms using subscale vehicles. - Conduct testing of autonomy algorithms on surrogate vehicles. - Initiate code repository of AI-based autonomy algorithms. FY 2022 Plans: - Initiate Government-hosted field experiments. - Initiate large-scale combat vehicle platform preparations. - Demonstrate off-road autonomy simulation technologies. - Demonstrate off-road speeds and interventions comparable to best human driver capability. - Increase the complexity of capability demonstrations.

Title: Proportional Weapons Description: The Proportional Weapons program will pursue a real-time capability to analyze and apply proportional effects for families of weapons that suppress or breach any external structure to neutralize threats, clear spaces at range, keep them intact, and minimize collateral damage. Novel approaches are needed that are effective from the air or ground against several scales of threats while not being catastrophically destructive. Current approaches to identifying, engaging, and assessing effects against evasive ground targets requires significant human oversight combined with human semantic reasoning tied to rules of execution, resulting in slow and methodical engagements. Proportional weapons will study systems that provide extended range and tunable effects. Proposed technical approaches will be scalable for application to dismounted warfighters, vehicle-borne (air and ground) systems, or as human-in-the-loop payloads for future autonomous platforms. FY 2021 Plans: - Conduct performance trade studies of air and ground systems and conduct effects analysis that support concepts development leading to a future platform. - Translate performance trade studies of air and ground systems and effects analysis into prototype concepts development leading to a future platform. FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease 2.000 - Title: Competing in Undergoverned Spaces Description: A vast majority of U.S. technology is focused on gaining competitive advantage against near peer adversaries in kinetic engagements where there are known rules and players, concrete timelines and clear winners and losers. While these finite games are important, many critical engagements are actually infinite contests, where activities occur over long periods, often involving third parties with an ultimate goal of resetting the regional power and influence equilibrium. Competing in these contests is critical for successful stabilization and Humanitarian Assistance Disaster Relief (HADR) missions, as well as operations in undergoverned spaces, where local governance is sufficiently weak such that internal or external parties can compete for influence over the local population (e.g., Syria). This program will develop technologies that are focused on successfully competing in infinite contests by developing tools for constant acting, assessing and adapting (i.e., iterative Hypothesis A/B testing). Specific areas of interest include information, influence or economic tools that rapidly adapt to the environment to yield specific, effects that can be sensed. This includes developing new options to engage friendly/non-friendly local populations while minimizing the social impact of stabilization. Other areas of interest include sensing tools designed to update pre-existing models to support decision making, and decision tools designed to adapt to changing population or adversary actions.- - 10.460 Volume 1 - 99 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 24 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 TACTICAL (Number/Name) TT-04 / ADVANCED LAND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY B.

FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease Statement: program initiation. Title: Mobile Force Protection (MFP) Description: The goal of the Mobile Force Protection (MFP) program is to develop and demonstrate an integrated system capable of defeating a raid of self-guided small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) attacking a high value convoy on the move. By focusing on protecting mobile assets, the program is emphasizing low footprint solutions, in terms of size, weight, power (SWaP), and manning, which will benefit other counter-UAS missions and result in more affordable systems. Defending in a variety of operating environments against these sUAS threats and associated concept of operations requires several breakthroughs in affordable technology to sense, decide and act on a compressed timeline while mitigating collateral damage. The program is developing solutions applicable to the defense of mobile ground and naval forces that can also potentially defeat more conventional threats. The solution will be scalable and modular such that it can be deployed in multiple defense applications and does not become obsolete with evolving threat capability.

FY 2021 Plans: - Finalize concept of operation, system architecture, and demonstration test plans. - Integrate enabling technologies and test system performance. - Verify technologies meet required speed and accuracy threshold. FY 2021 to FY Title: Squad X Description: The U.S. military achieves overmatch against its adversaries in certain regimes; however, this level of overmatch is not realized at the squad to individual dismounted warfighter level. The goal of the Squad X program was to leverage advances in real-time situational awareness and mission command; organic three-dimensional dismount mobility; extended range tracking, targeting, and response; and unmanned mobility and perception in order to create a squad with substantial combat overmatch. The concept of overmatch at the squad level included increased human stand-off, a smaller force density, and adaptive sensing to allow for responses at multiple scales. Squad X explored advanced wearable force protection, advanced organic squad level direct and indirect trajectory precision weaponry, and non-kinetic precision capabilities. The end result of the Squad X program was an individual dismount unit outfitted with sensors, weaponry, and supporting technology to achieve unit level overmatch as well as the overall integration of unmanned assets alongside the dismounts to create an advanced, dismounted small unit. FY 2021 Plans: - Demonstrate artificial intelligence decision aids and autonomous behaviors to augment small unit tactics with significant increase in situational awareness and tactical advantage.16.240 3.000 - Volume 1 - 101 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 24 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 TACTICAL (Number/Name) TT-04 / ADVANCED LAND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY B.

The urban environment creates unique challenges in providing solutions for mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and concealment. Every pound that a warfighter wears or carries reduces their mobility and mission effectiveness, and, particularly in urban combat, reduced mobility paradoxically reduces their survivability. The Rapunzel program sought to enable warfighters to manipulate the urban environment through the application of novel materials research. Rapunzel envisioned soldier-borne or vehicle-borne utility-belt style packaged containers, reels, and spools of material that can perform urban engineering tasks such as create bridges between building rooftops, pull down enemy barriers, or provide false targets and concealment. The program identified those mass-manufactured materials, such as extremely high-tensile strength monofilament that can both provide novel mobility between buildings but also provide novel counter-mobility to enemy vehicles due to their electrical conductance properties. The Rapunzel program leveraged extensive existing research into early developmental materials and invest in the task-based development and packing to provide these materials at appropriate length and size scales for immediate tactical use.4.000 - - Laser Eye Protection Research FY 2021 Plans: - Conduct research in Counter Directed Energy Laser Eye Protection.- 4.000 Congressional Adds Subtotals - 4.000 C.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) (SemaFor) program is developing technologies to defend against the falsification of multimedia and disinformation campaigns. Statistical detection techniques have been successful, but media generation and manipulation technology is advancing rapidly, including imagery, voice, video, text, and other modalities. Purely statistical detection methods are now insufficient to detect these manipulations, especially when multiple modalities are involved. Existing media generation and manipulation algorithms are data driven and are prone to making semantic errors that provide defenders an opportunity for asymmetric advantage. SemaFor is developing semantic and statistical analysis algorithms that determine if media is generated or manipulated, attribution algorithms that infer if media originates from a particular organization or individual, and characterization algorithms that reason about whether media was falsified (generated or manipulated) for malicious purposes. SemaFor aims to create technologies to identify, deter, and understand adversary media falsification. FY 2021 Plans: - Create techniques for using multi-source semantic information to detect, attribute, and characterize inconsistent and potentially falsified media, such as news articles or social media posts, and to develop mechanisms for explaining algorithmically-generated semantic inferences on multimedia. - Develop an initial semantic forensics system prototype, and evaluate performance on existing and purpose-built text, image, video, and audio datasets.10.450 19.700 23.421 Volume 1 - 107 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 24 R-1 Line #19Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 (Number/Name) TT-13 / INFORMATION ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) Description: The Adapting Cross-domain Kill-Webs (ACK) program is assisting military decision makers with rapidly identifying and selecting options for tasking and re-tasking assets within and across organizational boundaries. Based on technologies developed in the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contest Environment (RSPACE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), ACK will assist users with selecting sensors, effectors, and support elements across military domains (space, air, land, surface, subsurface, and cyber) to form and adapt kill chains to deliver desired effects on targets. Today's Command and Control (C2) organizations and processes cannot support multi-domain warfighting concepts, especially during joint operations. ACK will address this challenge by utilizing a decentralized approach to allocating resources to tasks and assigning mission orders to assets, motivated by ideas developed in online commerce, sourcing, and supply chain management, such as bid requests and offers. The impact of ACK will be to accelerate asset re-allocation and assignment decision timelines to be on the order of minutes, and the output of ACK will be automated tools and decision aids to support the selection of the elements of a kill-chain and assignment of roles and responsibilities to each of the elements.

Increasingly, competitors and adversaries are using information operations to project soft power. Competitor and adversary influence campaigns can be overt in the form of anti-U.S. messaging, or they can be disguised in the form of complex narratives that seek to advance agendas harmful to U.S. interests. The USG and DoD need the capability to rapidly detect and understand competitor and adversary messaging campaigns and narratives within the context of the populations and groups for whom they are intended. To accomplish this, the program will develop and operationalize natural language processing, semantic analysis, social network analysis, psychographics, and behavioral science-based technologies, and integrate these into a unified information operations modeling framework and sensemaking platform. INCAS aims to produce a suite of largely automated digital tools to enable analysts to better understand how information is being used by competitors and adversaries, and to quantitatively assess in real time and at scale the effects of influence campaigns and of countermeasures. FY 2021 Plans: - Formulate influence indicators that can be used to detect competitor and adversary influence campaigns from messages and narratives. - Explore the potential for natural language processing and semantic analysis techniques to extract an agenda from influence indicators and context, and for psychographic and behavioral science-based techniques to measure the receptivity of populations and groups to influence messages and narratives.

Active duty military personnel face increased risk of acute and chronic neuropsychiatric dysfunction, limiting day-to-day function and return to duty. Current therapeutic approaches for many neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD], mood disorders, and substance abuse) rely on individual management with integrated psychiatric therapy and medication. However, most interventions approved for use in these conditions lack long-term efficacy, involve a logistical burden of treatment and/or carry a risk of serious adverse side effects. The Restoring Cognitive Capability program is developing and testing novel drug chemotypes designed to functionally interact with neuronal receptor subtypes known to play a role in these neuropsychiatric conditions, with the aim of enabling fast-acting and effective alleviation of neuropsychiatric dysfunction with single or minimal doses.8.498 11.178 11.423 Volume 1 - 127 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602715E: MATERIALS AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 14 of 19 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 / BIOLOGICALLY BASED MATERIALS AND FY 2021 Plans: - Continue in vitro functional testing of novel molecules. - Develop novel biosensors for assessment of drug uptake and distribution. - Continue assembly and validation in vivo of behavioral assays.

Title: Atmospheric Water Extraction (AWE) Description: The Atmospheric Water Extraction program aims to enable water harvesting directly from the atmosphere by leveraging new materials and advanced engineering and manufacturing techniques to alleviate the logistical and tactical burden of the water supply chain. Currently, the DoD relies on purification of existing water sources and/or distribution of bottled or treated water to provide the warfighter with sufficient daily hydration. State-of-the-art water-from-air generation systems are not suitable for military applications because the systems do not operate in a range of atmospheric conditions needed by our soldiers, from arid conditions (<40% relative humidity) to extremely humid, and are too energy-intensive (<7 gallons of water output per gallon of fuel). This program will deliver systems with extraordinarily low size, weight, and power (SWaP) characteristics to provide potable water to individual warfighters, and expeditionary units. Technologies developed under this program will provide strategic and tactical advantages aligned with the DoD's vision of future combat operations carried out by distributed and self-sustaining forces.

Title: Bio-Inspired Coastal Defense Description: Building upon technologies discovered in the Persistent Aquatic Living Sensors (PALS) program, the Bio-Inspired Coastal Defense program will develop self-sustaining, hybrid man-made and biological reef structures to fortify and defend DoD bases in low-lying coastal regions. Military assets in these coastal regions are vulnerable to storm surges, wave action, and sea-level rise that cause erosion, degrade infrastructure, and impede operations. Innovative coastal defense will require major technological advances in (1) design, construction, and placement of manufactured reef primers, (2) accelerated recruitment and/ or growth of reef species, and (3) sustained, zero-cost natural maintenance and improvement (e.g., increased durability after challenge) of the defensive reef. The primary benefit of such structures is to attenuate wave height during storm events for both established and under construction coastal facilities. This approach could also mitigate ongoing threats posed by state and non- state actors that seek to penetrate, mine, or damage harbors using unmanned underwater vehicles as delivery mechanisms. FY 2022 Plans: - Design and fabricate structural components to achieve target wave energy attenuation in wave tank simulations. - Demonstrate the efficacy of reef-building approaches under laboratory conditions. - Conduct laboratory experiments to promote improved temperature tolerance for reef-building organisms.

Conventional methods to defend against these threats are generally slow and ineffective. This program will leverage recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology to enable rapid delivery of gene therapies to plants for large-scale trait modification, improving resilience against adversary attack or emerging natural threats. Research within this program will develop an agnostic, scalable capability for protecting entire crop systems from emerging threats posed to food security by U.S. adversaries. FY 2021 Plans: - Demonstrate successful insect delivery of a virus to targeted plants in a diverse plant community, without off-target effects, in a contained environment. - Employ and validate conditional lethal approach restricts viral delivery and limits propagation of virus, insect, and plant trait acquisition. - Verify protective traits delivered to a diverse plant community results in mitigation of an environmental stressor. Title: Enhancing Neuroplasticity Description: The DoD needs tools to rapidly and effectively train military personnel in multifaceted and complex tasks.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Electronics Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Applied Research Budget Activity because its objective is to develop electronics that make a wide range of military applications possible. The Electronics Technology Project focuses on turning basic advancements into the underpinning technologies required to address critical national security issues and to enable an information-driven warfighter. This Program Element also supports innovation and robust transition planning in the technology cycle by working with entrepreneurs to increase the likelihood that DARPA funded technologies take root in the U.S. and provide new capabilities for national defense. Advances in microelectronic device technologies continue to significantly benefit improved weapons effectiveness, intelligence capabilities, and information superiority. The Electronic Technology project supports continued advancement in microelectronics, including electronic and optoelectronic devices, Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS), semiconductor device design and fabrication, and new materials and material structures. Particular focuses of this work include reducing the barriers to designing and fabricating custom electronics and exploiting improved manufacturing techniques to provide low-cost, high-performance sensors. Programs in this project will also greatly improve the size, weight, power, and performance characteristics of electronic systems; support positioning, navigation, and timing in GPS-denied environments; and develop sensors more sensitive and robust than today's standards. This project has six major focus areas: Electronics, Photonics, MicroElectroMechanical Systems, Architectures, Algorithms, and other Electronic Technology research. The Beyond Scaling Technology project recognizes that, within the next decade, the continuous pace of improvements in electronics performance will face the fundamental limits of silicon technology. This project will therefore pursue electronics performance advancements that do not rely on Moore's Law but instead exploit new concepts in circuit specialization, by the optimization of materials, architectures, and designs to achieve specific circuit function at high performance. Because electronics advancements must simultaneously make progress in performance and secure the foundation on which our digital infrastructure relies, this envisioned electronics specialization will require incorporation of security safeguards. Accordingly, programs within the Beyond Scaling project will reduce barriers to making specialized circuits in today's silicon hardware and significantly increase the ease with which DoD can design, deliver, and eventually upgrade critical, customized electronics. Programs also explore alternatives to traditional circuit architectures, for instance by exploiting vertical circuit integration to optimize electronic devices and by incorporating novel materials, and new techniques for securing DoD and commercial data and hardware.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) Description: The Atomic Magnetometry for Biological Imaging In Earth's Native Terrain (AMBIIENT) program is developing novel magnetic sensors capable of providing high-sensitivity signal measurements in the presence of ambient magnetic fields. The AMBIIENT program will exploit novel physical architectures that are resistant to the impact of common noise sources. The AMBIIENT sensor itself must be able to detect the gradient of a local magnetic field while subtracting the much larger ambient signal. This would enable low-cost, portable, high-sensitivity measurements for in-the-field applications.

The ability to create tunable and reconfigurable bandpass and bandstop filters in the range of 2-18 gigahertz will be important for implementing transmit/receive modules in next-generation multi-function arrays. Another important area of interference mitigation is self-interference. WARP will develop the signal cancellation technology that will listen to the transmitted interfering signal and subtract it from the input of the receiver so faint signals near the noise floor can still be detected. Program research will provide feedback mechanisms that intelligently correct these problems. Whether for self- induced interference or external interference jamming, WARP will develop intelligent filtering and self-interference cancellation technologies to protect wideband DoD receivers. FY 2021 Plans: - Demonstrate new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable frequency tuning of band pass and band stop filters in chip-scale size for use in next generation wideband receivers for DoD systems.11.200 19.845 19.141 Volume 1 - 138 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 22 R-1 Line #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 ELT-01 Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 - Demonstrate new materials, devices and/or circuit architectures that will enable cancellation of signal leakage between two adjacent antennas for simultaneous transmit and receive electronic warfare applications on small platforms.

In addition to being diagnostically relevant, such sensitive magnetometers could enable future human-machine/brain-machine interfaces. The DoD and industry also use magnetometers for magnetic anomaly detection, which may allow for the discovery of mineral/oil deposits, discovery of old wellheads, or the detection of improvised explosive devices. In addition, magnetometers offer the possibility of magnetic navigation, which may operate in GPS-denied environments. Recent developments have resulted in the potential to develop highly sensitive vector magnetometers, which would enable the consequent development of sensitive full tensor gradient sensors. Such tensors offer more degrees of freedom than their scalar or vector counterparts and potentially provide additional information about the source.

Title: Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) Description: The Fast Event-based Neuromorphic Camera and Electronics (FENCE) program, building upon technologies developed in the FOCII program (budgeted within this PE and Project) will develop and demonstrate a low latency, low power event-based infrared (IR) camera to enable intelligent sensors for tactical DoD applications. Event-based imagers are an emerging class of sensors with major demonstrated advantages relative to traditional cameras. State of the art visible event- based cameras have been shown to produce over two orders of magnitude less data in optimal conditions relative to traditional framing cameras, because they only transmit data from pixels that have changed. This leads directly to two orders of magnitude lower data latency and a commensurate reduction in power consumption. Despite their inherent advantages, existing event- based cameras are not compatible with DoD applications because DoD applications regularly face conditions that are not naturally sparse, where issues such as clutter and noise would cause a large percentage of the event-based pixels to change simultaneously. When this happens event-based cameras do not perform significantly better than traditional cameras. FENCE will develop an infrared event-based imager consistent with military requirements. FENCE will develop a four megapixel asynchronous read-out integrated circuit (ROIC), co-designed with a 3D integrated processor that will intelligently remove noise and clutter to maintain low power and latency operation even when faced with all of the pixels firing simultaneously. If successful, this new class of sensors enabled by FENCE will be capable of responding to fast moving targets and discriminating dim targets in noisy conditions. FY 2021 Plans: - Conduct advanced design review for the ROIC. - Develop preliminary design of the processor layer.

These receiver systems will be portable, programmable over a very large frequency range, and more sensitive than classical systems at similar size and temperature. This will be achieved by exploiting quantum-based receiving elements composed of atomic vapor cells in highly excited \"Rydberg\" states that have programmable sensitivity over a large range of frequencies and amplitudes. The program will require quantum engineering and traditional electro-mechanical-systems engineering to overcome technical and application challenges that impede rapid adoption of a quantum aperture receiver by the defense industrial base. In this program, the receiver systems enhanced capabilities will also be leveraged to develop novel waveforms while also being compatible with constraints imposed by real-world defense applications. The final receiver system will comprise a phase-sensitive array of quantum \"Rydberg\" receiving elements, lasers to program the sensor and read out radio signals, and processing electronics.

Title: Waveform Directed Agile Radio-frequency Directed Energy (WARDEN) program, building upon technologies developed in the DREaM program (budgeted within this PE and Project) aims to extend the range and lethality of high power microwave (HPM) systems by introducing flexible waveform techniques that use combinations of frequency-, amplitude-, and pulse-width modulations to significantly improve electromagnetic coupling into complex target enclosures and increase the probability of disruption or damage to internal electronic components and circuits. Applications for HPM systems include counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), vehicle and vessel disruption, electronic strike, and guided missile defense. Current HPM systems use oscillators to produce electromagnetic radiation. These systems are inherently narrowband and lack the frequency agility to support waveforms to maximize electromagnetic coupling and to optimally exploit electronic system vulnerabilities. Lacking the capability to use optimized waveforms, HPM oscillators have been pushed close to the physical limits of peak power generation. To develop a more efficient, lower power, waveform agile approach, the WARDEN program will develop and demonstrate the first- 6.000 15.000 Volume 1 - 141 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602716E: ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 22 R-1 Line #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 ELT-01 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 broadband HPM amplifier; create new theory and simulation tools to predict electromagnetic coupling into complex enclosures and the effects on electronics; and develop novel agile waveform techniques capable of reducing the susceptibility threshold of targeted electronics systems to HPM attack.

Title: Generating RF with Photonics for low Noise (GRYPHON) Description: The Generating RF with Photonics for low Noise (GRYPHON) program will develop compact sources of microwaves and millimeter waves with extremely low noise. Compact signal sources used today, such as crystal oscillators, are too noisy to support advanced military radar and communications functions. Conversely, best-in-class oscillators which use optical techniques to synthesize extremely pure microwaves are too large and expensive to deploy on the airborne systems, munitions, and other size-constrained platforms where the DoD requires high-performance capabilities. The GRYPHON program will draw on recent advances in miniature optical components in order to replicate best-in-class optical synthesis techniques in microchip form factors.

Title: LongShot Description: The goal of the LongShot program is to develop and flight demonstrate a weapon system using multi-mode propulsion that significantly increases engagement range and weapon effectiveness against adversary air threats. LongShot will explore new engagement concepts for multi-modal, multi-kill systems that can engage more than one target. LongShot can be deployed either externally from existing fighters or internally from existing bombers. An air system using multi-modal propulsion could capitalize on a slower speed, higher fuel-efficient air vehicle for ingress, while retaining highly energetic air-to-air missiles for end-game target engagements. This approach provides several key benefits, which ultimately increase weapon effectiveness. First, the weapon system will have a much-increased range over their legacy counterparts for transit to an engagement zone. Second, launching air-to-air missiles closer to the adversary increases energy in terminal flight, reduces reaction time, and increases probability of kill. The program will also evaluate other applications of multi-mode propulsion. Potential transition partners include the Navy and Air Force.

Specifically, AFRE will demonstrate key components of the TBCC propulsion system at low speed where turbine propulsion is used, at high speed where a dual-mode ramjet (DMRJ) is used, and at turbine-to-DMRJ transition conditions. Large-scale components of this complex propulsion system will be developed and demonstrated independently and experimentation will focus on regimes where the propulsion system smoothly transitions from low-speed turbine only operation to high-speed DMRJ only operation. AFRE will enable future airfield- based hypersonic systems to operate without special logistics considerations, resulting in transformational changes in long- range strike, high-speed Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) operations.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. This program element will examine concepts and architectures that move the U.S. away from a dependence on monolithic, ultra-capable, vulnerable, and unsustainably costly assets; replacing them with disaggregated assets that are agile, affordable, and easily replaced/maintained. Ready access to space requires the delivery of capabilities, replenishment of supplies into orbit, and rapid manufacturing of affordable space capabilities. Development of smaller, simpler, and more agile launch vehicles and infrastructure will be pursued. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity and functionality of space systems, space-derived information, and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this program element include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness, and precision control of multi-payload systems. Studies will actively seek to take advantage of new commercial developments which may enable both rapid constitution/reconstitution of assets, and agility/functionality not previously available for military systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 Title: Satellites (RSGS) Description: A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO), providing persistence and enabling ground station antennas to point in a fixed direction. Technologies for servicing of GEO spacecraft would involve a mix of highly automated and remotely operated (from Earth) robotic systems. The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) program seeks to establish the capability to provide robotic services in GEO suitable for a variety of potential servicing tasks, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners and national security space operators, and with sufficient propellant for several years of follow-on capability. Key RSGS challenges include robotic tool/end effector requirements, efficient orbital maneuvering of a servicing vehicle, robotic arm systems, automation of certain spacecraft operations, and development of the infrastructure for coordinated control between the servicer and client spacecraft operations teams. The anticipated transition is to a commercial partner who will provide the satellite to carry the robotic payload and who will operate the robotic servicer. To support the development of a broadly accepted satellite servicing capability, DARPA is using the Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing operations (CONFERS) approach to bring together experts from the private sector and Government to research, develop and publish nonbinding, consensus-based standards for safe operational approaches to on-orbit servicing.51.580 46.329 19.005 Volume 1 - 166 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 3 of 7 R-1 Line #37Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2022 Defense Research Projects Agency Date: May 2021 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603287E / SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C.

Title: Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) Description: Maintaining U.S. interests in cislunar space will require leap-ahead propulsion technology. Current space propulsion includes electric (high efficiency but low thrust) and chemical (high thrust but low efficiency). The Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program seeks to develop and demonstrate a High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) system on orbit by 2025.

For the simultaneous purposes of responsiveness and resiliency, these spacecraft are envisioned to be built on dramatically faster timelines (weeks instead of years) than are executed today. The current practice for space launch generally favors large launch vehicles with complex, one-of-a-kind11.500 - - Volume 1 - 169 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 7 R-1 Line #37Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2022 Defense Research Projects Agency Date: May 2021 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603287E / SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C. Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 infrastructure. This architecture has been matched to the large, heavy spacecraft, which compose most of DoD's space architecture today. Small spacecraft, which offer large potential value for resiliency and tactical employment, are typically required to rideshare for access to space, which requires programmatic, technical, and schedule entanglement with other programs. The U.S. commercial sector has promising developments for small launch vehicles that are designed for launch on rapid timescales with minimal fixed infrastructure. To incentivize industry to deliver capability that can meet emerging DoD needs for rapid, responsive launch of small payloads, the DARPA Launch Challenge was designed to reward competitors who could demonstrate the ability to launch a payload to orbit with minimal notification time and unknown pre-conditions regarding the payload configuration, required orbit, and launch site. Title: Experimental Spaceplane (XSP) Description: The goal of the Experimental Spaceplane (XSP) program was to design a scalable, responsive, prototype reusable launch system capable of inserting commercially and militarily relevant payloads (greater than 3,000 lbs.) into low earth orbit and suborbital trajectories. There was a $5M/launch cost goal to drive down the expense of space access by an order of magnitude versus traditional expendable launch vehicles. This was to be accomplished by designing for high velocity staging which dramatically reduces the amount of costly expendable hardware. The ability to fly 10 times in 10 days and designing the system to launch a payload into orbit within 24 hours was traceable to the responsiveness necessary in a military system. The system had design goals to fly greater than Mach 6.5 multiple times.12.497 - - Title: Planar Imager Description: The Planar Imager program evaluated the feasibility of a lightweight, compact, affordable optical payload to be integrated into a ride-share compatible satellite bus with equivalent imaging performance of current commercial conventional optical imaging satellites. This technology has the potential to significantly lower the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP- C) of high-resolution intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) satellites enabling persistent coverage by an affordable satellite constellation and enabling a rapid reconstitution ability. To achieve this goal, Planar Imager explored recent developments in materials science and nanofabrication and matured small-scale ultra-thin optics demonstrated in the laboratory to larger sizes. Reducing optical payload SWaP-C enables multiple ISR satellites to be packaged into a single launch vehicle fairing, dramatically reducing launch costs and improving reconstitution rate. A more persistent and pervasive space-based ISR architecture will increase warfighter readiness and lethality. These planar optics also have possible applications in optical imaging systems where SWaP-C is a constraint, impacting all areas of optical remote sensing and imaging as well as any system that requires optical components. The anticipated primary transition partners are the Air Force and Space Force.5.000 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 173.839 151.439 101.524 Volume 1 - 170 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 7 R-1 Line #37Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2022 Defense Research Projects Agency Date: May 2021 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide / BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603287E / SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY D.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ Imaging (ReImagine) program aims to create multi-functional readout integrated circuits (ROICs) that fundamentally change the way camera systems collect, process and relay image information. This is accomplished by adding multifunctional flexibility in the ROIC. Today, most cameras are designed to capture high quality imagery at standard frame rates. These traditional camera architectures collect a single type of data across the full image frame. Specialty cameras can be used to capture different spatial, spectral or temporal data but are rarely deployed because of the cost and complexity of adding imaging subsystems for niche measurements. Although these measurements are typically only desired for specific features or regions of interest (ROIs) in a scene, the cameras collect specialized data over the full image frame. The ReImagine architecture, conversely, would enable a single, real-time reconfigurable, software-defined camera system with the ability to collect different data in different ROIs. Depending on the need, a ReImagine imager would be able to selectively collect and simultaneously process data from a specific ROI, for example, at a higher resolution (i.e., foveated imaging), at a higher frame rate, or with 3-D depth information. The system would interface with virtually any sensor and could therefore be used in any spectral band. By demonstrating more efficient data collection and computation across ROIs, ReImagine ROICs will enable real- time analysis of much more complex scenes and provide more actionable information than has ever been possible. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to the Air Force, Navy and Army.

Title: Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) Description: The Wideband Secured and Protected Emitter and Receiver (WiSPER) program aims to develop an ultra-broadband technology platform to demonstrate a robust, secure and protected communication link. WiSPER technology provides high signal coding gain to deliver a secured and protected link with significantly enhanced capacity for next generation DoD communications. Current terrestrial tactical radios operate with limited bandwidth at prescribed low frequency bands, which are unable to support high capacity with multiple users, and are vulnerable to interference and jamming. WiSPER technology addresses military needs for assured communications, throughput, security, and size, weight, and power limitations of future command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The program will develop an ultra- broadband compact antenna, radio frequency front end electronics, mixed signal circuits, and waveform technologies.

Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY Description: The Precise Guidance for Munitions (PRIGM) program is developing inertial sensor technologies for positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) in GPS-denied environments. These inertial sensors can provide autonomous PNT information when GPS is unavailable. The program exploits recent advances in integrating photonic (light-manipulating) components into electronics and in employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) as high-performance inertial sensors for use in extreme environments. Whereas conventional MEMS inertial sensors suffer from inaccuracies due to factors such as temperature sensitivity, photonics-based PNT techniques have demonstrated the ability to mitigate these inaccuracies. PRIGM is focused on developing and transitioning a Navigation-Grade Inertial Measurement Unit (NGIMU), a state-of-the-art MEMS device, will advance state-of-the-art MEMS gyros from TRL 3 devices to a TRL 6 transition platform. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete MEMS-based NGIMU with a mechanical/electronic interface identical to existing DoD- standard tactical-grade MEMS IMUs, providing a drop-in replacement for existing DoD systems. Service laboratories have been actively involved throughout program development and remain engaged to facilitate transition of NGIMU prototypes, which will be delivered at the program conclusion.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2020 2021 FY 2022 Title: Beyond Scaling - Access Description: The Beyond Scaling - Access program demonstrates design and fabrication of advanced electronics, including through collaborations with leading industry players. Although the United States has led the development of advanced electronics and is home to three of the five leading-edge silicon foundries, recent investments by foreign competitors are threatening this leadership. Additionally, the fabrication cost of next-generation microelectronics has increased at an alarming rate. While the commercial sector is able to spread these costs over a large volume of products, the low volumes used by the DoD creates a cost barrier to meeting its future technology needs. The Beyond Scaling - Access program forges forward-looking collaborations among the commercial electronics community, defense industrial base, university researchers, and the DoD to address domestic and DoD-available microelectronics capabilities. Activities include establishing design capabilities for advanced digital logic in state-of-the-art foundries; enabling domestic production of millimeter wave circuits for 5G applications, military communication systems, and DoD radar sensors; initializing prototyping facilities and other activities to enhance the likelihood for domestic production and implementation of leading edge technologies; and exploring microelectronics development and manufacturing capabilities aligned to DoD-specific environments.

Title: Millimeter Wave Digital Arrays (MIDAS) Description: The Millimeter Arrays (MIDAS) program is developing a common millimeter wave phased array tile that is scalable to large arrays to provide wideband frequency agility from 18-50 gigahertz with element-level digital beamforming. Millimeter wave systems are used today to achieve physical security through the use of narrow antenna beams in a small form- factor. We see this applied to satellite communications and tactical line-of-sight communications such as in the F-22 and F-35. One of the challenges of using directional communications in mobile applications is the problem of knowing where to point the antenna when both platforms are mobile. This can be solved with digital beamforming to enable a mobile platform to listen in all directions with many antenna beams to facilitate neighbor discovery when transmitting. Digital beamforming also enables multiple beams to communicate with several neighbors simultaneously. This capability will increase the network throughput and robustness that will be tolerant to unexpected outages. To achieve these goals, MIDAS is developing a common digital phased array tile that can be used to build large arrays from this common block. The program is executed in two primary technical areas. First, advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is used to develop the core transceiver elements at a size and power consumption that is required to fit in the small size required by current millimeter wave systems. Second, a combination of advanced packaging and high-performance compound semiconductors is used to build the wideband antenna and front-end amplifiers necessary to make a complete system. Technologies from this program are intended for transition through commercial industry to the Services. FY 2021 Plans: - Finalize designs, fabricate, and test millimeter wave 64-element digital phased arrays in advanced CMOS co-integrated with compound semiconductor power amplifiers and wideband apertures. - Begin designs of millimeter wave 256-element digital phased arrays in advanced CMOS co-integrated with compound semiconductor power amplifiers and wideband apertures. - Finalize advancements in the fundamental technologies relevant to millimeter wave digital arrays in the areas of converters, filters, oscillators, and broadband apertures.

FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2022 decrease reflects the shift from finalizing design and fabrication to demonstration. Title: Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) Description: The Photonics in the Package for Extreme Scalability (PIPES) program aims to develop optical signaling technologies for digital microelectronics. Distributed and parallel computing architectures are now pervasive across all size scales, from personal-scale multicore processing units to enterprise-scale high performance computing systems, and span application domains from consumer electronics to DoD systems. Increasingly, however, the benefits of parallelism are constrained not by the limits of computation at individual nodes but by the movement of data between nodes. PIPES will advance microelectronics capabilities by intimately integrating photonics with advanced integrated electronics to yield system connectivity with an unprecedented combination of high aggregate bandwidth, power efficiency, channel density, and link reach. Specifically, PIPES will develop photonic input/output (I/O) capability for application-specific integrated circuits and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are widely used in advanced DoD sensors and radio frequency systems. The goal of the program is improving I/O bandwidth density, efficiency, and reach by more than a factor of 100 to enable disruptive DoD system parallelism and performance scaling. As PIPES technologies mature, they are anticipated to proliferate into central processing units, graphical processing units, and emerging tensor-flow processing units that will impact a wide range of dual-use applications including artificial intelligence, machine learning, large scale emulation, and high performance computing. Technologies from this program are intended for transition to larger scale commercial performers and the Services. FY 2021 Plans: - Integrate silicon photonics and electronic drive circuitry, and characterize packaged photonic interconnect demonstrator performance to enable FPGAs with photonic interfaces. - Define system integration concepts that leverage PIPES photonic connectivity for defense applications. - Integrate and demonstrate innovative component technologies and characterize link performance of next-generation photonic interconnect capabilities.

Mixed-mode circuits take analog and RF signals and transform them to digital data for processing in computing systems. As defense and commercial wireless applications move to higher frequencies in order to carry more data traffic, integrating the broadband mixed-mode circuitry with high speed digital processing logic onto one chip becomes imperative to avoid data transfer bottlenecks. T-MUSIC seeks to integrate high-speed, high-performance analog and digital electronics together in highly-scaled silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundries on-shore. Such processes will enable the high integration and performance needed for DoD-relevant and commercial 5G/6G applications. A goal of the T-MUSIC program is to enable wireless operations beyond 100 gigahertz with very wide bandwidth with low noise and high dynamic range. In addition, T-MUSIC aims to develop next- generation terahertz mixed-mode devices based on the advanced digital CMOS fabrication platform. The T-MUSIC program will establish advanced on-shore foundry capabilities to establish a long-term domestic world-class RF mixed-mode system-on-chip technology for intended transition to DoD and commercial applications.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 The Programmable Logic for Applications In Defense (PLAID) program is developing a heterogeneous compute platform that can support processing of large data arrays. Current computing architectures are subject to scaling, bandwidth, and memory limitations and the large size of today's chips limits the movement of data resulting in a fundamental trade-off between circuit size and data throughput. The PLAID program will break this paradigm with new architecture development and achieve more than a 10X bandwidth increase on-chip. In addition to the development of this new device, the PLAID program will expedite deployment into DoD systems by engaging the defense industrial base to map DoD-relevant radio frequency (RF) processing problems onto the new architecture. These RF problems may include element-level digital beamforming, multi-target tracking radar applications and synthetic aperture radar processing. Once applications are mapped onto the new processor, the implementation will be programmed and tested with the intent that the use of the new device developed by commercial industry will directly transition into an asymmetric advantage for the DoD and used by the defense industrial base in emerging applications.

Approaches to this goal include developing technologies in these areas: - High-Capacity Links technologies - enables greater back-haul capability. - Advanced Networking technologies - supports resilience, adaptability, scalability, and composable systems to enable adaptive effects webs. - Low Probability of Detection and Anti-Jam (LPD/AJ) technologies - provides assured communications in very high-threat environments. - Novel Radio Frequency and Spectral Sensing (RF/SS) - supports efficient spectrum management in congested environments and detection of electromagnetic threats. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 Title: Network Universal Persistence (Network UP) Description: Current radios send network control information and data using the same wireless link. This produces a common failure mode when that wireless link degrades. In many of today's military wireless networks, even brief wireless link outages create a loss of network connectivity that can take more than two minutes to recover once the wireless link is re-established. During these network outages, data transmission is not possible. The Network UP program will develop and demonstrate radio technology that maintains network reliability through periods of frequent signal degradation that routinely occur in military operational environments. Isolation of critical control channel information in a separate, robust wireless link will allow creation of a protected control channel that can maintain network reliability even when the data channel is lost. The Network UP program will develop technology and a prototype system that enables military wireless networks to send data over dynamic, unstable wireless links. The program will develop approaches to separate the control and data planes across different wireless links and design and implement mechanisms to maintain synchronization across those separate links. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services.

Title: Protected Forward Communications (PFC) Description: The collaborative application of combat power in ground tactical operations demands reliable exchange of rich information and precise coordination of actions across various echelons. These operations take place over three critical conversations: (1) to coordinate the actions of a local group, (2) to coordinate group and airborne assets, and (3) to interact with rear echelon command. The communication links over which these three conversations take place are at risk from jamming and geolocation operations conducted with increasingly sophisticated exploitation and denial technology employed by our adversaries. This problem is compounded by demands for ever-increasing capacity of these links. The Protected Forward Communications (PFC) program will build on technical advances in resilient, efficient, and aware communications technology to design a single communication architecture to protect all three conversations from jamming and geolocation. PFC is generally applicable to small unit operations and is particularly relevant to the close air support (CAS) function typically executed by the Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air Controller (FAC).

FY 2021 to FY 2022 reflects program Title: Dynamic Network Adaptation for Mission Optimization (DyNAMO) Description: Wireless networks have evolved into complex systems having many configurable parameters and features, including link data rates, power settings, inter-network gateways, and security associations. The optimal settings for these features vary greatly depending on the mission for which the network is deployed and the environment in which it is operating. Currently, the majority of these features are optimized off-line for specific scenarios and assumptions and are pre-set before use in a mission. There is no capability for the settings to adapt if the actual mission or environment differs from the original assumptions used to configure the network. The problem is exacerbated in scenarios in which intelligent adversaries can affect the topology and operation of the network unpredictably and on short timescales. Furthermore, future operations will include multiple, different radios interconnected on the same platform, and those existing networks lack a common standard for interoperability. The DyNAMO program will develop software that addresses the incompatibilities preventing information sharing across independent airborne and ground networks and develop new approaches to configure and control networks and networks of networks for operation in dynamic and contested environments. The program will address optimization within legacy and future military networks, interactions between networks, and availability of necessary network services to support mission success. Technologies developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2021 Plans: - Integrate advanced security elements into DyNAMO in order to operate over multiple security enclaves. - Demonstrate the integrated DyNAMO system to military Service partners to support transition. - Provide DyNAMO software in government controlled repository for use by the Services.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology Program Element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly increased capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents using systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often co-located and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations. The Maritime Systems project is identifying, developing and rapidly maturing critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea, and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

Title: Systems of Systems-Enhanced Small Units (SESU) Description: The System of Systems-Enhanced Small Unit (SESU) program is developing and demonstrating adaptive kill-web capabilities based on a system-of-systems architecture that enables a small unit of U.S. forces to prevail against a much larger near-peer adversary force in a contested environment. SESU-developed capabilities will provide the small unit with improved awareness of enemy force composition, disposition, and intent. It will also provide the means to deter escalation of threat, and, if deterrence fails, the ability to degrade, disrupt, and/or destroy enemy anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) and combat systems. Technologies to accomplish this include command and control (C2) that operates in a contested environment; distributed sensing, including the ability to leverage indigenous information sources; hybrid effects that include a mix of kinetic, non-kinetic, and information operations capabilities; and autonomous systems to deliver effects and conduct sensing. A Campaign of Learning (CoL) will be conducted in partnership with the Army, and technologies produced by this program will be transitioned to the Services.

Title: Assault Breaker II (ABII) Description: Assault Breaker II (ABII) seeks to change the current warfighting paradigm of reliance on a Service-specific and platform centric force that executes prescribed kill chains to a highly adaptable and capability-based force. This new paradigm operates as a disaggregated kill web able to execute rapidly composable, joint, and all domain kill chains. Building upon technologies developed in the Cross Domain Maritime Surveillance and Targeting (CDMaST) program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-02, ABII will exploit both existing and emerging technologies across the Services to address known capability gaps, opportunities, and threats. ABII will conduct mission-centric, multi-Service and multi-domain analyses, modeling & simulation (M&S), and experimentation to inform research and development and program of record recommendations. ABII will build an enduring, multi-service M&S environment to support complex mission level kill web analysis.

Title: Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) Description: Currently, Command and Control (C2) of air platforms is a highly centralized process operating largely independently across planning domains (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), strike, and spectrum management) and is optimized for a permissive environment. To address the challenges faced in today's increasingly contested environments, the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment for the Contested Environment (RSPACE) program developed tools and models to enable distribution of planning functions across the C2 hierarchy for resilience (e.g., loss of communications), while synchronizing strike, ISR, and spectrum planning to maximize the contribution of all assets through increased utilization and exploitation of synergies. The program developed tools supporting a mixed initiative planning approach, maximizing automation according to operator's choice, and enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and modification. RSPACE also developed tactical decision aids for maritime commanders and planners to build and assess courses of action (COAs) for fleet and ship movements and the employment of counter-ISR techniques. During execution, the tools provided lifecycle tracking of targeting and information needs and supported assessment of progress towards achieving the commander's intent. The tools dynamically responded as directed to ad hoc requests and significant plan deviations via a real-time dynamic re-planning capability and easily adapted to technology refreshes. RSPACE tools transitioned to the Air Force's Kessel Run Experimentation Lab as part of the Air Operations Center Weapon System Program of Record modernization effort and the Navy.1.345 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 130.222 143.199 111.089 C.

Title: No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) Description: No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) seeks to develop small, low-cost, disaggregated naval platforms to demonstrate the ability to perform persistent power projection and force application combat missions currently conducted from large, high-value capital ships. The NOMARS program seeks to design a ship that can operate autonomously for long durations at sea, enabling a ship design process that eliminates considerations associated with crew. NOMARS focuses on exploring novel approaches to the design of the sea frame (the ship without mission systems) while accommodating representative payload size, weight, and power. The goal of the program is to demonstrate the feasibility of Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) that can operate autonomously for months to years without human intervention, in large numbers, with only periodic, depot-based maintenance. This capability will enable disaggregated persistent USVs, which allows the surface fleet to credibly threaten peer adversaries and negate their investments in high-cost weapon systems designed to counter large naval targets such as aircraft carriers. A successful NOMARS program will prove feasibility of a small unmanned ship with significantly improved reliability and functional performance over current USVs providing a pathway to allow a distributed lethality concept to become viable: small ships, in large numbers, each of which is individually low-cost and low-value, but in aggregate presents a significant deterrent. FY 2021 Plans: - Complete Conceptual Design Review. - Complete system requirements review. - Conduct preliminary system design of multiple concept vessels. FY 2022 Plans: - Conduct detailed design of selected concept vessels and complete critical design review. - Initiate NOMARS demonstrator vessel development.

FY 2021 to FY 2022 reflects program Title: Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) Description: The Positioning System for Deep Ocean Navigation (POSYDON) program provided continuous, Global Positioning System (GPS)-level positioning accuracy to submarines and autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) in the ocean over extended periods of time. Undersea navigation cannot use GPS because the water blocks its signals. At shallower depths, masts can be raised to receive GPS signals, but masts present a detection risk. Typically, the alternative to GPS for undersea navigation has been inertial navigation systems (INS), but INS accuracy can degrade unacceptably over time. The POSYDON program distributed a small number of acoustic sources, analogous to GPS satellites, around an ocean basin at known locations. Undersea platforms equipped with a passive acoustic receiver and appropriate processing software are capable of obtaining and maintaining location. By transmitting specific acoustic waveforms and developing accurate acoustic propagation models to predict and interpret the complex arrival structure of the acoustic sources, the submarine or AUV could determine its range from each source and thus calculate its position. Technologies developed under this program transitioned to the Navy's Maritime Surveillance Systems Program Office for fleet experimentation and future Office of Naval Research (ONR) research as endorsed by the Undersea Rapid Capabilities Insertion effort.4.719 - - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 112.421 148.459 149.127 C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensor Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets.

Title: Aerial Dragnet Description: Aerial Dragnet seeks to detect multiple small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in complex and/or urban terrain before they are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of friendly assets. Unlike traditional air targets, small UASs pose a special threat in urban terrain for several reasons: they can fly at low altitudes between buildings, they are small making them difficult to sense, and they move at slow speeds making them difficult to differentiate from other moving objects. Moreover, the development of small UASs is driven by commercial technologies, which make them rapidly adaptable and very easy to use. Building upon research conducted in the System of Systems Integration Technology and Experimentation (SoSITE) program (budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01), Aerial Dragnet will perform surveillance using an architecture consisting of networked sensor payloads deployed on buildings, masts and aerial platforms. The ability to see over and into urban terrain allows Aerial Dragnet to detect, track, and classify UAS incursions rapidly, thus enabling multiple defeat options. Aerial Dragnet sensor payloads are low-cost and comprised of signal processing software, sensor hardware, and networking for distributed, autonomous operation. The system will be scalable to provide cost-effective surveillance coverage from neighborhood to city-sized areas. Aerial Dragnet technologies are expected to transition to the Army, Marine Corps, and Department of State. FY 2021 Plans: - Develop and test new and enhanced sensor payloads that complement the current sensor suite, building from experience gained during FY 2020 large urban experiment. FY 2022 Plans: - Evaluate system performance, mission planning and modeling tools of the sensors in a persistent deployment (more than 30 days) within a dense urban environment. FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2022 decrease reflects a shift from development and testing of new sensors to evaluation of overall system performance.7.125 3.847 3.568 Title: Shosty Description: Shosty seeks to enhanced capabilities for high frequency (HF) over-the-horizon-radar (OTHR) systems. This program will develop techniques to characterize distributed skywave HF radar propagation channels and measure radar backscatter from the surface. System signal processing, modeling, analysis, and over-the-air experimentation will be conducted to assess performance. Technologies developed under the Shosty program will transition to the Services.7.345 7.078 6.055 Volume 1 - 218 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 14 R-1 Line #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-01 / SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned multi-site receive system capable of handling advanced waveform design. - Develop signal processing algorithms for coordinated, multi-site receive system. - Perform end-to-end multi-site, multi-static over-the-horizon radar demonstration. FY 2022 Plans: - Update algorithms based on testing and needs of identified transition partners, and verify with modeling and simulation. - Perform end-to-end multi-site, multi-static over-the-horizon a from algorithm development to testing of over-the-horizon radar. Title: Moving Target Recognition (MTR) Description: Based on technologies developed under the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Technology program (previously budgeted in 0603767E, SEN-02), the Moving Target Recognition (MTR) program seeks to enable the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to detect, track, image, and automatically recognize moving ground targets within an area of interest. SAR sensors provide the capability to detect and identify high-value targets in all weather conditions but only when the targets are stationary due to limitations in traditional SAR processing. Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars are capable of detecting and tracking moving targets, but they cannot form recognizable images of targets. MTR will overcome the limitations of traditional SAR and improve the operational utility of widely deployed SAR sensors on many different types of platforms. The recognition capability will enable new concepts of operation for maintaining persistent custody of high-value targets on the move. Unlike GMTI which loses custody if the track is broken due to terrain or other factors, MTR-enabled SAR sensors will be able to tolerate coverage gaps by reacquiring and reestablishing identification of the moving targets. Technology developed under MTR will transition to the Services. FY 2021 Plans: - Modify airborne research radar hardware in preparation for data collect experiments. - Develop software to enable novel MTR collection techniques in preparation for data collect experiments. FY 2022 Plans: - Develop novel MTR algorithms for ground moving target detection, tracking, and imaging with SAR sensors. - Plan and conduct airborne data collect experiments involving ground-truthed moving military vehicles to test the MTR algorithms and collection techniques. - Analyze MTR algorithm performance using the airborne experiment data.- 4.500 13.862 Volume 1 - 219 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 14 R-1 Line #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-01 / SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment, and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement, and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement, and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 Title: Military Tactical Means (MTM) Description: The Military Tactical Means (MTM) program is developing sensors and exploitation techniques capable of performing wide-area search to detect high-value targets in order to task engagement systems to close effects-chains. Finding and prosecuting targets with distributed effects-chains requires the ability to detect, track, and maintain custody of targets across sensors with different modalities residing in various domains. This program will examine both the sensors and the exploitation needed to perform this wide-area search for missions in denied territories and maintain positive chain of custody hand-offs to one or more targeting sensors. The sensors developed under this program will concentrate on sensor modalities that are mostly geometry-invariant and have the potential to be used in highly proliferated systems, such as small satellite constellations and small terrestrial platforms (e.g., class-I or II unmanned aerial system). The exploitation portion of this program will develop algorithms to ensure consistency when passing chain of custody between sensors in different domains where there is the possibility of different sensing modalities and will also be designed to increase confidence and accuracy as targets are passed between sensors. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies. FY 2021 Plans: - Complete development of initial multi-mode exploitation algorithms. - Complete multi-mode sensor module design based on size, weight, power, and modality requirements.13.806 28.335 23.718 Volume 1 - 221 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 14 R-1 Line #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

FY 2021 to FY 2022 Increase/Decrease Statement: The FY 2022 decrease reflects a shift from module design and development to system integration. Title: Dynamically Composed RF Systems Description: Dominance of the Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum is critical to successful U.S. military operations. Radar systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, and communication systems require custom software and hardware that is costly and time- consuming to build and integrate onto platforms. The Dynamically Composed RF Systems program addresses these challenges by developing adaptive, converged RF array systems. This enables enhanced operational capability by dynamically adapting the system for tasks to support radar, communications, and EW in a converged manner. This program will design and develop: (1) a modular architecture for collaborative, agile RF systems; (2) advanced techniques for RF apertures and airframe integration and the associated wide-band agile electronics to support converged missions over those apertures; (3) a heterogeneous signal processing complex implementing hardware-agnostic RF operating modes (the RF Virtual Machine); (4) software tools for the control, coordination, and scheduling of RF functions and payloads at the element level to maximize overall task performance (a System and Sensor Resource Manager (SSRM)). This capability can be adapted to address diverse missions. Technology developed under this program will transition to the Services. FY 2021 Plans: - Conduct laboratory testing of the SSRM installed on the two payloads to demonstrate the SSRM's ability to control the two payloads in concert. - Install SSRM and a second payload on the testbed aircraft. FY 2022 Plans: - Conduct ground testing of SSRM on testbed aircraft and demonstrate ability to control both payloads on the ground.7.960 13.158 6.900 Volume 1 - 222 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 9 of 14 R-1 Line #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022 - Conduct flight tests of the SSRM controlling two third-party payloads and demonstrate ability to control FY 2022 decrease reflects the transition from development and testing of the SSRM software and integration of the payloads to a focus on flight demonstration. Title: Coho Description: The Coho program will develop advanced signal processing technologies and techniques for future Radio Frequency (RF) systems. These systems will create an asymmetric advantage for tactical operations in anti-access/area-denial environments by extending the real-time operating bandwidth of tactical signal processing, underpinning the ability of U.S. and Allied Forces to accurately orient and beneficially maneuver in the electromagnetic spectrum. Based on technologies developed under the All-Signal Tactical Real-time Analyzer (ASTRAL) program, budgeted in this PE and Project, the objective of Coho is to provide ultra wide-band RF signal detection and recognition capabilities in a form factor suitable for tactical platforms. Coho seeks to provide capabilities for multiple mission areas. These capabilities include (1) surveillance: combining wide operating bandwidth with noise isolation for background electromagnetic search in the low signal to noise ratio environment, (2) filtering: isolating signals based on modulation features to process signals in the presence of co-channel interference, and (3) localization: supporting low-latency execution of multi-aperture processing for discrimination of signals based on angle of bearing. Technology from Coho will transition to the Services.

Accomplishments/Planned ($ in Millions) FY 2020 FY The Thermal Imaging Technology Experiment-Recon (TITE-R) leverages and expands upon the successful technology demonstrations associated with Small Satellite Sensors program, budgeted in this PE/Project. TITE-R will develop and demonstrate complimentary sensing modalities, advanced processing, and low swap cross and downlinks which will more closely represent an objective tactical capability. TITE-R will develop sensors and software automation capable of supporting future tactical Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) operations implemented on small (< 250 kg) satellites. This scalable multi-modal ISR approach will allow tactical users to rapidly characterize, quantify and report battlespace environments and conditions. TITE-R will also expand upon the utility of small satellites to enable access to the world-wide data necessary to optimize machine learning (ML) automation. In addition, this world-wide access will enable discovery of new sources of false positives which is a key factor in using proliferated Low Orbit Earth (pLOE) to support tactical operations. Such broad accesses are not possible through traditional R&D airborne testing. TITE-R aims to rapidly develop and demonstrate an early-to- space prototype system, the data from which will be used to optimize signature discovery and target discrimination algorithms. Technology developed by this program will transition to the Services and other government agencies.

Title: Small Satellite Sensors Description: The Small Satellite Sensors program developed and space-qualified an Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) sensor and an inter-satellite communications approach establishing feasibility for new DoD tactical capabilities to be implemented on small (< 100 kg) satellites. Experimental payloads were flown on small satellites, and data was collected to validate new operational concepts. Small satellites provide a low-cost and quick-turnaround capability for testing new technologies and experimental payloads. Operationally, small and low-cost satellites enable the deployment of larger constellations, which can provide greater coverage, persistence, and survivability compared to a small number of more expensive satellites, as well as the possibility for launch-on-demand. This program successfully leveraged the rapid progress being made by the commercial sector on small satellite bus technology, as well as investments being made by DoD and industry on low-cost launch and launch-on-demand capabilities for small satellites. The program focused on developing, demonstrating, and validating key payload technologies needed by DoD that are not currently being developed for commercial space applications. Technologies developed under this program transitioned to the Services.12.848 - (ASTRAL) program developed and demonstrated a system for radio frequency and optical electromagnetic signal surveillance and environment understanding. Built on technologies explored under the Dynamically Composed RF Systems program, also budgeted in this PE/Project, the objective of ASTRAL was to provide a factor of at least 1,000 times improvement over current signal awareness processing speed over broad spectral coverage. The program used technology that supports a development path leading to a mobile, tactical capability. The development objectives of the ASTRAL program were to (1) develop a hybrid processor that provides real-time processing of the most challenging Low-Probability-of-Intercept (LPI) threat signals across a wide bandwidth, and (2) identify exploitation algorithms for military applications that are well-suited to this type of hybrid processor. Several strategic and tactical spectrum awareness applications3.832 - - Volume 1 - 225 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 14 R-1 Line #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

ASTRAL transitioned to the Navy. Title: Collection and Monitoring via Planning for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS) Description: The goal of the Collection and Monitoring via Planning for Active Situational Scenarios (COMPASS) program was to build decision aids for gray zone scenarios, where adversaries attempt to manipulate a U.S.-allied nation through the use of both kinetic and non-kinetic means. Based on research performed under the Resilient Synchronized Planning and Assessment Contested Environment (RSPACE) program, budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01, the purpose of the COMPASS program was to reduce ambiguity and reveal intent of gray zone actors who use techniques such as misinformation and intimidation to destabilize host nations and possibly produce advantageous conditions for military engagements. COMPASS produced tools to automate gray zone information operations and help U.S. forces adapt to changing conditions and adversary responses. Instead of relying on passive collection of sensory data, COMPASS employed active sensing and recommended actions that U.S. Forces and allied partners can take to stimulate the environment and elicit a response from the adversary that reveals its strategies. To achieve this goal, COMPASS sought to build and demonstrate tools to: 1) discover the structure of the operating environment that includes the goals and objectives of the adversary as it engages in illicit and subversive activities, 2) develop models that capture the dynamics of the situations including the actors, relationships, timings, and dependencies of the adversary campaigns, and 3) integrate the various algorithms into a comprehensive gaming architecture that allows operators to assess the decision space, recommend sensing actions, and monitor progress towards reducing the ambiguity of the operating environment and suggest adjustments. Models and a planning technology prototype were provided to INDOPACOM.5.278 - - Title: Seeker Cost Transformation (SECTR) Description: The Seeker Cost Transformation (SECTR) program developed novel weapon terminal sensing and guidance technologies and systems for air-launched and air-delivered weapons that can: (1) find and acquire fixed and moving targets with only minimal external support, (2) achieve high navigation accuracy in a GPS-denied environment, and (3) be very small in size and weight and potentially low cost. SECTR-developed systems and technologies are small size, weight and power (SWaP), low recurring cost, and applicable to a wide range of weapons and missions, such as small unit lethality, suppression of enemy air defenses, precision strike, and strike of time-sensitive targets. Hardware technology leveraged passive Electro- Optical and Infrared (EO/IR) sensors, which have evolved into very small and inexpensive devices in the commercial market, and a reconfigurable processing architecture. SECTR also developed a Government-owned open system architecture for the seeker with standardized interfaces between components (both hardware and software). The technical approach to target recognition started from \"deep learning\" and machine vision algorithms pioneered for facial recognition and the identification of critical image features. Technologies developed under this program transitioned to the Services.3.626 - - Volume 1 - 226 UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 14 R-1 Line #60Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB Date: May 0400 SENSOR (Number/Name) SEN-02 / SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.
