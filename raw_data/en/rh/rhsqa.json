In revising WHO guidance on IMD in sub-Saharan Africa, a systematic review was undertaken to assess the effect of chemoprophylaxis and of vaccination in preventing subsequent cases of IMD in household contacts following an index case. A literature search for systematic reviewsidenti ed a single suitable review on chemoprophylaxis in 2004 (three studies meta-analysed). A search for primary research papers published since 2004 on chemoprophylaxis and without a date limit on vaccination was therefore undertaken. There were 2381 studies identi ed of which two additional studies met the inclusion criteria. The summary risk ratio for chemoprophylaxis vs.no chemoprophylaxis (four studies) in the 30-day period after a case was 0\u00b716 [95% con dence interval (CI) 0\u00b704-0\u00b764, P= 0\u00b7008]; the number needed to treat to prevent one subsequent case was 200 (95% CI 111-1000). A single quasi-randomized trial assessed the role of vaccination. The risk ratio forvaccination vs.no vaccination at 30 days was 0\u00b711 (95% CI 0\u00b701 -2\u00b707, P= 0\u00b714). The results support the use of chemoprophylaxis to prevent subsequent cases of IMD in household contacts of a case. Conclusions about the use of vaccination could not be drawn. Key words : Infectious disease control, meningococcus ( N. meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis is associated with severe morbidityand mortality and can result in devastating sequelae [1,2]. With the roll out of meningococcal vaccination against the common serotypes through routine immun- ization programmes and mass prevention campaigns, the incidence of IMD in Western settings and recentlyin sub-Saharan Africa has fallen markedly [ 3-6]. Despite these successes gained, sporadic cases and outbreaks of IMD still continue to occur [ 1]. * Author for correspondence: Dr L.

Primary prevention interventions targeting this high-risk group form the basis of much international guidance, whichrecommends chemoprophylaxis [ 9-11], with the aim of eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage. A recent Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) alone did not identify any eligible studiesaddressing the role of chemoprophylaxis in household contacts [ 12]. A systematic review by Purcell et al. , done nearly a decade ago, of both RCTs and observa-tional studies identi ed three observational studies which supported the use of chemoprophylaxis in household contacts of an index case of IMD [ 13]. The role of vaccination in household contacts of an index case of IMD has been debated [ 14-16]. Given the time required for protective antibodies to developfollowing vaccination, its role in immediate diseaseprevention and control strategies in this population, is not completely clear [ 14,15]. There may be bene tf r o m vaccination in addition to chemoprophylaxis, when dis-ease in the index case is caused by a vaccine-preventable strain [ 16]. As a result of the success of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac) [ 6] roll out in the African meningitis belt, the World Health Organiza- tion (WHO) is updating guidelines on the meningitisoutbreak response in sub-Saharan Africa. To inform these guidelines, work was commissioned by the WHO on key areas of the outbreak response, includ-ing prevention strategies (chemoprophylaxis and vac-cination) in household contacts. We present results of the systematic reviews undertaken to determine (1) the effect of chemoprophylaxis and (2) the effectof vaccination, in preventing cases of IMD in house- hold contacts during the rst 30 days and 1 year after an index case. METHODS Search strategy Medline, EMBASE, African Index Medicus, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of ControlledTrials, CAB health and TRIP were searched from incep-tion to December 2013 for original research studies and systematic reviews. A Google search with lters forcoun- tries in the African meningitis belt was performed (2002 - 2013) for grey literature. Bibliographies of identi ed studies were searched, and, experts in IMD contactedthrough the WHO, for additional studies or sources of data. Where possible, authors were contacted foradditional information if needed. The MESH headings and key words used were (1) for chemoprophylaxis: (Chemoprevention or Post-Exposure Prophylaxis or (chemoprophyl* or chemo-prevent* (Anti-Bacterial or Drug rifampi* cephalospori*)); (2) for vaccination: Immunization or Vaccination or Meningococcal Vaccines or (vaccin* or immun*); (3) for for the setting:Contact Tracing or Disease Transmission, Infectious or Disease Outbreaks or (contact* or household* or cluster* or transmi* or outbreak* or orassociated) adj2 case*). The expressions for each inter- vention were combined with the outcome and setting using the Boolean operator AND to generate a nal output of studies. Eligibility criteria Both (quasi-)RCTs and observational studies with clear intervention and comparator groups were included. The study population was household contacts, de ned for this review as persons (adults and children) living and/ or sleeping in the same household/dwelling as an index case of IMD. The included studies had a minimumfollow-up period of at least 30 days. The interventionsof interest were antibiotics currently recommended as chemoprophylaxis for for chemoprophylaxis (e.g. minocycline, sulphonamide) and any vaccine effective against N. meningitidis . The comparator groups con- sisted of those given placebo, no antibiotics or vaccin- ation, or any other intervention. The primary outcome was the occurrence of IMD in household contacts inthe 30 days and 1 year following onset of IMD in theindex case; henceforth referred to as a subsequent case. Cases occurring in the rst 24 h following the index case were excluded from the analysis as they were not po-tentially preventable. Studies were included irrespective of language and publication status.2260 L. Telisinghe and others https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268815000849 Published online by Cambridge University PressStudy selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved throughdiscussion or, if required, consultation with a third reviewer. An initial search for systematic reviews was con- ducted. If an appropriate systematic review was identi ed, a search for original research studies was conducted from the end date of the review. If a sys-tematic review was not identi ed, the search was con- ducted without a date limit. Studies were initially shortlisted based on the title and abstract. De nite selection was based on screening the full texts of short-listed studies for eligibility. All relevant data were entered onto standardized case report forms. The yield from the search for original research studieswas cross-checked with all identi ed relevant system- atic reviews to ensure that all applicable original research studies were captured by the search. The quality of systematic reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR tool [ 17]. Minimum criteria assessed were a comprehensive literature search (e.g. complete-ness of the search string, number of databases searched,restrictions and exclusions, etc.) and duplicate study selection and data extraction. RCTs were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk ofBias tool [ 18]. An adapted Newcastle -Ottawa Scale was used [ 19] (Supplementary Table S1), to comprehen- sively assess the risk of bias in observational studies. Statistical analysis The results of studies that were deemed clinically homogeneous with respect to the participants, inter-ventions, outcomes and follow-up were combined to generate a summary risk ratio and absolute risk reduc- tion by the use of a xed-effects model (Mantel - Haenszel). In studies with no events in either the inter- vention or comparator groups, 0\u00b75 was added to all four cells of the 2 \u00d7 2 table. If no events occurred inboth the intervention and comparator groups, these studies were not included in the meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspec-tion of the forest plot, the 2test for homogeneity (P= 0\u00b71) and the I2statistic. heterogenous a random-effects model (Mantel - Haenszel) was used. All statistical analyses were undertaken using Stata version 12 (Stata Corporation, USA).RESULTS The search for systematic reviews identi ed two studies with data on the role of chemoprophylaxis in preventing subsequent cases of IMD [ 9,13]. Both searched for RCTs and observational studies. The re-view by Purcell et al. in 2004 identi edve studies (four observational studies and a single small RCT), three of which were combined in a meta-analysis[13]. The review undertaken by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in 2010 identi ed a further observational study since the re- view by Purcell et al. [9]. When all domains of the AMSTAR tool were compared, the ECDC study re- lied mainly on one reviewer for study selection anddata extraction (J. M. Stuart, personal communica-tion), with fewer databases searched than the review by Purcell et al . Therefore the review by Purcell et al. was used as the starting point of the search for original research studies on the role of chemoprophy- laxis [ 9,13]. No systematic reviews were identi ed on the role of vaccination in preventing subsequent casesof IMD. Therefore the search for original research studies on the role of vaccination was conducted with- out a date limit. The search for original research studies identi ed 2381 studies of which 77 underwent a full text screen (Fig. 1 ). Of these, two new studies were identi ed for inclusion in this review, one addressing the roleof chemoprophylaxis and the other vaccination. No unpublished data were identi ed. Chemoprophylaxis A total of six studies met the eligibility criteria [20-25]; the study characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . There was one small RCT [ 20] and ve co- hort studies [ 21-25], of which four were suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 present the risk- of-bias assessments for the six included studies. All ve observational studies used routine treatment deci- sions speci c to the area when interventions were allo- cated [ 21-25]. In four studies the intervention groups were representative of household contacts of IMD [21 ,22,24,25] and the comparator groups were from the same population as the intervention group[21-23,25]. Baseline characteristics were not provided and comparability between the study groups were not assessed in all studies [ 21-25]. There was no informa- tion for 25 -32% of households followed-up in two studies [ 22,23], while information on missing dataProphylaxis for meningococcal disease 2261 https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268815000849 Published online by Cambridge University Presswas unavailable for the remaining three studies [ 21, 24,25]. There was inadequate control for confounding in all studies [ 21-25]. In the RCT undertaken in Dade County, Florida during an outbreak of IMD, 54 household contactswere randomized to either rifampicin ( or no treatment ( n= 19) [ 20]. There was a low to unclear risk of selection bias (while the intervention was allo-cated by dice throw there was no allocationconcealment) and a low risk of performance and detection bias. As there were no subsequent cases in either arms of the trial, this study was not considered further in this review. An observational study in Telemark, Norway over two time periods, assessed the role of rifampicin given to those harbouring disease-causing strains in addition to standard of care (penicillin to thoseaged <15 years) [ 24]. No subsequent cases occurred Fig. 1. Study selection process.

However, as the total number of house- hold contacts in the comparator group was unavail- able, a measure of effect could not be calculated andtherefore this study was excluded from any furtheranalysis. The remaining four cohort studies were conducted between 1973 and 2006 in Poland, Denmark, TheNetherlands and the USA [ 21-23,25]. Disease inci- dence in the populations were low, ranging from 0\u00b723 to 4\u00b700/100 000 population. IMD was diagnosedthrough routine health services. There were 1821 index cases, mostly with IMD caused by serogroups B and C. A total of 5675 household contacts wereeither given chemoprophylaxis ( n= in and sulphonamide. The comparatorgroup consisted of those receiving no antibiotics or antibiotics that were deemed unsuitable for use as chemoprophylaxis (e.g. penicillin). The de nition of a household contact was similar across studies (Table 1 ). Twenty cases of IMD occurred in household contacts of an index case; four in the rst 24 h follow- ing the index case and 16 subsequent cases (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the 30 days of follow-upno subsequent cases of IMD occurred in the interven- tion groups, while 14 subsequent cases occurred in the comparator groups [ 21-23,25]. The overall summary risk ratio for the occurrence of subsequent IMD in this30-day period was 0\u00b716 [95% con 0\u00b7008] in favour of chemoprophylaxis (Fig. 2 ). The overall summary risk difference was 0\u00b7005 (95% CI -0\u00b7009 to -0\u00b7001, P= 0\u00b7005), with the number needed to treat to prevent one subsequent case being 200 (95% CI 11 -1000). Three studies reported results up to a year of follow-up. In total, two subsequent cases of IMD occurred in the intervention groups, while nine sub-sequent cases occurred in the comparator groupsduring the total follow-up period. The overall sum- mary risk ratio and risk difference for the occurrence of subsequent IMD up to a year of follow-upwere 0\u00b734 0\u00b7009 to 0\u00b7002), re- spectively. However, it was unclear if the entirecohort in the included studies were followed up to a year, which would affect the denominators in these calculations.Vaccination A single quasi-RCT conducted in 1977 in Zaria, Nigeria during an epidemic of IMD caused by ser- ogroup A, assessed the effects of vaccination in pre- venting subsequent cases in 1043 household/closecontacts of an index case ( Table 1 )[26]. received the and C) vaccine, while the comparatorgroup n= 523) received tetanus toxoid. Supplementary Table S4 summarizes the risk-of-bias assessment for this trial. There was an unclear risk ofselection bias (alternative compounds allocated to intervention and comparator groups, with allocation concealment not being speci ed), a low risk of perform- ance bias and a low to unclear risk of detection bias(unclear if outcome assessment was blinded, which may have in fluenced classi cation of probable cases, but not de nite cases). There were no con rmed subsequent cases of IMD (meningitis with a positive culture, antigen test or rise in antibody titre) in the intervention group, whilethere were ve con rmed subsequent cases in the com- parator group. All but one of the con rmed subse- quent cases occurred within 30 days of the indexcase. There was one probable subsequent case ofIMD in the intervention group (meningitis with nega- tive cultures and antigen test orsepticaemia and high baseline antibody titre orrise in antibody titre) and four probable subsequent cases in the comparator group, all within 30 days of the index case. The risk of subsequent con rmed IMD in the 30-day period in those given was 0\u00b711 (95% CI 0\u00b701 -2\u00b707, P= 0\u00b714) times the risk in the comparator group. The risk of subsequent con rmed and probable IMD in the 30-day period in those given meningococcal vaccination was 0\u00b713 (95% CI 0\u00b702-1\u00b700, P= 0\u00b705) times the risk in the comparator group. Selective publication Due to the small number of identi ed studies formal analysis for publication bias could not be undertaken.

Based on four observational studies an 84% reduction in the risk of subsequent IMD in the 30-dayperiod after an index case was found in household contacts given chemoprophylaxis. However, the abso- lute risk reduction was small, with 200 householdcontacts needing treatment with chemoprophylaxisto prevent one subsequent case. No statistically signi - cant difference in the risk of con rmed IMD was found after 30 days in household contacts given men-ingococcal vaccination compared to those given tetanus-toxoid vaccine. Our results update and support the ndings of the previous systematic review by Purcell et al. [13]. We found an additional observational study on the role of chemoprophylaxis in household contacts publishedsince 2004 [ 21]. This study was the same additional study identi ed by the ECDC review [ 9]. All four stud- ies combined to generate a summary effect estimatewere cohort studies [ 21-23,25], with serious limita- tions which need to be considered when interpreting results. Information on baseline characteristics of the intervention and comparator groups were not avail-able. While adjustment for risk factors (such as age, socioeconomic status) would not have been possible in individual studies given the small number of subse-quent cases, the lack of baseline risk factor informa- tion leaves the comparability of the two groups in doubt. Imbalances in baseline characteristics couldin part have explained the results seen. Data on the completeness of follow-up in the two groups were not provided; therefore it is not possible to consider selectionbias in the included studies. However, most studies usedroutine national surveillance data and therefore differen- tial follow-up in the groups is unlikely. There were a large proportion of missing results in two studies where datawas provided, raising concerns about the generalizability ofndings. The small number of subsequent cases is reflected in the width of the con dence intervals for the measures of effect, resulting in imprecise summary esti- mates. Notwithstanding these limitations and the small number of studies, there was consistency in ndings across all included studies. This, combined with the bio-logical plausibility of the intervention and the severity of IMD, adds weight to our ndings and lends support to the use of chemoprophylaxis in household contacts ofan index case of IMD. Studies available for inclusion in this review on chemoprophylaxis were all from endemic countriesin Europe and the USA in non-outbreak settings. Therefore the applicability of the results to settings in sub-Saharan Africa is uncertain.

Studies have demonstrated that the risk of IMD to household contacts is highest in the rst week follow- ing the index case, and rapidly declines thereafter [ 7, 28]. Our ndings of a decreased risk of subsequent cases in the 30 days after chemoprophylaxis thereforesupport its use during this period of risk. While the data suggested a 66% reduction in the risk of subse- quent IMD up to a year of follow-up, there wasinsuf cient information regarding the follow-up data to draw rm conclusions on the sustained effects of chemoprophylaxis following the rst 30 days. Cipro floxacin and rifampicin are two commonly used chemoprophylactic agents, as they are known to be effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage ofN. meningitidis , can be given orally and are asso- ciated with generally mild and similar side-effect proles [12]. Antibiotic resistance is known to develop in meningococcal isolates exposed to rifampicin, whilethis is not seen to occur with cipro floxacin [ 12]. In addition, in sub-Saharan Africa fears of tuberculosis resistance to rifampicin is likely to limit its use as a chemoprophylactic agent. The cost of cipro floxacin is cheaper than rifampicin (US$4 per 100 vs.US$48, respectively) [ 29], with cipro floxacin beinggiven as a single dose and rifampicin needing a longer duration of treatment [ 12]. Therefore, cipro floxacin would be the preferred chemoprophylactic agent[12]. The cost associated with providing chemo- prophylaxis to household contacts in the UK showed varying results; following a case of IMD in a primaryschool pupil it was estimated at \u00a3318 [ 30], while a modelling study estimated this cost to be \u00a368 [ 31]. A study modelling chemoprophylaxis and vaccinationto household contacts following a case of IMD in school-aged children in the UK estimated this inter- vention to be cost saving at high relative risks of sub-sequent cases (cost per case prevented -\u00a3338 at arelative risk of 700) [ 32]. A single trial was identi ed which evaluated the role of vaccination in household contacts in prevent-ing subsequent cases of IMD [ 26]. While the data suggested an 89% reduction in the risk of de nite sub- sequent IMD in household contacts given vaccination,there was insuf to rule out a chance nding ( P= 0\u00b714). Given the dearth of information, conclusions cannot be drawn on the use of vaccinationin household contacts. However, it should be notedthat European guidance, which has been widely adopted, recommends the use of vaccination in add- ition to chemoprophylaxis in household contacts,when disease in the index case is caused by a vaccine- preventable strain [ 9].

Telisinghe and others https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268815000849 Published online by Cambridge University PressIn conclusion, this systematic review supports the use of chemoprophylaxis in household contacts of acase of IMD to prevent subsequent cases in non- epidemic settings. There is insuf cient evidence from this review to draw conclusions about the bene ts of vaccination for household contacts.
