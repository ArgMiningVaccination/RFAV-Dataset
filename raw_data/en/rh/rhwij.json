August 2014 1 Approved by Decree of the Kyrgyz Republic Jogorku Kenesh No. 3694-V of December 18, Kyrgyz Republic Susta inable Development Program 2013- 2017 Introduction The period 2009 through filled with symbolic events marked a new milestone in the Kyrgyz Republic deve lopment and will enter the country's history as the period of strength test fo r the Kyrgyz statehood and entire public administration system including soci opolitical, economic, environmental, financial and other areas of development management. The country development background during that period included the world financial crisis and growing unce rtainty on world markets which created risks for all market actors including the Ky rgyzstan's key trade partners such as Russia, Kazakhstan and China. However, the crucial impact of social and political development inside the country in 2010 was determinative. The Kyrgyz Republic moved to the parliamentary system. The most important result of that pe riod for Kyrgyzstan as a whole was the overcoming of unpredictable econom y fall against the background of the world financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, internal devel opments in April and June 2010, and technogenic accident at the country's largest gold mining company Kumtor in 2012. The deep sociopolitical and economic s hocks resulted in notable decrease in the country population's living standards. Thus, ab out 2.1 million people or 38 per cent of the total population wer e living beyond the poverty line, with about 66 per cent of th em in rural areas. In such a context, the arising is sue concerned the country's future development and the urgency of mobilization and rational use of all reserves and resources including those human, natu ral, financial and other to reach sustainable development positions. The government officially declared th e country's sustainable development oriented policy. For Kyrgy zstan as a country with its still high poverty level, particularly in rural areas, and lim ited natural and fina ncial resources, the sustainable development policy seems toda y's logically and politically justified choice. The sustainable development concept h as never seemed so in tune with traditions, spirit and mentality of Kyrgy zstan peoples and may play an extremely important role in consolidating the society since the Kyrgyzstan peoples, regardless of their ethnicity and parti es preferences, are unanimous in their 2 commitment to overcome hardships and live in a country that has its future and sustainable development positions. The sustainable development model itsel f suggests striving for systemacy, comprehensiveness and balance in deve lopment. Transition to sustainable development suggests considering economic growth through the prism of human values and reasonable use of natural resources. The Kyrgyz Republic's policy line or iented at sustainable development was supported by formation of the Kyrg yz Republic President National Council for Sustainable Development on November 24, 2012, that began its activities by uniting efforts of all state power branches , private sector and civil society with respect to issues of the Kyrgy zstan's future development. Establishment of the National Counc il for Sustainable Development (the Council hereinafter) headed by the Pr esident has become a timely step demonstrating the unity of the country a nd its peoples. The Council's work goal is to reach the consensus with regard to key positions of the Kyrgyz Republic's future sustainable development on the highest level policy platform. On January 21, 2013, based on the Council's second meeting results, the Kyrgyz Republic 2013-2017 National Sust ainable Development Strategy was approved by the Kyrgyz Re public President's Decree. In general, the approved strategic document for the period up to 2017 is a framework. In this document, the Kyr gyz Republic President highlighted strategic landmarks of the new strategic development model and major priorities and proposed launching 78 major invest ment projects for that period. Taking into account the fact that the implementation of the Kyrgyz Republic 2013-2017 National Sustainable Development Strategy requires a real administration tool for the next five y ears, the Kyrgyz Republic government has decided to develop the Kyrgyz Republ ic Sustainable Development Program 2013-2017. These five years will be the Kyrgy zstan's first stage of transition to the new sustainable development model. It wa s the first time in the country's post- soviet history, that its government made an unconventional decision to revive the five-year planning practice. It is supposed that objectives planned for this period will be implemented through the Kyrgyz Republic governmen t's annual plans, which will allow saving long-term succession in promo ting priorities and achieving target landmarks highlighted in the Kyrgyz Republic 2013-2017 Na tional Sustainable Development Strategy. The five-year plan 2013-2017 may be come crucial in the context of radical transformation of approaches to the provision of quality services to population by government, as the human development and human capital are declared as the country development absolute priorities. The sustainable development ultimate goal is human being, each citizen of the Kyrgyz Republic with equal rights and opportunities for the self-fulfillment. 3 I. CURRENT TRENDS OF THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC DEVELOPMENT The country's economic growth in y ears 2008 through 2012 reached 3.2% as annual average, per capita GDP incr eased by 20% ($1,013 to $1,209.7). The average annual inflation growth was 10.5% in 2008-2012. Average annual goods price growth was 11.9%, and serv ice prices grew almo st by 14.3%. By the end of 2012, the inflation reached 7.5%. Average annual population's real earnings growth rate for the period reach ed 13.3%. According to official data, overall unemployment level reached 8.4% within the period. Table 1 The Kyrgyz Republic's Key Economic Figures (2008-2012) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 GDP real growth (%) 108.4 102.9 99.5 106.0 99.1 Inflation (%) 20.0 0.0 19.2 5.7 7.5 Unemployment (%) 8.2 8.4 8.6 8.5 8.4 Current account transactions (% of GDP) -13.7 -2.3 -7.3 -6.3 Broad money growth (%) 12.6 17.9 21.1 14.9 23.8 External debt (% of GDP) 41.4 53.1 54.7 45.0 46.9 With the economy development paramete rs and sociopolitical background actually present in years 2008 through 2012, the national budget income was 26.9% of GDP that is 4.6% higher th e level of years 2004-2008. The national budget expenditure in 2008-2012 were gr owing annually by 24.7% as average and reached 35.2% of GDP in 2012.The to tal volume of external financing for the State Investment Program reached 5.1% of GDP by 2012. The budget deficit, with account of the State Inv estment Program, was 3.4% of GDP as average in 2008-2012. Thus, the Kyrgyz Republic government succeeded in ensuring the fulfillment of one of th e most macroeconomic stability objective that is to reduce and take over control of the national budget deficit. The Kyrgyz Republic managed to achieve sustainability in controlling the external debt that reached 41.4% of GDP in 2008 a nd 46.9% in 2012, which is much lower than the economic security thr eshold values for this indicator that is 80% of GDP. There was a stable growth trend in gov ernment social services financing. In 2008-2012, the specific weight of gove rnment spending grew from 5.2% to 7.1% of GDP for education services, from 2.4% to 3.7% of GDP for health, and from 2.5% to 5.7% of GDP for social welfare and insurance. 4 Notwithstanding the measures taken by the Kyrgyz Republic government in 2010 and 2011 to increase social benefi ts, financing and in come level remains low for the beneficiary cat egory. Average amount of monthly benefit in 2012 was 565 soms or 13% of the living wag e. At the same time, as result of reforming the compensation system for education and health institutions employees, their average monthly salary increased two time s as average and reached 184.3% and 220.3% of living wage in 2012. During the last five years, the Kyrgyz Republic government was consistently taking steps to increase pensions. As a result, average pension amount reached 4,208 soms by the en d of 2012 and incr eased three times comparing to 2008. The ratio of aver age pension amount to pensioner living wage increased from 45.7% to 110%. While in 2009, the number of persons of pension age receiving pension below the pensioner living wage was 452,9 thousand (86.6% of the total number), this figure was only 344 thousand by the end of 2012 (62.2% of the total number). At the same time, the negative impact of the world financial crisis and sociopolitical tension inside the country led to the worsening living quality in general. Significant region al imbalance remains in poverty level. The highest poverty level has been noted in Jalal-A bad oblast (55.7%), Osh oblast (51.4%) and Naryn 1.1. Urgency of and Prerequisites for the Kyrgyz Republic Transition to Sustainable Development Economic growth in the Kyrgyz Re public has so far been mostly occurring due to uncontrolled use of si gnificant volume of na tural resources. Huge losses and degradation of natural ca pital has also been taking place. In general, according to expe rts, over 75% of the count ry's area are exposed to increased risk of natural capital degradation. Thus, the country's depths contain deposits of a wide range of minerals. Such deposits exploration, with accoun t of ensuring environmental safety, contributes significantly to economic development. The gold mining share is about 11% in country's GDP , 40% in industrial producti on and 48% in export. However, the mineral raw material finiteness is already requiring the government to calculate benefits and cost s of their extraction in the long-term, taking into considerati on their drop-out of the c ountry's natural capital. A separate element to be considered in assessing benefits and costs is the toxic waste storages remaining within th e country following closure of mining companies and requiring significant financia l investments to maintain them in proper condition and prevent negative impact. Water as a natural resource and a source of the coun try's internal stability and wellbeing may only be multiplied in co ntext of protection of Kyrgyzstan's natural ecosystems and glaciers. The Ky rgyz Republic is the only Central Asian country with water resources completely formed within its area, which is its 5 hydrological peculiarity and advantage. Ho wever, a significant part of collected water is lost in process of use. Du ring the period 2006 through 2010, average water loss in transportation reac hed 23% of the water intake. Agriculture is the main sweet water consumer. The most significant part of water intake, 93%, is used for irrigation and agricultural water supply purposes. However, water resources are used inefficiently in this area and water losses are excessive. In general, this sector is developing outside the environment saving growth principles and has low produc tion capacity, low efficiency and law ability to adjust itself to changi ng climate context. Crop rotation and structure are disturbed. Th e area of degraded agricultural lands including arable lands and pastures is in creasing. All this im pedes the growth of crop production and livestock sector output. Since 1985, the area of degraded land has significantly increased, with about 80% of agricultural lands recogni zed at risk of degrading as of 2011, however precise monitoring has not been carried out since 1990. Average pasture productivity decreased to 40% and that of closest pastures to 10-20% of norm. The livestock structure and br eed composition do not contribute to rational use of pastures. Energy saving and power efficiency is sues have become urgent as the forecasted power generation output defici t will reach 5 billion kW/h, and a problem arises related to stable power supply services delivery to population and economy entities functioning . Therefore, introduction of energy saving and power efficiency mechanisms, both at major production and household levels seems reasonable if carried out simultaneously. Transition to sustainable developmen t makes it necessary to include the environmental factor in the system of development main economic indicators. Presently, conventional macr oeconomic figures (GDP, in come per capita) ignore environmental degradation. These figures growth in the country is currently based on technogenic and natural resource intensive development. Thus, there is a risk of dramatic deterioration of econom ic figures in case of natural resources exhaustion and envir onment pollution. Calculation of macroeconomic a nd microeconomic figures without consideration of the natural capital wear will lead to distorted economic outcomes which in its turn will result in environment degradation and unstable country development. Taking into account the above far from being complete list of issues existing in the country due to the ruli ng priority of ec onomic benefit by all means, the urgency of the Kyrgyz Republic transition to sustainable development is obvious and increasing ma ny times in context of growing risks of natural resource depleti on and environment pollution. By the end of the 20th century, the struggle for resources became aggravated dramatically along with unprecedented income stratification throughout the world and substantial pove rty increase. As a result, the world faced the unprecedented challenge of creating substantially new model of 6 civilization development, a sustainable de velopment model that could resist the coming global sociopoli tical, economic and environmental crisis. The struggle for resources is expect ed to be more aggravated in the nearest future. The illusion of natural r esources inexhaustibility is blowing over. Kyrgyzstan has not become an exception in this global view. Moreover, in the context of extremely limited resources and the need of their rational use, with the political problems existing in the count ry, the issues of future sustainable development have become urgent as never and come out to the foreground. 1.2. Overall View and Specifics of the Kyrgyz Republic Transition to Sustainable Development The Kyrgyz Republic's entire contem porary history has been developing under the mark of reforms which seem a response to the challenge of modern times. The advancement of such reform s is inevitable since everything is changing around including economy acquir ing its global natu re, living quality standards more and more based on the human rights aspect, and environment requiring us to make its development sustainable. In its independent de velopment history, Kyr gyzstan succeeded to overcome multiple deep shocks, prevent deeper economy collapse, and save its natural capital and base positi ons in economy in order to declare its intent to move to the sustainable development prin ciples. In world practice, sustainable development is first of all understood as comprehens ive and balanced public administration of the three interlinke d development compone nts: (i) economy; (ii) social development, and (iii) environment. Human being or social development is the center and ultimate goal of such development. Therefore, the hum an capital development will remain the Kyrgyzstan's absolute national priority bo th at present and in the long term. It suggests that all th e country citizens have an oppo rtunity to obtain good quality education, maintain their health, buy a hom e, have decent earnings and live in health friendly environment using their knowledge and skills. This is the first time that the priority of hu man development and human ca pital is declared as the absolute national priority in developmen t, with each Kyrgyzstan citizen equally empowered to develop. Meanwhile, the Kyrgyz Republ ic's current development background includes global financial shoc ks, debt issues, signs of recession in some EU countries, and economic grow th slowdown in the US. The capital inflow to developing coun tries has dramatically reduced. Many countries' ratings have been revised towards decrease. Global trends show growing risks and challenges including global climate ch anges leading to food deficit in the population growth context. In practical respect, the sustainable development model is a way the society, the state and economy are orga nized and functioning on sustainability basis ensuring internal and external risks prevention and neutralization. 7 It is obvious that momentar y and random actions will not take the country to the sustainable development vector as the sustainable development model itself suggests striving for systemacy and bala nce in development. The essence of the model is that the natural environment is considered a pool of resources required to meet economic needs and growing community demand. Therefore, within this Program, th e economic policy is developed with consideration of rational us e of natural resources thro ugh the country's higher competitiveness, development intensific ation and advanced growth of labor capacity. The degree of the Kyrgyz economy in tegration with the world economic system through the export diversificati on and retaining liberal foreign trade policies should definitely and substantially rise. Ensuring the labor capacity growth , economy acceleration and export diversification will require more efficien t elaborating of tools to regulate the business environment for th e development of business and industries where Kyrgyzstan has potential relative advantag es, particularly in agriculture and power industry, in key su stainable development prio rities, as well as in mining sector, agroindustrial complex processing i ndustries, and specific service areas including tourism. One of favorable prerequisites in this process will be the public administration system reforms launched in Kyrgyzstan and aimed at minimizing the government interference with business, which alr eady give initial results with respect to simplification of proce dures for opening, licensing and running of business in Kyrgyzstan. One of the most important investment policy areas will be the creation of most favorable conditions for domestic and internati onal investors to include ensuring protection of rights of prope rty owners and parties to economic relationships. In general, the Kyrgyz Republic Sustainable Development Program 2013- 2017 is based on the five new components. First of all, three sets of the Pr ogram sections with relevant policy measures (economy, social development a nd environmental aspects) are closely interlinked with the sustainable devel opment model components. The prevailing principle was used to formulate the policy of transition to sustainable development through the interrelation and mutual influence of economic, social and environmental processes. In power industry, such transition is shown by certain measures to promote power saving, low-carbon de velopment and expansion of non- conventional power sources. Therefore, th e construction sector has already been considered through the measures to im prove the attractiveness of projects oriented at power saving construction. In agriculture, one of the prospective priorities is the organic agriculture and manufacturing of ecologically clean products. The processing industry priority is development of policy meas ures to gradual tr ansition to resource saving technologies. 8 The environmental set cons iders measures aimed at reduction of economic activities harmful impact, ensuring access to drinking water, saving the biological diversity and re storing natural ecosystems, and reducing the disaster risks in the changing climate context. Secondly, taking into account that su stainable development first of all means comprehensive and balanced public administration and that this Program is an administration tool , the policy contents has for the first time been formulated for all development areas th rough specific requirements to the key components of the public administration system: (i) institutional capacity; (ii) legislation; (iii) human resource capaci ty and the need of its improvement to promote sustainable development prin ciples within the country; and (iv) reliability of information for reconc iled policy solutions. Relevant policy measures have been proposed based on the critical evaluation of the current public administration ins titutes system capacity. The third novelty feature of the Program in the context of the country's transition to sustainable development is the main section covering the human development policies with the Kyrgyz Republic govern ment's detailed plans to improve the living quality for each population categor y by 2017 through specific commitments to the governments service s quality improvements and indicators to measure progress within the next five years (see Annex 7). For this purpose, new methodology prin ciples were developed and used to formulate policy and asses the quality of government services oriented at specific population category, from the very moment of birth to the old age, including all social services guaranteed to population. Furthermore, a set of special meaningful indicators was devel oped to evaluate progress in this direction (see Annex 8). The fourth and the most complex nove lty feature of the Program is the cross-sectoral segments (see Annex 9) in providing government services to population which have never been mentioned in any pr ogram and have remained a weakness of the public administratio n system where in certain cases a line ministry alone, without support of local governance bodies, will not be able to address issues including the following: (i) working children; (ii) school students health; (iii) children with disabilities; (iv) unemployment among university graduates; (v) safe school environmen t; (vi) unemployment among illiterate adult rural citizens; (vii) issues of pe rsons with disabilities who need special education, health and employment service s; (viii) constructi on, development and infrastructure support of pr eschools, mainstream education institutions and medical facilities; (ix) ener gy efficiency and safety of the social infrastructure facilities. The section of regional sustainabl e development has become the Program's prevailing one. This is the fifth element re lated to new approaches since there may not be entire country 's sustainable development without regional economies input. The local community development polic y is based on the understanding of the fact that conventional a pproaches to regional devel opment are today hampering 9 their development. The time has come to become oriented at regional specialization, interregional trade and cooperation. The conventionally specialized, projec t-targeted model of regional local community sustainable development is proposed instead of the industry model of regional development. At the same time, the two-level model of intergovernmental fiscal relations should become the encouraging factor for local gove rnance bodies with respect to promotion of prospective project s locally. As for oblasts and districts, development foundations are proposed for them. Through the above measures, the Ky rgyzstan's regions will become more recognizable both inside and outside the country and acquire stable and specific brands which have already been clearl y identified such as 'beans of Talas', 'Batken dried apricot', Uzgen five-year devel opment vector (2013-2017) builds upon the existing economic basis with reaching stable development positions through the promotion of natural sustainable de velopment priorities such as mountainous ecosystems, water resources, agricu lture, power industry, and tourism. 1.3. Goals and Objectives at the State of the Kyrgyz Re public Transition to Sustainable Development The period 2013 throug h 2017 should become th e one of change and determination in the Kyrgyzstan's transi tion to sustainable development. Within this period, the Kyrgyz Republic should b ecome a country orie nted at successful implementation of the Kyrgyz Republic National Sustainable Development Strategy, with improved go vernance institutes, effec tive laws, advanced human resource capacity willing to strengthen the basis of the country's sustainable development, people's advanced envi ronmental and economic thinking and improved social and econom ic ratings in global development including significant rise of the Kyrgyz Re public's human development index. 1.4. Challenges and Risks in Transition to Sustainable Development Kyrgyzstan is situated almost in th e center of the Eurasian continent, with long distances to all four oceans and with no di rect access to powerful international transport communicati ons. The Kyrgyzstan has population of 5,551,900 with 300 thousand to 1 million labor emigrants, according to different estimates. Rare earth and precious metals and coal are prevailing in rich mineral deposits. All this, with the country's mountainous landscape and sharply continental climate conditions specifics of production structur e and substantially impacts export structure and capacities. The world economy has been facing s ubstantial problems for the last few years. Financial and economic cri ses cover not only economically weak countries but also devastatingly impact developed countries including the United 10 Stated, European countries an d others. Some countries have been facing chronic internal conflicts. The growth of financ ial, economic, terrorism and ideological risks lead to necessity of measures aimed at economy and export diversification and higher competitiveness, creation of sustainable political system and achievement of interior harmony. Key im portance has been gi ven to the Kyrgyz Republic's membership with internationa l alliances such as Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO ) and others, as well as strategic cooperation with conventiona l development partners. The Kyrgyz Republic is a part of global econom y. The country's economy openness1 reached 105 per cent in 2011. Econom ic relations have been deeper penetrating international a nd regional capital, goods, se rvices and labor markets. Accordingly, the depende nce on such markets is increasing. The global economy, along with the line of economic crises, witn esses the emergence of new centers of economic power. For the last few decades, several developing countries, first of all those of the Asian continent, have been demonstrating high economic growth and domestic market de velopment rate. In the future, the economic development achievements, as well as setbacks will to significant degree depend on the country's ability to make use of competitive advantages and occupy advantageous pos itions within the interna tional division of labor. Meanwhile, the national econom y is oriented at export, mostly of raw materials and mineral products. The export specialization is ch aracterized by low science intensiveness. Furthermore, the country's econom y has environment-intensive nature and develops in rather an extensive wa y. The existing limitations and stimuli insufficiently orient development at lower environment in tensiveness of all human activities and, first of all, pr oduction processes. As a result, the accumulation of the mass of factors unfa vorable for environment is taking place. This is expressed by grow ing environment pollution, degrading water and land quality and lower biological diversity. The c ountry has some facilities inherited from the soviet era containing toxic an d radioactive waste. Their destruction poses a threat to the entire region environment. Global climate changes represent a stable trend for which the entire humanki nd is getting prepared. Kyrgyzstan's nature and economy, due to geographic sp ecifics and production structure, is very sensitive to such changes manif estations. The most serious threat to people's lives, production capacities, set tlements and life support facilities are being posed by earthquakes, landslides, mu d flows, avalanches and other natural phenomena. Potential extreme temperature values in global climate changes may pose threat to stable functioning of wat er, heat and power supply systems and have negative impact on cr ops growth and development and biological diversity. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan as a mount ainous country situ ated within the watercourse formation area is facing the th reat of substantial decrease of water resources including almost full (64% to 95%) glacier extinction by 2100. More 1 Foreign trade turnover ratio to GDP. 11 serious consequences are expected for th e water sector in the nearest 20 years when, according to forecasts, stable decr ease of surface flow is expected. Such a situation may result in water supply defic it in Kyrgyzstan and the Central Asian region as a whole. State regulation of economy, notwi thstanding measures applied, still remains ineffective. On the one hand, the state systematically implements measures to reduce interferenc e with companies' activit ies. On the other hand, the state taking business out of admini strative pressure often increases risks for government, municipal and private proper ty and environment without finding alternative ways to address the issue. The state's economic policy set forth in strategic and programmatic documen ts and actual practice of economy regulation are often torn away from each other. Transition to program budgeting is extremely slow. Lack of political responsibility for outcomes of adopted strategies and programs implementati on remains a fundamental problem of public administration. The Kyrgyz Republic's economy is characterized by high imbalance between production and consumption, ac cumulation and cons umption, growth of employable population and the economy's capability of absorbing the labor resource. Territorial disproportions result in inefficient use of material, financial and human resources and reduce the national economy growth capacity. The government sector of economy is regulated inefficiently. Government assets mostly include structure-forming strategic enterprises the overwhelming majority of which are monopolies in indus tries such as ener gy, mining, railroad transport, etc. To date, the enterprise management system is not adjusted to achieve high activity output, with th eir actually preserved management inefficiency and non-transparency. Some di shonest managers turn such situation to advantage which is then \"sold\" to us ers in form of production costs using the pricing mechanism. The non-government sector of econo my is characterized by significant share of informal economy reaching 39% of GDP according to expert estimates. A large number of business entities which act ually stay within preferential tax niches undermine the fiscal policies, create unfair competition environment, produce false messages and stimuli for economic development, distort official statistics, and lead to inefficient administrative solutions in economy development. However, the main damage caused to the country through the informal sector is the investors' decr eased trust to the country's investment climate and corruption promot ion. Presently, Kyrgyzstan stands on inadmissibly low positions in a number of fundament al ratings, particularly on the 127 th position in the Global Competitiveness Index 2012-2013 (126th position the year before), 71st position in the Doing Bu siness 2012 index (73rd the year before). The country's energy security level is under permanent threat. The country's own power resour ce production is mostly concentrated in production of electric power with over 90% generated by hydroelectric plants. The country imports over 90% of all co nsumed carbons. All this conditions country's high dependence on river water c ontent and world prices for oil, petrol and gas. 12 The tariff policy in energy sector is excessively depending on social aspects of development. This circumstan ce is limiting the ability to accumulate resources for technical modernizatio n which, combined with dishonest management, results in increased breakdown rate. The power equipment wear rate is as follows: 57.6% at Toktogul H ydroelectric Plants System, 64% at the Bishkek Heat and Electric Power Pant, an d 77.8% at the Osh Heat and Electric Power Pant. Further development of ener gy sector as a competitive branch of the Kyrgyzstan's economy is complicated by lack of long-term regulations of region's water power resources use c oordinated with other Central Asian countries. The situation with excessive labo r force in the Kyrgyz Republic is resolved by mass labor migration, part icularly of the population's youngest and most energetic part. This trend combin ed with addressing urgent issues of employment and emerging stable resource of currency inflow to the country leads to degrading human ca pital inside the country. Mass migration leads to the tearing of family ties, actual fatherl essness and poses growing threat to the family institution. Socioeconomic probl ems also motivate increase in internal migration and population concentration in Bishkek and other large cities. Cities' limited capability of accepting incoming population created increased load on social infrastructure and causes tensi ons in socioeconomi c and sociopolitical spheres. Notwithstanding the government's efforts and donor support, quality health services become less accessible to people. Orientation at development of medical institutions and private clinic networks in Kyrgyzstan has allowed extending the range and improving the quality of services provided however increased their cost for those in need of medical assistance. Currently, the health system is to a significant degree concen trated on practical medicine while little attention is paid to disease prevention. Mass physical culture as a tool of human physical and spiritual health has not be en properly developed. As a result, the level of physical co ndition of children and adolescents is low. Education level is exposed to slow degradation in Kyrgyzstan. The quality of training is very low, particularly in village schools with Kyrgyz and Uzbek languages of instruction. Sk ills imparted to school and university students turn out to be quite ineffective in practice, and most of e ducation institutions do not form personalities socially adjusted to sustainable development. Overall economic and cultural environment do es not promote hardworking among students to master their curricula but ra ther encourages obtai ning the university degree diploma by any means including those corruptive. People's access to culture values a nd their cultural development level do not meet long-term concerns of society and economy development. Culture and its material and nonmaterial values and institutions are not of government's particular concern due to lack of resour ces. Kyrgyz culture is becoming less known abroad, to significant degree, due to decreasing number of international level works and culture values and in sufficient popularization. Social consciousness is exposed to external ideo logical and cultural influence which to 13 some extent leads to declining from trad itional moral, ethical and culture values and confuses the society and particularly the youth. Statements of the urgency of forming a national ideology remain unf ulfilled. Cyber hazards constitute a growing threat throughout the world. Cu rrently, internal political destabilization is more often linked to targ eted use of social networks . The world statistics is fixing the growth of cyber crimes and increase in number of offences such as unauthorized access to funds, confiden tial information stored on electronic media, etc. Employment of informatio n systems for producti on process control makes such processes vulnerable to e xposure. Information security issues require focused government policies, highly qualified experts and means of protection against unau thorized access to in formation systems. II. AREAS AND PRIORITIES OF THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC'S TRANSITION TO SUSTAIN ABLE DEVELOPMENT 2.1 . Sustainable Development Policy Basis 2.1.1. Increasing the Public Administration and Local Governance Capacities The overall goal is to form an effi cient and open public administration system within the country meeting people's needs a nd concerns and able to resist challenges and address sustainable development objectives. Background. The current executive power system of public administration is growingly criticized both by society an d the Kyrgyz Republic President and Jogorku Kenesh. It is less oriented at people's needs and concerns and unable to response adequately to cha llenges and risks and addres s urgent objectives, being at the same time perceived by people as sc ene and source of corruption. It is the administration system that the present failure of most reforms is hidden behind. None of the steps underta ken to reform the public administration system has been completed. As a result, presen tly, the public administration system is facing lack of diverse models at which the reforms were oriented. The administration system functioning is not or iented at result and first of all that expected by society. Government bodi es' programs and plans do not show specific goals to be achie ved. The system is working for itself, without any elaborated programs. According to expert es timates, up to 70% of time is being spent on current tasks fulfillment rather than on development oriented planned work. The administration system issues also include the functional confusion. There are no uniform approaches to functions formulation, content and implementation. Multiple excessive functi ons are still being fulfilled resulting in excessive influence on and interfer ence with business environment and prevailing services commercialization. At the same time, many necessary administrative functions are not implemen ted at all or implemented partially. Other functions are incomplete and th erefore futile. The 2012 practices have 14 revealed substantial problems related to the policy development functions, particularly those of contro l and supervision. There is a weak mastering of up- to-date management technologies sugges ting transition from administering to development and implementa tion of specific public administration measures. Negligent fulfillment of tasks and fu nctions and inability to explore new activity areas are the issues dominatin g in the government bodies functioning (44%). Such a situation is directly point ing at the human capacity problem. The situation is aggravated the change of managerial generations , and mechanism of succession of professional experience, in stitutional memory and intergeneration ties are lost. The public service system is not able to sa turate itself with appropriate staff, nor does the higher pr ofessional education system ensure adequate level of candida tes for public service office s. In 2012, only 3,493 of 7,104 applicants (49%) passed the threshold. Public administration is not organized integrally and consistently. As a rule, government institutions pursue na rrow departmental concerns with prejudice to those of the state. The situ ation is being aggrav ated by management of different executive authorities implemen ted under different level regulations. One of the current public administrati on system weaknesses is the lack of institutional mechanism to address issu es of cross-sector/interdepartmental cooperation, therefore practic ally no attention is paid to the interdepartmental segment government services although th ere are specific population categories in need of such services (Annex 9). Such situation contributes to low publ ic trust to executive power bodies. The country's public trust score was -5.8 as of the 4th quarter of 2012. The lack of individual oriented approach in government bodies' activities and poor quality of government services also c ontribute to public mistrust. Actual mechanism for real public opinion consid eration does not wo rk in government solutions development and adoption. Local governance is characterized by presence of all the above mentioned issues, however specific ones as well exist. There is still a gap between government and municipal service. The existing local budget support and cross- budget transfer systems require improveme nt with considerat ion of necessary increase of local governa nce bodies' accountability. During the last 2-3 years the Kyrgyz Republic government implemented targeted measures to address the situa tion and bring the administration system into a compact and effective form. Substa ntial groundwork has been prepared to optimize the government service provision system and licensing system, as well as for the system functional and structur al ordering. However all that is not enough. The current situation requir es creation and introduction of an administration model that could serve its citizens based on population's social demand and ensure effective mechanis m for public control over government. For this purpose, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to correct substantially the process of the current public administration system reform. First of all, a key role of ministri es and agencies in modern world is provision of services to community and c itizens. In this view, service provision 15 standards will be developed, agreed upon with public and approved and further enforced by government. Secondly, the public administration functions will be redistributed based on the principle of a ddressing all issues at administration levels and by organizations that will offer most rational, cost-effective and effective ways both for state and societ y. Thirdly, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to make activiti es of all the public administration institutions result-oriented and increase the sense of responsibility for specific result achievement. Fourthly, the Kyrg yz Republic government will move from preferential admini stration practice to the govern ment policy development and implementation with involvement of al l concerned parts of society. Such involvement will be stipulated in relevant regulations. All the above four components of th e public administration system reform will become the policy basis designed to set the fashion and change the contents of public administration. Hence, the public administration system reform will be implemented in the following four priority areas: (i) strengthening the capacity of executive power government bodies; (ii) improve ment of vertical and horizontal manageability, integrity a nd consistency of the executive power system; (iii) development of human resource capacity of government and m unicipal service; (iv) development of sound local governance. The priority area of strengtheni ng the capacity of executive power government bodies will be focused on a ddressing the following objectives: (i) strengthening the executive power gove rnment bodies' capacity of task and function fulfillment and government pr operty management, and government services' capacity of law enforcem ent and government services quality supervision; (ii) introduction of the outcome-based administration principle using the program budgeting t ool; (iii) legislation improve ment in line with this programmatic document.

Judicial System Reform The current Kyrgyz Republic developm ent is characterized by increased civil society attention to state power bodies activities and first of all to those of judicial power. Notwithstanding certain positive outcome of judicial system reforms implemented in years 1994 through 2009, the system failed to become a complete state power branch standing aside politics and providing for the rule of law. Notwithstanding the measures taken to strengthen the status of judges, the justice administration quality and culture did not improve. The courts' authority and public trust in them decreased. The judicial administration has pre served mechanisms contributing to corruption. Reduced government funding of judicial system directly affects the justice administration quality. The current stage of socioeconomic reforms requires moving courts to a new level of administration of just ice and sets new objectives requiring revolutionary and quality changes in judici al system. This conditions the need in 19 substantial government suppo rt and employment of new additional resources in order to improve courts efficiency. Goals and objectives set in the Kyrgyz Republic 2013-2017 National Sustainable Development Strategy2 and the document on measures to improve justice in the Kyrgyz Republic3 approved by the Kyrgyz Republic presidential decrees are of fundamental importance for the country's judicial system development. Creation of independent judi cial power capable of reliably protect rights and freedoms of human and citizen has been determined as a strategic goal. The above goals make its necessary to ensure addressing comprehensively the issues related to court system reform and development, justice administration procedures improveme nt, justice humanization, and law enforcement reform. Based on goals and objectives set, the judicial system reform will be implemented through the following: - development and approva l of updated procedural laws and other ones regulating court arrangement and activiti es; alternative conflict resolution mechanisms; provision of pr ofessional legal assistan ce; execution procedures. - justices selection process based on professionalism and impeccability, election of the Supreme Court and its Constitutional Chamber judges, appointment of local court justices, a nd improvement the process of justices self-purification and responsibility increase; - judicial system financ ial support and logistic base improvement with account of actual needs through the gove rnment developmen t and parliament approval of the State Program of Judici al System Development 2013-2017 (draft State Target Program \"Judicial System Development 2013-201 7\"), and update of laws with respect to the judicial system funding4. 2.1.3. Country's National Security and Defense Capacity The overall goal is to reach national security and defense capacity that meets the country's needs as a necessa ry condition for the state and society sustainable development. Background. Kyrgyzstan's national secur ity is exposed to external threats including those of extrem ist organizations and orig ination from Afghanistan. For the purpose of state border rein forcement, measures were taken to establish the south-west re gional commandment. Additi onal military units were deployed in Batken and Jalal-Abad obl asts. However, as a whole, the current defense system is not capable of giving adequate response to external threats due to poor up-to-date arms provision and low professional trai ning level of the country's Armed Forces staff. 2 Presidential Decree No. 11 of January 21, 2013. 3 Presidential Decree No. 147 of August 8, 2012. 4 More detailed description of activities is included in the draft State Target Program \"Judicial System Development 2013-2017\". 20 The public security sphere has also been facing growing issues related to law enforcement activities such as (i) lo w public trust in the Kyrgyz Republic Interior Ministry (MVD here inafter); (ii) corruption; (iii) pursuing the crime detection rate and violatio n of human rights and freed oms; (iv) insufficient professional training and the system po liticization; (v) high criminogenic level; (vi) established negative management fo rms and methods; (vii) lack of interior bodies activities transparency. Low administrative level of interior bodies officers, frequent changes in the MVD senior personnel and unwillingness to introduce management innovations in law enforcement sphere ha ve ultimately unde rmined trust in MVD both in civil society and among interior bodies staff. In general, there is a negative im age of law enforcement officer in population. There are facts of red tape in citizens' applica tions processing and ungrounded refusal to initiate criminal cases, low qua lity of criminal investigation, as well as offenders acquittals by cour ts and ungrounded placement to temporary detentio n centers (TDC hereinafter). Based on goals and issues identifi ed, ensuring national concerns protection and territorial integrity and c ounteraction against external threats to the Kyrgyz Republic will constitute the first priority area that will be implemented through addressing the following objectives. First of all, the following measur es will be implemented to ensure territorial integrity and reinforce the country's border guard: (i) optimizing the activities of government delegations fo r the Kyrgyz Republic borders with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan; (ii) engagement of the Kyrgyz Republic frontier area community members in Batken and Jalal-Ab ad oblasts in join t border security activities including formation of vigilante groups Sakchy, etc. (iii) completion of the bypass road construction in Batken oblast; (iv) timely allocation funds for engineering works (barbwire installati on, trench excavation) along approved sections of Kyrgyz-Uzbek state border an d certain parts of Kyrgyz-Tajik border where border sectors in Batken oblast will be considered a priority.

The first task is to improve the regulative framework for the military reform preparation. The following measur es will be implemented to address this task: to develop and approve the Kyr gyz Republic Draft Military Doctrine in collaboration with the Kyrgyz Republic Defense Council Secretariat; (ii) to adjust the Kyrgyz Republic defense system legislatur e plan on annual basis. The second task that is to estab lish the Armed Forces Uniform Control Center will be addressed by initiating modi fications to the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Defense and Armed Forces based on results of discussions to be held at of the Kyrgyz Republic De fense Council meetings. The third task is to im prove the army professionalism. The following measures will be implemented to address this task: (i) to develop and approve the Plan of the Kyrgyz Republic Armed Forces Staffing on Contractual Basis; (ii) to implement stage-by-stage activiti es for transition to contract based staffing.

The following measures will be implemented to address this task: (i) to develop and approv e the mechanism of targeted allocation of funds for the Kyrgyz Republic Armed Forces development; (ii) to deve lop and approve the Kyrgyz Republic Armed Forces National Development Program. 2.1.4. Strengthening the Rule of Law in the Kyrgyz Republic for Sustainable Development 23 The overall goal is to provide const itutional guarantees to society through the achievement of the rule of law. Background. One of the legislatio n development conditions is the acquirement of the system of specifi c requirements set for the legislature process. Certain steps have already been undertaken in this area. The state has implemented measures that allow taking the legislature process to a new quality level. Such measures include the adoptio n of the new version of the Law on the Kyrgyz Republic Regulations, Gu idelines on Legal, Human Rights, Environmental, Gender and Anticorruptio n Expert Analysis of the Kyrgyz Republic Bylaws and draft law development forward planning. At the same time, the country's legi slation still contains a number of outdated norm requirin g update and comprehensive revision. In this view, further activities for the improvement of the state's legal basis should be built upon the Constitution norms developmen t, actual needs of society and adherence to the Rule of Law principl e. Therefore, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to work for the improvement of quality of adopted regulations, identification of collisi ons and controversia l norms through the legislation inventory mechanis m, arrangement of specialized expert reviews, etc. The result of such work should be the elaborati on of quality regulations. Numerous regulations have been a dopted with no proper elaboration of the financial and economic aspects thus being doomed fo r non-compliance. Furthermore, legislature bodies often develop regulations duplicating or contradicting each other wh ich affect law enforcemen t practice increasing the number of controversial legal norms. As a result, the number of amendments to regulations grows witnessing poor qua lity of the legislature process. Another issue related to development of quality and appropriate legislation is the lack of dialog platfo rm on which the \"arc hitecture\" of future regulation could be develope d, its potential effects a nd prospects analyzed, and potential risks examined. The existence of the listed issues wi tnesses the necessity of revising the state's legislature policy, increasing the capacity of government bodies involved in legislation and liability for poor quali ty legislation work, and increasing the capacity of the body responsible for go vernment bodies' legislation activities coordination. Therefore, balanced development of legislation system with account of the Kyrgyz Republic sustai nable development up to 2 017 will be the priority area, including the following objecti ves list: (i) legislation process modernization; (ii) development of quali ty legislation based on the set of human development and country's economy issues ; (iii) citizens legal enlightenment and education. The Kyrgyz Republic government inte nds to address the first objective by implementing the following activities: (i) to identify collisi ons and gaps, as well as corruptive provisions in legislat ion through legal, human rights, environmental, gender and anticorruptio n expert analysis; (ii) based on the inventory findings, draft re gulations should be devel oped aimed at eliminating 24 collisions, gaps and corruptive provisions in legislation; (iii) to develop and approve accreditation procedures for indi viduals and entities which will carry out specialized expert review of draft regulations; (iv) to amend laws as to cessation of adoptin g regulations not provided w ith financial resources for enforcement. The following measures are planned to a ddress the second ob jective: (i) to develop activities coordination mechan ism for government bodies involved in legislation process with respect to s ynchronic and coordinated planning and forecasting of legislation development; ( ii) to establish a nd expert advisory council at the Kyrgyz Republ ic Ministry of Justice that will serve as a legislation think-tank in implementing the Kyrgyz Republic 2017 Sustainable Development Program and form a dialog pl atform for government bodies. To address the third objective that is related to citizens legal enlightenment and education the Kyr gyz Republic gover nment intends as follows: (i) to develop a legal promotio n concept; (ii) to establish and launch central legal data bank; and (iii) to develop a set of regulations aimed at regulating practical measures for th e legal promotion implementation by government bodies. 2.1.5. Anticorruption Policy The overall goal is to reduce corruptio n to the level at which it does not hamper the development of state and society (up to 15 positions annually, according to Transparency International). Background. Corruption in Kyrgyzstan h as become a serious threat to the country's national security . Corruption undermines pub lic trust in government, destroys the entire public ad ministration system, and leads to the fall of the state power authority and public service prestige. According to expert data , the damage caused by co rruption in Kyrgyzstan has reached 30 billion soms ($70 million) per year, while the budget revenues reached $1,83 billion in 2012. The phenom enon's multifactor nature and links to other criminal activities re quire strong political will for combating corruption. Such political will has recently been de clared at the highest authority level. However, there is a number of problems affecting the antic orruption policy efficiency. Lack of a specialized institution for development and coordination of an integral anticorruption policy within the public administration system is significantly decreasing the effectiveness of activities in this area. Functions performed by the Anticorruption Serv ice of the Kyrgyz Republic State Committee for National Secur ity are only oriented at further strengthening of law enforcement capacity for combating co rruption, while corruption prevention objectives and functions remain overlooked. Lack of real and effective m echanism for cooperation between bodies responsible for coordination and law en forcement bodies combating corruption implications makes it difficult to arrange a unified system for the anticorruption 25 policy implementation. Therefore, it is ve ry important to establish an effective institutional mechanism for co rruption prevention measures. Presently, legislation basics have been developed for combating corruption. However, further improvement of anticorruption legislation is required for the strengthening of antico rruption expert analysis institution, public control mechanism developmen t, and government and municipal administration system improvement. Inte rnational practice also shows that substantial results may only be achieve d in this area with public support. The Kyrgyz Republic laws do not prov ide special methods of corruption crime detection and investigation. The institutional basis for corruption crime investigation and adequate anticorru ption laws and bylaws are practically absent. The Kyrgyz Republic Criminal Procedural Code establishes uniform basis for investigation of all types of crimes including those related to corruption. Anticorruption laws provide the corruption combating mechanism although not quite efficient. Lack of details in le gal infrastructure creates conditions for corrupted officials to subj ectively and often incorrectly interpret articles of laws a nd other regulations. In context of unprecedentedly large num ber of regulations , uncertainty of precepts of law, and duplicated or controversial legal norms, the law enforcement subjects often lack correct idea of how specif ic norms should be applied and how they actua lly work which significantl y broadens conditions for corruption. Therefore, it is considered necessary to move to the stage of anticorruption laws interp retation and adjustment. Another existing serious pr oblem is that of access to official information and government documents. Kyrgyzstan has legal provisions on access to information which however are not implem ented in full due to insufficient law enforcement and public awareness of the ri ght to information. The analysis of existing legal basis and law enforcemen t practice allows making a conclusion that information availability is not only an important component of the struggle against corruption but also a fundam ental principle of functioning of anticorruption system includi ng government bodies activities. Another issue of concern is the la ck of professionals to implement anticorruption activities . Law enforcement bodi es employ established anticorruption methods without intr oducing new approaches to corruption exposure and elimination. Independent anticorruption expert analysis is underdeveloped, and law enforcement offi cers responsible for anticorruption program implementation have not ma stered methods of departmental anticorruption programs development and implementation. The issues of staff, technical and operating preparedness of law enforcement bodies responsible for the struggling against corrup tion remain unaddressed. According to Transp arency International, the Kyrgyz Republic held the 154th position among 174 countries in 2012 and is now in the high corruption level group. Priority areas of the country's an ticorruption policies for 2013-2017 will include the following: (i) strengthening of the anticorruption policy institutional 26 basis. This area suggests addressing the following objectives: (i) to establish an independent body for corruption preven tion and developmen t and coordination of the national anticorruption progra m implementation; (ii) to develop anticorruption legislation basis; (iii) to increase the efficiency of government bodies activities in reducing corruption risks and ensuring information openness of government bodies activities. To address to first objective, the Ky rgyz Republic government intends to implement the following measures: to de velop and approve a standard document regulating activities of the bo dy responsible for corruption prevention; (ii) to procure financial resources for the sai d government body activities; (iii) to develop and introduce a syst emic education mechanism for staff training and retraining; (v) to open anticorruption de partments within government bodies and include their officers in education system ; (vi) to develop uniform requirements for development and implementation of anticorruption pr ograms; (vii) to develop and introduce the system of moni toring and evaluation of anticorruption activities efficiency . The second objective will be addresse d through the foll owing measures: (i) inventory and review of regulations re lated to anticorruption activities with identification of missing norms and devi ations in national legislation; (ii) development of regulations oriented at the implementation of international anticorruption legal standards; (iii) de velopment and intro duction of procedures for existing and developed regulations anticorruption expert review; (iv) development and introductio n of the verification a nd validation system for anticorruption measures implemented by government bodies; (v) analysis and strengthening of corruption and bribery criminal liability provisions; (vi) normative consolidation of mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability of government bodies; (v ii) development of measures to join globally accepted inte rnational anticorrupti on conventions and the Anticorruption Group of Countries. The Kyrgyz Republic government intends to address the third objective as follows: (i) to develop measures for reduc ing operating costs associated with business registration and running; (ii) to review powers of government bodies exercising supervisory and licensing functi ons, as well as regu lations on their activities for availability of corruption conditions; (iii ) to develop and introduce mechanisms to exclude to maximum possible degree co ntacts of individuals and entities with government bodies in gove rnment services provision by making a part of such contacts el ectronic; (iv) normative co nsolidation of government bodies executives responsibility for en suring government bodies information openness; (v) to develop measures for introduction of a unified document circulation system that would allow ke eping record of and supervising the document enforcement to prevent corrupti on risks in processing of applications of individuals and organizations; (vi) to develop and in troduce formats and procedures of promotion and media coverage of the Kyrgyz Republic government anticorruption activities with the participation of concerned civil sector groups. 27 The second priority area in ach ieving the set goal will be the counteraction against corruption through the elimination of corruption risks.

Informal Economy Legalization The overall goal is to facilitate info rmal economy legalization with its reduction by up to 25% of GDP by 2017. Background. Informal economy is a chronic problem in Kyrgyzstan posing a real threat to the country's se curity, constituting a serious obstacle for small and medium-size busin ess development, and cr eating unequal conditions for competition. This negative phenomenon reduces the taxable base 29 contributing to the country's budgeting sphere destabilization. No appropriate measures have been implemented by ke y government bodies. Currently, the role of judicial system in reducing inform al economy is minima l. Where laws do not work and where business does not rely on power of law, it is more profitably for business to operate in info rmal sector with establishe d customs and mechanisms. According to recent studies, the in formal economy volume reached 53% in 2006 in Kyrgyzstan. In 2012, new studies were conducted which showed that the informal economy level was39 %6. Major reasons forcing business to \"m ove to the shadow\" were found out to include the following: (i) corruption; (ii) lack of political stability; (iii) high percentage of petty cash circulation; (iv) incompleteness of legal and institutional basis to c ounteract against informal economy; (v) administrative barriers in legal operati ons; (vi) complicated proc edures of tax reporting and business entities registration. The segment of entrepreneurs who do not pay taxes, conceal their revenues, do not buy licenses and unders tate taxes was studied. The study findings may be considered optimistic, and it would be reasonable to conduct extended and deeper research from the po int of view of all economy sectors in order to clarify the inform al economy level in 2013-2017. In global scale, the speci fic weight of informal economy is estimated as 5 to 10 % of GDP and the threshold is 40 to 50 %. The total of world informal economy (including criminal sector) is estimated as $9 trillion exceeding 40 % of the total GDP in coun tries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. In Kyrgyz Republic, this figure exceeds 100 billion soms. In general, the country undertakes sporad ic attempts to legalize informal economy. The institutional base has not been formed, there is a lack of a unified government policy regarding legal pressure instrument to ha ve economic entities coming out of \"the shadow\". Taking the above into account, the Ky rgyz Republic gove rnment intends to implement urgent measures as a part of this Program to eliminate conditions and causes of emergence of and to legalize informal economy. Priority areas for the achievement of th e set goal include the following: (i) facilitating the move of business entities out of informal sector; (ii) increasing the attractiveness of the gove rnment policy for business. The first priority area that is relate d to facilitating the move of business entities out of informal sector is orient ed at addressing the following objectives: (i) to modify laws as to fiscal administ ration; (ii) to create a simplified reporting system for small and medium business, first of all in tax authorities; (iii) to introduce the one-stop-shop principl e in the foreign trade sphere. To address the first objective, the Kyrgyz Republic govern ment intends as follows: (i) to review existing regulations and identify factors forcing economic entities to move to \"the sh adow\"; (ii) to use the revi ew findings for development 6 19.5% in 2011 according to National Statistics Committee data. 30 of proposals on modification of regulations related to fiscal administration and on abolishing some of them. The second objective will be addresse d through the foll owing measures: (i) to develop and introduce simplified taxation system for small and medium business; (ii) to identify and make deci sions for groups for which uniform tax is specified based on different criteria; (iii) to introduce computer-based tax reporting; (iv) to intro duce a computer-based tax in spection system for small and medium business. The third objective will be addresse d through the following measures: (i) to develop and adopt regulations on elect ronic disclosure in troduction; (ii) to establish normatively the maximum time am ount (up to 60 hours in 2013) for customs procedures with ac count of electronic disclosure introduction, reducing the amount yearly to the optimal level. The following objectives will be addres sed as a part of the second priority area that is related to raising the attrac tiveness of the state po licy for business: (i) to simplify business entity registration pr ocedures; (ii) to prevent corruption schemes and \"business patronage\" by hi gh level officials; (iii) to introduce institutions of joint regula tion and self-regulation; (i v) to raise the business community trust in government bodies. The Kyrgyz Republic government inte nds to address the first objective through the following activities: (i) to adopt regulations providing introduction of application-based (re)registration of bu siness entities; (ii) to set normatively exact deadline for business entity cl osure; (iii) to introduce legally administrative liability of government bodies for delays in business entity liquidation process; (iv) to adopt regul ations on introduction of one-stop-shop registration; (v) to bring administrative procedures in compliance with the one- stop-shop principle. The second objective will be addresse d through the foll owing measures: (i) to adopt a regulation abolishing license s for tobacco products import; (ii) to reduce the time of decision making by government body and se rvice provision; (iii) to unify ministerial and departme ntal information bases for launching a specialized portal in orde r to provide government se rvice in electronic format; (iv) to adopt a regulation abolishing exclusive right to collection, purchase and sale of ferrous and precious metal scrap and waste. The third objective will be addressed through the following objectives: (i) to modify regulations for upgrading of pe nalties of officials for providing an informal immunity to certain business entit ies; (ii) to unite ef forts of fiscal and law enforcement bodies in finding government structur es providing patronage to business entities and employing inform al schemes; (iii) to develop recommendations and make pol itical decisions based on findings of monitoring and evaluation of the Kyrgyz Repub lic government's 2012-2014 Anticorruption Plan implementation. The fourth objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to conduct analysis and evaluation as to validity of excessive and inefficient government regulation of economy sectors with the participation of business 31 community; (ii) to use the analysis fi ndings in developi ng ad adopting a regulation stipulating principles of participative economy regulation (business + government) in sectors with unreasonable and ineffici ent government regulation; (iii) to adopt regulations providing fo r passing specific economy sectors to business for self-regulation. The fifth objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to conduct an awareness campaign regardi ng outcomes of the Kyrgyz Republic government efforts to reduce informal economy; (ii) to create permanently active open platforms for development of informal economy legalization tools; (iii) to introduce a mandato ry norm for the involvement of business community representatives in the process of making decisions regarding mechanisms of informal economy legalization; (iv) to open feedback hotlines and websites for counteraction against informal ec onomy with key government bodies. III. PEOPLE UNITY AS A COND ITION FOR THE SAFEGUARDING OF STATEHOOD AND SUCC ESSFUL DEVELOPMENT 3.1. Ensuring Interethnic Harmony and Strengthening the People Unity The overall goal is to build a compre hensive conflict prevention system for the strengthening of stability a nd country's sustainable development. Background. Conflicts pose a real threat to and constitute a challenge for the Kyrgyz Republic's sustainable deve lopment. During the period 2008 through 2012, some 254 conflicts of socioeconomic nature7 were registered in Kyrgyzstan including more than 30 inte rethnic conflicts with 1,012 instances of violence. 17 current conflicts have been reported in the re ligious cooperation sphere including three directly associated with the threat of terrorism. Religious conflicts as a rule pose pot ential threat of their tran sformation into political and ideological confrontation. Analysis shows existence of three majo r types of conflicts in Kyrgyzstan which may at the same time be \"mixed\" and \"transform\" into another form: (i) conflicts caused by unequal or unfair access to resources (water, land, pastures, mineral deposits, etc.) including border c onflicts and conflicts with investors; (ii) identification conflicts: interethnic and interdenominational conflicts; (iii) conflicts caused by perceived discrimi nation or exclusion: local conflicts between communities and local governance bodies, between community groups and state power institutions, etc. Priority areas in conflict preventi on in the country will include the following: (i) development of an effect ive mechanism for conflict prevention both at national and local levels; (ii) reducing conflicts in interethnic relationships; (iii) broadeni ng the participation of conf lict vulnerable groups in administration and decision making processes. 7Conflict Management Agency Egalitee. 32 The following objectives will be addressed as a part of the first priority area: (i) institutionalizat ion of the conflict prev ention and peace building mechaniss; (ii) increasing the capacity of human resources engaged in conflict prevention. The following measures have been pl anned for the addressing of the first objective: (i) to form an effective system for early identification and prevention of social and other conflicts that ma y acquire ethnic nature at the newly established the Kyrgyz Republic Governme nt Agency for Local Governance and Interethnic Relations; (ii) to form Na tional Coordination Center for Conflict Prevention and Peace Buildi ng at the above said Agen cy; (iii) to develop and introduce coordination mechanism fo r cooperation between government and local governance bodies and civil societ y institutions; (iv) to introduce the practice of peace agreements in conflict communities; (v) to develop and introduce the conflict thr eats assessment methodology. The following measures have been planned to address the second objective that is related to increasing th e human resources capacity: (i) to audit competences of ministries, departments and local gove rnance bodies staff in order to identify conflict prevention and resolution functions; (ii) to develop qualification requirements for staff invol ved in addressing conflict prevention issues; (iii) to incorporat e conflict science issues in to qualification requirements for staff selection and professional devel opment; (iv) to develop and introduce staff professional development programs. The following objectives will be addres sed as a part of the second priority area: (i) to develop and implement the \"Language of Peace\" National Program; (ii) to employ capacities of cinematogr aphy, media, education and culture for promotion of initiatives of interethnic c onsolidation and relig ious tolerance. The following measures have been planned to address the first objective: (i) to develop and introduce a uniform language standard for translating regulations into the state la nguage; (ii) to develop and introduce the program of training, retraining and certification for th e state language translators; (iii) to develop and introduce a standardized system for the state language skills assessment for government and municipal employees; (iv) to teach government and municipal employees the state langua ge and national re cords management based on their language skills; (v) to deve lop and introduce effective curricula and manuals for intensive adult language teaching; (vi) to arrange short-term state language courses for government and municipal em ployees and law enforcement officers; (vii) to devel op and introduce effective curricula and manuals for intensive language te aching in remote and monoethnic communities; to develop and distribute bilingual and trilingual state language- based dictionaries and phrasebooks for government and municipal employees working in polyethnic communities; (ix) to arrange short-term state linguistics courses for government and municipal employees working in polyethnic communities for teaching them languages of ethnic minorities. The second objective will be addres sed based on the following measures: (i) to support prospective re search related to national cu lture development; (ii) to 33 propagate best samples of cu lture heritage of ethnic gr oups living in Kyrgyzstan; (iii) to arrange contests aimed at popula rization of best cultural heritage of Kyrgyzstan peoples; (iv) to introduce simultaneous translation of news and information national TV channels broadcas ting from the official into the state language and vice-versa; (v) to deve lop and disseminate methodological recommendations on editorial policy de velopment for ethnic aspects media coverage; (vi) to convert all government bodies' official websites based on bilingual and trilingual standards; (vii ) to compose a government contract for cultural products of theaters, cinematogra phy and other arts in order to promote community interethnic consolidation in itiatives; (viii) to reorganize regional libraries work with ethnic mi nority language literature. The third priority area will be impl emented by addressing the following two major objectives: (i) to develop and implement the Na tional Staff pilot program oriented at conflict vulnerable ethnic groups in economic and political life; (ii) to introduce the system of reco rd of vulnerable grou ps input in regional and nationwide economic a nd political development. The following specific measures have been planned to address the first objective: (i) to develop and adopt the National Staff program; (ii) to develop and introduce formats and pr ocedures for the involvem ent of vulnerable groups in economic and policy processes; (iii) to conduct awareness campaigns; (iv) to develop a plan of measures to encourag e entrepreneurship in vulnerable groups and ethnic minorities. The second objective will be addresse d through the foll owing measures: (i) to develop a methodology for recordi ng vulnerable groups input in economy with particular focus on input of wome n and ethnic minorities in regional and nationwide development; (ii) to develop a methodology to estimate economic losses caused by conflicts. IV. ADDRESSING SOCIAL OBJECTIVES AND ISSUES Addressing issues related to human development and poverty alleviation will be a key area of the country's sust ainable development policy. In this view, the poverty reduction policy will be closely linked to measures of ensuring economic growth and environment prot ection. As of 2012, 38 % of population live beyond the poverty line, and the poverty level has grown by 6.3 points since 2008, while the poverty depth has remain ed almost the same reaching 7.7 %. The largest part of poor population lives in rural areas. Thus, while 2,153 million people lived beyond the poverty line in 2012 in the country 66 % of them were rural citizens. Livelihood and income of poor families in rural areas substantially depend on na tural resources and envi ronment, therefore the population's living standards largel y depend on safe and productive environment. Poverty level in mountainous areas is more than in flat country (51 % against 37.4 % in 2012). 34 Child poverty is a matter of particul ar concern. Of the total number of children aged 0 to 17, 46 % lived in po verty context including 5.6 % in extreme poverty. The child poverty level in rura l areas has reached 47.6 % which is 8.9 % higher than in urban co mmunities. The percentage of children living in poor households exceeds the overall poverty le vel. This situation is explained by dependency rate that was higher in poor households and largely influenced by the number of children aged 0 to 17. T hus, while there are 1.9 children per non- poor household, this fi gure reaches 2.7 children in poor households. Poverty alleviation is directly lin ked to issues of population's living quality. One of urgent issues associat ed with living quality is that of qualitatively and quantitatively balanced nutrition. The an alysis of staple food consumption per capita in years 1990 th rough 2011 showed the fall in quality of nutrition. Thus, while meat and meat pr oducts monthly consumption was 3.5 kg per capita in 1990, this figure decr eased to 1.7 kg per month by 2012. Consumption of milk and m ilk products also significantly decreased from 20.1 kg per month in 1990 to 6.1 kg by 2012. Transition to sustainable developm ent suggests not only review of environmental factors influencing popula tion but human impact on environment as well. Insufficient accessibility of util ity services leads to intensification of negative human impact on envir onment at the mundane level. Taking into account the fact that the challenge of living quality improvement and poverty reduction re quires a comprehensive approach, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to implement the development policy aimed at reaching a balance between econom ic and social areas with account of environmental issues based on sustai nable development principles. 4.1. Labor Market and Employment The overall goal is to expand the range and improve the quality of employment services, as well as quality of workforce. Background. The country's economically active popul ation is 2.5 million people with 91.6 % employed. The num ber of unemployed has reached 210.4 thousand where 46.5 % are women. The overall unemployment rate is 8.4%. 68 % of economically active populati on are young people. The youth unemployment rate varies 8 % to 21 % in various age gr oups. The country's average monthly wage is $228,2 that is 3-4 times less than in Russia and Kazakhstan. 500 thousand people leave the country each year as labor migrants. According to informal expert estimates, the figure reaches one million. About 500 thousand Kyrgyzstan citizens left the country for permanent residence and became Russia nationals duri ng the independence period. The informal economy sector, with its worst working conditions, poor legal and social protection, low pr oductivity and limited opportunities for working skills development and training, is a serious challenge. Of the total number of employed, only 25 % or 571.6 people are employed in the formal sector while 76 % of economically active population are self-employed 35 including farmers and working migrants. Bu ilding of an integral institutionalized employment service system is incomple te. The five-year reform monitoring showed inconsistency of function division on domes tic and external labor markets. There is no agency responsib le for government re gulation of labor protection. This leads to growing number of workplaces with poor working conditions, injury and occupational rate increase, and aggravation of employment issues for certain groups such as youth, persons with disabilities (persons with disabiliti es), women, etc. Each country's district has employm ent services which directly provide services in the area of labor relationshi ps, unemployed regist ration and records, unemployment benefit payment services, professional training for unemployed, as well as services to applying for international employment. Employment services cooperate with their respectiv e community employers and update the vacancy bank that offers 50 to 70 thou sand jobs per year. Nevertheless, poor cross-region communication and lack of a country's unified vacancy and job seekers databank show inefficiency of centralized operating regulation. Jobs offered are usually underpaid holding the vacancy filling rate at 60 % in Bishkek and 80 % to 100 % in other regions. The Youth Employment Office in Bishkek (YEO) delivers monthly job fairs where 10 to 15 thousand young people are consulted in professional guidance a nd employment annually. Furthermore, YEO also provides temporary and single jobs to juveniles and students including those abandoned. Professional training for industries staff is provided through the basic vocational education and training system (VET) that includes 110 vocational schools in all regions. The VET system institutions train 30 to 32 thousand young people each year. Furthermore, the VET system also provides short-term training services to unemployed and t hose willing to have another specialty. Reforms and large scale international proj ects aimed at logistics and curricula modernization have not yet achieved VET system's flexible response to changing demand of workforce. Due to limited resources allocated to support employment, reduce unemployment and implement active measur es on the labor market, the service coverage is not more than 55 %. Thus, in 2012, activities (vocational education, paid public works, microcredits) cove red 30.8 thousand unemployed or 51 % of those officially registered as unemploye d and 21 % of those who applied to employment services. Employment services cooperate with microcredit organizations in offering n ew jobs through the system of preferential unsecured lending for unemployed. Thus, annually , 3.5 to 5 thousa nd unemployed people may receive preferential loan in amount of 15 to 30 thousand soms for 1 year with 10 % to 15 % interest rate. In 2012, 4,479 people had new jobs through microcredits facilitate by employment services. On av erage, 10 to 30 thousand soms per unemployed pe rson are provided for one year with 15 % interest rate. The International Employment Cent er has its own employers and job seekers databank and provides consulta tion and legal services, preliminary training, as well as training and testing services for potential working migrants 36 applying for organized employment. Th e center also monitors activities of private agencies. There are more than 20 private agencies in Bishkek providing international employment services to Kyrg yzstan citizens. On average, about 2 thousand people find jobs through govern ment and private employment agencies annually. Annual migrant outflow has b een varying from 30 to 50 thousand people the last five years. In 2012, the outflow of country's population decreased five times comparing to 2008 . Currently, personal contacts remain the main method of international employment witnessing limited resource s for mass information and education for migrants and their families. Legal protection services to Kyrgyzstan citizens staying abroad as working migrants ar e provided by the Ky rgyz Republic's consular departments which have no labor law experts and are unable to cope with the large number of applications due to heavy workload and provide information on labor market. The labor attach\u00e9 institute established in 2010 was then abolished as a part of reorganiza tion of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Labor, Employment and Migration. Thus, the state has to some degree lost the link with working migrants. This ar ea is actively operated by various associations and public unions establishe d in Kyrgyzstan citizens' communities abroad. During the period 2006 through 2010, Kyrgyzstan implemented its National Employment Policy 2010, however the labor market policy measures provided within the program were rather aimed at mitigation of social implications of employment issues. During the last two years, there was not any specific national employment policy prog ram in the country. The draft Kyrgyz Republic's Strategy for International La bor Migration Regulation for the Period up to 2020 has yet been discussed. The Kyrgyz Republic Labor Code has been many times modified for the last five years. As for the cross-sector level, there has not been any practice of making comprehensive, economically reconciled and coordinate d decisions in response to new developments and trends in labo r area. The country's labor market forms spontaneously and with no appropriate demand and offer assessment by regions and professions in demand. No analysis has been conducted with respect to influence of regulative measures (busin ess environment, trade and services) on labor market, income distri bution and social rights in unstable economy context. In development of investment projects , no detailed assessmen t is conducted with respect to number and quality of new jobs, employment stability, and local workforce professional development. The higher education system that has expanded with no account of economy demands, with prevailing en rollment to humanities and economic departments where no logistics base ar rangements are required have already been contributing to deficit of engineer ing and technical staff. Pursuing larger enrollment figures has led to educat ion quality loss, university degree devaluation, and potential staff outflow from the VET system. Almost every university graduates economists and managers, however there is no inflow of new generation professional managerial sta ff of medium and hi gher levels in all 37 spheres including public ad ministration. There is also a growing problem caused by lack of effective measures and ca pacities to prevent brain drain. Notwithstanding the salary increase, th e professional staff outflow cannot be stopped and the issue of weak inflow of qu alified staff to social sphere remains urgent. The available unemployment statistics th at does not show true significant scale of unemployment cannot facil itate unemployment classification by qualifications, duration etc. There are no suff icient data to investigate causes of growing inactivity among popul ation and study low-paid and substandard labor sector. The growing segment of populati on with low income verging on poverty should be assessed and so should be season and part-time employment and quick job change. Taking into account the above issues, the country's mid- term policy will be focused on the following priority areas: (i) gove rnment support to employment; (ii) governme nt support to Kyrgyzstan citizens employed at external labor markets; (iii) ensuring th e right to work of vulnerable groups: women, young people, PwDs. The following objectives should be addres sed as a part of the first priority area: (i) to develop legislation framework aimed at implementing sustainable development principles on labor market; ( ii) to facilitate employment rates increase among employable population; (iii) to arrange training for unemployed based on labor market demand; (iv) to ensure staff training based on domestic and regional labor market demand. The Kyrgyz Republic government inte nds to address the first objective through the following steps: (i) to de velop a long-term national program \"The Kyrgyz Republic Employment Policy 2020\" ; (ii) to develop and introduce the map of forecasting economy's demand of workforce by specialties and country's regions; (iii) to develop the new versi on of draft Kyrgyz Republic law on employment and other regulations oriented at increasing the employment efficiency (coverage of all employment ar eas, participation forms, responsibility of all involved entities for addressi ng employment issues); (iv) to adopt regulations providing mechanisms for cooperation of government and private sector on labor market; (v) to deve lop quality-oriented social services standards/passports (13 standards); (vi) to develop and introduce methods for ensuring accounting of all indicators, with sufficient detail in all labor market segments and focus on informal sector. The second objective that is relate d to facilitating the increase of employment among employable population will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop and im plement project of paid public works at the country's social f acilities; (ii) to develop pr ojects for employment of unemployed from among wome n and young people trai ned in handicraft in remote, mountainous and border communiti es; (iii) to arrange activities of mobile employment services for career guidance, registration and employment consultation; (iv) to organize at least 15 job fairs per year aimed at employment of unemployed persons, youn g people, women and PwDs; (v) to develop and 38 distribute among employment services materi als on consultations in microcredit business plan preparation; (vi) to arrang e for regular local labor market surveys through employment services in orde r to study the demand of qualified workforce. The third objective that is to trai n unemployed based on labor market demand will be addressed th rough the following measu res: (i) to introduce simplified curricula for training un employed women and young people in remote, mountainous and border commun ities on handicrafts, marketing and running business; (ii) to introduce simplified curricu la for unemployed persons training based on local labor markets de mand; (iii) to develop and introduce a short-term familiarization course for une mployed on professions for sustainable development in agriculture, small-sc ale energy generation, ecotourism). As a part of addressing the fourth obj ective that is to provide qualified competitive staff based on domestic an d regional labor markets demand, the following measures will be implemented: (i) to conduct regu lar assessment of needs of domestic and re gional labor markers based on government and private sector partnership in order to adjust vocational educatio n and training; (ii) to develop and introduce mechanisms of curricula/training module adjustment based on employers' large orders; (iii) to develop and intr oduce new curricula on professions in demand in the sustainable development context (agricultural production, new type power generation, ecologically safe product processing, ecotourism, etc.); (iv) to teach the faculty new teaching methods and disseminate positive experience of successful training institutions; (v) to develop and disseminate teaching and training manuals on new education standards application. To address the second priority area or iented at government support to the Kyrgyz Republic citizens employed at external labor markets, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to address th e challenge of extending the capacity for standardizing procedures of intern ational employment through the organized recruitment introduction. The following activities will be implemented within this priority area: (i) to study the im pact of joining the Customs Union (CU hereinafter) on labor market and the agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic and CU countries on organized recruitmen t, social insurance and labor migrant protection; (ii) to develop draft laws regulating working migrants insurance and establish a foundation to support them; (iii) to develop, in c ooperation with the Kyrgyz Republic Social Fu nd, mechanisms and forms of pension and social provision for the Kyrgyz Re public citizens engaged in temporary labor activities abroad; (iv) to initiate the agreemen t on establishing training centers in the Kyrgyz Republic for training and prof essional development in cooperation with host countries; (v) to introd uce the system of mutual recognition of (profession) diplomas/certificates thr ough initiatives within bilatera l interstate agreements. As a part of the third priori ty area that is to ensure the right to work for vulnerable groups such as young pe ople, women and PwDs, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends as follows: (i) to develop and introduce, in cooperation with the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Social Development, 39 curricula for persons with disabilities short-term training for their further employment; (ii) to develop targeted regional employment programs/pilot projects for women, young people and PwDs ; (iii) to conduct a survey in order to identify issues faced by working ch ildren; (iv) to develop and introduce mechanisms for supervision of enforcem ent of laws concerning the liability for children labor use and expl oitation; (v) to develop a project of training, employment and leisure arrangement for street children aged 14 to 18 in Bishkek and duplicate practices of successful basic education curricula application for working children. 4.2. Education and Science for Sustainable Development The main goal of the education system development is to support, through efficient use of internal and external resources, individual's personal and professional competence and provision of the state with staff needed for country's sustainabl e development. One of the most important goals for science is reorientation of fundamental and applied studies at agenda urgent for Kyrgyzstan's sustainable development and forming a model of Kyrgyzstan transition to sustainable development. Background. Development of policies, administration in the education sphere and government supervision of its accessibility are the responsibilities of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Educat ion and Science (MoES) that works directly with more than 3 thousand e ducation organizations, kindergartens to universities. However, administration of basic professional education is a function of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministr y of youth, labor a nd employment, and isolation of administrative structures impedes development and implementation of an integral education policy. E ducation organizations management and control processes are implemented thro ugh district and m unicipal education departments which are also responsible for methodologi cal support to teachers. Universities and vocational education ins titutions are controlled directly by MoES, without any intermediary struct ures. Education institutions are the immediate agencies providing services to citizens. Education services provision functions are also performed by local governance bodies responsible for the provision of preschool, school and prof essional education in accordance with government education standards and prov ision of buildings and other facilities for providing services at the said education levels. The Kyrgyzstan's education system h as a developed infrastructure, trained teaching staff (more than 80 % with university degree), and significant education and training traditions. However , all education levels are facing a number of issues: only 15 % percent of children enjoy support of preschool education institutions. With insufficie nt attention to children's early development, it impedes their socializatio n and further progr ess in schooling and life. The key issues of the school leve l include those related to education accessibility and quality. Schools loca tion and infrastructure (although in 40 sufficient total number) do not meet in full population n eeds. According to surveys of international organizati ons, the number of school age children permanently or temporar ily missing school has reached approximately 50 thousand. At the same time, accordi ng to the Kyrgyz Republic General Prosecutor Office, 3,981 children did not at tend school in 2011. Lack of relevant statistics impedes provision of targeted education services to children. The existing education system is poorly adjusted to needs of students with disabilities and from poor families. As a r esult there is a risk of exclusion from education system for a significant part of Kyrgyzstan's young citizens which may further lead to degr ading quality of the country's human resources. Children with special needs may receive education services in inclusive or specialized schools and children left wi thout parental care stay in boarding schools. Transition from education to employm ent represents a process facing difficulties due to lack of developed career guidance system and underdeveloped labor market on the one hand, and grad uate's insufficient competence on the other hand. Basic, secondary and high prof essional education ra ises chances for employment. Thus, according to EFO su rvey conducted in 2012, 63.4 % of secondary and higher education instituti ons graduates and 26.9 % of persons with basic education were employed, an d 12.4 % and 16.7 % respectively were unemployed. However, gra duates of basic and secondary professional education institutions find job more quickly than university graduate s. Adult training and/or retraining and professional devel opment are provided both in formal (evening/shift/extramural schools) and in formal (courses, training centers, etc.) sectors. To improve the quality of fi nancing system management, conditions were created for transition to wide-sector approach suggesting direct budget support by donors. Allocated funding will come to the country as a part of Kyrgyzstan's fulfillment of general and special te rms and conditions agreed upon with partners. Roughly, more than 50 million euros will be attracted to country's education system within the next five years under favorable conditions. Education aspects are regulated by the Kyrgyz Republic Constitution, laws on education, on teacher status an d on preschool education, as well as by strategic paper (the Kyr gyz Republic Education Dev elopment Strategy 2012- 2020 (EDS 2020), EDS 2020 Im plementation Action Plan 2012-2014, etc.), etc. Education issues for sustainable development are covered by the key education system documents such as EDS 2020, Framewor k National Standard (curriculum)8, the Kyrgyz Republic Envir onmental Security Concept9, Education Concept for Sustainable Deve lopment, etc. Kyrgyzstan has also joined to the global process of the UN European Commissions for Europe's Strategy of Education for Sustainabl e Development and the UN Global Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. Although quite complete in general, 8Adopted at the college of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Education and Science in 2009. 9Adopted in 2007. 41 the legislation base weakly regulates coop eration between edu cation authorities, education institutions and local gover nance bodies, as well as inclusive education and other aspects. There is no an integral system of education regulatory institutions: supervision functions are included in co mpetence of education authorities which still substitute supervision functions by administrative inspections. In 2013, the establishment of Finance and Quality C ontrol Centers will begin with local education departments which will allow st rengthening the supervision functions at the school education level. MoES has supervision functions at the secondary education level, and the internal and external quality control system (certification) exists in higher educa tion. The accreditation system will be launched in 2013. The education system employs 75,502 teachers, more than 5 thousand secondary vocational educat ion teachers (VET teachers ), and 12 thousand of university faculty staff. The quality comp osition of school te acher staff remain at a high level from formal point of view with 80 % of teachers having university degrees, however only 62 % of teachers passed a pilot test and the rest proved insufficiently competent in their subjects. No research has been conducted as to the quality of teaching sk ills. VET and university staff is often not quite aware of their areas up-to-date scientific and applied designs which impedes quality student training. Therefor e, changes are need ed in training of teachers, as well as in professional deve lopment system in order to diversify provided services and better meet teachers' needs through the introduction of professional development voucher. The pr ofessional development system should also be restored for VET te achers and university staff. Information availability. Information of the education system is available to users through the MoES website that has been active since 2010, as well as through websites of the Kyrgyz Repub lic Ministry of La bor, Migration and Youth and a number of education instituti ons, annual publications of the MoES reporting college, Kut Bilim trade news paper, etc. However, an integral information policy in education sphere ha s not formed yet and to be developed in 2013. Lately, MoES has been contin uously monitoring and evaluating the strategic documents implem entation to inform the policy decision making process. However, no system monitoring has been conducte d as to the quality of the education system services quality. As a result, data of the Kyrgyz Republic National Statistics Committee, NGOs and in ternational organizations working in the education system are used. However, due to di fferent data collection methodologies, there is a significant gap in quantitative and, therefore, qualitative evaluation of various issues, such as drop-out rate. Lack or poor representativeness of information impedes decision making process. Science. Ministry of Education an d Science implemen ts science policy aimed at strengthening the research a nd technical capacity and increasing the science and engineering inpu t in addressing socioeconom ic issues faced by the Kyrgyz Republic. However, there is no uni fied system for science management 42 that is distributed between the three in stitutions: MoES, the Kyrgyz Republic National Academy of Scie nces, and Kyrgyzpatent. In legislation regard, the science deve lopment is regulated by the Kyrgyz Republic laws \"On Science and Fundam entals of the State Science and Technology Policy\", \"On Scientific and Technical Information System\", etc. However, these laws mostly focus on institutional issues of science and provide no clear steps aimed at supporting innovati ons, new research or ganization forms, etc. The personnel issues faced by science ar e, to significant degree, related to economic problems including outdated la b equipment and its unsuitability for up-to-date research, degradi ng prestige of research acti vities, weak system for search and selection of gifted young expe rts for research ac tivities, and, as a result, research staff aging and weak ening of existing scientific schools. Other recent issues include difficulties faced by young research workers following their internship or training in foreign universities and other training and research institutions and other exis ting research facilities. Such problems force gifted young people to leave the country or change the activity area. At the same time, Kyrgyzstan's unive rsities graduates do not always have competence needed for research work du e to weak science development in the Kyrgyz Republic's universiti es and insufficient faculty's qualification where only 5 % of all faculty have doctor's degree and 23 % of teachers have the \"kandidat\" nauk degree. Due to weak scientific information base, insufficient contacts with foreign scholars, lack of references to Kyrgyzstan 's scientists in in ternational citation index, Kyrgyzstan science ha s found itself in the shell of its narrow local issues. All that impedes familiarization with and introduction of new research methodologies and leaves the country br oken away from up-to-date designs in areas important fo r development. In the view of the necessity to reorie nt science at suppo rting innovations aimed at sustainable development, f undamental and applied studies should be reoriented at agenda urgent for Kyr gyzstan's sustainable development. The goal will be achieved through the following priority areas implementation: (i) increasing the efficiency of governme nt regulation of the education sphere development; (ii) providing quality and accessible education in accordance with individual age-related needs; (iii) reorienting the science sphere, including that in universities, at working with specific client s oriented at the country's sustainable development promotion.

Health The overall goal is to improve the quality of health services aimed at reducing prevalence of diseases includi ng those associated with environmental factors influence. Background. In 2008-2012, the hea lth achievements were below the expected level. The health services qu ality was affected by political instability and frequent change of government that impeded consistent reform implementation. Population health was also impacted by insufficient attention to prevention, overall socioeconomic situat ion in the country, and poverty growth. Other problems included high staff outflow from the Ky rgyz Republic Ministry of Health system to other organizations and decreasing attractiveness of public service for qualified speciali sts due to low stimuli and lack of motivation. The issue of medical staff outflow and uneven distribution conditioned by their high concentration in town and deficit in rural areas affected the accessibility and quality of medical assistance, particularly for vulnerable groups in remote rural comm unities. Furthermore, the specialist training system fails to meet health pr actice needs and up-to -date international standards. The country has bases of informati on and communication infrastructure for medicine needs, and up-to-date in formation and communication technologies are growingly applied in th e health sector. At the same time, the establishment of Unified Health Information System (UHIS) has not been completed. 48 Sufficient funding is a necessar y condition for ensuring maximum coverage by cost effective health servic es. One of the important achievements in the health system development has been the consistent yearly growth of the health share in the overall national ex penditure from 10 % to 13 % within the period 2006 through 2011. Particularly, as a result of funding increase, the co- payment practice was abolished for de livery services and those for children under 5 and elderly. Moreover, in or der to improve ec onomic and physical accessibility of medication at the prim ary level, the supplementary medical insurance program for medicine support fo r persons insured at outpatient level was implemented throughout the count ry. However, the re maining problems include inefficiency and irrationality in resource use. The sh are of expenditures for salaries and infrastructure funding is more than 80 % of national budget funds allocated for health. Direct expe nses for patients have reached 20-25% (medicine, catering). At th e same time, amounts informally paid to medical staff continue growing. The country has improved its infant a nd child mortality rates and retained their further decrease trends. Thus, the in fant mortality rate decreased 27.1 to 21.1 cases per 1,000 live births with in the period 2008 th rough 2011, and the child mortality rate from 31.5 to 24.5 cases per 1,000 live births within the same period. The country has a well establishe d immunization system with timely child immunization against all major vaccine administered diseases. With the overall primary health care coverage, the degree to which maternity and child health care services are used remains high. All pregnant women have the right to free of char ge antenatal care services and 95 % of deliveries are administered at medical in stitutions. However, maternal mortality rate remains high and shows unstable dynamics. Thus, while maternal mortality rate decreased in general from 58.9 to 47.5 cases pe r 100,000 live births during the period 2008 through 2011, th e rate dramatically in creased to 75.3 cases per 100,000 live births in 2009. A large part of high expenses associ ated with chronic disease treatment may be avoided thro ugh health and wellbeing strengt hening measures, as well as effective preventive activities in health and other sectors. Such measures include those aimed at restricting risky behavior patterns, health improvement, physical activities, and reducing harmful environmental factors impact. The infectious and parasitic disease pr evalence remains a major factor of current sanitary and epidemic situation sustainability in the country which is largely conditioned by restricted access of a part of population to safe drinking water sources and incompliance with sa nitary standards. Acute intestinal diseases prevalence remains high, particul arly among rural chil dren in southern Kyrgyzstan. Such a situation occurred as a result of water supply systems degradation and poor efficien cy and unsatisfactory quality of drinking water in water supply sources used by people fo r domestic and recreational needs and drinking. As a result, the drinking water accessibility rate in the country was 87.8 % as of the beginning of 2013 including 70.8 % in rural communities. According to territorial disease prevention and expertise centers, 206 water 49 pipelines (19.1 %) fail to meet sanita ry standards require ments and have no sufficient sanitary control areas, water purification facilities and decontaminating equipment. No sufficient attention ha s been paid in the country in recent years to food safety control services, while more th an 70 % of harmful substances may be taken by the human body with food. Rates of and expend itures associated with food poisoning treatment will probably in crease as the enviro nment temperature rises unless the situation with compli ance with food safety requirements improves. Based on the goal set fo r the period 2013-2017, the government policy in health sector will be aimed at addres sing objectives within th e following priority areas: (i) strengthening the health care system capacity aimed at provision of quality medical services to people; (ii) facilitating protection and improvem ent of health of population and each single person. As a part of the priority area rela ted to strengthening the health care system capacity aimed at provision of quality medical services to people, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to address the foll owing objectives: (i) to improve access of vulnerable groups to specialized medical assistance; (ii) to ensure rational and efficient us e of financial resources allocated for preferential medication s upport to vulnerable groups; (iii) to guarantee free of charge basic health care services to socially vulnerable groups; (iv) to implement government-private partnership mechanisms; (v) to improve the quality of medical and pharmaceutical education for staff capacity improvement; (vi) to introduce unified and standardi zed medical information systems in health care practice. The following measures have been planned to address the first objective: (i) to optimize the organizationa l structure and budget spending of specialized organizations ( oncology, hematology, psychiatry) transferred to the single payer system; (ii) to integrate gradually specialized organizations into the single payer system; (iii) to develop funding standards for types of provided specialized health care services. The following measures have been planned to address the second objective: (i) to revise and approve the amount to be reimbursed to patients for medicine served against pr escriptions of the supplementary mandatory medical insurance program for so cially vulnerable groups; (ii) to increase public awareness with re spect to benefits and warranties within approved nationa l health programs. 50 The third objective that is related to guarantees of free of charge basic health care services to socially vulnerabl e groups will be a ddressed through the development of the basic medical insura nce system that su ggests the following measures: (i) to adopt regulations on proce dures of the basic national medical insurance development; (ii) to revise and introduce minimu m standards for budget funding based on designed minimum health care standards; (iii) to develop annual programs of national guarantees for providing the Kyrgyz Republic citizens with medical and sanitar y assistance based on the basic national medical insu rance terms and conditions. The fourth objective that is relate d to implementing government-private partnership mechanisms in health care suggests development and implementation of pilot projects based on government-private partnership aimed at ensuring real input to the improveme nt of quality of health care services and efficiency of health care resources use. The fifth objective that is related to the prevention of staff outflow and improvement of medical and pharmaceutical education quality will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop and introduce new na tional education standards for university and postgra duate levels, new work plan s, curricula and teaching materials designed for competence development; (ii) to develop legal and economic mechanisms to claim refund of amounts invested by government in graduate's studying if such graduate refuses to work within comp ulsory internship; (iii) to reinforce the Kyrgyz Repub lic government decree on measures for additional promotion for physicians employed by health care organizations in remote communities, small towns a nd villages of the Kyrgyz Republic; (iv) to introduce the medical staff regi ster to include all staff with university degree or seconda ry special education in medicine, regardless of medical institution status. The sixth objective that is related to the intr oduction of unified and standardized medical information syst ems in practical health care will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop strategies for IT deve lopment in health care sector; (ii) to develop and introduce a unified standards system and provide that with information systems and resources; (iii) to develop and introduce databa ses (registers for a range of nosologies) in order to design a personified recording system; (iv) to develop and intro duce secured multiservice departmental/corporate health care network with key user access. As a part of the second priority area consisting in facilitating protection and improvement of health of populatio n and each single person, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to address a number of obj ectives both for specific categories and entire population. To achieve MDG 4, reduce infant and child 51 mortality and morbidity rates, efforts s hould be continued to improve the quality of health care services for children an d ensure prevalence prevention among them. The following measure will be implemented to address the objective: (i) to implement immunization ca mpaigns among children under 2 according to the National Vaccination Calendar; (ii) to develop, revise and introduce clinical guidelines/protocols on child diseases treatment; (iii) to improve public awareness of ch ild health care issues through the involvement of civil society and medi a, development and dissemination of information and education materials, and tr aining of health care workers in rural communities; (iv) to provide for micronutrient f ood enrichment with \"Gulazyk\" mixture; (v) to arrange training ses sions for health care workers on the standard recommended preventive service p ackage for children under 5; (vi) to purchase reanimobiles for ob last maternity departments; (vii) to develop and introduce a mech anism to consult parents on important preventive meas ures and alarming sympto ms of child diseases. Efforts for the achievement of MDG 5 (maternity protection improvement) will be focused on addr essing the following objectives: (i) to improve quality of servi ces provided by health care organizations; (ii) to raise the awareness of women and their family members with respect to safe maternity and family planning issues. The first objective will be addre ssed through the following measures: (i) to develop, revise and introdu ce guidelines/clinical protocols; (ii) to arrange training sessions for obstetrical institutions staff on efficient perinatal services; (iii) to revise the registration mechanis m in order to provide access to medical services to migrant women; (iv) to improve equipment of maternit y hospitals in Bishkek, Bishkek City Perinatal Center and Os h City Perinatal Center; (v) to raise the awareness of women and their family members with respect to issues such as anemia, mother nutrition, alarming symptoms in pregnancy, necessity of tim ely requesting guaranteed health care service from the health system instituti ons through the involvement of civil society, media, development and diss emination of information a nd awareness materials, and training of village health committees a nd health improvement centers staff. In order to achieve MDG 6, the Ky rgyz Republic govern ment intends to improve the quality of medical services provided at vari ous levels of health care system in preventing HIV and TB. More over, another priority area is the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop, revise and introduce evidence-based medicine clinical protocols and guidelines in health care practice; 52 (ii) to revise and approve the list of illustrated warning messages on tobacco harm to health to be placed on cigarette and other tobacco products packs; (iii) to train health care workers on appropriate identification, registration and management an d emergency medical aid; (iv) to purchase medical equipment for oblast cardiology departments; (v) to ensure early identification of persons with TB through medical examination of all those seeking medical assistance, in acco rdance with the TB diagnostics algorithm; (vi) introduction of up-to-date express lab TB diagnostics methods at all medical assistance levels; (vii) to develop and introduce the mech anism of cooperation between the TB service and public health care a nd primary health care service concerning TB prevention activities; (viii) to provide the 1st and 2nd line primary health care institutions with TB drugs; (ix) to build the National Referenc e Laboratory for better TB diagnostics; (x) to consult key groups and re fer them to HIV test; (xi) to ensure ART coverage for HIV-positive women; (xii) to train health care workers in or der to improve th e quality of HIV patients treatment and care, HIV consu ltations and medical procedures safety. The following measures have been plan ned to strengthen the public health care system: (i) to improve the efficiency of activities of public health care system oriented at people's needs; (ii) to tighten the government contro l of power supply facilities and arrange for enforcement of the Kyrgyz Republic Law \"Drinking Water Safety Technical Regulation\"; (iii) to reduce the prevalence of dise ases associated with food safety. Addressing the objective of improving the efficiency of activities of public health care system oriented at people's needs sugg ests the following measures: (i) to develop regulations ensuring effective operation of the public health care service; (ii) to involve local communities in addressing issues of health protection and improvement through th e establishment of village health committees and implementation of the Community Action for Health Program in six districts of Jalal-Abad oblast; (iii) to provide for flour enrichment with vitamin and mineral premix and salt iodization; (iv) to develop regulation on laboratory accreditation; (v) to purchase consumables (test syst ems, reagents including those for GMO) for laboratories; 53 (vi) to extend the range of research with regard to envi ronmental factors influencing people through the introduc tion of the HELI methodology (health and environment linkage); (vii) to develop and introduce the register of potentially toxic substances imported to the Kyrgyz Republic. The following steps are required to tighten the government control of power supply facilities an d arrange for enforcement of the Kyrgyz Republic Law \"Drinking Water Safety Technical Regulation\": (i) to extend the range of research with respect to drinking water safety indicators; (ii) to develop and approve targeted indicators for water and health issues; (iii) to develop and introduce integrated system of government control of diseases associated with water safety; (iv) to develop and approve the progr am on water quality impact on health based on the water and health issues protocol; (v) to implement public awareness ca mpaigns on prevention of diseases associated with water. The following measures have been planned to address the objective of reducing the prevalence of disease s associated with food safety: (i) to develop regulations ensuring control of f ood safety in order to monitor biological, chemical and physi cal harmful factors associated with nutrition; (ii) to develop public awareness and education materials on the home use of food products; (iii) to develop recommendations to modify regulations with respect to extending the list of imported and dom estically produced goods/products; (iv) to develop and approve regulation on manda tory sanitary and epidemiologic expert examination for compliance with food safety requirements. 4.4. Improvement of Efficiency of So cial Protection and Pension System The overall goal is to provide quali ty services and guarantee equal opportunities to citizens as a result of establishment of a sustainable government social protection system. Background. The Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Social Development employs about 1.5 thousand people including 70 % in local divi sions. During the last few years, the ministry implemente d various structural reforms contributing to the human resource capacity instability. Currently, ther e is a serious challenge of establishing a modern social protec tion system including system of staff professional development and retraining, introduction of performance indicators, and material incentives and motivation for workers. 54 Another important element of the soci al protection functions fulfillment is the achievement of maximum informati on coverage. This goal will require a comprehensive information strategy aimed at gradual changes in public attitude towards the outcomes of activities of soci al work entities, necessity of social worker's new professional functions, and establishment of the social protection institution. The effectiveness of social protec tion activities also depends on the availability of efficient information syst em. Such issues as insufficient funding and lack of developed skills and know ledge of information system operation affect the IT system operability and de velopment within the social protection system. As for pension payment, unlike social support providing budgeted benefits to persons in n eed, major funding sources for social protection include insurance fees deducted fro m all incomes. To implemen t such norms, insurer is required to provide high quality relia ble information on each single insured person. Further developmen t of the pension service provision system requires addressing such challenges as simplifying contacts between pensioners and government bodies and reducing the numbe r of corruption facts through the introduction methods of interaction between citizen s and government bodies of all levels without personal contact. To address such challenges, transition is needed from the printed social protecti on certificate to the Kyrgyz Republic citizen's uniform electronic social card. In 2011, the number of ch ildren under 16 living in poverty reached 13.2 % of the country's total population. One of the social protection instruments designed for reducing the gap in incomes of poorest families with children to the minimum living wage level is the monthl y benefit for low-income families with children. Currently, this benefit is pr ovided for more than 340,000 children. Notwithstanding annual increase of the benefit amount (min imum wage was raised to 580 soms in November 2012), th e benefit growth rate remains low only covering the inflation rate, with the benefit amount reaching 16 % of child's minimum living wage and 43.3 % of extreme poverty line. The number of families unable to provide appropriate child care increases each year. The social orphanhood phe nomenon has appeared where child is considered an orphan event with his parent alive. A significant number of children enter the unqualified workforce market or join street and abandoned children. According to the first national children labor survey in Kyrgyzstan (2007), of 672 thousand workin g children 592 thousand were employed at works unacceptable for their age and developm ent level. 57.9 % of working children were boys. The vast majority of ch ildren are employed as unpaid family workers. They are mostly engaged in domestic production (76.4 %) including agricultural works. Currently, about 11 thousand childre n are placed in 117 government, municipal and private residential instituti ons, where 80 % of su ch children have one or both parents. Due to significa nt economic problems, the country has 55 restricted family support social services. Family substitution services such foster families are almost absent. Nervous diseases, inherited abnormalitie s and mental disorders have been leading in the structure of disability ca uses among children in recent years. Currently, the overall disability level in the country is about 2.6 % of total population. Until recent times, the medical disability model was dominating considering disability a pur ely medical issue only attri buted to individual and requiring medical interven tions. The country is planning to introduce the biopsychosocial disability model that extends the disa bility concept and allows studying impact of medical, individual, social and enviro nmental factors on person's functionality and disability. Ho wever, it should be noted that the existing social protection system fails to ensure full coverage and record of all PwDs. Restricted access to infrastructur e is a serious obstacle to PwDs integration in community. As of 2012, ramps and special devices were only installed in 172 government and municipa l bodies and health care and education organizations in Bishkek. Repairs of buildings and shops were made in 25 VET schools in all regions taking into cons ideration students with disabilities. Nevertheless, violations of standards and rules of provision of conditions for PwDs were found in 17 desi gn organizations in 2012. Over 8 thousand single elderly pers ons receive social services at home free of charge. The social service or ganizations system also includes government residential social institutions such as nursing homes for the elderly and PwDs. There are 15 residential social institutions in the country including 6 for the elderly and PwDs that provid e full government support to about 900 elderly citizens. Furthermore, underdev eloped social services provided locally and local budget deficit lead to lower accountability of local state administrations and local governance bodies for the service development within their communities. As for the pension provision, the c ountry has not had any pension debts since 2003. Pensions are paid for current month in monetary form only. Pension has been increased significantly in the last five years: the average pension amount was 1,426 soms in 2008 and reach ed 4,208 soms by the end of 2012, with average pension ratio to pensione r minimum living wage raising from 45.5 % to 110 %. The average monthly pens ion amount has first reached the pensioner's minimum living wage in 2011. The mechanism of PAYG component in crease within the context of the pay-as-you-go pension system allows a ddressing issues of not only the PAYG concept support but also of reducing the number of pensione rs with pensions below the minimum living wage. While there were 452.9 thousand pensioners with pension below the minimum livin g wage in 2009 (86.6 % of the total number), their number decreased to 344 t housand (62.2 % of the total number) by the end of 2012. 56 The pension reform that started in January 2010 allowed introducing the funded pension component in the Kyrgyz Republic's pension system without rejecting the PAYG component. The insurance fee rate was decreased by 2 % for employers. The age qualification was introduced for the funded pension component: persons of pens ion and pre-retirement age are not involved in the funded pension accumulation process. Issues of prevention and social rehab ilitation for homeless people remain among the most serious an d sensitive social problems of the society. Other problems include insufficient work with social protection of the homeless, lack of legislation initiatives regulating social protection of the homeless, lack of research and record of risk groups by re gions; lack of free government social services of prevention and rehabilitation for risk groups at the local governance bodies level, lack of coordination an d cooperation between the state, local governance bodies and non-profit organizations. Based on the set goal, the government social protection policy 2017 will be focused on the follow ing priority areas: (i) ensuring government guarantees in th e area of social protection for the most vulnerable groups; (ii) developing the capacity of social protection and pension system for providing quality services to citizens.

Increasing the Cultural Capacity The overall goal is to facilitate the improvement of the quality of living, spiritual growth, and creation of count ry's positive image based on culture environment development. Background. Currently, Kyrgyzstan is integrating into the culture space. International relationships has been given new qualities, with bilateral agreements on cooperation in culture and arts spheres signed with many countries. Positive outcomes of the impl emented national culture policy include preservation of the country's network of cultural institutions and prevention of cultural facilities privatization. The country has 20 professional theaters, 3 philharmonics, 1,055 libraries, 700 fixe d club institutions, 72 children music schools, 3 schools of paining, 11 schools of art, 58 museums, 7 recreation parks, 2 higher education institutions a nd 8 secondary special schools. However, almost completely cessati on of museums and libraries funding resulted in extremely difficult situati on in main areas of their activities, particularly in stocking, security and user access. None of the country's museums has a restoration lab and appropri ate staff. Deficit of professional arts experts and museum specialists leads to lack of research, and the forms of collection management are outdated. Th e State Historical Museum has no 62 permanent exposition. Only 10 of 58 museums occupy specially designed buildings. Worn-out and ob solete books comprise more than 60 % of library stock. The specialized children education syst em that was devel oped in years has been collapsing. Most of schools of mu sic, paining and arts operate in non- suited premises that fail to meet sta ndard requirements. Schools are lacking classrooms. One the most serious cha llenges is provision of children music schools with instruments, printed musi c, guidebooks, manua ls and up-to-date teaching methodologies. The country has 583 registered monume nts of national significance, and the UNESCO World Heritage List includes one of them, the sacred mountain of Sulaiman-Too. Files of three monument s in Chui valley were accepted in 2013 for consideration within the Silk Road transnational world heritage nomination, in cooperation with Kazakhstan and China. Nevertheless, the vast majority of monuments has been ruined dramatically and not included in modern culture processes. Major reasons fo r such a situation include lack of appropriate monitoring system, long intervals (15-20 years) in monument restoration and preservation, absence of secured ar eas around such monuments and legal execution of monument protection with security contracts. Unstructured development of surrounding areas leads to the loss of monuments' integrity and authenticity including those of natural landscapes. In recent years, the Kyrgyz Republic passed the Law on Manas Epic and National Program for Manas Epic Preserva tion, Research and Popularization for the Period 2012-2017 (the Kyrgyz Republic governm ent decree No. 67 of January 31, 2012). Amendments were ma de concerning terms of activities and responsibility to the Kyrgyz Republic laws on museums and museum stock, on historical and cultural heritage protectio n and use, and on library management. The process of regulation framework adjustment to new cultural context has not been completed. Law enforc ement mechanisms have not been developed. No cooperation has been es tablished with local authorities, communities and private structures. The Kyrgyz Republic Program for Culture and Arts Development in Rural Communi ties up to 2010 (approved by the Kyrgyz Republic government decree No. 4 of January 11, 2005) has not reached its ultimate goal nor has it had any s ubstantial impact of culture sphere development. Notwithstanding the country's divers ifying cultural life, the state of culture sphere can hardly satisfy its actors and overall community. No government purchase is practiced for dram a, music and artistic works, which leads to poorly updated repertoire of theatres and philharmonics. Funding is only provided to theaters within secured budget lines. Almost no funds are allocated for repertoire a nd inventory stock update. Furthermore, there is a deficit of advanced managers in theaters and other culture institutions. Staffing and professional development in culture sphere remain a serious challenge, particularly in rural communi ties. Professional sp ecialists has little authority throughout the country, pa rticularly in its regions and rural 63 communities. The culture sphere almo st has no staff with planning and programming skills and trained on basics of marketing and fundraising methods. No analysis has been conducted with respect to staffing issues. Mechanisms of attracting sp ecialists have not been de veloped, particularly for district and rural cultural institutions. Th ere is a lack of methods for assessment of effectiveness and produc tivity of local authorities, institutions and events. Taking into consideration the abov e mentioned issues, the country's midterm policy will be based on the following priority areas: (i) structural reforms in culture sphe re for the improvement of quality of services provided to citizens, and ex tending participation in cultural life; (ii) preservation of the c ountry's cultural and natural heritage; (iii) forming the country's image b ased on the culture environment development. The following objectives will be addressed in the culture sphere to implement reforms for service quality im provement and publ ic participation expansion: (i) institutional assessment and re organization in culture sphere; (ii) staff training and retraining; (iii) development of targeted strate gic documents for the culture sphere sustainable development. The following measures have been planned to address the objective of institutional assessment and reor ganization in culture sphere: (i) to review efficiency of cultu ral institutions activities; (ii) to develop a system fo r inventory and monitori ng of valued stocks in order to tighten the circulation control; (iii) to develop mechanis ms for introducing government-private partnership in culture sphere institutions; (iv) to develop mechanisms for intr oducing the public purchase practice for professional arts works such as performances, circus programs, TV broadcasts, and literature works; (v) to develop and introduce new form s of film distribution and service in rural communities; (vi) to develop a plan for optimization and modernization of district and rural cultural institutions network in cluding logistics and equipment; (vii) to extend the ranges of club a nd library services within the optimization plan for the purpose of ch ildren and adults creative development; (viii) to implement pilot projects for op timization and modernization of cultural institutions in all country's oblasts. To address the objective of staff tr aining and retraining, the Kyrgyz Republic government has planned the following measures: (i) to conduct inventory of culture education institutions for their compliance with standards and develop a plan for creating necessary conditions based on the inventory findings; 64 (ii) to publish guidebooks for children music schools, sc hools of arts and children schools of painting, and to develop a fundraising plan for extended circulation; (iii) to develop a mechanism for the trai ning of specialists referred by local governance bodies: to form annual or der for grant funded training based on the country's needs in cultu re sphere specialists; (iv) to sign contracts on targeted trai ning/retraining of Kyrgyzstan specialists referred by the country to foreign education institutions within international agreements; (v) to train/retrain managers in mate rial and non-material heritage and cultural institutions financia l sustainability management. The following steps have been suggest ed to improve regulation basis for the culture sphere sust ainable development: (i) to develop draft Culture Dev elopment Strategy 2020 and draft Cinematography Development Strategy 2020, as well as Broadcasting Development Strategy; (ii) to develop draft laws on amendmen ts to the Kyrgyz Republic laws On Culture, On Museums and Museum Stock of the Kyrgyz Republic, On Library Management, On Government Support for the Kyrgyz Republic Cinematography, and On Patronage; (iii) to develop a program fo r targeted strategic cu lture sphere funding; (iv) to arrange inventory of the ex isting culture sphere regulation framework and prepare a uniform regu lations code based on the inventory findings. The following objectives have been plan ned within the priority area of preserving the country's cultu ral and natural heritage: (i) to introduce comprehensive methods of recording, research and monitoring, as well as culture heri tage sites protection and use; (ii) promotion and formation of high cu lture of consumption and nature management. The following measures have been sugg ested for addressing the objective of introducing comprehensive methods of recording, research and monitoring, as well as culture heritage si tes protection and use: (i) to develop programs aimed at attracting resources for the development of a unified database of culture heritage sites recording, documenting and monitoring; (ii) to develop and approve long-ter m management plans covering secured areas, plans for reducing natura l and anthropogenic factor impact, and for development of infrastructure fo r visitor reception and supervision; (iii) to develop projects and activities aimed at local community involvement in protection and income-g enerating activities within management plans to attract resour ces for protective acti vities popularization; (iv) to introduce stage-by-stage cont ractual relations with mineral developers with respect to terms and conditions of monuments protection and use; 65 (v) to prepare files for the World He ritage List nomination: Silk Road (2nd stage), Central Asian petroglyphs , and Western Tien-Shan (natural monument); (vi) to prepare files for the Worl d Non-material Heritage List nomination: Aitysh, Boz Ui. The objective of promotion and format ion of high culture of consumption and nature management will be addr essed through the following measures: (i) to cover and discuss comprehensiv ely in media the sustainable development ideology; (ii) to open information center for e nvironmental public education in libraries, museums and other institutions; (iii) to produce videos and popular sc ience films for environmental enlightenment and education and devel opment of responsible attitude towards nature in children and adults; (iv) to establish children and youth local history movements/groups based on interest groups and clubs activities for cultural and natural sites studies; (v) to develop and introduce proj ects for the local community involvement in ecotourism and protecti on of cultural and natural sites; (vi) to organize resident lecture cent ers, interest groups and other activities at museums and libraries to develop children's creative activities and aesthetic and environmental world-view. 4.6. Physical Culture and Sports Development The goal is to develop phys ical culture and sports. Background. Physical cultu re and sports have be en actively developing the recent years which is witnessed by successful performances by Kyrgyzstan's athletes on the international athletic ar ena attracting young people to physical exercises and sports. Currently, there are about 100 physical cu lture ad sports institutions in the country training about 50 thousand people. However, th e physical culture and sports involvement rate is only 6- 7 %. According to the World Health Organization, physical culture and spor ts involvement below 15 % constitutes a threat to the na tion's gene pool. No standard sports facility has been constructed in 20 years at the national budget expense. Funding allocated for spor ts equipment is insufficient. 48.3 % of mainstream schools are provided with gyms and 91.3% with stadiums and basic facilities, and 37 % of sports faci lities are considered unsatisfactory. 70 % of school did not renew their sports equi pment for 15-20 years. The provision of population with sports facilities is not more than 16%. There are 1,500 coaches working in the country as average. With the total number of population younger than 21 is 1. 6 million, the number of coaches and instructors is insufficient. The young staff retraining system is inefficient. About a half of coaches and instructors ha ve no specialized education. Another 66 problem is the lack of up-to-date sports base. The capacity of Issyk-Kul region with its perfect conditions for traini ng has not been realized in full. The physical culture and sports sphere particularly needs sports medicine professionals. Taking into account the above issu es, the Kyrgyz Republic will implement the following priority areas: (i) physical culture and mass sports development; (ii) top-class sports development. The following objective should be addre ssed within the firs t priority area: (i) to improve the quality of school students physical training: for this purpose, normative fundamentals of physic al education will be developed and introduced in the country's mainstre am schools. Minimum standards will be developed for sports equipment supply; (ii) to improve the efficiency of the use of budget fundin g allocated for the physical culture and sports sphere: for this purpose, the sports register will be developed specifying priority sports in which the country's athletes may really win awards on international arena. Such register should specify professional sports to be developed on their own expense, and mass sports to be developed by government in order to improve nation's health; (iii) to involve the country's populat ion, particularly in regions, in physical culture and sports. For this purpos e, large-scale mass sports spectacular events will be organized. It is planned to build a power-saving physical culture and recreational center in each oblast center. The following objectives will be addresse d within the second priority area of the sphere development: (i) to improve qualification of coach es and instructors. For this purpose, a high school of instructors w ill be established for their professional development. Furthermore, planned activiti es should be implemented in order to prevent non-professional staff fr om coaching and instructing; (ii) to build a state-of-the-art sports base with medical dispensary on Issyk-Kul lake coast. Taking into account the budget deficit, one of the existing state-owned resorts should be chosen fo r the base construction, with already existing hotel and catering facilities; (iii) to improve the quality of medical support. For this purpose, the a system for training of doctors in s ports medicine will be developed and implemented at the Kyrgyz Medical A cademy. A comprehensive medical group should be formed and equipp ed appropriately to provide support to the country's athletes. 4.7. Raising the Role of Family and Ensuring Gender Equality The overall goal is to strengthen the institutional basis ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women and men for complete realization of country's human capacity in the cour se of the Kyrgyz Re public sustainable development. 67 Background. Gender equality issues ar e prevailing in all areas and levels of administration. Substantial gende r policy outcomes are resulting from relevant efforts of ministries and agen cies both at national and local levels emphasizing the importance of coordination of activities by a gender policy authorized body. A formalized gender expertise instru ments has not become a part of government bodies practices. Women's sharply narrowed acce ss to economic opportunities implementation is the most urgent and obvious issue re lated to gender inequality. Independent women's economic activity has decreased almost two times or even more in certain regions (to 30.6 % in Naryn oblast) within the two decades of the country's independence. Wo men are prevailing in informal labor market and certain service and trade sect ors where there are high risks and lack of social guarantees. Sample household surveys in the Kyrgyz Republic show that the specific weight of women engaged in two or more paid work areas, except household work, is much higher than that of men. However, women' s work and input remain insignificant for community. Home and gender violence is manifested by the growing spread of plural, early and forced marriages and sexual hara ssment. There is new type of gender violence such as women trafficking for la bor and sexual exploitation. There is a lack of broad network of government and municipal institutions providing services violence victims. Gender imbalan ce still exists in administration bodies, particularly with respect to senior pos itions, which making it urgent to more broadly apply special measures a nd strengthen their enforcement. Priority areas. Taking into account the above mentioned issues, the gender policy up to 2017 will be focused on the following priority areas: (i) improvement of efficiency of government regulation to ensure gender equality; (ii) extending women's econom ic opportunities; (iii) creating a system of functional edu cation in order to ensure equal opportunities for women and men; (iv) struggling discrimination on gende r basis and improving women's access to justice; (v) promoting gender parity in d ecision making and women's policy making input. The priority area of improving the effi ciency of government regulation to ensure gender equality will be focused on addressing the following objectives: (i) to procure the improvement of na tional institutional mechanism of achieving the gender equality at all administration levels; (ii) to improve regulation framework and law enforcement practice for the gender policy implementation; (iii) to optimize standardization of th e national gender statistics and harmonize indicators with in ternational commitments. To address the objective of procuring the improvement of national 68 institutional mechanism of achieving th e gender equality at all administration levels, the Kyrgyz Republic government has planned the following measures: (i) to develop and pilot of the improved model of institutional mechanism for gender issues ( both vertical and horizontal); (ii) to develop and test tools for intr oducing the gender-based approach in developed policies and plans of government and municipal bodies; (iii) to approve standards for govern ment services inventory for gender sensitization level; (iv) to modify the list of qualificat ion requirements for government and municipal employees base d on gender competence a ssessment criteria; (v) to develop and introduce a methodol ogy for assessment of provided government services gende r sensitization level; (vi) to develop gender-sensiti ve government service quality standards; (vii) to develop and pilot special proj ects for eliminating barriers in access to government servi ces for women and men. The second objective that is to impr ove regulation framework and law enforcement practice for the gender po licy implementation will be addressed through the following measures implementation: (i) to harmonize and synchronize re gulations with the country's international commitments; (ii) to strengthen parliame ntary control of fulfillment of the gender equality international commitments; (iii) to modify the laws in order to make government services gender sensitive; (iv) to improve supervision and cont rol, including those public, for gender related laws and regulations compliance th rough the development and introduction of control pr ocedures and methodology. To address the third objective that is to optimize standardization of the national gender statistics and harmon ize indicators with international commitments, the Kyrgyz Republic gove rnment has planned the following measures: (i) to develop unified gender indi cators within the development analysis, planning, mon itoring and assessment; (ii) to introduce gender indi cator (a check-list) in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA) system through the modification of the RIA provision, methodological recommendations and guidelines on government bodies policy development and analysis; (iii) to analyze correspondence and gaps between international standards and national statistics; (iv) to develop statistical indicators (i ncluding new ones) in accordance with the country developmen t standards and needs. The second priority area relate d to extending women's economic opportunities will be focused on addr essing the following objectives: (i) to improve working conditions th at allow combining employment and family responsibilities; (ii) to redu ce gender-based labor market segregation 69 through women and men employment divers ification; (iii) to ensure women's employment through the expansion of sources for women's economic empowerment; (iv) to ensure the record of women's input in public development through the national ac counts optimization.

V. ENVIRONMENTAL ACTI VITIES FOR SU STAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 5.1. Environment Protection The overall goal is to protect enviro nment favorable for living in context of economic growth. Background. Kyrgyzstan held the 101st position in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI)10 by 2012 being ahead of all the Central Asian Countries; However, objectively, the low environmental performance index showed high level of natural resourc es degradation whic h witnesses lower efficiency of government and local govern ance bodies activities with respect to rational use of natural resources. 10 \u00ab2012 - Environmental Performance Index and Pilot Trend Environmental Performance Index\u00bb, Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy. 72 During the Kyrgyz Republic inde pendence period, the national environmental agency (the State Agency for Environment and Forestry - SAEF) underwent numerous structural reforms associated with the status degrading and functions change. Currently, SAEF, havi ng no appropriate powers, develops environmental policies and provides ser vice at the same time, while its environmental supervision and c ontrol functions are weakened. There is still an uncertainty in allo cation of authorities and environmental control implementation, and interdepar tmental sabotage is also taking place. National and regional environment cont rol bodies face deficit of permanent staff, significant specialists outflow and lack of knowledge and experience succession. Division of authorities re lated to environment control between government and local governance bodies remains unclear. The sustainable development policy implementation requires interdepartmental cooperation and comprehensive approach to the implementation of both na tional and sector strategic documents. However, currently, such mechan isms, if existing at all, have no effect. There is a trend of making policy d ecisions aimed at simplifying the requirements for business community w ith no consideration of environmental safety issues. Such collisions lead to conflicts between local population and economic entities. To prevent potential negative impact, environmental impact analysis and government and public environmental e xpert review are carried out. However procedural and technical asp ects of such instruments need revision due to new \"green devel opment\" challenges based o international practices. Responsibility measures do not lead to the change of offenders' behavior, nor do they promote implementation of preventive activities for environment control and introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Amounts of penalties and lawsuits are much lower than actual expenses needed for full recovery of the damage caused to environment through economic activities. The country's environmental monitoring system has been destroyed and uncoordinated. The program for government water monito ring in Issyl-Kul lake coastal zone has been reduced to 11 spots where water samples are only taken during summer holiday season. In 20 12, the pollutant contents exceeded maximum concentration limit 4.6 times. There are significant problems associated with environmental data collection, processing and further application. Environmental activities ar e substantially constrai ned due to low funding, with stable trend of decr ease of funds allocated for environmental control from national budget. Thus, according to the Kyrgyz Republic Law on National Budget 2012 and Budget Foreca st for 2013-2014, the amount secured in the Environment line for 2012 was 9.7 % less than that in adju sted budget 2011 and only reached 0.1 % of GDP or 0.4 % of the national budget total expenditure. Implementation of environmen tal activities is mostly supported by special funds and projects of international organiza tions of targeted and pilot nature. 73 The forested area is only occupying 5.61 %11 of the country's total area, and specially protected natural reservations12 only take 6.006%, and the current socioeconomic situation and poor envi ronmental laws enforcement by local governance bodies result in m ass deforestation, poaching, extensive arable land use, etc. The deteriorating condition of enviro nment and lack of natural resources pose a threat to health an d safe development of pe ople. The share of urban population exposed to polluted air harm is about 58.7 %13, and vehicles exhaust gas constitutes over 80 % of contaminants . Chemical agents are more and more intensively used in industrial, agricultu ral and consumer sectors of communities increasing pollution and wast e. In 2010, there were 1,114.5 thousand tons of municipal waste, while only 1 % of a ll domestic waste are recycled. Dramatic change of habi tats and direct withdrawal of plants and animals from environment have led to extinc tion of 11 species and endangered the others. The Kyrgyz Republic's Red Book already includes 207 rare and endangered species and plants. Global climate change issues are already af fecting the country's development. However, in the nearest fu ture, issues of food and power safety directly influencing the pove rty level may become more urgent. In this view, a systematic work is needed to prevent climate change and adapt population to the changing environment. Priority areas and policy measures. To achieve the set goal and address the above mentioned issues, the Kyrgyz Republic government activities will be focused on the following priority areas: (i) reform of the national environment and nature management system; (ii) reduction of harmful impact and minimization of negative environmental e ffects of the economic activities; (iii) preservation of biodiversity and revival of natural ec osystems in the changing climate context; (iv) low-carbon de velopment principles promotion.

To address the second objective, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to implement the following measures: (i) to develop a draft new version of the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Production and Co nsumption Waste; (ii) to approve the provision of plastic waste collecti on and recycling; (iii) to develop procedures for power-saving mercury lamp s collection and recycling; (iv) to approve technical regulations for safe treatment of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB); (v) to prepare 150 tons of outdate d pesticides for recycling; (vi) to develop and introduce a system of classi fication and marking of chemical agents based on the Globally Harmonized System (GHS); (vii) to arrange temporary (until 2025) PCB safe storage facilitie s; (viii) to adopt a regulation on the renewal of registration of hazardous ch emical agents imported to the country; (ix) to rehabilitate drainage syst em and solid domestic waste (SDW) management in Issyk-Kul obl ast; (x) to assess the impact of primary mercury extraction and prepare for reclaiming oper ations on pilot areas in Haidarkan. The following objectives will be addres sed to promote the third priority area that is related to conservation of biodiversity and revival of natural ecosystems in the changing climate contex t: (i) to facilitate conservation of natural ecosystems by expanding protected areas to 7 % and strengthening their capacity; (ii) to ensure fore stry resource conservation for at least 5.62 % of the forested area up to 2017. To address the first objective that is to facilitate conservation of natural ecosystems by expanding pr otected areas to 7 % and strengthening their capacity, the following measures have been planned: (i) to create Khan-Tengri natural park on 187 hectare area in Iss yk-Kul oblast; (ii) to introduce the international system for the assessment of efficiency of specially protected areas (SPA) management (as an example, Sary chat-Ertash nature reserve or Khan- Tengri nature park); (iii) to devel op a program aimed at supporting local communities' initiatives for the improveme nt of SPA functioning and creation of new livelihoods (as an example, Sarychat-Ertash nature reserve or Khan- Tengri nature park); (iv) to support the functioning of the specially protected areas network; (v) to arrange for inventor y of wildlife preserves and their status 76 revision; (vi) to approve the national SPA cadastre; (vii) to develop and approve the provision on the Red Book procedures; (viii) to approve the activities plan for the snow leopard preservation; (ix) to develop the fifth national report on conservation of biodiversity. To address the second objective that is to ensure forestry resource conservation for at least 5.62 % of th e forested area up to 2017, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to implem ent the following measures: (i) to support local communities in social cultivation of fast-growing breeds; (ii) to create forest plantations on the Nationa l Forestry Pool (NFP) areas, 1,000 hectares per year; (iii) to rehabilitate 27 hectares of flood plain forests in Osh oblast through the introduction of particip atory forest manage ment principles; (iv) to establish the forestry seed farm ing center and monitor forest pests in Frunze and Jalal-Abad forestry areas; (v ) to implement measures aimed at sustainable development of mountain woods and land resource in the changing climate context on a 30 hectare area; (vi) to develop a program for rehabilitation of coastal flood plain forests and wetlands in Kyrgyzstan; (vii) to provide for forest management within the unified fo restry pool and SPA in Issyk-Kul and Jalal-Abad oblasts; (viii) to approve the program for nut bearing plants cultivation in the Kyr gyz Republic up to 2025. The fourth priority area that is related to the low-carbon development principles promotion will be focused on the objective of the development of Nationally Appropriate Miti gation Actions (NAMA). To address the objective, the Ky rgyz Republic government will implement the following meas ures: (i) to train repres entatives of government bodies and expert community to develo p sector-wide Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions based on internationa l standards; (ii) to develop and implement sector-wide Nationally Appropr iate Mitigation Actions based on international standards; (iii) to de velop practical recommendations on improvement of municipal buildings power saving; (iv) to develop a program for coal boiler rooms modernization in order to increase the heat generation power efficiency by 38 %; (v) to deve lop a low carbon development concept. 5.2. Water Resources and Drinking Water Supply The overall goal is to create a reliable and successfully functioning system ensuring uninterrupted access to safe dr inking water and improved sanitary conditions. Background. 93.2 % of the Kyrgyz Re public population have access to household water pipelines, with 89.4 % ac cess rate in rural areas. Only 26.9 % of population have stable access to cent ralized sewage systems, with 85.1 % access rate in Bishkek and 6 % to 17 % in other towns. Furthermore, the specific weight of some oblast and rayon cente rs population with access to sewage systems decreases by 1.5 % ev ery year due to the infr astructure degradation. 1,272 of 1,891 villages, or 67 % do not have sufficient access to centralized drinking water supply, and in 396 villages without any pipelines 77 people take water from open sources. Re gions most sufficiently provided with pure drinking water include Bishkek (100 %), Chui oblast (99.8 %) and Issyk- Kul oblast %), Osh (96.0 %) and Talas oblast (97.6 %). There is still a gap in water supply between urban and rural populations. Rehabilitation and construction of water supply systems in rural communities will require funding in amount more th an $600 million (about 28 billion soms). The system of government water ma nagement in the area of household water supply is currently in extremely difficult situation. The Drinking Water Supply and Drainage Department of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation is the government body responsible for drinking water supply. This agency underwent numerous st ructural and functional reforms that led to professionals outflow and staff tu rnover due to low sala ries and difficult working conditions. No separate division was established at the department for drainage systems. Since 2010, no budget funding has been provided for program activities. The education system does not train staff required for addressing the objectives set for the water supply and drainage sector. Drinking water supply an d sewage systems. Current projects related to water supply and drainage systems construction in ru ral areas are implemented by the Community Development Investme nt Agency ARIS that has the non- government organization status. ARIS reports to the Kyrgyz Republic government and the Kyrgyz Re public Ministry of Finance. As a part of the World Bank supported project for rural water supply and sanitary implemented since 2002, Rural P ublic Association of Drinking Water Users (RPADWU) were established and act as the ma in organization responsible for water supply system management in ru ral communities. It was expected that by the project completion date RPADWU will be the main structure providing sustainability of water u se and sewage systems. Ho wever, currently, due to institutional drawbacks of rural organi zations responsible for drinking water supply (RPADWU), a part of pipelines has become inoperable. Thus, pipelines built with donor support do not work in 35 villages. Th ere are no structures with sufficient capacity at oblast or rayon leve l to provide the wa ter supply systems with service and maintenance. Drinking water quality. In general for the country, divergence from standard quality of drinking water in pi pelines was found in 2.2 % to 2.5 % of samples for sanitary and chemical i ndicators and in 10 % to 13 % for microbiological indicators in the last fi ve years. However, the divergence from microbiological standards decreased in 2012 which may be explained by the effect of the Kyrgyz Republic L aw \"Drinking Water Safety Technical Regulation\". Issues related to imprope r quality of drinking water are conditioned by the following: - lack of plans for ensuring drinking water safety in the Kyrgyz Republic secured by sustainable funding and logistical resources; 78 - technical degradation of the drinking water supply infrastructure, first of all pump equipment, purif ication and decontamination facilities, and water mains and distribution network; - incomplete regulation and technical basis for water quality monitoring, particularly in rural water supply syst ems, as well as weak human resource capacity of organizations engaged in monitoring; - destroyed system of the water quality lab and large-scale control in rural areas. The above data confirm the need to improve coordination between public administration authorities, local g overnance bodies, and organizations and enterprises responsible for the management of water resources, water supply and drainage systems, and wat er supply sources protection. The country's existing industry approaches are far from bei ng always capable of ensuring effective addressing of urgent issues. As for the policy decision making leve l, there is a steady trend of loosening the requirements for busine ss including the service segment which leads to the lowered safety threshold both for population and environment. As for regulation framework, the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Drinking Water is currently under revision putting the dri nking water quality under the risk of loosened requirements. There are no regula tions for protective sanitary zones of drinking water sources. No sanitary expe rt analysis has been carried out with respect to water supply an d drainage construction s ites which leads to worse water safety level. The issue of lab staff capacity remain s challenging. The lab capacity fails to meet up-to-date standards due to low sa laries, lack of suc cession and worn out equipment. Priority areas. Taking into account th e above listed issues, the country's policy for drinking water supply will be fo cused on the following priority areas: (i) development of an e ffective mechanism for wat er supply and drainage system management and opera tion; (ii) development of comprehensive approach to management in the water supply an d drainage area and improvement of access to safe drinking water; (iii) drinking water quality and safety improvement. The first priority area that is relate d to the development of comprehensive approach to management in the water supply and drainage area and improvement of access to safe drinking water will be focused on addressing the following objectives. The objective of strengthening govern ment institutions responsible for water management and staff training wi ll be addressed through the following measures: (i) to establish the water management monito ring and evaluation department at the Government Agency for Architecture, Construction and Utilities; (ii) to establish a nationa l training and professional development center; (iii) to develop and introduce the Young Engin eers program; (iv) to increase the capacity of operating orga nizations (RPADWU) responsible for drinking water supply and drai nage; (v) to establish district service centers for 79 water supply and sewage pipeline mainte nance; (vi) to design methodological manuals on water supply and drainage system management for operating companies. The second objective that is related to the improvement of standardizing quality in the drinking water supply and drainage area will be addressed by the Kyrgyz Republic government through the following measures: (i) to develop a draft technical regulation setting conditio ns for waste water intake by centralized sewage systems and discharge to water basi ns; (ii) to develop a draft technical regulation for choosing centralized hous ehold water supply sources; (iii) to adopt the technical regulation on safety of water-supply and drainage outdoor networks and structures; (i v) to approve sanitary standards and rules within 6 months. The third objective that is to inform and involve public in water and sanitary decision making will be addre ssed by the Kyrgyz Republic government through the following meas ures: (i) to establish a national water supply and sanitary database; (ii) to design a website for public information; (iii) to design a methodology for public monito ring and evaluation of pr ogress in improvement of water supply, sanitary and hygiene services quality; (iv) to develop financial management manuals for operating organizations. The second priority area that is rela ted to development of comprehensive approach to management in the water supply and drainage area and improvement of access to safe drinking water will be focused on addressing the following objectives: The first objective that is related to development of the Kyrgyz Republic's comprehensive policy for drinking water and sanitary will be addressed by the Kyrgyz Republic government through the following measures: (i) to develop a water supply and sewage strategy 2013- 2023 and implementation plan for the Strategy of Water Supply and Draina ge Development 2013-2023, and safe drinking water plans for Bishkek and Osh; (ii) to incorporate issues of quality drinking water supply into strategic pl ans for socioeconomic development of settlements; (iii) to incorporate requi rements of the Kyrgyz Republic Law \"Technical Regulation on Drinking Water Safety\" in to plans of large-scale control of drinking water suppliers. The second objective that is related to in creasing the coverage of access to safe drinking water for rural populatio n will be addressed by the Kyrgyz Republic government through the followi ng measures up to 2017: (i) to develop and introduce the system fo r supervision of preparation and implementation of water supply systems rehabilitation and construction projec ts in order to improve access to safe dri nking water for rural popul ation (50 villages by 2017); (ii) to assess condition of and required investment s for water supply system modernization in 100 % of schools and preschool institutions and, based on the assessment findings, to design system rehabilitation and de velopment programs for the period up to 2020; (iii) to develop a co mprehensive program of economic, administrative and technical me asures for promoti on of rational water use within drinking water supply systems. 80 To address the third objective that is related to increasing the access to improved sewage and sanitary facilities from 26.9 % in 2012 to 40 % in 2017 the Kyrgyz Republic government has pl anned the following measures: (i) to develop standard designs a nd operating rules to regulat e issues of construction and operation of improved sanitary system s including those small-scale; (ii) to develop drainage systems in towns of Balykchy, Karakol and Cholpon-Ata through the ADB supported project \"Issyk -Kul Sustainable Development\"; (iii) to develop and introduce system of se wage system and sanitary facility monitoring and evaluation. The fourth objective that is related to reducing the losses and rational use of water resources will be addressed by the Ky rgyz Republic government through the following meas ures: (i) to analyze drinking water losses and make the findings available to public and RP ADWU; (ii) to promote timely current repairs of water facilities through the development of preventive works methods and schedule; (iii) to carry out wide organizational and awareness activities among population with respect to economi c use of drinking water by printing information materials and medic covera ge; (iv) to conduct public awareness activities in media in order to promote street water pumps pr actices replacement with household pipeline connection; (v) to require designers to include water meter installment in design docum ents and install such meters. The third priority area that is related to dri nking water quality and safety improvement will be focused on addr essing the objective normative provision of water quality in househol d water supply systems. The Kyrgyz Republic government plans to address the objectiv e through the following measures: (i) to develop and introduce procedures for separat e recording of findings of lab tests for drinking water in centr alized water supply system s for each figure exceeding the maximum allowable concentration; (ii) to arrange three large-scale and one mobile labs of the Water Supply and Drainage Departmen t to control the drinking water quality in ru ral settlements; (iii) to design an interdepartmental mechanism for sample survey of protective sanita ry zones of centralized household water supply sources and exis ting and potential sources of their pollution in the Chu river basin; (iv) b ased on the survey findings, to develop a comprehensive program for rehabilitation of household water supply sources in the Chu river basin; (v) to develop the re gister of centralize d and decentralized drinking water inlets for the Chui river basin. 5.3. Ensuring Comprehensive Security of Popula tion and Area against Natural and Technogenic Disasters The overall goal is to form, in accordan ce with international standards, the basis for disaster risk management ensuring beforehand and comprehensive safety of population's vital activiti es and environment and the country's sustainable development. Background. According to findings of expert review and assessment, about 50 % of the country's GDP are sen sitive to natural disaster risks. Annual 81 economic damage caused by natural disasters has reac hed $30 to 35 million according to experts with nearly 2 thousand affected families per year. Natural and technogenic risks are exacerbated by socioeconomic vulnerability. Main vulnerability factors include irrational land management planning, deteriorating infrastructure, incompliance with and obsolescence of construction standards and rules, deforestation, infringed sl ope stability, and remote areas with insufficient communication lines. Furt hermore, environment degradation and inefficient management increase the exposure to natural and technogenic disasters. Consequences of natural disasters and technog enic catastrophes affecting human development, poverty re duction and economic growth require efficient disaster risk mana gement as an integral part of development planning. Currently, activities of government bodies are mostly limited to implementation of sector goals and obj ectives and missing the addressing of interlinked issues important from the point of view of CRB. This is conditioned by the fact that the comprehensive CRB c oncept, although important, has not yet been incorporated into sustainable de velopment planning process and sector strategies and activities. This circumst ance is exacerbated by the fact that decentralization reforms with respect to CRB have not been implemented in sector ministries. As a result, activiti es of government bodies in the CRB area are not divided, particularly at the local governance bodies level. The model of natural disaster an d technogenic catastrophe risk management will be based on principles of multilat eral cooperation and risk analysis with the coverage of all hazard types for the purpose of consistent introduction of interna tional standards which will finally contribute to the establishment of conditions for compre hensive security and transition to sustainable development. The model sugg ests transfer of the national disaster risk management system from emer gency consequences liquidation to prevention of and improved preparedness for natural and technogenic disasters. Another distinctive feature of the proposed model is introduction of decentralized approaches to disaster risk management with clear division of functions of central and local governments. Implementation of the following five priority areas is required for the building of stable risk management basis at the international standards level: (i) integration of disaster risk mitiga tion into the planning of sustainable development, poverty reduction and ad aptation to climate change; (ii) strengthening the capacity of public administration and local governance bodies for disaster risk monitoring and evaluation and early warning system improvement; (iii) raising understandi ng and awareness among population and government employees with respect to disa ster risk manageme nt; (iv) preventive activities (structural mitigatio n) in order to reduce disaster risks; (v) improving the preparedness for disaster for the purpose of effectiv e response at all levels.

VI. SUSTAINABLE ECONOM IC GROWTH AND MACROECONOMIC STABILITY 6.1. Macroeconomic Policies The overall goal of the macroeco nomic policy 2013-2017 will be the ensuring of macroeconomic stability fo r sustainable development. The following prerequisites and conditions have been la id in the basis fo r the macroeconomic policy 2013-2017 de velopment. External prerequisites and conditi ons associated with international development trends influen ce on Kyrgyzstan's economy. Predicted favorable influencing factors: (i) political stability in the region and major trade partner countries; (i ) gradual world economy recovery (forecasted economy growth up to 4 % as average per year); (iii) forecasted economic growth in neighboring count ries: Russia (over 3.0 %), Kazakhstan (6.0 %), and China (7-8 %); (iv) low infl ation forecasted in Kyrgyzstan's major 85 trade partner countries such as Russia and Kazakhstan (not more than 7.0 %); (v) foreign trade cooperati on expansion within th e Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Eurasian Econom ic Union, and CIS; (vi) active employment of WTO membership by Kyr gyzstan; (vii) political resolution on joining the Customs Union; (viii) ex tended cooperation with international economic and financial organizations; (ix) forecasted stabilization of world oil price at $100-110 per barrel for the re duced demand due to economic growth slow down in China and some European countries; (x) world trend of innovation investment growth. Negative external factors that may influence the country's economy and budget: (i) financial instability of some European countries and the US; (ii) economic growth slow down in the US a nd China; (iii) worsening conditions of trade with major trade partners and Cu stoms Union member countries; (iv) high level of dependence on ex ternal loans to cover th e national budget deficit; (v) high risk of the Kyrgyz Republic govern ment default under social commitments due to failure to secure ex ternal loans to cover the budge t deficit; (vi) forecasted world food price growth; (v ii) gold price decrease. Internal prerequisites and conditions for maintaining the macroeconomic stability. Favorable: (i) resumed operations by Kumtor gold mine exploring companies after repairs and recovery operations; (ii) full start of sheet glass production; (iv) steadily developing trad e relations with trad e partner countries; (v) preferential crediting for agricu ltural development leading to the development of the overall agricultural sector and processing industry; (vi) forecasted agriculture sector developm ent; (vii) joining the Customs Union; (viii) service sector stable development. Negative prerequisites and conditions: (i) potential sociopolitical situation complication; (ii) unstable budget and tax s pheres; (iii) persistently high deficit level for a prolonged period; (iv) risk of inflation increase due to food price growth; (v) unfavorable actually establis hed economy developm ent trends based on 2012 outcomes; (vi) risks of Kumt or gold extraction decrease; (vii) forecasted risks of low water level which may influence power generation output significantly; (viii) increase of g as purchase price in Uzbekistan; (ix) persistently high level of losses in the energy sector. Based on the above mentioned exte rnal and internal development prerequisites and conditions, three macr oeconomic development scenarios have been developed. The following macroeconom ic figures have been forecasted for the basic scenario: Table 1 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Cumulativ e of 2013- 2017 against the 2012 level Prelimin ary, actual Expecte d Forecast Forecast Forecast Forecast 86 GDP in actual prices, million soms 304,350.1 355,470.3 414,501.4 101.2 108.9 Unemployment 8.4 8.2 8.1 growth rate 90.3 105.2 105.9 105.6 105.3 to the basic scen ario, the GDP growth is forecasted at 7.5 % per year as average in 2013-2017. The inflation dynamics will depend on remaining risks of external shock impa ct on macroeconomic situation, as well as factors such as external and domestic aggregate demand, changes in external market trends and budget a nd tax and tariff policies. It is expected that coordinated monetary and credit, budge t and tax, investment, antimonopoly and social policies implementation will allow ke eping inflation at single-valued level in 2013-2017. The following measures will be implem ented to contain inflation: (i) to promote goods offer and competition de velopment (particularly on food and agricultural markets); (ii) to support the bank system effi ciency, safety and reliability in order to promote people's sa vings growth; (iii) to provide economy with liquidity in volume co rresponding to the cash demand. In case of inflation pres sure increase due to pric e shocks and if such shocks are prolonged, m onetary and credit policy me asures will be tightened. The floating foreign exchange rate po licy will remain in 2013-2017. Currency interventions will be appl ied in amounts necessary fo r the leveling of sharp exchange rate variations. Table 2 GDP Use Pattern in 2013-2017 2012 prelimin2013 expecte2014 forecast 2015 forecast 2016 forecast 2017 forecast 87 ary, actual d GDP in market prices 100 100 100 100 100 100 Consumption 117.3 113.3 111.5 108.6 107.5 106.1 Government 35.9 Government investment 6.3 5.2 6.2 3.8 1.5 1.2 Including those of the Government Investment Program (external) 5.1 4.2 4.0 2.2 0.8 0.5 Private investment 26.6 28.7 28.3 31.5 34.1 34.7 Export (goods and non-factor services) 49.5 54.1 52.8 51.4 48.9 46.9 Import non-factor gross investment share in the GD P use pattern will rise from 32.9 % in 2012 to 35.9 % of GDP in 2017 due to promotion of private domestic and foreign investments. The mid-term i nvestment policy provides average annual gross investment growth at 18.7 %. Th e investment growth will be secured by increasing private investment as a result of : (i) elimination of all administrative barriers; (ii) creation of favorable custom s and tax regimes; (iii) real confidence building and increasing stability of the finance system including banking sector and insurance market, which will raise the efficiency of the mechanism to protect investors against potential risks and become a long-term investment source. The share of government investment is fore casted at 3.6 % per year in 2013-2017. External debt stability will be a significant factor influencing the country's investment attractiveness. In the budget policy context, the debt stability suggests the accumulated external debt and amounts of the regular debt servicing expenditure requiring payments without prejudice to other budget lines and economy as a whole. In order to reduce the external debt burden potentially threatening to stable economy growth , the Kyrgyz Republic government will consider all opportunities of the exte rnal debt further restructuring. The private consumption growth at 6.0 % per year on average in 2013- 2017 will be secured by people' s cash wage growth due to the forecasted growth of real wage and business activities re venues. Taking into account the reforms aimed at the public admi nistration optimization, the specific weight of government consumption will decrease fr om 19.2 % in 2012 to 15.6 % in 2017, with its growth restrained at 2 % per year as average (Annex 2). The trend of goods and services expor t and import will persist in the mid- term period. The net export indicator w ill improve by 8.2 percentage points in 2017 comparing to that in 2012 and reach 42.0 % of GDP. The average annual 88 export growth will be 7.6 % and mostly secured by gradual increase of green agricultural products export share. The import increase (5.7 % per year as average) will mostly be determined by growth of energy products and other intermediate products import. The volume of capital investment from all funding sources is expected to rise in 2013-2017 up to 120 billion soms per year as average which is 2.6 times higher the figure of 2008-2012 (46.3 b illion soms). The national budget capital investment volume will be more than 8.2 billion soms per year as average in 2013-2017, which is 1. 7 times higher than that in 2008-2012. The midterm budget policy will be aimed at higher-than-anticipated growth of the consolidated budge t revenues comparing to the budget expenditure leading to significant budget deficit decrease (with account of the Kyrgyz Republic Social Fund) to up to 5 % of GDP per year as average. Maintaining stable macroeconomic si tuation, improving tax and customs administration and increasing the taxable ba se will contribute to ensuring stable budget revenues. Further reforming of cr oss-budget relations will also have a positive impact on local budgets revenue s. The government expenditure policy will be focused on development pr ojects specified by this Program. Three scenarios of the country's macroeconomic development for 2013- 2017 have been developed: (1) optimistic, with 8. 3 % average annual GDP growth rate; (2) basic, w ith 7.5 % average annual GDP growth rate set as basic for the 3-year budget 2014-201 6; and (3) pessim istic, with 5.1 % average annual GDP growth rate, with acc ount of potential influence external and internal negative factors may have on the country's economy. 6.2. Government Finance Administration The goal is to achieve budget stability , build efficient and transparent budget system, improve efficiency of the national budget funding use, and orient the budget system at economic growth promotion, effectiveness of budget expenditure and improvement the quality of provided services. Background. During the last five year s, the country's budget was facing serious risks related to its instability. Po litical developments in 2010 resulted in substantial growth of add itional expenditures, mostly for recovery following April unrest and June violence in southern Kyrgyzstan and for social benefits to victims. Moreover, budget expenditure increased significantly due to social sphere and law enforcement employees sal ary growth and development projects funding increase. As a result of constructive coope ration of the Kyrgyz Republic government with conventional developmen t partners and do nor community in the budget support area, as well as implementation of a number of steps to attract additional budget revenues source s, the national budge t deficit was 4.9 % of GDP in 2010, which was 0.7 % lower th an expected level. In 2011, with the forecasted budget deficit at 7.5 % of GDP, actual deficit reached 5 %. However, 89 due to the budget expenditure increase in 2012, the budget deficit reached the threshold affecting the budget stability. In general, the government fi nance administration policy was characterized during that pe riod by the following: (i ) significant budget deficit; (ii) social sphere oriented budget (about 50 % of total expenditure); (iii) local budget reliance on the nation al budget (subsidized nature of cross-budget relations); (iv) significant dependence on external funding to cover the budget deficit; (v) restricted budget funding for development goals. The country's budget remains socially oriented. Budget funding allocated for social services increase every year< wh ile its investment capacities reduce. Laws regulating budget relations is outdated and requires update and systematization. The basic budget law if the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Main Principles of Budgetary Law in the Kyrgyz Republic. Th e law was amended many times during the pe riod 1999 to 2012, only seven of 58 articles remain unaltered. All amendments and additions were made irregularly. Therefore, it is now topical to develop a single document to regulate the government finance administration process. As shown by the presented pr ogram budgets re view, further comprehensive training on sector anal ysis and program budge t development is needed for ministries and agencies employees. Difficulties often occur in program-based budgeting and identification of program efficiency indicators. In context of growi ng financial and economic autonomy of local governance bodies, their local budget administration capacity should be strengthened. Public awareness activities and im proved access to budget process information, as well as more active c ooperation with public organizations with respect to budget transparency through the annual civil budget development are needed. Priority areas. Based on analysis findings and identified issues, the country's budget policy will be focused on the following priority areas within the next five years: (i) ensuring budg et stability; (ii) government finance administration system reform. The priority area of ensuring budg et stability will be focused on addressing the following objectives: (i) to increase the budget's resource capacity; (ii) to optimize government ex penditure; (iii) to reduce the budget deficit. To address the first objective that is to increase the budget's resource capacity, the Kyrgyz Republic government will implement the following measures: (i) to improve customs admi nistration by transferring most of imported goods from the weight-based to pr ice-based custom clearance; (ii) to continue implementation of effective ex cise tax policy; (iii) to implement non- tax proceeds reform aimed at optimiza tion of government pa id services and efficient management of state property a nd natural resources; (iv) to implement tax initiatives contributing to the budget revenues growth. 90 The second objective that is to optim ize government expenditure will be addressed through the following measures : (i) to improve the budget planning process; (ii) to move from socially oriented budget to development budget; (iii) to reduce government expe nditure and restrain appr oval of new expenditure initiatives with no appropriate funding secured. To address the third objective that is to reduce the budget deficit the Kyrgyz Republic government intends: (i) to tighten budget discipline; (ii) to ensure budget balance based on the \"pay way\" principl e; (iii) to toughen the government expenditure efficiency control. The following objectives will be addressed within the second priority area aimed at government finance administ ration system reform: (i) to move gradually to program based budgeting; (ii) to improve budgetary laws; (iii) to continue the cross-budget re lations reform; (iv) to re novate the treasury system; (v) to ensure public purchase efficiency. The first objective that is to move gradually to program based budgeting will be addressed by the Kyrgyz Repu blic government through the following measures: (i) to arrange comprehensive tr aining on sector an alysis and program based budgeting for ministries and agencies employees; (ii) to identify fiscal and non-fiscal indicators to assess budget fundi ng use efficiency; (iii) to develop and launch a system for monitoring and ev aluation of budget spending efficiency. The second objective aimed at b udgetary laws improvement will be addressed by the Kyrgyz Republic gove rnment through the following policy measures: (i) to complete the draft Kyrgyz Republic Budget Code development; (ii) to arrange for specialized expert re view, including that environmental, of the draft Kyrgyz Republic Budget Code; (iii) to initiate approval of the draft Kyrgyz Republic Budget Code by the Ky rgyz Republic Jogorku Kenesh. The third objective that is to contin ue the cross-budget relations reform will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to raise the local governance bodies' concern with respect to revenue capacity increase and improve expenditure efficiency; (ii) to raise the role and responsibility of local governance bodies for local budget administrati on; (iii) to reduce gradually local budget subsidizing. The fourth objective that is to renova te the treasury system will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop and introduce treasure information management system; (ii) to centralize government finance administration by connecting the Treasury to package clearing system and introduction of single treasury account. The following measures will be implemen ted to address the fifth objective aimed at ensuring the public purchase efficiency: (i) to revise the public purchase policies; (ii) to introduce e-proc urement practices for public purchase; (iii) to integrate the e-procuremen t system into the budgeting process. 6.3. National Debt Administration 91 The goal is to satisfy funding needs as a part of transition to sustainable development based on formation of an optimized national debt structure14. Background. The external debt re mains dominating in the Kyrgyz Republic's national debt structure. IN 2008-2012, the specific weight of external credits reached 90 %. At the same time , the external funding share dominating in the national debt structure also s hows the Kyrgyz Republic's high reliance on external credits. The main factors containing the grow th of domestic borrowings include the low development degree and narrow st ock market in the Kyrgyz Republic. IN 2008-2012, the Kyrgyz Republic gove rnment took steps to improve regulation frameworks for governmen t securities issue, circulation and redemption (unification and simplification of government securities categories), gradual extension of matu rity of government borrowi ng instruments (Treasure bonds issued 2009) and expans ion of the government market securities share. However, the degree of the government securities mark et development is still insufficient to provide the nationa l budget with substantial borrowings. At present, moratorium on state guarante es is in effect in accordance with the Kyrgyz Republic's Mid-term Nationa l Debt Administration Strategy 2012- 2014. At the same time, as a part of transition to sustainable development, significant financial resources are needed a part of which could be attracted through private government borrowings ag ainst state guarantees. Nevertheless, provision of state guarantee s with no account of budget policy needs, restrictions and capacities and goals of effective na tional debt administration may create serious problems for the Kyrgyz Republic debt stability. In this view, further steps of the Kyrgyz Republic government in provision of state guarantees should be based upon well-considered and bala nced decisions and deep risks and benefits analysis. Lately, there is an uneve n growth of bilateral borrowings share in the external debt structure. Thus, the extern al debt's bilateral component increases due to large loans provided by one or two creditors. Continuing borrowings concentration that has been observed for the last four years is associated with the risk of high debt dependence on such creditors and a possibility of considering of various aspects of coope ration with creditor countries (foreign policy, trade, etc.) in relation to such debts issues. Priority areas are based on retain ing the achieved positive outcomes in national debt administration and implementation of new priority areas in the country's government borrowings, partic ularly: (i) maintaining the national external debt stability; (ii) dom estic borrowings share increase. The priority area of maintaining the na tional external debt stability will be focused on addressing the following ob jectives: (i) to optimize the existing external borrowings; ( ii) to optimize new external borrowings flow. 14 For the purpose of this Program, the optimized national debt structure is defined as one with optimized costs and risks combina tion. Costs may include, for instance, budget funding for the debt servicing. Risks include additional costs that may be incurred under unf avorable circumstances (as an example, increase of loan interest rates or foreign exchange rate variations). 92 To address the first objective that is to optimize the existing external borrowings, the Kyrgyz Republic gove rnment intends to implement the following: (i) bilateral external debt r estructuring as a part of the Paris Club Protocol 2005 implementatio n; (ii) to initiate a mechanism of conversion transactions with the Kyrgyz Republic's bilateral debt; (iii) to prevent overdue repayment of the current external debt15. The second objective that is to opt imize new external borrowings flow will be addressed by the Kyrgyz Repu blic government through the following measures: (i) to attract new government external borrowings subject to minimum loan preferential le vel (grant element) at 35 %; (ii) to restrict annual amounts of newly attracted external borrowings with account of maintaining annual external debt balanc e not exceeding 60 % of GDP. The following objective will be addresse d as a part of the priority area of domestic borrowings share increase: (i) to change the domestic debt structure with increase of the share of domestic borrowing market instruments.16 The following measures have been planned to address the objective: (i) to cover budget needs only through issue and pl acing of domestic borrowing market instruments; (ii) to issue domestic bor rowing instruments with maturity over 2 years; (iii) to develop new regulati ons and amend those existing regulating activities on the government securities market. VII. IMPROVEMENT OF BUSI NESS ENVIRONMENT AND INVESTMENT CLIMATE 7.1. Small and Medium-size Business Development The goal is to reduce the number of necessary licenses and permits almost two times by 2017 (from 240 to 101), liberalize go vernment's supervisory functions and devel op new approaches to the system of regulatory impact analysis in administra tive decision making. Background. The private sector contin ued its development in last few years, however not quite rapidly. In 2007-2012, the total number of employed in small and medium-size business sect or increased by 35.6 %, from 284.2 thousand to 385.4 thousand. Accordingl y, the number of f unctioning small and medium-size enterprises incr eased by one third, from 9, 000 to 12,000. The small and medium-size business specific wei ght in GDP reached 42 % in 2012. In 2011, the interdepartmental comm ission for the reform of government business regulation system completed the process of optimizing the licensing area. As a result, the number of require d licenses and permits was gradually cut from over 500 in 2008 to 240 in 2012. 15Except for so called technical arrears caused by payment suspension procedures associated with the debt restructuring. 16Market borrowing instruments mean government securities placed with the use of market pricing mechanisms such as auctions, etc. 93 However, notwithstanding the implemente d reforms, a lot of barriers still exist impeding small and medium-sized companies' access to domestic and foreign markets and creating [problems fo r business such as unclear and vague licensing procedures and anticompetitiv e actions by larger market actors. In order to reduce the bureaucratic pressure on business and raise the economic freedom level, the regulatory impact analysis procedure was introduced in 2008 to assess the influe nce regulations may have on business activities and provide for abolition of those restricting small and medium business development. The legislation system and law enforc ement in administrative area have a number of drawbacks including sign ificant number of duplicating or contradicting regulations, legal collisi ons, adopted regulations incompliance with laws governing business relationships or distor ting their norms. Passed laws regulating business activities were not analyzed to assess their regulatory impact. Incompleteness of the regulatory impact anal ysis methodology remains a problem, therefore RIA procedures are rather formal. To protect business entities agains t unlawful interference with their activities, the number of inspection bodi es was reduced from 21 to 12 in 2008. Risk assessment criteria and check lists regulating intervals between business inspections and prevent total inspecti ons were actively introduced. Inspection period were reduced 2 times. Broa d awareness campaign was conducted in regions to inform public on inspection rules and proce dures. As a result of such activities, the number of actual inspec tions decreased nearly 2 times in 2012 (24.4 thousand to 13.5 thousand). At the same time, the practice of arbitrary inspections of small and medium-size companies still exists. Gove rnment regulation in the supervisory and control sphere remain inefficient, expensive, duplicating and rather formal. Notwithstanding the introduction of risk assessment criteria, inspection bodies continue total inspections affecting bus iness entities' activities. Violation of laws by inspection bodies often lead to creation of corruption schemes. Priority areas. Taking into account the above listed issues, the business regulation policy will be focused on the following priority areas: (i) creating new approaches in the regulatory impact analysis of administrative decisions including those oriented at environmenta l safety; (ii) to reduce the level of government interference with busin ess activities with regulation policy emphasizing issues of rational use of limited resources and toughening the environmental laws requirements. The following objectives will be addres sed within the first priority area: (i) to develop and introduce a new methodology of the regulatory impact analysis of administrative decisions; (ii) to involve actively business structures and civil society institu tions in the regulatory im pact assessment process. To address the objective of develop and introduce a new methodology of the regulatory impact assessment the Ky rgyz Republic government intends: (i) to review the existing regulatory impact assessment methodology; (ii) to develop 94 and introduce a new regulat ory impact assessment methodology also covering environmental safety issues. The second objective will be addresse d through the foll owing measures: (i) to revise legislation related to entr epreneurship with the participation of business community and civil society institutions; (ii) to develop and propose to the Kyrgyz Republic gove rnment recommendations on the abolishment of regulations which are neither well f ounded nor market economy oriented. The following objectives will be addressed within the second priority area that is oriented at government business activities regulation emphasizing rational environment management a nd toughening the environmen tal laws requirements: (i) to reform the licensing system em phasizing rational use of limited natural resources; (ii) to reform the supervisi on and control sphere as to tighten the requirement of environmental laws compliance. The Kyrgyz Republic government intends to address the objective of reforming the licensing system through the following measures: (i) to develop and propose the new Kyrgyz Republic law on licensing system; (ii) to reduce the number of existing licenses and permits; (iii) to develop and propose new bylaws which allow specifying clear licensing procedures, rights and responsibilities of licensors and licensees, and other licensing norms emphasizing rational use of natural resources. The second objective that is to reform the supervision and control sphere as to tighten the requirement of en vironmental laws compliance will be addressed through the following measures : (i) to arrange the supervision and control legislation inventory for governme nt's duplicating and excessive control functions; (ii) to prepare proposals on reducing government 's duplicating and excessive control functions; (iii) to in troduce a new system of risk criteria assessment by inspection bodies em phasizing the environmental laws requirements tightening; (iv) to deve lop a new inspection mechanism based on the risk criteria system including those aimed at environment conservation; (v) to develop and introduce graduall y automated inspections database. 7.2. State Property Management The goal is to build an effective gove rnment property management system meeting the economic and soci al efficiency criteria. Background. Currently, the state is a shareholder in some 59 joint-stock companies including 22 ones of strate gic significance and operating in most profitable sectors of econo my. Companies' performanc e is evaluated base on general financial and econom ic indicators with major stress on their dividend and other budgetary payments plan fulfillment. No co mprehensive analysis has been conducted with respect to activities of companies fully or partially owned by the state. No state-owned compan ies practice strategic planning. The government has not formulated any cl ear administration goals nor has it specified criteria of state-owned comp anies performance. There is no clear 95 position as to where the state should reserve its participation and which companies should be fully or partially privatized. The situation with the excessive number of state-owned companies remains problematic. The issue of idle , subsidized, detrimental state-owned companies and those failing to perform socially important functions has not been addressed. There are omissions in the state-ow ned companies functioning regulation framework. The Kyrgyz Re public Civil Code only v ests main provisions on state-owned companies. There is no clear division of functions of the government property management author ized body and sector ministries and agencies responsible for state-owned comp anies. No proper control is ensured for financial and economic activities of state-owned companies and their government property use efficiency. Due to lack of centralized government property record system, the Kyrgyz Republic government does not have relia ble information regarding full value and size of government property. Informa tion provided by stat istics and justice authorities and State Registry Service is scattered and inco mplete and may not present a real picture of the country's assets status. In the last few years, attempts were made to car ry out country wide govern ment property inventory, however the issue has not been resolved so far. In 2011, a requirement was introduced for state-owned companies to pay a part of net profits to the national bu dget. Thus, state-owned companies paid 257.6 million soms in 2012 and 758.9 million soms in 2012. However, dividends on state-owned stock hold th e major share in the structure of government property management re venues. The maximum dividend amount that reached more than 2.9 billion soms or 4 % of total national budget revenues was received in 2011. In 2012, state-owned companies paid 1.8 billion soms in form of dividends exceeding 6 times the amount of dividends received by the state in 2008. Revenues from the government prop erty privatization have been maintained at 170 million soms as yearly average in the l ast three years. Proceeds from rent of state-owned rooms and facilities have also been remained almost the same amounting to some 19 million soms per year as average. In 2012, the total am ount of proceeds from government property management reached more than 2.7 bil lion soms or 3.4 % of total national budget revenues. However, if measures are taken to toug hen financial discipline in state-owned companies and strengthe n the government property use control additional reserves may be f ound, in particular through the government property rent. Thus, the following majo r issues may be highlight ed in the government property management system: (i) lack of consistency of the government property management regulation framew ork and existing gaps and conflicts; (ii) lack of government property centralized recordi ng and country-wide inventory; (iii) lack of methodology of control and an alysis of the government property use efficiency; (iv) insufficient work of go vernment agents in boards of companies 96 with the state participation; (v) lack of responsibility for state-owned companies management and their performance im partial assessment; (vi) non-productive use of public assets by state- owned companies and institutions. Priority areas. Taking into account the above mentio ned issues, the Kyrgyz Republic government activities will be oriented at the following priority areas in the next five years: (i) the gove rnment property structure optimization; (ii) facilitating the growth of the gove rnment sector prof itability growth and sustainable development. The priority area of the government pr operty structure optimization will be focused on addressing the following objectives: (i) to approve the government property record and inventor y mechanism for the functioning of the Single Government Property Register; (ii) to prep are well-founded proposals and adopt regulations on liquidation or privatization of the state-owned companies that fail to perform strategic and socially oriented state functions; (iii) to prepare solutions regarding the re structuring of seconda ry assets of state- owned companies, institutions and economic entities fully or partially owned by the state. The following measures have been pl anned to address the first objective that is to develop and approve the government prope rty record and inventory mechanism: (i) to deve lop a government property record and inventory methodology; (ii) to develop an inte rdepartmental communication mechanism for government bodies engaged in th e government property record and inventory; (iii) to develop a ToR for th e development of an interdepartmental automated information system \"The Kyrgyz Republic Single Government Property Register\"(IAIS SG PR); (iv) to develop IA IS SGPR; (v) to purchase software and hardware for launching the IAIS SGPR; (vi) to train staff on the IAIS SGPR support and main tenance; (vii) to carry out the government property inventory throughout the Kyrgyz Republic. The second objective sugg ests the following measures implementation: (i) to carry out comprehensive review of stat e-owned companies ac tivities; (ii) to adopt regulations on liquidation and priv atization of companies considered unreasonable to be held within the gove rnment property; (iii) to implement practical activities for such compan ies liquidation and privatization. To address the third objective that is related the restruct uring of secondary assets of state-owned companies fully or partially owned by the state the Kyrgyz Republic government intends: (i) to carry out inventor y of secondary assets of state-owned companies, institutions a nd economic entities fully or partially owned by the state; (ii) to prepare a set of measures for efficient management of identified secondary asset s; (iii) to implement pr actical activities for the identified secondary assets disposal. The following objectives will be addres sed as a part of the second priority area that is related to facilitating the growth of the government sector profitability growth and sustainable deve lopment: (i) to tight en supervision of financial and economic activities of state-owned companies and economic entities fully or partially owned by the state; (ii) to facilitate efficient 97 management of non-operated government immovable prope rty; (iii) to develop and introduce mechanisms ensuring the government property management transparency and openness. To address the first objective that is to tighten supervisio n of financial and economic activities of state-owned companies and economic entities fully or partially owned by the state the Kyrgyz Republic government intends: (i) to develop and introduce a uniform management proc edure for state-owned companies; (ii) to develop and introdu ce key financial and economic indicators of state-owned companies productivi ty; (iii) to develop and introduce mechanisms aimed at rais ing the accountability and motivation of management bodies of economic entities fully or partially owned by the state and regular assessment of their activities. The objective of efficient manage ment of non-operated state-owned facilities will be addresse d through the following meas ures: (i) to carry out comprehensive review of rentals for stat e-owned facilities and market rates of similar facilities rent; (ii) based on the review finding s, to develop and introduce state-owned property rental estimat e methodology in line with market principles; (iii) to adopt a regulati on on implementing competitive and open procedures for the government property rent. The following measures have been planned to address the third objective that is to develop and introduce mech anisms ensuring the government property management transparency and openness: (i) to adopt regulations on electronic auctions for the government property di sposal; (ii) to de velop a software and purchase software and hardware for th e launching of trading platform in Internet. 7.3. Investment Climate The goal is to improve the Kyrgyz Republic's investment climate attractiveness. This includes raising the environment oriented investment level to 10 % in newly launche d investment projects. Background. In 2008, the foreign direct investment (FDI) reached its peak of $866.2 million. FDI significantly decr eased during the next two years due to the world financial crisis reaching only $660.9 million in 2009 and $666.1 million in 2010. According to prelimin ary data, FDI reached $521 million in 2012. Currently, the existing system of investment policy issues regulation shows serious drawbacks directly affec ting FDI inflow. Func tions and certain powers are allocated to separate govern ment institutions such as ministries, agencies and local governance bodies. Ther e is no coordination of efforts to develop a single investment policy. Th e public administration system has no independent agency responsible for i nvestment promotion and support that could promote the country's investme nt opportunities, provide reliable information and quality services to fore ign investors based on the one-stop-shop 98 principle, and ensure investments security in the country in accordance with the Kyrgyz Republic laws. Stability, including that political, le gal, economic a nd social, is a fundamental factor for investment promo tion. Currently, investors perceive the Kyrgyz Republic as a politica lly and socially unstable st ate with frequent change of government and laws a nd lack of succession and c onsistency in government decisions. Investment laws norms are of ten interpreted arbitrarily. Artificial barriers arise in investor activities accompanied by conflicts and corruption, particularly at local level. The poor pr otection of investor ownership rights is also a serious obstacle for FDI. Furthermore, the country stall does not have a database of existing and planned investment projects including those of regional level. Access of potential investors to information on the Kyrgyz Republic's investment opportunities is impeded. Th ere is a need in a Multi language web portal that would provide access to the investment projects database and potential investment areas and ensure reception and urgent consideration of investors' complaints and messages. Taking into account the above menti oned issues and objective factors impeding attraction of investments such as small market scale and lack of access to sea ports, it is an urge nt challenge for the Kyrg yz Republic government to provide preferences to inve stors for better competiti veness of the country's investment market. The human resource capacity for in vestment policies development and implementation shows serious drawbacks. Staff is sel ected on common grounds, with no additional qualification requir ements such as language skills and experience. There is deficit of pr ofessionals specialized in new world development trends including issues of attracting environmentally oriented investments for the country's sustainable development. Priority areas. Taking into account the above issues, the investment policies up to 2017 will be focused on the following priority areas: (i) improvement of the governm ent investment policy effi ciency; (ii) development of mechanisms to promote and suppo rt investments. The first priority area activities will address objectives aimed at the following: (i) institutional capacity incr ease; (ii) improvement of access to reliable information; (iii) stable legisl ation development; (i v) human resource capacity building. The following measures should be implemented to address the objective of institutional capacity increase: (i) to establish an institution to promote investments that will act as a coordi nating body and work based on the one-stop- shop principle ensuring that any invest or can have necessar y information and assistance in starting and implementing a pr oject; (ii) to introduce the institution of investment agents with diplomatic missions who will act as agents for local targeted campaigns for investment attraction. The second objective that is relate d to access to information will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to conduct annually the country's 99 investment advantages surveys at regional and industry levels; (ii) to develop a single database of existing and planned inve stment projects; (iii) to provide open broadband access to the database via Inte rnet for potential investors; (iv) to inform local communities on potential benefi ts of planned and existing projects. The third objective suggests ensuri ng the investment laws stability through the following initiatives: (i) to m odify laws as to clarify the provision of the investor's right to choose stable and favorable legal regime ; (ii) to develop procedures for investors to exercise thei r right to choose most favorable regime in case of law modification through newly adopted regulations; (iii) to propose legislative limitations on regulations whic h deteriorate investor position; (iv) to secure legislatively clear grounds for forc ed seizure of proper ty by government providing fair seizure and compensation mechanisms. The fourth objective that is related to the investment pr ocess support will be implemented through the following measures: (i) to arrange a regular capacity development system for st aff involved in investment policy development and investment promotion; (ii) to organize activities for the studying of best practices of international investment promotion agencies; (iii) to develop and introduce a mechanism of government order placement within education system for staff retraining. Successful fulfillment of objectives within the first prior ity area will allow promoting the second one that is relate d to development of mechanisms to promote and support investments. The second priority area suggests addressing the following objectives: (i) to attract inv estments; (ii) to promote investments. The first objective suggests the followi ng measures: (i) to develop criteria for the identification of proj ects that will have preferen ces and incentives; (ii) to develop an investment incentives map (II M) based on the following criteria: investment amount, area, economy sector , availability of environmental components in investment projects; (i ii) to develop a draft regulation on procedures of the IIM-based preference s; (iv) to develop and distribute investment directories on incentives provided. The following measures have been planned to address the second objective: (i) to lower the threshold amount required for investment visa; (ii) to abolish the commission for apartment purchase by investors that meet specific conditions; (iii) to deve lop and introduce a system for the assessment of activities of investors and encouragement with annually awarded title Investor of the Year as an example. 7.4. Finance and Credit Sector Development Banking Sector Development The goal is to form a stable and ef fective system of finance and credit institutions capable of efficiently mob ilizing financial resources and satisfy the need of overall population and entreprene urs in long-term an d accessible credits. 100 Background. 23 commercial banks and their 278 br anches operated in the Kyrgyz Republic as of the end of 2012. Commercial banks' capital17, being their main strength source, incre ased by 26%. While the main indicator characterizing the capital sufficiency reac hed 28 % as of the end of 2012 and excessed the set normative (12 %) two times. Notwithstandi ng the impact of global financial crisis and developments in April and June 2010, th ere was annual growth of deposits in commercial banks witnessing growing public trust in bank system. Thus, the bank sector's deposit base incr eased from 29.6 to 50.6 billion soms, or by 71.4 % in 2008-2012. Its net profit grew by 33 % within five years, from 1.8 to 2.4 billion soms. Commercial bank s' credit portfolio increased by 56.2 % within five years, from 25.6 to 40 billion soms. However, specific weight of long-ter m credits (more than 3 years) remains low (24 % in the last five year s). Crediting of economy by commercial banks shows that average specific weight of trade in the 5-year credit portfolio is 41 %, while agriculture, mortgage and c onsumer loans had 13.4 %, 11 % and 8.4 % respectively. Interest rates of credits provided by commercial banks remain high, although rates of credits in local curren cy for more than 1 year decreased 24.4 to 21.7 %, except for mortgage and construction loans where rates increased 19.1 to 21.3 % a nd 21.1 to 22.5 % respectively. Thus, main issues associ ated with finance and credit services included the following: (i) high interest rates on credit s; (ii) narrow long- term credit segment; (iii) not quite high level of trust of general population and entrepreneurs in banking system; (iv) lo w financial literacy of bank service users. Priority areas. Main priority areas for the period through 2017 will include the following: (i) increase of the financ ial intermediation level and achievement of forecasted figures of the bank sector and non-bank financial sector by 2017; (ii) decrease of bank system credit interest rates to the forecasted 16.5 %; (iii) development of criteria for innovative pr ojects and provision of crediting in 2014; (iv) increase of the long-term m oney share in the Kyrgyz Republic's economy. The first priority area will be implemen ted in line with the forecast-based scenario. According to the scenario, the indicator \"Ratio of Finance and Credit Sector Assets to GDP\" will increase by 0.5 % per year until 2017. The second priority area: weighted aver age interest rates of bank credits will fall to 16.5 by 2017 as the following developments occur: (i) annual growth of credit portfolio by 15 %; commercial ba nks' credits interest rate remains at 19 %; (ii) the Kyrgyz Republic government support to the real sector through crediting, at least 5 % (sta te funding in amount about 7 billion soms or interest rates subsidizing for credits in amount of at least 700 million soms, to be secured in the national budget) of the tota l amount of the entire bank system per year. The third priority area: specific weight of credits for at least 3 years will remain at 24.0 % level until 2017, with account of the credit portfolio growth. 17 Paid up authorized capital 101 The financial market should be provided with long-term resources in order to increase the share of long-te rm credits. Pension savings are one of long-term resource sources globally, therefore the country's pension re form should be continued with respect to introduction of the funded pension component within the capacities of the Kyrgyz Republic So cial Fund and Kyrgyzstan's economy. At the same time, the Kyrgyz Re public governmen t and relevant ministries should work to facilitate attrac tion of long-term loans by the finance sector entities both on external a nd domestic markets. Furthermore, capitalization is needed for the Kyr gyzstan-Kazakhstan Investment Fund ($296,000) which would al low implementing the first installment in amount of $30 million. Agreement should be signed w ith the European In vestment Bank so that could start its operations in the country. The Kyrgyz Republic government will order the Ministry of Finance a nd Ministry of Economy to provide for subsidizing credits for agricu lture and trade sectors. As a part of the fourth priority area, criteria will be developed for environment oriented inno vative projects. In 2014 crediting of environment oriented innovations will commence provide d that funding is secured in the national budget to promote such cred iting (subsidizing, funding, etc.). Non-bank Finance Sector Development The goal is to transform and attract f unding in order to ensure investment in the real economy sector. The non-bank finance sector is a part of the Kyrgyz Republic's financial market and consists of the s ecurities market, insurance activities and funded pension sy stem, and accountin g and audit. Background. 2,674 securities issues we re registered as of December 31, 2012. The total emission amount was 64 billion soms. The amount of funds raised on the security market reached ab out 5 billion soms annually in the last five years. Currently, the choice and variety of financial instruments are limited. The securities market capacitie s are used insufficiently for investment projects funding, particularly for those nationa l. Many joint-stock companies fail to follow corporate management principle to sufficient extent. The stock market has not taken an adequate position as an instrument fo r capital mobilization and attraction to economy. Liquid stock are not circulated freely (companies fully or partially owned by the state). Weak pub lic awareness on the market leads to non-confidence in stock market. People are not professionally prepared for investing. There are 17 insurance companies ope rating on the market including two reinsurance ones. Their aggregate assets incr eased 2.5 times in the last five years and reached 1,376.5 million soms as of January 1, 2013. Premium payments increased 1.6 times and reached 51.2 m illion soms in 2012. However, practice shows that, due to lack of administra tive measures mechanis ms, not all entities comply with the law requirement on en tering contracts on the four types of 102 obligatory liability insurance (their shar e is only 9.1 % of the entire premium amount). The lion's share of premiums passed to reinsurance is transferred outside the country. In 2012, insurance organizati ons transferred 583. 7 million soms for reinsurance (69.5 % of the total premiu m amount) including 576.1 million soms transferred to foreign countries (68.6 %) . To protect the insurance market and reduce capital outflow abroad a reinsu rance organization s hould be established in Kyrgyzstan, possibly pa rtially owned by the state. Currently, there is one non-governme nt pension fund, NPF Kyrgyzstan, providing additional pension provision on voluntary basis. The fund's assets reached 23,697,300 soms by January 1, 2013. The f unded pension system has been introduced in January 2010. Th e State Pension Savings Fund's account accumulated 980 million soms in 2010, 1.8 billion soms by January 1, 2012, and about 3 billion soms by Ja nuary1, 2013 (with the set 2 % fee). These funds are only invested in government securities and commercial banks deposits. Transfer of the funded pension component to pr ofessional actors (asset management companies) for trust manage ment and expansion of inv estment areas are planned for 2016. To increase profitab ility and regulate risks, mechanisms should be provided for the safeguarding of pensi on savings. Pensions savings, being a sources of long-term money will allow fu rther investing in long-term profitable projects and therefore contributing to ec onomy development without the state's external debt growth. With respect to IFRS introduction, the Kyrgyz Republic was one of the first CIS countries to determine its acc ounting policy strategy in line with IFRS and has been implementing the strategy so far with a number of achievements. For the purpose of practica l assistance to co mpanies accountants in conversion and IFRS application, a set of documents was developed for a ccountants to work under IFRS. The Kyrgyz Republic government's auditors register includes 70 organizations. Four international audit co mpanies of the Big F our operate on the country's audit services market along w ith domestic audit organizations. In 2011, two audit companies of the internati onal top 10 started to operate in the Kyrgyz Republic witnessing progressive development of the audit market in the Kyrgyz Republic. The amount of proceed s of all domestic audit companies reached 103,101,800 soms in 2011, while internati onal audit companies had proceeds in amount of 118,533,400 soms which shows the market's need in high quality audit. There is also the need to improve quality of domestic audit services and build a multistage audit qua lity control system in line with advanced international practice. To implement comprehe nsive measures for fu rther development and improvement of the account ing and audit system in the private sector, an accounting and audit deve lopment strategy and plan should be adopted. Priority areas. Main priorities include the following: (i) improvement of efficiency of the national stock market to secure investme nts in the Kyrgyz Republic's economy sustaina ble development; (i) development of the Kyrgyz 103 Republic's insurance market and funded pension system ; (iii) establishment of a financial reporting quality control syst em and development of audit quality control in the Kyrgyz Republic. The first priority area will be implemented through addressing the following objectives; (i) to extend the range of financial instruments on the stock market; (ii) to improve pe ople's financial literacy a nd ensure investors' rights protection; (iii) to promote the increase of investments thro ugh the stock market. The following activities will be implem ented to address the first objective; (i) to adopt a regulation on introduction of Islamic financ ial instruments; (ii) to prepare a set of regulations for government securities tran sfer to stock exchange for placement and circulation. The following activities have been planned to address the second objective: (i) to approve Financial Lite racy Improvement Program; (ii) to establish a stock market information cente r; (iii) to adopt a regulation ensuring protection of investors' rights. The third objective will be addressed th rough the following activities: (i) to prepare proposals on ensuring free circul ation of 5 % to 15 % of state-owned companies' stock on stock market; (ii) to introduce international principles of the Corporate Management Code in or der to improve domestic companies' attractiveness. The second priority area will be impl emented through the addressing of the following objectives: (i) to introdu ce new types of oblig atory insurance and further implement existing types of ob ligatory liability insurance; (ii) to facilitate reduction of capital outflow fro m the domestic insurance market to those foreign; (iii) to attract long-term pension money as an investment in the country's economy. The first objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop a draft law on amendments to the Ky rgyz Republic Code of Administrative Liability; (ii) to adopt a regulation on introduction of new types of obligatory insurance. The second objective will be addressed through the establishment of a reinsurance organization fully or partially owned by the state. To address the third objective, a re gulation should be adopted providing procedures of pension savi ngs investment and mechan ism to safeguard them. The third priority area will be oriented at addressing the objective including development of a financial reporting qual ity control system and building of a multistage audit quality c ontrol system. The obj ective will be addressed through the following measures: (i ) to approve the country's corporate financial reporting strategy and plan 2013-2020; (ii) to modify regulations on accounting; (iii) to modify regulations on audit as to improve the quality control system. 7.5. Tax and Customs Policies 104 The goal is to create an effective fiscal regulation system in context of the Kyrgyz Republic transition to sustainable development. Background. Tax and customs revenue s increased from 36 billion to 64 billion soms or 1.8 times in 2008-2012. Their specific weight in GDP grew from 19 % to 21.0 %. According to expert estimates, fiscal performance in Kyrgyzstan has reached 70 % of the possible level. Fundamental tax and customs admini stration enactments include Tax Code and Customs Code of the Kyr gyz Republic. The Kyrgyz Republic Tax Code provides liberal tax treatment in general, particular ly for good faith taxpayers. The tax burden is 19 % as average that is relatively law comparing to trade partner countries. This figure is 35 % in Russia, 23 % in Kazakhstan, 32 % in Moldova, and 34 % in Belarus. At the same time, the tax load is distributed uneve nly between economy branches. The heaviest load is put on in dustry, while the agricultural sector is almost tax exempted except land and property taxes. The current tax and customs servi ces administration has serious drawbacks. Complex administrative proc edures still exist in tax obligations fulfillment by business entities. Activities of fiscal bodies involved in corruptive schemes undermine business community's tr ust in government and pose threat to the financial system's st ability as a whole. Frequent transfer of fiscal policy functions from one government body to a nother affects efficiency of fiscal bodies in general including th eir human resources capacity. The regulation base has substantia l gaps. It should be noted that, notwithstanding relatively low tax rates, almost 20 years of the Kyrgyz Republic independent development is characterized by a numbe r of institutional and administrative barriers that forced a part of business to move to the shadow. In this view, the main objective is to reduce areas and conditions for shady business development and create legi slative and other barriers preventing its existence and spread. Furthermore, th e lack of stable tax laws sends an alarming message to investors. Perfor mance of tax and customs services is significantly affected by the lack of proper information exchange between agencies engaged in collection of taxes and other state fees. Priority areas. Taking into account the above issues, priority areas for the period to 2017 will include the following: (i) development of an effective and stable tax system; (ii) simplificati on and improvement of tax and customs administration; (iii) improvement of tran sparency, identification and elimination of conditions for corruption; (iv) impl ementation of fiscal measures contributing to the environment pollution prevention. The first priority area that is related to developm ent of an effective and stable tax system will be focused on th e following objectives: (i) to streamline tax and customs services; (ii) to improve human resources capacity of tax and customs bodies; (iii) to coordinate act ivities of law enforcement and other government bodies. The following measures will be im plemented to address the first objective: (i) to continue introduction of customs service au tomated information 105 system including the electronic custom s bill submission; (ii) to continue introduction of the tax service automa ted information system including the electronic tax report submission; (iii) to modify regulations on introduction of new technologies in tax administration to facilitate tax obligations fulfillment by taxpayers (inspections based on risk criteria, wide prac tical use of taxes charged, mandatory patent, tax contract). The second objective will be addresse d through the foll owing measures: (i) to amend laws as to promote or hold liable tax and customs service officers; (ii) to arrange training workshops fo r tax and customs service officers professional development. The following measures have been pl anned to address the third objective that is to coordinate activities of l aw enforcement and other government bodies: (i) to conduct systematic inspections in cooperation with the Kyrgyz Republic government Service for Economic Crime Prevention, Tax Service and Customs Service in order to identify forei gn trade entities involved in smuggling, taxpayers with tax debts, as well as to identify and re gister economic entities not registered with tax authorities. The second priority area that is rela ted to simplification and improvement of tax and customs administration will be focused on the following objectives: (i) to even tax load and improve investment climate; (ii) to ensure tax collection completeness. The first objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to revise the list of activities run based on voluntary and mandatory patents; (ii) to develop a draft regulati on preventing duplication of VAT and sale tax; (iii) to develop draft regulations on revision a nd optimization of of the existing tax preference system; (iv) to develop a dr aft concept of fiscal policy for 2014-2017. The following measures will be implemented to address the second objective: (i) to develop draft regu lations aimed at tax and customs administration simplification; (ii) to intr oduce universal tax d eclaration; (iii) to develop draft regulations on non-cash payment of taxes and customs fees. The priority area of improvement of transparency, identification and elimination of conditions for corruption will be promoted through the addressing of the objective that is to improve tax and customs administration and automate reporting system. The above objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to establish electronic tax declaration processing centers; (ii) to interview taxpayers and foreign trade entities with re spect to corruption in tax and customs bodies; (iii) to apply administrative measures to tax and customs officers involved in corruption activities; (iv) to implement continuous activities aimed at the tax reporting simplification. One of the fiscal policy novelties will be the pr omotion of the fourth priority area oriented at fiscal policy measures contributing to the environment pollution prevention. The following measures have been planned for this area: (i) to adopt a regulation on environmental fee for forei gn vehicles entering the Kyrgyz Republic customs territory as th e air pollution compensation; (ii) to 106 adopt a regulation on the customs fee ex emption of imported electrically driven and hybrid-engine vehicles; (iii) to ad opt a regulation on raising the customs fees for imported goods posing threat to environment; (iv) to establish a system aimed at increasing customs officers' capacity for international conventions compliance. 7.6. Foreign Trade Activities Regulation Foreign Trade Activities The goal is to develop and improve re gulation framework of foreign trade cooperation in order to facili tate the trade turnover grow th and FDI inflow to the country's economy. Background. Kyrgyzstan implements its most economically beneficial cooperation with countries of the Comm onwealth of Independent States and Eurasian Economi c Community and within the Shanghai cooperation Organization. Advantages of coopera tion with CIS and EAC members are obvious. CIS countries citizens may enter, leave, travel thr ough, move within and stay in other CIS countries withou t visa regardless of their permanent residence. Certain CIS countries sign ed intergovernmental agreements on streamlined citizenship procedures. Th e Commonwealth addresses issues such as provision of CIS countries citizens with equal access to mainstream education institutions, mutual recognition of educ ation certificates, and free emergency medical assistance. No customs fees are charged on goo ds produced in CIS countries and transferred through the Commonwealth's in ternal borders. Goods produced by the CIS countries become more compet itive than those from third countries thanks to lower transaction costs. The opportunity of collaborative use of the CIS countries' innovative technologies and intellectual resource s capacities also plays a significant role. Close nei ghborhood of countries such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan contributed to intensive development of trade relationships and included them in the category of Kyrgyzstan's major trade partners. Conference of the Central Asia Regional Economic Co-operation (CAREC), a program of the Asian Dev elopment Bank aime d at implementing projects in power generation, transport and trade sectors also contributes to substantial improvement of the CA region competitive ness and better integration into the world economic community. Thus, the project \"Energy Sector Rehabilitation in the Kyrgyz Republi c\" has been designed to improve the reliability of national and re gional power grids of Ky rgyzstan and Central Asia as a whole, and the \"Energy Sector Improvement\" project will contribute to increase the level of energy security, re gional power generation efficiency and output, and reliability of power grids in the Kyrgyz Republic and Central Asia. The CAREC transport projects contribu te to regional trade turnover growth. Particularly, the pr oject for rehabilitation of the national motor road Osh 107 - Batken - Isfana is aimed at providi ng reliable access to social services and economic activities for people and better road network management in the country. The CAREC Transport Corridor Pr oject will increase the regional trade turnover, particularly between Kyrgyzstan and China. The CAREC Project for Improvement of the Regional Motor Road Corridor will allow reduci ng transportation costs, contribute to regional cooperation between the CA countries, a nd improve access to regional markets and social services for people living along the corridor. The regional power project CASA 1000 is quite promising for the Kyrgyzst an's economy as it is designed to facilitate power export from Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan to Pakistan and Afghanistan, increase the reliability of national and region al power grids of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia, improve energy security and efficiency, and increase regional trade turnover. Major foreign trade issue is the incomplete regulat ion base for investment and financial cooperation and avoidance of double taxation failing to meet present day requirements. The priority area for the period up to 2017 in addressing the issue will be activation of integration processes within CIS, SCO, EurAsEC, and Cooperation Council of Turkic-Speaking States (CCTSS ) through efficient development of integration relationships. The following meas ures have been planned: (i) to hold negotiations and consultatio ns to coordinate inte rgovernmental agreement versions on establishment of development funds of SCO and CCTSS; (ii) to hold negotiations and consultatio ns to coordinate inte rgovernmental agreement versions on investment pr omotion and protection a nd avoidance of double taxation in the CCTSS countries. Foreign Trade Relations The goal is to build competitive export capacity for steady economic growth. Background. In 2008-2012, the Kyrgyz Republic government's foreign trade policy measures were aimed at streamlining the trade procedures. A number of regulations were adopted nece ssary for foreign trade procedures reduction and optimization. Taking into account the high level of in tegration in mutual trade with the Customs Union member countries, with its 45 % share in the KG's total foreign trade turnover, the Kyrgyz Republic gove rnment decided to initiate negotiations on joining the Customs Union and Common Econom ic Space in 2011. The activity plan for joining the Customs Un ion has already been coordinated. In 2012, according to the Plan, Kyrgyzstan car ried out analysis of its laws for compliance with the Customs Union's cont ractual legal framework that included comparison of custom fee obligations of Kyrgyzstan and Russia in WTO, as well as package of regulations and intern ational treaties. The goal of the Plan is 108 to prepare the road map for Kyrgyzstan to join the Customs Union's contractual legal framework. Kyrgyzstan, although not a CU member , can feel the union's influence on trade. The CU countries apply various cust oms tariff and non-tariff restrictions in their mutual trade with the Kyrgyz Republic and toughe n customs procedures on its outside borders. In case of harmonization with the CU's common customs tariff (CCT), the Kyrgyz Republic's current customs ta riff should be increased. Negotiations are expected within WTO to alter the Kyrgyz Republic's customs tariff obligations. Prices for goods importe d from China are likely to grow significantly as customs fees will be applied to them based on their value and not their weigh as it is practiced curre ntly. Customs fees increase and the toughening of customs control will lead to reduced re-export from China and, respectively, reduced tax revenues from wholesale markets. Tax revenue decrease due to reduced import will to some extent be compensated by increased customs fees. Ther e is a risk that, at initial stage, domestic market will suffer deficit of goods and raw materials (food and raw materials necessary for production) as domestic products will be exported without limitations. When in the CU, th e Kyrgyz Republic will not be able to apply any protective measures against goods from other CU countries, therefore there is a risk that domestic goods will not be able to compete on domestic market. Advantages of joining the CU and C ES include the following: (i) abolition of formalities, fees and customs control on the CU internal borders and freedom of transit will ensure reduction of co sts incurred by impor ters/exporters and facilitate trade; (ii) pos itive impetus and border trad e development previously constrained by customs control; (iii) bor der communities wi ll be able to buy goods on the neighboring country area with no mandatory standards; (iv) other strategic goods and energy carriers will be supplied within communities without any export and import fees which is pa rticularly important for Kyrgyzstan. Particular significance is given to the CU countries on the railroad transportation common market, uniform approach to rate fixing without separation of export and import tariffs, and development of a uniform technical regulation system. Another advantage for manufacturers is products export clearance with the use of uniform CU ce rtificates, without follow-up checks and control within the CU area. Kyrgyzstan membership in CU and CES will ensure free migration policy without quotas and lim itations which will enable migrant workers to enjoy all social rights pr ovided to host countries citizens. The following major issues will impe de foreign trade development: (i) change of conditions for fo reign trade with main regi onal trade partners due to the CU establishment and development; (ii) reduced re-export activities and attractiveness of country's wholesale ma rkets; (iii) adopted agreements and requirements for technical regulation an d sanitary, veterinary and phytosanitary measures applied in the CU have complicated the access to the CU markets for Kyrgyzstan's products. Re strictions introduced by neighboring countries for 109 export of goods demand for which is met by import in Kyrgyzstan lead to their rise in price on domestic market. Trade development has also been ha mpered by lack of well-developed government export support system incl uding weak infrastructure, as well as incompleteness of export and import documents completion procedures, and limited capacity of testing lab base. Increased import competition forces domestic manufacturers to compete w ith imported goods that have price advantages. There is gr owing export of raw mate rials used by domestic manufacturers due to higher prices for such material s in neighboring countries. Priority areas. To address the above mentioned issues and achieve the set goal, the following priority areas will be implemented: (i) the country's export capacity development; (ii) facilitating ne gotiations on and procedures of the Kyrgyz Republic's joining the CU and CE S; (iii) of the Kyrgyz Republic's regulations and the CU documents related to technical regulation. The following objectives will be addres sed within the priority area of the country's export capacity deve lopment; (i) to create basi s for the achievement of more attractive foreign trad e regime; and (ii) to ra ise competitiveness of goods and responsibility of manuf acturers for their products. The first objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop the Kyrgyz Republic Export Dev elopment Strategy that will as well cover the export of fresh and processed fr uits and vegetables, with focus on 'green' products; (ii) to obtain the st atus of beneficiary of the universal preferences system for the Kyrgyz Rep ublic; (iii) to deve lop a regulation on extending the range of functions of th e Foreign Trade One-Stop-Shop Center state-owned company of the Ministry of Economy; (iv) to hol d negotiations with international organizations on issues of international standards application, and discuss application of international an d regional standards as those Kyrgyz national with major trad e and economy partners. The second objective that is to raise competitiveness of goods and responsibility of manufacturers for their pr oducts will be ad dressed through the following measures: (i) to develop and implement procedur es of entering the international agreements on technical regulation and standardization in order to apply international and regional st andards as those national in the country, as well as to apply CU technical regulations; (ii) to ensure harmonization of nati onal standards with international standards and rules; (iii) to enter agreement with major trade partners with respect to mutual recognition of standard compliance assessment findings; (iv) to reequip the testing lab and re ference base with donor funding attraction; (v) to modify laws on promotion of economic entities implementing product quality and safety management. 110 The second priority area will be focu sed on the objective of facilitating negotiations on and procedur es of the Kyrgyz Republic 's joining the CU and CES through the following measures: (i) to elaborate positions for negot iations with the CU and WTO; (ii) to assess and economic effects of joining th e CU for the Kyrgyz Republic; (iii) to develop the road map fo r joining the CU and CES; (iv) to implement information and c onsultation activities for private sector with respect to the issues of access to the CU countries' markets. The third priority area will be fo cused on addressing the objective of ensuring harmonization of the Kyrgyz Republic's regulations and the CU documents related to technical regul ation through the following specific measures: (i) to elaborate positions for negotiati ons with the CU in line with agreements within the WTO; (ii) to apply internationa l and regional standard s as those national. 7.7. Forming the Innovative Activities System for the Economy Competitiveness Improvement The goal is to create an effective syst em of intellectual property protection and innovative activities for ec onomy development and improved competitiveness. Background. Kyrgyzstan holds the 127th position among 144 countries in the index of innovation use in business18, and the indicator continues lowering (122nd position in 2008). 48 industrial companies developed and introduced process innovations in the country in 201019 (1,8 % of the total number of companies). The most intensive innovative activities took place in 2010 in food production (13 companies), power, gas and water generation and distribution (8), metallurgy and finished metal items manufacturing (5), other nonmetal mineral products manufacturing (4), and pulp-and-paper production and printing (4). The most of innovation- active companies are concentrated in Bishkek (89.5 %) and Chui oblast (9.0 %). All innovative products are produced by private companies. The majo r part of innovative acti vities is associated with technology purchase. Thus, in 2010, 32 companies purchased machinery and equipment with their expenditures amoun ting to 55 million soms. Companies' own resources reach 91.6 % and other funding sources 8.4 % of the total amount of expenditure associated with pr ocess, marketing and organizational innovations. Expenditures for process innovations in industry are quite insignificant and incommensurable with the country economy's actual need in upgrade of 18WEF: World Economic Forum: Global Competitiveness Report 2012-2013. 19NSC data on the Kyrgyz Republic industry 2006-2010 Bishkek 2011. 111 main production assets and expansion of totally new and competitive product range. Development of innovative activities in the country is constrained by the following set of factors: (i) lack of an adequate system for innovative activities institutional support and development; scie nce low productivit y and isolation from industry; (ii) poor level of training and deficit of engineering and technical staff and other innovation deve lopment specialists; (iii) country's economy insensitivity to wards innovations with reliance on imported innovations in form of equipment and technologies; (iv) lack of an effective technol ogy commercialization system. Currently, the country's innovation s upport and introduction system is in process of formation. In this view, actual development trends and nature of the country's industrial compan ies innovative activities shoul d be taken into account as they are mostly focused on process up grade issues rather than on innovative product development based on research and designs. Innovations development is an expensive process that requires credit support or borrowed funding. Underdevelope d venture financing, lack of own resources for research, as well as lack of govern ment system for new technologies support and introduction ma ke the innovation development process inaccessible for the c ountry's companies. Taking into account the current situation and available resources, Kyrgyzstan should focus on development of system and mechanisms for search, borrowing, adaptation and distribution of technologies which are efficient and innovative for domestic companies. Priority areas. Taking into account the issues mentioned above, the priority areas will be as follows: (i) to facilitate development of innovative activities and use of intellectual property assets; (ii) to build a system contributing to effective decision making in innovative activities development includi ng power saving and power efficient technologies; (iii) to improve the regulation framework of innovative activities and protection of intellect ual property rights; (iv) to facilitate training and profess ional development and raise public awareness of the role and significance of intellectual pr operty and innovative activities. The priority area of facilitating th e development of innovative activities and use of intellectual property assets w ill be focused on the addressing of the objective of developing a system for searc h, selection and reco rd of innovative power saving and efficient technologies. The Kyrgyz Republic intends to im plement the followi ng measures to address the objective: (i) to develop criteria for inclusion of technologies in the list of those innovative, power saving and efficient; 112 (ii) to create a register of innova tive, power savi ng and efficient technologies; (iii) to create a list/regis ter of industry needs and designs; (iv) to provide services of innovativ e technologies search, selection and marketing. The second priority area that is to bui ld a system contri buting to effective decision making in innovative activities development includi ng power saving and power efficient technologies will be focused on addressing the objective of developing a system for decision making and c oordination of innovative policy implementation within the Kyrgyz Republic Governme nt Innovations Council. The objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to carry out a comprehensive analys is of innovative activities in the country that contribute to the economy formation; (ii) to develop and present proposal s on adaptation of national innovative development statistic indicato rs to international standards; (iii) to adopt a program for innova tion development and technology transfer. The priority area of improving the regulation framework of innovative activities and protection of intellectua l property rights will be focused on addressing the objective of improving the innovative ac tivities and intellectual property protection legislative base. Th e Kyrgyz Republic government intends to address the objective thro ugh the following measures: (i) to modify laws on intellect ual property protection; (ii) to amend the Kyrgyz Republic laws including tax and customs codes to ensure support for companies applying innovative, power saving and efficient technologies. The priority area of facilitating trai ning and professional development and raising public awareness of the role and significance of intellectual property and innovative activities will be focused on th e objective of establishing a training center to share innovations and know ledge within the Kyrgyzpatent's Technology and Innovations Support Cent er (TISC). The objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to arrange for the TISC specialists international training in areas such as innovation management, market ing and assessment and patent and information search and review; (ii) to develop the TISC curricul a and training programs; (iii) to conduct innovation development training for target audience and other concerned parties; (iv) to arrange yearly competitions of innovative concepts for the innovation development promotion; (v) to conduct surveys and intervi ews among wide public and business communities for the innovation policy per ception in order to adjust innovation policies; (vi) to implement informa tion and education activ ities related to green innovations. 113 VIII. DEVELOPMENT OF STRAT EGIC ECONOMY SECTORS 8.1. Energy Sector The goal is to ensure the Kyrgyz Republic energy security and develop export capacity. Background. The Kyrgyz Republic has sufficient reserve of fuel and power resources. Estimated water-power capacity of 225 large and medium-size rivers is 18.5 million kW and over 140 billion kW/h. Power is generated by 7 hydroelectric power plants and 2 heat po wer pants of national scale and 11 small hydroelectric plants with various owners hip, with total installed capacity of 3,784 MW and available output of 3,315 MW . 93 % of power is generated from renewable sources, mostly from water resources. Power generation output increased by 28 % in the last five years and reached 15.3 billion kW/h. Power export increased almost 3 times and reached 1.6 billion kW/h. The specific weight of consumption by po pulation has grown by 8 per cent points and reached 65 % due to increased prices for other energy carriers such as gas and coal and co untry's population growth by 4 %. The specific weight of othe r consumers is as follows: industry - 12 %; budget organizations - 10 %; service sector - 12 %; agriculture - 1 % (pump stations). Most of the generated power is consumed in northern Kyrgyzstan. In fall and winter season, power s upply system face overload due to 3 times increased consumption by populati on comparing to summer period. The emergency shutdown does not seem the best way to regulate the power distribution. Consistent activities have been implemented to reduce power losses. Outcomes of such activities have proven effective, with losses reduced from 31.6 % to 21.2 % in 2008-2012. Power consumption per capita increased by 4 % in the last five years and reached 2.28 tons of equivalent fuel pe r 1,000 people that exceeds the European countries' figures 6 times. Although the GDP power intensity in current market prices has been reduced by 49 % to 43,300 kW/h per 1 million soms in the last five years it exceeds the Europ ean countries' figures 10 times. The Kyrgyz Republic's energy sector has been facing numerous problems for several years. The energy sector's budget did not decrease in the last five years and amounts to more than 2 bill ion soms per year, and this cuts its capacity for stable functioning and main assets upgrade. As a result, the existing power supply services system is based on fixed socially oriented rates for population in amount of 0.70 soms per kW/h while total power production cost that covers generation, transfer ad distribution is 1.16 soms per kW/h. Domestic consumer s have no stimuli for power economy. Consumers with different income leve l pay for power supply based on single rate, regardless of consumption volume. Imbalanced tariff policy reduces the necessary level of power companies' revenues and impe des attraction of 114 investment for the energy sector devel opment. Electric power sale revenues subsidize the heat power generation. For the purpose of better targeted service provision and benefit optimization, monthly monetary compen sation was introduced in 2010 for 25 categories of citizens instead of benef its including those for electricity. The benefits monetization has ma de social benefits expenditure open and targeted. Replacement of benefits with monetary compensati on has provided additional material support to families. The country spends about 1.5 billion soms per year as total amount of the national budget expenditure for the monetary compensation instead of benefits. For 164 thousand power consum ers living in difficult and disadvantageous natural and climate mountainous conditions and remote areas compensation was provided in amount of 50 % for electricity use for domestic purposes, within the following consumpti on limits: 100 kW/h in summer, May 1 to October 1, and 220 kW/h in winter time, October 1 to May 1. Annual amount of such compensations paid from the national budget is 117 million soms. For the purpose of social support for pensioners, 83 % of them (532 thousand), in addition to their basic pe nsions, receive monthly compensation for electricity in amount of 200 soms from th e country's budget, amounting in total to 1,8 billion soms. The energy sector assets are 50 % to 70 % worn out putting the industry's stable operation under high risk and leading to the growing number of breakdowns and power equipment fail ures under season peak overloads. The problem of unstable power supply in winter time due to supply of up to 40 % of consumed power through the CA united power grid has not been addressed in full. Disturbed gas supply lead to the growing number of emergencies in the energy sector, increased public tension, which further affect people's health. One of the key operational issues is the energy se ctor's non-transparent management. Adequate le vel of interchange and payments has not been achieved. Activities of the Department fo r Fuel and Energy Complex Regulation depend on political factors. Reforms resulte d in reorganization of Kyrgyzenergo joint-stock company did not resolve issues related to quality and uninterrupted power supply, upgrade and restructuri ng of existing 35-0.4 kV lines and substations, and improvem ent of power accounting in distribution networks. Power generation largely depends on hydropower engineering. Country's own fuel and power resources and non- conventional renewa ble energy sources have not been utilized to sufficient degree, with onl y 1 % of power generated by renewable energy sources. Generation capacity defici t will reach 1,5 billion kW/h in the midterm prospective, by 2017, as new production facilities are launched including those in mining industry and GDP grows to 586.6 billion soms, with account of the GDP power intensity in cu rrent market values. Power economy is one of the key factor s of energy sector efficiency. The major source of heat losses in the c ountry includes residential and public buildings heated by 60 % of all fuel a nd energy resources. Power consumption 115 figures in this segment exceed those of Eu ropean countries more than 5 times. For the country in general, the re al energy saving capacity through the improvement of residentia l and public buildings ener gy efficiency is 4 to 5 billion kW/h. Based on the goal set and issues highlighted, the energy sector development policy will be focused on the four priority areas: (i) improvement of the energy sect or development regulation; (ii) creating conditions for energy saving; (iii) renewable energy sources development; (iv) energy sector sustainable deve lopment through low-carbon energy and compliance with environm ental safety standards. The following objectives will be addre ssed within the first priority area: (i) to achieve regulating agency 's independent status; (ii) to improve financial and economic stability of the energy sector companies; (iii) to improve efficiency of co rporate management in energy companies; (iv) to improve transparency and account ability in the energy sector. The first objective will be addressed through the following objectives: (i) to pass the law on amendments to the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Electric Power Industry in order to establish new rules of energy sector government regulation; (ii) to have the regulating agency a nd licensees sign agreements on pre- license and post-license obligations of energy sector entities; (iii) to establish a universal settlements center. To address the objective of impr ovement of financial and economic stability of the energy sector companies (the second objective), the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to implement the following: (i) to approve a midterm ta riff policy for electric and heat power for 2014-2017; (ii) to approve the program of targ eted social support for domestic consumers, with the end us er rate change for 2014-2017. To address the third objective that is to improve efficiency of corporate management in energy companies, th e Kyrgyz Republic government has planned the following activities: (i) to hold open and transparent co mpetitions for senior positions; (ii) to analyze and assess the existin g model of the energy sector management; (iii) to approve a regulation based on the assessment findings of further reforming the energy sector management model. The following measures have been plan ned to address the fourth objective that is to improve transparency and accountability in th e energy sector: (i) to develop and introduce a new design of the government information resource (website) integra ting information on key decisions of government authorities regarding fuel and energy complex, and main outcomes 116 of energy companies' economic and administrative activities; (ii) to have the Kyrgyz Republic Mini stry of Energy and Industry and energy companies' executive bodies sign operating agreements. The second priority area that is rela ted to creating conditions for energy saving will be focused on addressing the following objectives: (i) to provide for institutional devel opment of a single body for energy saving policy implementation; (ii) to ensure energy saving promotion. The address the first objective, the Kyrgyz Republic go vernment intends to implement the following measures: (i) to analyze the existing system of cooperation between government bodies in regulating energy saving issues; (ii) to develop a regulation on a si ngle body for energy saving policy implementation. The following measures will be implemented to address the second objective that is related to energy saving promotion: (i) to develop and introduce electric power rates based on established social consumption standards; (ii) to analyze potential i nvestment projects for securing support from the UN international program \"Sustainab le Energy for All\" and for greenhouse gas reduction mechanisms in order to ass ess energy saving capacity in various economy sectors; (iii) to approve a comprehensive energy saving program; (iv) to develop and launch a single ener gy saving information portal to inform power user s on energy saving benefits and up-to-date technologies. Main objectives of the third priority area that is related to renewable energy sources development include the following: (i) to increase the renewable energy sources share in the country's energy balance; (ii) to develop small hydropower facilities. The first objective measures will incl ude the following: (i) to develop and introduce a mechanism for tariff co mpensation in power generation using renewable energy sources; (ii) to deve lop the Kyrgyz Republic wind, sun and biogas atlas. To address the second objective that is to develop small hydropower plants by 2017, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to implement the following: (i) to develop 2017 small hydropower industry development concept taking into account inclusion of small hydropower plants construction in every oblast in the regional development plan; (ii) to hold an investment tender fo r construction of four small hydropower plants as a part of an EBRD project. The fourth priority area will be focused on the following objectives: (i) to satisfy economy's need in energy and ach ieve the country's energy independence; 117 (ii) to improve power supply stability a nd ensure reliable record of generated and distributed power; (iii) to provide the country's fuel and power comp lex with professional staff. As a part of addressing the first objec tive, measures have been planned to implement large-scale national projects: (i) construction of Da tka 500 kV power line and 220 kV power line in southern Kyrgyzstan; (ii) construction of Datka - Kemin 500 kV power line and Kemin 500 kV substation; (iii) construction of Kamba r-Ata hydropower plant 1; (iv) construction of four small hydropower plants; (v) construction of Verkhne-Naryns ky hydroelectric power chain (4 plants); (vi) commissioning of the second hydraulic unit of Kambar-Ata hydropower plant 2; (vii) CASA 1000 project works continuation; (viii) seeking investments for feasib ility study of Kara-Keche heat power plant with coal gasification option.

Agriculture Development The goal is to facilitate productio n growth, product quality improvement and country's food security achievement. 118 Background. Agriculture is the country 's one of leading economy sector both in added value scale and number of people employed. In 2012, the sector's share in GDP was 17.5 %, with 31 % of employed population. However, the sector's annual average gross added valu e growth is substantially behind the relevant figures for the country, 2.1 % against 3.2 % in 20 01-2012. The average wage in agriculture is lowest comp aring to other economy sectors. The agriculture development government regulation is mostly aimed at ensuring current activities and allocatio n of the sector's government support resources. The management institutions structure includes all necessary activity areas however the capacity of each one of them is low due to limited funding. The sector lacks highly qualified staff and has accumulated system problems that require reforms. The first problem category is associated with implications of agricultural land reform implemented after 1991. The pr inciple of social justice put in the basis of the land reform led to excess ive land lot partition. The agricultural sector is currently represented by more than 334,000 farms with average arable area of only 2.7 hectares including 1.9 hectares of irrigated area. This has become a barrier for agricultural producers' production capacity growth. Institutions facilitating land lots cons olidation do not work. Arable lands are being reduced due to land transforma tion and exclusion from agricultural turnover due to degradation. Works ai med at land fertility recovery has been carried out not quite effectively. The second problem category is associ ated with limited access of rural producers to government ser vices, logistic and fina ncial resources. These problems are aggravated by the government body structure inability to meet needs of agricultural produc tion arrangement. Formation of private structures to provide services is lagging. The current level of arable land ir rigation and funding of the existing irrigation system repairs and rehabilit ation works do not allow appropriately providing agricultural produc tion with water resources. The sector fails to address the challenge of providing a high-l evel protection for animals. Problems of agricultural production certifica tion have not been resolved. Seed and pedigree stock quality is low. The country does not produce fertilizers. The volume of fertilizers brought to soil decreases yearly. All this negatively impacts crop capacity and cattle breeding productivity. Notwithstanding the measures applied, the access of rural producers to financial resources and agricultural m achinery is limited. Finance and credit organizations operating in ru ral areas are unable to meet even medium need in funding. The third problem category is associat ed with difficulties in agricultural products sale and poor level of their processing by domestic processing companies. Agricultural fresh or proces sed products are supplied to consumer markets by producers, intermediate comp anies, processers and others not bound by any long-term contractual relations . The government efforts to establish cooperation of agriculture with processi ng industry and trade and value chain 119 failed. As a result, the added value generated along the chain of product suppliers is distributed unfairly, with rural producers' interests infringed upon most. Priority areas. The agriculture development will concentrate on the following priority areas: (i) development of efficient systems of agriculture management and staff training, as well as prerequisites for agricultural production concentration; (ii) facilitating the agricultural produc tion and agricultural products export; (iii) providing services to agricultural production; (iv) improvement of efficiency of wate r and land resources rational use. The first priority area that is related to development of efficient systems of agriculture management and staff tr aining, as well as prerequisites for agricultural production concentration will be focused on addressing the following objectives: (i) to improve the ag riculture sector management and staff training systems; (ii) to create pr erequisites for cooperation and cluster development and product quality improvement. The following measures will be implemen ted to address the first objective: (i) functional analysis of activities of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, with account of objectives of the Kyrgyz Republic National Strategy for Sustainable Development and this Program; (ii) formation of the ministry's optimal structure. The following activities will be implem ented to create a stable system of staff training and retraini ng for rural producers: (i) situation analysis of the agricultural professions labor market; (ii) placement of public or der for staff training based on demand for specific number of specialists in va rious areas, order fo r training methods development, and research and development; (iii) development of farmer traini ng and retraining and faculty professional development programs. The following regulations will be de veloped and adopted to address the second objective: (i) on strengthening of ownership pr otection in agricultural land market transactions; (ii) on government cadastre assessme nt of agricultural lands; (iii) on methodological recommenda tions for the assessment. The following measures will be implemented to enlarge farms and consolidate them into cooperatives: (i) proposals will be prepared on modi fication of the Ky rgyz Republic Land Code with respect to the use of go vernment agricultural lands, particularly for their exchange to land lots as a part of consolidation, provision of degraded lands to private ownership for cultivation, and providing the right to limited use of lands other than those within border areas to both the Kyrgyz Republic's and foreign citizens; 120 (ii) provision will be approved regarding the procedure of the government agricultural lands exchange to private lands for consolidation. The following activities will be implemented for cooperation development: (i) the agricultural cooperative de velopment government program will be approved; (ii) amendments will be approved to regulation framework ensuring protection of property of potential coopera tive relations parties, as well as a set of tax and other economic measures to promote cooperative development in agriculture; (iii) training program will be develope d for the cooperative sector, training provided to professional staff, and information and education activities package implemented; (iv) provision will be developed rega rding priority support for rural producers owning or managing substantia l areas or livestock (approximately at least 100 hectares of land for plant growing and at l east 500 sheep or 300 bovine animals for cattle breeding). The CDS and cluster development will be supported as follows: (i) agriculture CDS and cluster development program will be developed; (ii) methods of CDS and cluster form ation in agriculture will be developed, as well as mechanism of gove rnment-private part nership and public purchase applications as an instrume nt for agricultural CDS and cluster development support; (iii) a regulation will be approved regarding government support (logistics, training) for CDS and cluste r formation and development through the support of innovative cluster infrastruct ure development (incubators, technology parks , etc.), and formati on and introduction of import ant cluster institutions (partnership, corporate culture, responsibility, etc.). To develop and strengthen labs fo r the assessment of product safety parameters and improve the product certification pr ocedure, the following regulations will be adopted: (i) on establishment of and funding m echanism for an up-to-date lab unit for agricultural products and food safety parameter assessment; (ii) on opening of product certification la bs to improve access of rural producers to services. The second priority area that is to facilitate agricultural production and export growth will be focused on the following objectives: (i) development of large-scale agroin dustrial complex production and export; (ii) processing industry development; (iii) organic agricultural production development. To address the first objective, th e following set of measures will be implemented to develop cooperative, clusters and enlarged farms: 121 (i) support will be provided for est ablishment of prospective cooperatives (\"growth spots\") in each region through the government-private partnership mechanism; (ii) activities will be implemented to launch agricultural clusters; (iii) priority support will be provided to rural producers owning or managing large areas and livestock (approxi mately at least 100 hectares of land for plant growing and at least 500 sh eep or 300 bovine animals for cattle breeding). The following steps will be made to expand the geographic area of agricultural export: (i) a set of measures will be approved to support the agroindustrial complex products promotio n on foreign markets; (ii) agreements will be achieved with regional state administrations in Russia and Kazakhstan for agricultu ral export from the Kyrgyz Republic. The second objective that is related to processing industry development will be addressed through the following activities: (i) agricultural product processing technical regulations will be approved; (ii) regulations will be approved to en sure funding for direct government support for processing industry (forage pr oduction, meat and milk processing, product preserving, etc.), with the use of government-private partnership principles or provision of subsidies for credit s and machinery lease. The following steps will be taken to address the third objective that is related to organic agricultural production (OAP) development: (i) the OAP Development Action Plan and the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Organic Agricultural Produ ction will be approved; (ii) organic agricultural production technical regulation will be approved; (iii) regulation will be approved to establish a funding mechanism for certification centers in order to ensure compliance check; (iv) a set of measures will be approve d to support the development of technologies for organic plant-growing and dairy and meat production at all process stages; (v) a regulation will be approved regarding implementation and funding of direct support for fertilizers biological preparations production with the use of government-private partnershi p mechanism, as well as technical and financial assistance; (vi) a regulation will be approved re garding implementation of and funding for the development of organi c agricultural production added value chains and pilot clusters in plan t-growing and cattle breeding, through mechanisms of government-private pa rtnership, technical and financial assistance, as well as through the suppor t for \"organic aima k\" establishment. The third priority area that is to provide agricultural production with services and market infrastructure will be focused on the following objectives: (i) to improve quality and range of services for agriculture, and create 122 prerequisites for technical and technological upgrade of agricultural production; (ii) to establish an adva nced market infrastructur e for the agroindustrial complex.

Food Security and Nutrition Quality The goal is to provide all citizens wi th access to sufficient quantity of food products that includes ensuring food av ailability, efficien t use and stability. Background. Issues of food security are regulated by the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Food Security and a li mited set of regulations. The following 9 types of food were se t as those basic for assessment of food security level (the Kyrgyz Repub lic government decree No. 138 of March 3, 2009): (i) bread and cereal products; (ii) potatoes; (iii) fruits and berries; (iv) vegetables and cucurbitaceous; (v) sugar; (vi) vegetable oil; (vii) milk and milk products; (viii) meat and meat products; (ix) eggs. 126 The existing institutiona l mechanism regulating fo od security issues does not ensure proper interdepartmental cooperation. With weakening capacity of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Agricult ure and Irrigation, key ministries and agencies have almost excluded foods security issues from their agenda. The Kyrgyz Republic government is una ble to adequately influence the situation with unjustified gr owth of prices for socia lly important food products due to the lack of an efficient government supervision system to ensure antimonopoly laws compliance. The count ry has no government system for monitoring and early warni ng of food price growth. Funding for grain purchase for the govern ment material reserve compliant with laws is not planned at the initial st age. Actual funding is provided based on real budget capacity and leftover principle. Food security is considered ensure d by law if the government material reserve level allows covering at least 90 -day need of socially vulnerable groups in basic food products. Howe ver, the government fails to meet this legislative norm year by year due to budget limitations. Furthermore, the government materi al reserve range and accumulation standards are chronically outdated and require update. Therefore, the current logistic resource management system is unable to satis fy all needs in food, not only by quantity, but also by the quality a nd range of the stored products. No uniform standard and reserve renewa l regulation have been developed. The supervision of food products saf ety and compliance with technical requirements is poor posing threat to country populati on health. Extension of the Kyrgyz Republic's foreign trade relations hips facilitated import of a wide range of agricultural fresh and processed pr oducts. The share of GM and infringing goods, some of which cause direct harm to health or do not have qualities indicated on the package, is growing. Kyrgyzstan has no veterinary, sanitary, food and diagnostic labs accredited in compliance with national and international standards. In this view, no food is examined for GMO, radiation, and antibiotic residues. At the same time, the main food pro ducts self-sufficiency level remains low. The domestic market sufficiency was as follows in 2012: cereal products - 46.7 %, vegetable oil - 31 %, sugar - 12 %, eggs - 38 %, fru its and berries - 18 %, meat - 37 %. The country only achieve d self-sufficiency with food security product such as potatoes (120 %), milk - (112.0 %), and vegetable (125 %). The low food self-sufficiency level inevitably leads to high import reliance. In accordance with the food security commitments undertaken by Kyrgyzstan under the Rome Declaration, the recommended security level should be not more than 16 % of imported prod ucts in the overall consumption. The actual specific weight of import in th e domestic market volume was as follows in 2012: flour - 45.7 %, meat - 26.2 %, sugar - 85 %, and ve getable oil - 65 %. In case of further global food problems aggravation, incomplete food self- sufficiency within the count ry and potential barriers for import may pose a real threat to Kyrgyzstan food market th at is usually accompanied by uncontrolled inflation growth and growing social strain. 127 Efficient and systemic resolution of food security issues in the country require reforms of the government institu tions regulating food security aspects including the following: (i) establishment of a new coordination mechanism; (ii) effective legislation; (iii) human resource capacity development; (iv) access to reliable information for veri fied policy decision making. The government regulation system re form will take the country to a secure food level. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Strategy, such level concept is based on the following four principles: (i) food availability; (ii) accessibility; (iii) ef ficient use that suggests food products quality and safety; and (iv) stability. Based on the goal set and issues highli ghted, the main priority area 2013- 2017 will be the government regulation syst em reform with respect to food security that, according to the above conceptual principles, will focus on the following objectives with appropriate measures and activities. 1. Availability (i) To satisfy the country's internal demand of agricultural and processing industry products. The following measures have been planned for the objective: (i) to develop and introduce effectiv e mechanisms of government support allocation to rural producers to ensure output growth; (ii) to develop and launch new programs for plant-growi ng development and soil fe rtility increase; (iii) to use government regulation measures for the achievement of 25 % specific weight of agricultural products processing and 20 % export specific weight in the total output; (iv) to extend winter wheat sown areas to 300,000 hectares per year; (v) to develop and introdu ce mechanisms for rehabilitating and strengthening the selection and breeding activ ities; (vi) to develop and start the implementation of the Fo od and Processing Indus try Development Program 2017; (vii) to arrange trai ning on advanced methods of agricultural business running; (viii) to develop and propose to the Kyrgyz Republic government recommendations on establishment of a ri sk insurance system for agricultural production. To ensure timely allocation and sp ending of commodity stocks. This objective suggests the following measures: (i) to increase food stock (flour, grain) in the government material reserve to the level approved by laws; (ii) to develop and approve new ra nges and standards of st ocks accumulation in the government material reserve; (iii) to launch a new grai n quality certification lab; (iv) to introduce the government purcha se system for food purchase from local producers in order to re duce reliance on import. 2. Availability Antimonopoly regulation and governme nt pricing policy improvement. This objective will be addr essed through the following measures; (i) to develop and introduce a continuous system fo r government regul ation of domestic market consumer prices; (ii) to adopt a regulation on tightening the antimonopoly law compliance control; (iii) to develop and introduce a 128 mechanism of interventions aimed at bread market price stabilization under roaring demand. The objective of improving the govern ment finance management policy efficiency to ensure food security will be addressed th rough the following measures: (i) to provide tim ely funding for spring and fall field works; (ii) to provide timely funding to the government material reserve for grain stocking in volume set by laws; (iii) to develop a regulation framework for government purchase system's efficient functioning; (i v) to maintain a financial environment facilitating food security provision for a ll; (v) to introduce and efficiently operate an electronic purchase system. 3. Use To ensure government control of domestic and imported agricultural products safety. This objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to ensure government c ontrol of complian ce with rules and requirements of seed and pl anting stock postharvest processing and storage; (ii) to organize research and review of biol ogical, toxicological and environmental regulations on application of pesticides and agrochemicals safe for people and environment; (iii) to monitor and fore cast phytosanitary and agrochemical situation; (iv) to ensure government control of compliance with norms and regulations in export, impor t and transit of goods subject to sanitary, veterinary and phytosanitary control at bonded ware houses; (v) to create a government control system for the quality of grai n and its processing products purchased, delivered and loaded to the government material reserve or other economic entities regardless of ownership. (ii) To ensure accessibility of safe food products. The following measures have been planned to address the objective: (i) to form a system of government epidemiologic control and preventive activities for prompt confinement and elimination of food poisoning outburst s; (ii) to develop and introduce a mechanism securing guaranteed adequate access to safe basic food products; (iii) to run systematic public awareness cam paigns to foster balanced nutrition patterns in population; (iv) to introd uce a continuous mechanism of animal product veterinary and sani tary expert examination in manufacturing and sale; (v) to adopt a regulation on toughening th e rules of plant products market-based examination and ensuring food products safety. 4. Stability To ensure food security for the sake of macroeconomic stability. This objective will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop and introduce new instruments of achieving the macroeconomic st ability; (ii) to develop a continuous syst em for monitoring and eval uation of the food price change impact on inflation rate; (iii) to maintain a macroeconomic environment that facilitates ensuring the food security; (iv) to maintain food price stability through the monetary and cr edit regulation instruments. The policy of measures for the provisi on of unprotected categories with food in accordance with norms will be aimed at: (i) introduction of social norms and guaranteed government minimum so cial standards; (ii) securing the 129 guaranteed income to provide access to sufficient food quantity in accordance with rational physiological norms; (iii) increase of the guaranteed minimum income. Improvement of quality and accessibil ity of information on food security. This objective will be addressed with direct involvement of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's project thro ugh the following measures: (i) to strengthen capacity of the Hydrometeorology Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Emergencies for preparation of annual crops harvest forecasts and food supply reviews; (ii) to provide assistance to th e Kyrgyz Republic National Statistics Committee in improvement of the food security statistics; (iii) to develop and launch an inform ation system for monitori ng and evaluation of food prices change with account of world trends and internal impact factors; (iv) to provide assistance to the Kyrgyz Repub lic Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation in development of the long-te rm Food Security Strategy. 8.4. Resource Saving Technologies for Processing Industry The goal is to increase the capac ity of processing companies by 20 % through the introduction of r esource saving technologies. Background. Currently, ther e is a trend of indust ry's growing input to economy witnessing the industry's capacity. Within the years of market reforms, certain industry sectors, despite diff icult economic conditions (two world financial crises), managed to reorient themselves and not only survive but also increase their output and, importantly, or ganize export. Indust ry remains one of the most important economy sectors wi th respect to budget assessments and export and definitely needs close attention and government support. Regular government bodies staff cu t has led to development and implementation of government policies in 13 branches of processing industry by two structural divisions, a nd therefore it is impossibl e to develop and implement government industry polic y in a proper way. At the same time, industry lacks information succession, young staff training system and government body's institutional memory. The processing industry is one of th e key economy sectors with its 75 % specific weight in the country's tota l industrial output. There were significant structural changes in the processing i ndustry in recent years, where some branches vanished and new ones emerge d. Thus, cotton and silk fabric manufacturing branches were lost, rubber footwear is produced instead of that leather, and production of machinery in cluding large electric devices, electric engines, metal cutting tools, balers, trucks and comp ression-type machines was practically ceased. There has been decrease in textil e production (ginned cotton and wool processing, silk production) due to obsolet e equipment, poor seed quality and, as a result, products non-competitiveness. Textile companies that used to provide all knitwear manufacturers w ith yarn and clothes are cu rrently idle or bankrupts. The market context led to developmen t of new demanded production, in 130 particular, processing of mineral resour ces (gold, glass, mercury, antimony), sewing industry, wood processi ng, printing, plastic items manufacturing, etc. Presently, the total range of i ndustrial production has five economy forming branches including four proces sing ones such as metallurgy, food processing, textile and sewing, manuf acturing of other nonmetal mineral products (construction materi als), and power generation as a separate industry branch. In total, the listed branches pr oduce over 90 % of industrial products. The largest share in the country's processing industry export structure is held by gold, food products and raw materials, sewing in dustry, and construction material production. Metallurgical production mostly repr esented by gold production has 44.5 % specific weight in industry. The indus try's leading compan ies include Kumtor Gold Company closed joint-stock comp any and branches of Kyrgyzaltyn open joint-stock company such as Combinat Makmalzoloto, Solton-Sary Mine, and Tereksai Mine. The measures for me tallurgy production development are described in the Mining Industry section. The sewing production has a high social significance for the country since the branch is socially oriented a nd resource consuming with respect to workforce use. According to the Nati onal Statistic Commit tee, the industry employs over 60,000 people20, with rural citizens as the major workforce and women as most of employees ensuring positive impact on gender balance. Main issues currently faced by proces sing industry companies include low resource efficiency and, particularly, high energy intensity. Outdated technologies and worn out assets incr ease resource consumption and reduce their use efficiency. The processing industry's equipment and technology deterioration rate is very high reaching 90 %. At the same time, the lack of finance resources for resource sa ving technologies introduction and improvement of processing industry compan ies resource efficiency remains one of the major obstacles fo r the industry. There is a need in export capacity increase with reduction of ba rriers for export, a swell as in specialist training system development and resource effici ent technologies introduction. Stable and predictable tax policy is important in midterm prospective, and so is the development of accessib le crediting vehicles. Priority areas for achieving the goa l include reduction of industry's energy consumption and establishment of a mechanism to promote introduction of resource saving technologies, appropr iate use of local workforce and minimization of envi ronmental impact. The following objectives will be addressed within these priority areas: (i) to raise the processing industry empl oyees' awareness of resource saving technologies; (ii) to develop standard instructions on industrial resource efficiency improvement; (iii) to analy ze and compare resour ce efficiency of other countries' similar industries; (iv) to establish an industry platform for discussions and resource efficiency practice exchange; (v) to carry out 20 For 2012. 131 awareness campaigns on advantages of energy efficient technologies and environment friendly production. To address the objective of establis hment of a mechanism to promote introduction of resource saving technolog ies, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to introduce preferences for se wing and textile companies employing resource saving technologies. The next priority area suggests increas e of the processing industry export capacity. To continue promotion of the sewing industry export, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to build a technopolis. This suggests the following steps: (i) to adopt a regulation on implementation the Clothing Technopolis project implementation in Chui oblast with its legal status identified; (ii) to provide feasibility study and complian ce with logistic, e nvironment and energy saving requirements; (iii) to build a syst em for training medium and senior level staff for sewing industry. On the meeting of Voenno-Antonovka village council (Sokuluk district, Chui oblast) held on October 11, 2012, the project of technopolis construction for sewing and textile pr oduction on 50 hectare ar ea was approved as an environmentally safe and feasible facility. According to preliminary estimates, the Technopolis will be able to include over 35 industrial facilities and provide 10,000 jobs. Such project is effective for diversification of industrial production and product sales market as able to serve as a model industrial zone employing up-to-date technologies not only in text ile and sewing production but also in other processing industry br anches. The project's su ccessful implementation will be ensured through preserving th e patent-based taxation in midterm prospects. The Kyrgyz Republic government inte nds to increase the export capacity through the following steps: (i) to estab lish a single logistic center within the Technopolis both for finished products export and raw and other materials import; (ii) to develop a st rategy to promote and protect the Made in Kyrgyzstan brand; (iii) to form a fl exible policy providing different customs fees for raw materials and readymade products. To ensure the priority industry su stainable development and increase resource efficiency through the reduction of the volume of products defected due to interrupted power supply, the Ky rgyz Republic govern ment intends to implement the following: (i) to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the Technopolis; (ii) to include the Technopoli s in the strategic companies list; (iii) to develop recommendati ons supported by best inte rnational practices of industry's resource saving t echnologies introduction, e fficient resource use, and waste minimization. To develop the construction materi als production export capacity and promote such products on the CU count ries' markets, the Kyrgyz Republic government intends to implement the following: (i) to develop and adopt regulations and protocol s on harmonizing the constr uction material safety technical regulations with requirements of the CU technical regulations; (ii) to apply an alternative fuel for cem ent production (Kant Cement Plant). 132 8.5. Mining Industry Development The goal is to achieve the mining i ndustry sustainable development with rational use of mineral reser ve capacity and environmenta l impact minimization. Background. Issues. Currently, re sponsibilities for development and implementation of the gove rnment subsurface use and control policies are divided between the following three au thorized government bodies: (i) the Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Economy developing the gover nment subsurface use policies; (ii) the Kyrgyz Republic Government Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources implementing the gove rnment subsurface use policies; (iii) the Kyrgyz Republic Government E nvironmental and I ndustrial Safety Inspectorate exercising control of envi ronmental and industrial safety. In general, such mechanism allo ws preventing corruption. There is a competition between responsible government authorities in implementing the government policy for mining industry regulation. In addition to the public administration authoriti es, local governance bodies and local communities also act as independent institu tions. As a result, there is a conflict of interests and an alarmi ng message to investors. The existing law requirements are often not enforced due to corr uption and institutional weakness of supervision and control bodies. Since neither the government no r domestic business have necessary financial, technical and human resources to explore most of deposits, currently, the country's mining industr y can only develop through th e attraction of foreign direct investments. With its substa ntial capacity for the mining industry development, new companies launching a nd employment provision, Kyrgyzstan is unable to implement such capacity to the full degree. Reasons for such situation are divers e and include the following: (i) the legal normative system regul ating subsurface use need s further improvements. Legislation provisions are neither coordi nated in different laws nor equal for different forms of government and inv estors relationships; (ii) government guarantees of investments payback re main low reducing the industry's investment attractiveness; (iii) the government regulation level is excessively high and promotes corruption; (iv) the country's investment attractiveness international rating positions are extr emely low; (v) procedures of providing land allotments for subsurface use and documenting are complicated and require extensive coordination and expert exam ination; (vi) the mining industry development is impeded by energy r esources limitations, the country's underdeveloped transport infrastructure, and professionals deficit; (vii) the government's unclear position and mineral developers irresponsibility have led to numerous trials which for a long tim e suspended the pro cess of licensing and mineral deposits exploration; (viii) the lack of norms regul ating relations of investors and local communities has led to conflicts between them; (ix) mining activities have been politicized, and there is a threat of some local communities turning into an independent political force uncontrollable by central government 133 and laws with respect to mineral deposit explorati on projects implementation; (x) uncontrolled use of natu ral resources and direct damage to environment. Notwithstanding the adoption of the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Subsurface in 1997, the mining sector has not been developing. The proc ess of new deposits exploration has been almost frozen. At the same time, all areas subject to licensing are used by minera l developers however they do not strive for mining and profit generation. There have been no significant achievements in new deposits discovery and exploration in th e country. Administrative regulation has not had any positive effect. The necessity is urgent to replace administrative regulation methods w ith those economic. In 2012, the Kyrgyz Republic government initiated a numb er of measures to reform the industry including the new Law on Subsurface and bylaws passed. In addition to the new Law on Subsurface, laws were p assed to introduce fees for retained license as an economic mechanism of subsu rface use regulation, and the procedure of providing land allo tments for mineral development was simplified. A new income tax was intr oduced for ore mining and processing companies engaged in extraction and sale of gold ore, concentrate and alloys and refined gold, and so was the \"s ilence-means-consen t\" mechanism for mining operations plan approval, etc. Furthermore, the subsurface use sector continues to face issues requiring balanced policy decisions, particularly , such as highly politicized local communities. Where this is the case, in spite of obvious benefits the mineral deposit development may give the local communities, there are evident rejection and, in some cases, direct conflicts with investors locally. The key issue here is the lack of balance between concerns of government, investors and local communities. To address the issue, appropriate rules should be developed within the existing laws. The mining sector's huma n resources capacity is quite low. Existing issues also include the following: (i) insu fficient professionalism of government employees and managers; (ii) qualified technical and ma nagerial staff deficit; (iii) insufficient young staff inflow; (iv) lack of staff succession; (v) incompetent specialists appointed to management; (vi) lack of internship programs for students at industr ial companies. Another issue is hardcopy storage of geological data and exploration and survey maps which may fu rther lead to destructi on of the entire geological archive. The data should be urge ntly saved on electronic media. Priority areas. Taking into acc ount the issues described above, the country's midterm policy will be focuse d on the following priority areas: (i) institutional strengthening and establishm ent of an effectiv e system for the mining industry government regulation; ( ii) increase of contribution to the country's socioeconomic de velopment and national bu dget replenishment with the environmental impact minimization. The following objectives will be addres sed within the first priority area: (i) to improve and implement subsurfa ce use laws through bylaws development; 134 (ii) to facilitate ensuring of licensing pr ocedures transparency via tenders and auctions; (iii) to carry out outreach activities for communities and local governance bodies to explain significance of investments in the mining industry for specific locality development; (iv) to improve and toughen control of appropriate use of mineral resources in the Kyrgyz Republic and counteract the use of wasteful and environmen tally harmful mining methods. The following measures will be implemented to address the first objective: (i) to develop midterm and long-term mining industry development strategy; (ii) to develop and adopt a regulation on EIA procedures for the mining industry facilities which will also regula te communities' rights to participation in EIA21 and full and timely information on planned activities; (iii) to develop and present a set of regulatio ns on control of appropria te natural resources use including (i) instructions on subsurface use and protection in development, conservation and liquidation of coal mining companies within the Kyrgyz Republic's coal deposit areas, (ii) instru ction on procedures of precious metals record and storage and uniform rules of subsurface protection in mineral development in the Kyrgyz Republic, (iii) oil and gas field development rules; (iv) methodological recommendations on technologies of gold sample preparation for gold concentration tests a nd rules of ore and concentrate testing during their exploration, extraction and processing in the Ky rgyz Republic, (v) rules of subsurface prot ection in non-metallic mi neral resources deposit development in Kyrgyzstan; (vi) rules of subsurface protection in auriferous gravel exploitation in the Kyrgyz Republic ; (vii) rules of subsurface protection in collecting and using subsurface fr esh and mineral water in the Kyrgyz Republic. The following measures will be im plemented to address the second objective that is to facilitate ensuring of licensing procedures transparency via tenders and auctions: (i) to adopt regul ations improving the tender and auction procedures by modifying the provision on pr ocedures and conditions of auctions and tenders for subsurface us e licenses; (ii) to provide media coverage of tender and auction procedures. The following measures have been pla nned for the third objective: (i) to form outreach workgroups for informa tion campaigns on reforms implemented and subsurface use novelties introduced; (ii) to design booklets and brochures informing on project significance, regi onal development and environmental aspects. The fourth objective that is related to improve and toughen control of appropriate use of minera l resources will be addressed through the following measures: (i) to develop and intro duce a transparent mechanism for the government's supervision and control fu nctions and toughe n requirements on compliance with national environmental re gulations with the participation of a civil sector representative; (ii) to pr ovide for inventory of requirements 21 Environmental impact assessment. 135 regarding import of machinery and proc ess equipment not us ed currently in developed countries. The second priority area that is rela ted to increase of contribution to the country's socioeconomic development with the environmental impact minimization will be focused on the follo wing objectives: (i) to increase the budget revenues through tax and non-tax proceeds, GDP growth, foreign direct investment attraction and mining indust ry diversification for the purpose of reducing the economic reliance on Kumtor project in 2013-2017; (ii) to reduce negative impact of mining companies on environment and implement systemic activities of government structures in cooperation with local governance bodies and mining companies administrations to prevent conflic ts with local communities; (iii) to ensure regi onal socioeconomic development. The following activities will be implem ented to address the objective: (i) to facilitate commissioning of the foll owing new large and medium-sized mineral deposits22 in u II, and Charvak area of Changyrtash oil field; (ii) to hold an open tender fo r the subsurface use licenses in order to commence Jerui and Togolok gold ore deposits in 2013- deve Solton-Sary and Terekkan gold ore deposits; (iv) to recover mineral reserve through FDI to the geological industry; (v) to stud y practices of small mineral deposit development in countries with de veloped small mining industry. The following measures will be im plemented to address the second objective: (i) to monitor regular repor ts on activities for local communities' social conditions improvement ; (i) government structures officials to take steps for preventing mining companies from environmental requirements breach, carry out regular inspections for comp liance with environmental laws and publish such inspections findings; (iii) lo cal governance bodies officials to carry out activities for informing their co mmunities on project implementation significance for regional development; (iv) to create new jobs in launched mines for regional development purposes and, as agreed upon with investors, purchase goods, works and services solely wi thin deposits location areas. 8.6. Construction Industry Development 22Development of these deposits and fields will allow increasing the gold production by 5-6 tons and, if full capacity is used, by 10-12 tons per year, and raising coal mining output to 1-1.5 tons. 136 The goal is to improve citizens' access to quake-proof homes in a favorable urbanized environment and en sure comfortable living and activities through the buildings' energy efficiency improvement. Background. Residential buildings commissioning rate somewhat increased in Kyrgyzstan in recent five years with 39.7 thousand apartments and individual homes of total area 3,995.9 thousand square meters commissioned. The average annual growth rate is 6. 5 %, however the residential houses commissioning rate is not mo re than 1 % of the existing housing stock and meets population's demand of housing to an insignificant degree. Lack of financial resources for housing purchase makes the accessible homes provision conditions development a priority task. The area's high seismicity poses specia l requirements for the country's construction industry. 80 % of commissi oned houses as aver age are represented by private buildings constructed at citizen s' expense and largely with the use of local, non-quake-proof and non-energy- saving construction materials and technologies. Settlements' long-term general lay outs have been drawn up without consideration of territorial planning an d urban zoning poli cies as the policy documents are only expect ed to be developed. Main buildings existing in the Kyrg yz Republic were constructed 30 to 60 years ago, with no consideration of energy saving aspects. Currently, such buildings are worn out and do not provide minimum sanitary and comfort conditions for living. In general for the country, power consumption by buildings, including electrical and heat po wer, gas and coal is 16 to 18.5 billion kW/h per year. Energy consum ption per square meter is 3 to 5 times higher than in the European Union countries and varies from 145 to 170 kW/h per square meter as average for the country, reachi ng 320 to 450 kW/h per square meter yearly in Bishkek. Energy saving, quake-proof and econom ically accessible construction is one of key mechanisms to move the c ountry towards sustainable development. Main issues containing this area developm ent include the lack of an institution to form the policy and ensure developmen t of appropriate legislation framework for the sector, weak professional trai ning of public administration staff and almost complete lack of public awaren ess with respect to the industry development goals and objectives in the sustainable development format. The objective of the industry transition to energy saving development path and consistent improvement of quake-proof home acces sibility will be addressed through the following steps: (i) establ ishment of an institutional structure ensuring policy development; (ii) le gislation framework improvement; (iii) development of capacity of professionals in the area of management, design and construction and innovative activities en suring reduction of energy consumption by new buildings by 30-40 % by 2017 against the current state; (iv) outreach activities.

Tourism Industry Development The goal is to facilitate formation of a stable and competitive tourist product with the preserving of cultu ral and historical sites and minimum negative impact on environment. 139 Background. The tourist services spec ific weight in GDP varied 3.7 % to 4.7 %23 in the last five year s. According to the Wo rld Tourism and Travel Council (WTTC), tourism provi ded jobs to 180 thousand people in 2012, i.e. 7.8 % of the total number of employed economy including those employed indirectly24. Tourists reception revenues reached $677.7 million25 in 2012 which was the highest figure in the la st five years. The nationa l budget tax revenues from tourist activities reached 96.1 million so ms in 2012 which was 2.1 times as less than in 2011. According to international experts, Ky rgyzstan only uses up to 15 % of its tourist capacity and this explains the tourism's insignificant share in GDP. According to WTTC, Kyrgyzstan holds the 103rd position in the index of tourism's direct input to GDP with its 3 percenta ge points while the world average figure is 5.2 percentage points26. Although tourism was many times declared a priority at national level it actually was either a responsibility of a low status agency (government agency) or an adjunct to various ministries (ministr ies of culture, indus try, sports, etc.). As a result, there is a lack of success ion, qualified staff with institutional memory and young staff training system. The tourism development has almost not been forecasted, the statistics base has been incomple te, and, the most important, the regulation fram ework has significant gaps. Incompleteness of the tourism industr y regulative framework and lack of a unified system for the classificatio n and standardization of collective accommodation facilities create barriers for the sector development and provision of the offered tour ist product quality guarantee. At the same time, the existing legislation requirements are often unfulfilled which is conditioned by co rruption and institu tional weakness of supervision and control bodies, first of all, with respect to compliance with fiscal laws requirements, and sani tary and epidemiologic, t echnical and environmental requirements. Such incompliance is primarily caused by requirements complexity, rare inspections, expensive compliance arrangements and a possibility to pay off 27. Existing administrative barrie rs also facilitate corruption schemes where, as an example, a potential investor is required to pass several jurisdiction authorities (village, distri ct, oblast, republic) to obtain a land allotment for a tourist facil ity. This is why informal ac tivities are widespread in tourism and budget assessment s are minimal and do not correspond to actual gross revenues. Another alarming issue is the fact that limited financial resources cause weakness of government services that c ould significantly ac celerate tourism sector development. Thus, the existi ng infrastructure (road and transport, 234,7 % in 2012, according to NSC. 24Travel&Tourism. Economic Impact 2013. Kyrgyzstan. WTTC publication. 25According to NSC. 26Travel&Tourism. Economic Impact 2013. Kyrgyzstan. WTTC publication. 272012 Survey on Informal Economy in the KR. Data related to all economy sectors and cover both legal entities and individual entrepreneurs. 140 information, engineering services) is w eakly developed, worn out and in many parts constructed with no account of tour ism development needs. In particular, this is why Kyrgyzstan does not use its advantageous lo cation along the Silk Road while, according to the UN World Tourism Organization, 27 % of international tourists are inter ested in tours along the route. Treatment facilities in the Issyk-Kul ar ea, particularly in towns such as Karakol, Cholpon-Ata and Balykchy, are scattered and worn out posing serious threat of pollution to the lake that is the country's main tourist resource. The country has not had precise data of its tourist and recreation capacity so far therefore limiting it s tourism investment capa city. The country did not assess its resort area natural recreation ca pacity in the last five years, and this may lead to excessive exploitation of natural resources and gradual degradation of the area ecosystem. Weak coordination between governme nt bodies, business community and education institution leads to poor leve l of tourist service and security. The international tourist market considers travels to Kyrgyzstan unsafe, and the extent of information on country's touris t services and produc ts and investment opportunities are quite limited. The poor environment management culture provokes inappropriate and exploitative treatment of tourist and recreation resources. Unawareness of local cultura l and historical resources and poor tourist reception culture in local commun ities affects the Kyrgyzstan's image of a country providing tourist services. Priority areas. Taking into account the above facts, th e country's midterm policy will be focuses on the following priority areas: (i) improvement of efficiency of the tourist industry governme nt regulation; (ii) assistance in tourist services diversification and quality improvement. The priority area related to improvement of effi ciency of the tourist industry government regul ation will be focused on th e following objectives: (i) to ensure institutional development of the government body responsible for the tourism sector development; (ii) to im prove regulation framework for tourism sustainable development; (iii) to improve tourist activities statistical recording and forecasting; (iv) to provide acc ess to reliable, attractive and quality information on traveling to Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz Republic government in tends to implement the following measures to address the fi rst objective: (i) to increase the capacity of the authorized body responsible for de velopment and implementation of the government tourism policy; (ii) to anal yze the existing system of cooperation between government structures directly or indirectly resp onsible for tourist activities control and regulatio n; (iii) to use the analys is findings as the basis for development of recommenda tions on changing the sy stem of government bodies cooperation in tourism area. The second objective will be addresse d through the following policy measures: (i) to develop and approve a range of tourism types; (ii) to approve a standardized method of tourist services re cording in accordan ce with the tourism types range; (iii) to develop and appr ove a unified government system for 141 classification and standardization of co llective accommodation facilities; (iv) to arrange for inventory of the tourism se ctor regulation framework in order to identify contradictions; (v) to prepar e and present recommendations for the improvement of the tourism sector regul ations; (vi) to de velop and approve a simplified procedure of provision and us e of land allotments for tourist facilities development and construction. To address the third objective that is to improve tourist activities statistical recording and forecasting, the Kyrg yz Republic government intends to implement the following measures: (i) to in troduce migrant cards; (ii) to specify the list and develop methodologies for collection and calcula tion of additional tourism sector indicators in accordance with methods applied by international organizations such as UNWTO and W TTC, and incorporate them to the statistical activities program; (iii) to develop the tourism sector development forecasting system linked to the governme nt forecasting system in the Kyrgyz Republic and procedures of the Kyrgyz Republic socioeconomic development forecasting28. To address the fourth objective that is to provide access to reliable, attractive and quality information on tr aveling to Kyrgyzstan, the Kyrgyz Republic government has planned the foll owing steps: (i) to develop and launch the unified information portal including information on accommodation facilities reservation, available tours, maps, tour organizer, tourists feedback, forums, etc.; (ii) to design and publish a nnually a catalog of ev ents that foreign tourists may be interested in; (iii) to design and publish printed information materials on the Kyrgyzstan's tourist resources oriented at specific target markets; (iv) to arrange for participa tion of domestic tourist companies in specialized tourist exhibitions and fa irs in Berlin, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Ekaterinburg, Almaty, Tokio, Madrid, etc.; (v) to purchase interactive information systems and install them in airports and at border crossing points. The following objectives will be addr essed as a part of the second priority area that is related to assi stance in tourist services diversification and quality improvement: (i) to upgrade the tourist infrastructure, based on government- private partnership as well; (ii) to facilitate tourist services diversification and quality improvement; (iii) to provid e for the Issyk-Kul lake ecosystem protection. The Kyrgyz Republic government inte nds to address the first objective through the following activities: (i) to assess road construction and reconstruction projects; (ii) to correct road construction and reconstruction projects for account of the tourism deve lopment concerns (roads to tourist facilities); (iii) to develop oblast and di strict 3-year programs (2015-2017) for the road infrastructure development (l avatories, service centers including catering, technical support an d medical assistance facilit ies, as well as signs and guideboards in Kyrgyz, Russian and Eng lish; (iv) to develop a co-financing vehicle (the Kyrgyz Republic governme nt and concerned tourism sector entity) 28Approved by the Kyrgyz Republic government No. 711 of November 11, 2011. 142 for construction of roads of oblast and district significance and other necessary infrastructure (power and water suppl y, waste management, waste water treatment) for the existing and projected tour ist facilities; (v) to design 2 tourist information centers (TIC); (vi) to hold negotiations on exclusion of national air carriers from the EU blacklist. The second objective that is to facilitate tourist services diversification and quality improvement will be addres sed by the Kyrgyz Republic government through the following policy measures: (i) to carry out a research and evaluation of the pilot oblast area to identify pot ential tourist zones through outsourcing; (ii) to develop a map of the pilot oblast's potential tourist z ones combined with the map of specially protected natura l areas and lands of mineral deposit exploration registered with the Kyrgyz Republic National Balance of Mineral Reserves; (iii) to prepare recommenda tions on amendments to the Kyrgyz Republic Land Code as to introduce a new land category that is the \"land with travel and recreational capacity\"; (iv) to develop and appr ove a methodology of assessing natural recreation capacity of existing and potential tourist and recreation zones; (v) to conduct at least two surveys, in 2015 and 2017, including interviews with tourists within target markets to identify their needs (accommodation, conditions, se rvices, leisure, habits, et c.); (vi) to develop and approve the Sector's Tourism and Hosp itality Qualification System; (vii) to develop and introduce nati onal education standard s in accordance with professional standards and the sector's tourism and hospitality qualification framework; (viii) to develop oblast and district 3-year programs (2015-2017) for solid waste disposal and utilization and waste water treatment; (ix) to carry out education and public awareness campaigns in regions to inform communities on specifics of tourism and recreation res ources (regional bra nd) and arrangement of local ethnic and cultural and historic al tours; (x) to develop and arrange courses to train local communities me mbers on local tourism business projects development and funding application pro cedures; (xi) to approve legislatively obligatory insurance of tourists visiting the Kyrgyz Republic. To address the third objective that is to provide for the Issyk-Kul lake ecosystem protection, the Kyrgyz Repu blic government suggests the following measures: (i) to include construction of centralized waste water treatment system in the Issyk-Kul coast general district layout29; (ii) to assess the natural recreation capacity of Issyk-Kul resort zone; (iii) to organize annual Issyk-Kul lake bottom cleaning within government and business partnership; (iv) to carry out a research in order to identify most challenging areas with respect to wetland complex conservation; (v) to create temporar y wildlife reserves (2 to 5 years) on the identified challenging areas, with a ppropriate nature management regime. 8.8. Transport Infrastructure Development 29The general layout development was planned for 2013 to be executed by Kurortturizm Research Institute of the Government Agency for Construction and Regional Development in accordance with the Parliamentary decree No. 1738-V of March 15, 2012. 143 The goal is to improve accessibility of and satisfy people's need in transportation services through the reduc tion of transport's harmful impact on environment. Background. The Kyrgyz Republic's transport infrastructure is represented by motor roads including the network of internal motor roads and international transport corridors, as well as by motor vehicles, railroad transport and aviation. Highways form a 34,000 km road network including 18,700 km of intercity roads and 15,300 km of roads in to wns, villages, agricultural, industrial and other companies, connecting the country's oblasts and districts and providing access to international transport corridors. Of the total 2,700 km of transport co rridors including the alternative road South to North, 1,400 km (50 %) have be en rehabilitated so far. Rehabilitation have also been completed on roads such as Bishkek - Osh (except Bishkek - Kara-Balta and Madaniyat - Jalal-Abad sections), Bishkek - Karamyk, Osh - Sarytash - Ir two sections of Taraz - Talas - Suusamyr road. Rehabilitation is in process on sections of international corridors Bishkek - Naryn - Torugart and Osh - Batken - Isfana. The agreement on the 3rd phase of Taraz - Talas - Suus amyr road rehabilitation is currently in process of ratification. Fe asibility study is discussed for the alternative South - North road. Another important issue of the country's economic se curity is ensuring its transport independence which requires c onstruction of bypass roads in border areas conjunction and detouring neighbori ng countries' areas. Currently, the Aigultash - Sogment - Tayan bypass road is under construction, and preparatory works are in process for construction of roads Bel - Sogot - Bojoi and Koktash - Aksai - Tamdyk and two bridges on Kulun du - Maksat road in Batken oblast. To ensure stable functioning of th e road sector, its reforms should be continued and include development of optimal road sector management structure, completed financing system pr oviding full funding for road repairs and maintenance within standard time frame, development and introduction of mechanisms of government-p rivate partnership and priv ate sector engagement in road construction and re habilitation, as well as introdu ction of consultancy and supervision. Taking into account difficult access to settlements, motor transport is a priority since it carries about 95 % of ca rgo and 97 % of pa ssengers. Figures of motor transport cargo and passenger carriag es that showed no dramatic drops in specific weight within the total carriag es structure in recent years witness the sector's stable development. The vehi cle stock is growi ng continuously. The number of vehicles that was 300,000 in 2 008 has increased more than 2.5 times and reached 735,000. More than a half of all vehicles in the country are more than 10 years old. Before 2009, there was a growing import of vehicles with service life more than 10 years which we re a source of air po llution to a higher degree comparing to those new. 144 In order to restrict the import of \"old er\" vehicles, rates of single customs fee and taxes were increased more than 11 times in 2008 for vehicles older than 13. That measure had a positive effect reduc ing the import of ve hicles older than 10 more than 4 times in 2 009. Furthermore, in 2012, there was a positive trend of decrease in import of vehicles olde r than 10 which made 46.3 % of the total number, against 93.4 % in 2008, and in creasing import of motorcars of operating age 5 to 10 years (50.8 %). The sector's issues include the vehi cle stock aging leading to pollutant emission growth including that of GHG, in sufficient coverage of the country's settlements by route communication, and in sufficiently developed legislation framework for the motor transpor t uniform policy implementation. The Kyrgyzstan's railroad that is 424.6 km long is represented by two geographically separated sections and characterized by absence of railroad transit. The northern section that is 323.4 km long connects Balykchy and Lugovaya (Kazakhstan), and the southern section is 101.2 km long. Analysis of railroad cargo and passenger carriages in recent years showed increase in cargo turnover and decrease in passenger carriag e. The country's figures of cargo and passenger turnover are low comparing to other transport types due to lack of railroad communication across the countr y area. Issues faced by the railroad sector include separated sections in th e country's northern and southern parts and underdeveloped transit capacities due to railroa d transport and communication dead-end. Civil aviation is one of the fastest, most comfortable and, in some instances, practically irreplaceable type of transport in the country taking into account the mountainous landscape. Ther e was an increase in passenger carriages by 17 % as average in the ye ars 2008 through 2012. The same period dynamics included cargo carriage decrea se by 2 % as average in 2011 and increase to 22 % in 2012. There are 4 international airports (Manas, Osh, Issyk- Kul and the Ky rgyz Republic. At present, regular international flights are only operated from Manas and Osh airports. Regular domestic flights are operated to Osh, Is fana, Batken and Jal al-Abad airports. There are no regular flights to the othe r domestic airports due to lack of passenger traffic flow. Issues faced by the civil aviation sect or include infrast ructure of Manas international airport (terminal, ground handling facilities, etc.) insufficiently developed for transformation into an international transit airport/hub. Infrastructure and specifications (runway, taxiways, aprons and other airdrome components, as well as terminal building, ground handling facilities) of some international and all domestic airports do not meet present day conditions. Vast majority of air navigation equipment ope rated in airports and throughout the country is outdated. The transport infrastructure and envi ronment priority areas will include the following: 145 Priority area 1: Improvement of dom estic road network and ensuring of the country's transport independence will be achieved through the addressing of the following objectives: The first objective that is to repa ir and support public roads will be addressed through the following measur es: (i) development of annual work plans and design documents for public ro ad repairs and maintenance; (ii) arrangement of at least 150 km of bitumi nous concrete pavement per year; (iii) arrangement of at least 300 km pf no-skid surface per year; (iv) purchase of road construction machinery with further prov ision to road servicing companies. The second objective that is to reform the road sector will be addressed through the following measures: (i) appr oval of activities plan for the country's road sector reform; (ii) regulations mo dification; (iii) ins titutional reforms in road sector. The objective of domestic road netw ork improvement s uggests facilitation of alternative paid highway construc tion. The following measures will be implemented to address the objective: (i) to initiate the Kyrgyz Republic law on paid roads; (ii) to work with donors and internationa l organization to attract potential investors for paid highway construction. Ensuring the country's transport inde pendence suggests rehabilitation and construction of road det ouring neighboring countries' areas. To address the objective, works will be continued to construct roads Aigultash - Sogment - Tayan, Bel - Sogot - Bojoi and Koktas h - Aksai - Aktatyr and two bridges on Kulundu - Maksat road. Within the second priority area, intern ational transport corridors should be rehabilitated in order to provide access to regional commodity and service markets (Annex 5). The following steps will be taken to ad dress the objective: (i) to prepare international corridor rehabilitation feasibility study and construction documents, coordinate a nd hold negotiations with donors on attracting investments, and enter agreements; (ii) to rehabilitate international transport corridors in accord ance with agreements and cont racts on corrid ors Bishkek Naryn Batken - Isfana, Suusamyr - Talas - Taraz (75 to 105 km) and Karakol - Tyup - Kegen; to prepare and implement project for rehabilitation of Bishkek - Balykchy hi ghways (147 to 172 km), Bishkek - Osh (phase 4), and Batken - Is fana - Hudjand (to the Tajik istan border). Cooperation with international donors is provided w ith respect to feasibility study funding and the North - South alternative road construction commencement. The third priority area that is relate d to facilitation of motor transport sustainable development services with harmful emission minimization suggests the objective of minimizing emission of pollutants including GHG by motor transport. The objective will be addressed through the fo llowing measures: (i) to adopt regulations aimed at reducing GHG emission by motor transport; (ii) to conduct regular roundtables fo r better public awareness of activities to minimize GHG emission by motor transport. 146 The following measures will be im plemented to address the second objective that is to develop bus route network: (i) to adopt regulations on motorcar passenger traffi c; (ii) to launch new communication within the country's settlements; (iii) to arrange tenders for sel ecting bus route operators. The fourth priority area is related to development of th e country's transit capacity. It includes the objective of pr omotion of the China - Kyrgyzstan - Uzbekistan railroad project for the tran sit capacity development. The following steps will be taken to addr ess the objective: (i) to a dopt working documents for the feasibility study, review that fo r compliance with national planning standards and submit proposals on the railroad constructi on to the Kyrgyz Republic government; (ii) to conduct ne gotiations with potential investors and make decisions on issues of technical standards de termining railroad gage, as well as on the project financi ng; (iii) to coordinate and adopt agreements; (iv) to provide for the China - Kyrgyzstan - Uzbekistan railroad construction commencement. Another objective in the country's transit capacity development will be related to connection of the northern and southern railroad communication sections. The following activities will be implemented to address the objective: (i) to conduct negotiations with internat ional institutions and other organizations with respect to financing of the feasib ility study for the construction of a branch railway to connect the country's northern a nd southern parts; (ii) to prepare the railway feasibility study subject to environmental standard requirements following the commencement of the China - Kyrgyzstan - Uzbekistan railroad construction; (iii) to im plement activities for the id entification of funding sources for the north - s outh railway construction. The fifth priority area is related to en suring flight safety, international and domestic air traffic expansion and civil aviation sustainable development. This suggests the objective of the Kyrgyz Re public air transport transit capacity increase. The objective will be addressed th rough the following activities: (i) to prepare a plan of Manas international airport development and transformation into an international transit airport / air transport hub; (ii) to prepare the plan's feasibility study. The following measures will be implem ented to address the objective of international and domestic air traffic development: (i) to develop/update feasibility studies of Osh an d Issyk-Kul international ai rports reconstruction and raise investments for their reconstruction and upgrade; (ii) to develop domestic airports reconstruction plan and fe asibility study and accomplish their reconstruction; (iii) to am end regulations in order to facilitate promotion of import of up-to-date aircrafts and components and refresh the Kyrgyz Republic's airlines' aircraft fleet. The following measures will be impl emented to address the objective of upgrade of air navigation equipment for th e national air traffic service system: (i) to purchase and upgrade air navigati on equipment for the air traffic service system; (ii) to complete construction of control tower in Manas airport. 147 Communication Development, Inform atization and Introduction of Electronic Public Administration Background. New telecommunication serv ices are introduced all over the Kyrgyz Republic. The number of Internet users reached 3.2 m illion in 2012. The number of mobile communication s ubscribers reached 6.3 million (113 connections per 100 residents). The mob ile communication market moves from qualitative development to quantitative le vel of subscriber acquisition. As a result, prices for mobile communicat ion operators' services are among those lowest in the CIS countries. In ac cordance with the International Telecommunication Union's digital plan, the country should complete the p digital broadcasting introduction process by June 17, 2015. In this view, the Kyrgyz Republic government adopted the Digital Broadcasting Introduction Program and commenced construction of th e digital TV broadcast network. The current society informatization processes set higher requirements for the quality and efficiency of telecommunication infr astructure as an information transport medium. As a part of Digital Future project, construction of fiber optic transmission highway completed by the end of 2012, with installation of necessary equipment for broadband data transmission. The total highway length in the country is 2,444 km. The postal communication market is represented by the state-owned company Kyrgyzpochtas y and six commercia l post operators. The widest range of services in the coun try is provided by Kyrgyzpochtasy with its most branched network consisting of 923 post offices all over the country. Although the postal communi cation bears significant social load by providing services to wide population of the coun try, the Kyrgyzpochtasy gross revenue increased 4.3 times in 2012 comparing to 2003 and reached 506.9 million soms. At the same, the IT development area and communication sector are facing numerous issues including th e following: (i) weak IT development processes in government sector, lack of electronic interdepartmental interaction and mechanisms for integration of government information systems and resources, and use of diverse technologica l solutions by agencies impeding the introduction of electronic government; (ii) the country's government bodies practically do not provide government and municipal services in electronic format; (iii) incomplete coverage of the country area by di gital broadcasting; current state of TV and radio broadcas ting in rural areas does fails to meet present technical requirements; (iv) uneven telecommunication infrastructure development throughout the country's re gions; (v) poor level of postal services automation and weak development of postal communication infrastructure. To address the above listed issues, the country should actively continue construction and development of commu nication infrastructure and ensure introduction of the electronic governme nt system for the purpose of efficient provision of government and municipa l services in electronic format. Sustainable development of informa tion and communication services will be implemented through the following pr iority areas: (i) introduction of the Kyrgyz Republic electronic government system; (ii) transition to digital 148 broadcasting; (iii) provisi on of optic fiber data transmission highway to country's regions; (iv) improvement of services quality and broadening of the post offices services range throughout the Kyrgyz Republic; (v) ensuring environmental and information sustainab ility with the use of IT technologies; (vi) ensuring efficient use of frequencies range to develop competitive communication market. Introduction and devel opment of the Kyrgyz Republic electronic government infrastructure subject to set of measures and pr inciples of its architecture will be implemented throug h the following steps: (i) to develop concept of the electronic government de velopment and upgrad e and appropriate regulations (standards, rules, etc.) incl uding those for the country's information security; (ii) to develop and introduce electronic govern ment web portal; (iii) to create and integrated information center for data processing in order to ensure common access to information resources by integrating them; (iv) to create a common information environment of g overnment bodies as the base for the government broadband telecommunication network. The priority area of transition to digital broadcasting will address objectives of upgrade and replacement of analog transmitters and equipment and provision of quality broadcasting services to population with the use of energy saving technologies through the follow ing measures: (i) to build land-line networks for broadcasting of mandatory TV and radio ch annels with free access for population; (ii) to provide socially unp rotected groups with analog-to-digital converting equipment; (iii) to facilita te upgrade of government broadcasting companies infrastructure, including obl ast level companies, for transition to digital technologies; (iv) to adopt regulations on digital broadcasting introduction. All the country's regions w ill be covered by broadband telecommunication network as a result of implementati on of FOCL projects and installation of up-to-date equipment, and this will facilitate ensuring reliability, precision and promptness of informa tion delivery and increase of the data transmission volume and speed. The priority area of im provement of quality and ex tension of range of post office services throughout the country includes the objective of developing a postal and savings system on the basis of the state-owned company Kyrgyzpochtasy to provide postal financ ial and other services with coverage of remote communities. The following measu res have been planned for further development of Kyrgyzpochtasy: (i) to adopt regulations for institutional reforms; (ii) to upgrade fixed and produc tion assets; (iii) to extend the range of postal and banking, postal a nd finance and other serv ices using information technologies. To ensure environmental and informa tion sustainability using information technologies, the Green Economy and IT interactive web resource will be developed to be based on the electronic government web portal. The resource will include information on environmenta l sustainability and efficient disposal of outdated equipment, as well as elect ronic industry products , to raise public 149 awareness of issues related to drinking water supply, fresh air, resource and power saving and food security issues. The following objectives will be addressed within the priority area of ensuring efficient use of frequenc y range for the communication sector competitive market promotion: (i) to ex tend coverage of the radio monitoring system aimed at ensuring electromagne tic compatibility of radioelectronic equipment and high-frequenc y devices; (ii) to ensure international legal protection for the national radio frequency range; (iii) to raise the telecommunication market in vestment attractiveness through the guaranteed radio frequency range clarity. The following measures will be im plemented to address the above objectives: (i) to adopt the Program of the Radio Monitoring System Development in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2013-2017; (ii) to automate the radio frequency range control proc ess; (iii) to introdu ce national standards and technical regulations on new communicati on technologies; (iv) to introduce the national radio monitoring system cons isting of 11 fixed and 5 mobile radio monitoring stations by 2017. IX. THE POLICY OF REGIONS' TRANSITION TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT The goal is to provide the Kyrgyz Republic's regions with necessary capacity for transition to sustainable development. Background. Within the 22 years of i ndependence, Kyrgyzstan failed to develop regional policy and an eff ective local administration system. Administrative approach prevailed in public administration forming the image of local governance bodies as of the government machinery lower level. With only a few exceptions, local governance bodi es do not orient themselves at their own resources in local communities deve lopment, but continue practicing wait- and-see attitude. Previously developed regional and local communities development strategies included many priority issu es to ensure comprehensive regional development. However, they could not be implemented in context of lacking resources and insufficient coordination w ith sector policy makers, therefore the situation remains difficul t in local communities. Only 20 % of the total number of ayil aimaks (village districts) are not subsidized, while others' incomes are insufficient to cover their budget expenditure. This means that of most of the 22 activiti es of local significance specified by laws are implemented in limited volume and some are not implemented at all including provision of economic growth , drinking water supply, local roads support, etc. All this affects the access to and quality of government and municipal services provided to communities particul arly in small towns and villages where women, children and young people ar e the most vulnerable groups. 150 Other always urgent issu es faced by regions includ e the limited and worn out infrastructure. Local budgets do not allow launching and controlling development processes. Such a situ ation leads to social tension. The economic policy's sector principl es have not brought any structural shifts to regions' economies. Uneven al location of main industrial capacities aggravated disproportions in regional development where 77. 4 % of GDP are as usually formed by the gros s regional product of Bis hkek and Chuil, Jalal-Abad and Issyk-Kul oblasts. Such a situation causes specific problems faced by border communities turning them in to depressive areas. The current conditions including uneve n allocation of large industrial facilities among regions, sector and geogra phic specifics, inef ficient crediting system, etc., impede promotion of business activities in regions and, therefore, creation of sufficient number of jobs with fair wages. Thanks to a number of regulations adopted30, local governance began to develop in Kyrgyzstan and therefore play growingly significant role in support of activities of local communities and their members. At the same time, the existing norms fail to ensure necessary conditions for complete decentralization including that fiscal. The existing tax rules do not prom ote development of border and depressive areas, introduction of \"e nvironmentally clean\" technologies and provision of job opportunities. The policy of including regions in sustainable development requires the strengthening of regional and local gove rnment staff capaci ties, raising of government and municipal service pres tige, and elimination of gender prejudices. The current situation at local level is characterized by high staff turnover and lack of professionals and career opportunities for municipal employees. Gender disbalance in government struct ure staff at local level should be particularly noted. Serious implications of pe rsistent poverty in regi ons include internal and external migration. According to the empl oyment center of th e Kyrgyz Republic Ministry of Labor, Migration and Youth, at least 700,000 of Kyrgyzstan citizens were working abroad. The level of internal migration from rural to urban areas is also high particularly in Bishkek as the destination of 26 % of internal migrants. The active population outflow from regions to the capita l city and abroad leads to deficit of qualified specialists practical ly in all sectors, as well as to social orphanhood, border area de sertification, etc. Insufficient information on developm ent opportunities and efforts of central and local government to addres s urgent issues nationwide and locally causes mistrust in government a nd sense of social injustice. 30 The Kyrgyz Republic laws on local governance, on local councils deputies elections, on municipal service, on municipal ownership, on financial and economic fundamentals of local governance, on status of local council deputies, on access to information of central government and local governance bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic , etc. 151 Unresolved local development problems cause conflicts of investors and communities that should be resolved lo cally. Nine signific ant conflicts took place in 2012 impeding the growth of regions' economic capacity, such as conflicts related to Kumtor mine, Shamb esai field in Batken oblast, and those in Kemin, Chon-Alai and other districts. A nother example is the situation with the oil refinery in Kara-Balta. Regions sustainable development is one of the most important conditions for the country's sustainable developmen t. The following grounds for transition to sustainable development do exist and will be used to launch regional sustainable development processes: (i) th e key development resource is a human being, a country citizen with qualities a nd features such as flexible thinking, adaptability, tolerance, hard worki ng, initiative, education, nature comprehension, patriotism and freedom; (ii) political will for reforms, the country's government and sociopolitical groups committed to sustainable development principles; (iii) laws that, although with some reservations, allow launching regional sustainable developm ent processes; (iv) developing local governance and other administration ins titutions; (v) projects attractive for investors, not only those in energy and mini ng sectors; (vi) availability of certain regional products in demand on domestic and external markets able to form brands of oblasts, districts and single co mmunities; (vii) unique ecosystems, first of all those mountainous; c ountry's membership with various international organizations, etc. Transition of regions to sustainabl e development will include policy measures based on actual situation in regions, market sp ecialization, and interregional trade, with consideration of environmental, social and political features of each single region. Reliance on the above provides uni que opportunities to strengthen regions' capacities and fi nancial autonomy, retain environmental advantages, and ensure growing quality of living through the development of regional economies' priority areas as su stainable development engines. This program will consider changes that will accompany optimization of ayil aimaks and oblasts pr ovided by the Administra tive Territorial Reform Concept and will by 2017 allow considerin g a region as an economic unit with borders not necessarily fitting into those administrative. Priority areas. The set goal will be ac hieved through the following priority areas implementation: (i) effective admi nistration in transition to sustainable regional development; (ii) regional ec onomies development management; (iii) social development administration. The priority area of effective admini stration in transition to sustainable regional development will be focused on addressing th e following objectives: (i) to provide regulative conditions for the sustainable regional development administration; (ii) to strengthen regi onal capacity for sustainable development administration. The first objective that is to pr ovide regulative conditions for the sustainable regional devel opment administration will be addressed through the 152 following measures: (i) to amend the Kyrgyz Republic Law on Local Governance and other regulations for cl ear division of functions, powers and responsibilities of central government and local governance bodies; (ii) to develop and approve government and muni cipal services standards; (iii) to develop and approve norms of material, financial and other resources necessary to exercise delegated authorities; (iv) to develop a new transparent methods to estimate categorical and leve ling grants that will fac ilitate leveling of regions' budget support and ensuring better flexibi lity and financial autonomy of local governance bodies; (v) to introduce revenue charges for ecosystem services that will serve as an effectiv e economic mechanism that allows retaining and rationally using all functions of natura l capital and an economic incentive for employing renewable energy sources, power saving construction and environmental research. The second objective that is to stre ngthen regional capacity for sustainable development administration will be a ddressed through the following measures: (i) assessment of needs, restrictions, capacities and expectations of people in communities committing themselves to sust ainable development; (ii) to develop and pilot regional projects introducing community-based resource management linked to nationwide projects launched in all the country's regions; (iii) development of methodological recomme ndations on \"green\" jobs projection with an emphasis on women and young peopl e; (iv) to develop a module and arrange systematic training of governme nt and municipal employees on essence and methods of management of transiti on to sustainable development; (v) to introduce of midterm planning of lo cal budgets with consideration of introduction of project target development model considering each region's strengths and specifics, and to accumu late resource for implementation. Another government policy prior ity is the regions' economies development management that suggests the following objectives: (i) broader introduction of market principles in government regulation of regional development and regulative support for the use regional economies priority areas as engines for each region; (ii) coordination of c oncerns for regional economic development. The following measures will be implemented to address the first objective: (i) to carry out regional resea rch to identify the main conventional priority that would become a local develo pment engine; (ii) to develop (based on research findings) strategies for trans ition to sustainable development for each region, town or ayil aimak which will fix midterm and long-term sustainable development prospects and economic gr owth capacities; to coordinate implementation of sector programs thr ough the promotion of regional projects, creation of jobs within border and depress ive areas, special measures aimed at supporting communities and environmenta lly disadvantaged areas; to use competitive advantages of each oblast or di strict including green production in agricultural regions; (iii) to introduce project ta rget model of regional sustainable development based on resour ce capacity and climate specifics, with maximum inclusion of recognizable compe titive advantages of each oblast and 153 district both inside and outside the country, including green agricultural production; (iv) to speci fy legislation with respect to identification of responsibility of government struct ures and local governance bodies for coordination and mobilization of budget and non-budget fundi ng and thus allow concentrating resources to su pport priority sectors in re gions; (v) to establish local communities foundations in each region to support sustainable development projects implemented, as well, based on government-private partnership in each region; (vi) to pr ovide targeted resource support for job creation in border and depressive areas. The second objective that is to coordi nate concerns for regional economic development suggests the following meas ures: (i) to supplement laws with a norm raising the responsibility of loca l government administrations and local governance bodies for ensuring favorable conditions for hone st investors; (ii) to develop a regulation aimed at broader use of mediation in conflicts at various levels and first of all in communities wh ere investors operate; (iii) to carry out regular information campaigns in commun ities to ensure understanding of the sustainable development essence and im portance of civil participation in decision making process; (iv) to draft a standard Corporate Social Responsibility Code that will be offered to companies operating in regions. The third priority area in regions transition to sustainable development that is related to social developm ent administration in cludes the following objectives: (i) to broaden cooperation between government structures, local governance bodies and civil so ciety institution for the management of transition to sustainable development; (ii) to manage the improvement of Kyrgyzstan citizens' living conditions and quality. The objective of broadening th e cooperation between government structures, local governance bodies and civil society institution for the management of transition to sustaina ble development suggests the following measures: (i) to establish local sustaina ble development council s as an effective mechanism for coordination of mutually beneficial re lationships between local communities, business, and re gional and central governme nt structures; (ii) to develop and introduce procedures of m onitoring and evaluation of decisions related to sustainable development in order to provide recommendations on adjustments in the process of implem entation of the Pr ogram and regional strategies; (iii) to introdu ce practices of mandatory pu blic hearings at all the budgeting process stages in order to ensu re expenditure transp arency and public control of funds received by the local budget; (iv) to introduce the social services commissioning mechanism for lo cal governance bodies; (v) to develop a training module and train local administra tors and heads of organizations of all ownership types locally on sustainable deve lopment issues in or der to strengthen the regional development human resources capacity. The following measures will be impl emented to address the objective of managing the improvement of Kyrgyzst an citizens' living conditions and quality: (i) to develop the sustainable development map for each region that will reflect common issues in local commun ities development, specific problems 154 faced by certain groups (infants, preschool age ch ildren, school students, employed and unemployed young people, students, employable population, elderly, pensioners, PwDs, abandoned children, etc.), and initiatives of government, commercial and non-profit orga nizations to address such issues in order to ensure comprehensive approach to social development administration; (ii) to create a sustainable social deve lopment model for ea ch region that will include concepts, methods, designs, pro ducts, services, as well as research, organizational, marketing, financial, commercial and production activities and consider regional specifics; (iii) to develop a mechanis m to provide the widest possible range of government and muni cipal services within single facility, including the one-stop-shop princi ple and use of information and communication technologies that will im prove the access to and quality of services, minimize time and money spendi ng for citizens, and reduce conditions for corruption; (iv) to pr epare the list of municipal services and ensure such services standardization by each local governance body; (v) to introduce methods for local governance bodies perfo rmance outcome-based assessment. X. IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS 10.1. Process Management This program will be implemen ted through the development and execution of annual plans linked to the se t of national projects with budget and non-budget funding sources. Decisions of the Program adjustment s will be made based on findings of monitoring and evaluation of annua l Program plans implementation. The Program implementation process management suggest the following activities: (i) systematic review and ev aluation of annual plan implementation in order to make policy decisions regardi ng the Program implem entation progress; (ii) validity of necessary expenditures fo r implementation of projects and sector programs; (iii) identifica tion of potential funding sources for measures and investment projects; (iv) facilitatio n of sector programs and projects implementation; (v) creation of regul ation and administration environment required for successful Program implemen tation; (vi) launching the monitoring and evaluation system, identifying deviat ion from stated goals and objectives and reviewing its caus es, and making necessary adjustments. Main objectives to be addressed by government bodies will include the following: (i) to mobilize necessary budget funds; (ii) to coordinate borrowings attraction; (iii) to coordinate efforts of central, sector and regional government bodies; (iv) to create institu tional conditions for privat e sector and civil society to take part in the Kyrgyz Rep ublic government Program and Plan implementation; (v) to coordinate im plementation of sector programs and projects as a part of this Program. 10.2. Monitoring and Evaluation 155 Regular monitoring and eval uation of implementation of sector programs and projects included in this Program's pl an will be an effect ive instrument to assess the Program implem entation progress and allo w (i) making preceding decisions through adjustments in implemen tation process, and (ii) assessing their impact on the country's overall development. The annual Plan implementation sche dule (2013-2017) including indicator system coordinated with all stakeholders will be an integral part of monitoring and evaluation of progress in promotion of economic and social priorities set for years 2013-2017 within this Program . Indicators of the Plan and annual schedules monitoring and evaluation will include both qualitative and quantitative parame ters (Annex 3). The set of indicators for monitoring and evaluation will allow tracking and measuring the following: (i) interim results of the Program implementation with account of input; (ii) outcomes, through the set goals and objectives implementation indicators; (iii) nati onal indicators showing the Kyrgyz Republic's development dynamics at macr oeconomic level, including MDG. The Program implementation progress will be evaluated regularly based on the monitoring data. As a part of such evaluation, the progress achieved will be analyzed in detail and weaknesses and drawbacks in the Program's activities and projects implementation identifie d. Based on the evaluation findings, decisions will be made as to selecting al ternative options of further steps in the Program implementation, resources reallocation and optimal use, improvement of efforts coordination with the donor co mmunity, and better satisfaction of the community's expectations. 10.3. The Country's Needs in and Capaci ties for the Program Financing All available funding sources will be m obilized for the achievement of the Program goals. These will mostly be f unds provided by the country budget which will in midterm prospect be integr ated in the Plan of specific measures and projects within the set prioriti es, as well as the development budget supported by international donors as a pa rt of the Government Investment Program (GIP). To implement the Program effici ently, requirements for budget transparency should be toughened and exte nded. For this purpose, the shift from line-item budget to the program-based bud geting process will continue, with assessment of budget institutions expenditu re efficiency. Activities of agencies and their program funding will be closel y linked to the Plan measures policy. At the same time monitoring and as sessment of implementation of the Plan through the annual pl ans of the Kyrgyz Republic Government will become a real management tool d esigned to establish relations hip between the amount of funds provided and the degree of achievement of the goa ls set within the Plan. 156 Other important funding sources will include program credits and grants of international donors allocated for budget deficiency payment and technical assistance. The Plan implementation will also be supported by local budgets and private investments including those fo reign. Measures wi ll be implemented consistently to improve ac cess to bank and microfinan ce organization resources. Annex 4 \"The Kyrgyz Republic Sustainable Development Transition Program 2013-2017 Budget\" in cludes data of funding needs and capacities for the seven major sections: (i) areas and priorities of the Kyrgyz Republic's transition to sustainable development; (ii) addressing social objectives and issues; (iii) environment protection for ensuring sustainable development; (iv) sustainable economic growth and macr oeconomic stabilit y; (v) business environment and investment climate im provement; (vi) economy's strategic sectors development; (vii) policy of regions transition to sustainable development. The Plan also includes estimates of deficit funding, a finance gap that might be a subject of cons tructive cooperation with inte rnational donors as a part of development of the Joint Strategy fo r Donor Support to the Kyrgyz Republic 2017. The overall need in financing of th e Plan's activities, programs and projects amounts to some 791.8 billion so ms. Capacities are estimated at 419.2 billion soms as average. The part of the Plan not cove red by funding is 372.6 billion soms or 47.1 %. The need in funding is 320.8 billion soms from local sources (national budget) and 471.1 billion soms from ex ternal sources (development budget, private investments). Secure d financing for the Plan's activities, programs and projects will be 214.1 billion soms in gene ral (51.1 % of the total capacity). The donor community and private investors wi ll provide funding in amount of 205.1 billion soms (48.9 % of the total capacity). The current budgeting figures in the key priority breakdown are as follows: 1) The required amount of funding for areas and priorities of the Kyrgyz Republic's transition to sustainable de velopment is estima ted as 3.2 billion soms. The national budget and other f unding sources capacities amount to 113.6 million soms. Thus, this priority is c overed by funding in amount of 88.2 % of the estimated needs. The remaining part of funding in amount of 15.1 million soms should be raised from the national budget. 2) 236.0 billion soms are needed for th e financing of priorities aimed at addressing social objectives and issues within the Plan. Secured capacity amounts to 187.7 billion soms or 79.5 % of the estimated needs. About 20.5 of the funding required will be raised fr om the national budget and international donors. 3) The funding needed for the financing of priorities of environment protection for sustainable development am ounts to about 10 billion soms and is almost completely secured (9.6 billion soms, or 96.1 %). 157 4) Funding in amount of 36 million soms is needed to ensure sustainable economic growth and macroeconomic st ability. The secured funding amounts to 35.5 million soms, or 98.6 %. 5) Funding in amount of 3.2 billion so ms is needed for priorities of business environment and investment cl imate improvement. 48.3 % (1.5 bilion soms) of the needed funding have been secu red. More than a half of the needed amount should be raised from the national budget an d international donors. 6) The need in funding for prioriti es aimed at the economy's strategic sectors development amounts to 531.4 b illion soms. The na tional budget and other funding sources capacities amount to 216.4 billion soms, or 40.7 % of the estimated needs. The remaining part in amount of 315 billion soms should be raised through private investments and international donor funding. To attract direct investment in the priorities development, the Plan provides for activities aimed at the business environment and investment po licy improvement. 7) The government is w illing to allocate 2.2 billion soms (including funds from the development budget) for activit ies and projects aimed at regional development. This amount c overs 88.9 % of the funding needed for the area that has been estimated as 2.5 billion soms. 8) Funding in amount of 260.3 billion soms have been provided for the national budget's other expenditures31 in 2013-2017. As for figures related to the investme nt projects financing (Annex 5), the estimates are as follows: the total funding needed for 70 national projects implementation in 2013-2017 amounts to 354.8 billion soms. Capacities have been estimated as 187.6 billion soms on average. The part not covered by financing amounts to 167.2 bi llion soms, or 47.1 %. The Kyrgyz Republic governme nt is concerned about the fact that it is difficult to raise finances resources in full amount for the Program's goals and objectives and therefore expects support from international donors within the Joint Strategy for the Country Donor S upport (JSCDS) that will be closely linked to objectives of the Kyrgyz Republic government's Program 2017. Activities of the JSCDS partners will co mpletely fit the framework of the Program's major priority areas, while the principle of new debt growth containment will be that funda mental in attracting extern al support. It means that the international donor support will be mo stly provided to the country through the program grant system. 31(other expenditures including budgets of the Kyrgyz Repu blic parliament, president's staff, government staff, Chamber of Accounts, ombudsman's staff, and social infrastructure support) "}
