No. 3:20-cv-00865 -BAS -AHG OPINION Appeal from the United States District Court for the Southern District of California Cynthia A. Bashant, District Judge, Presiding Argued and Submitted January 15, 2021 Pasadena, California Before: Kim McLane Wardlaw and Richard R. Clifton, Circuit Judges, and FILED JAN 22 2021 MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK U.S. 01/22/2021, ID: DktEntry: 52-1, Page 1 of 2 Timothy Hillman,* District Judge. Opinion by Judge Wardlaw The State of California is facing its darkest hour in its fight against the COVID -19 pandemic , with case counts so high that intensive care unit capacity is at 0% in most of Southern California . To slow the surging community spread, California's public health and epidemiological experts have crafted a complex set of regulations that restrict various activities based on their risk of transmitting the disease and the projected toll on the state's health care system. Under this framework, California permits unlimited attendance at outdoor worship services and deem s clergy and faith -based streaming se rvices \"essential,\" but has temporarily halted all congregate indoor activities, including indoor religious services, within the most at-risk regions of the state . South Bay United Pentecostal Church challenged this restriction, along with others, under provisions of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States and California Constitution s. In its challenge brought under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, South Bay argues that the current restrictions on indoor services prohibit congregants' Free Exercise of their theology , which requires gathering indoors. The district * The Honorable Timothy Hillman, United States District Judge for the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 2 of 54 3 court made multiple findings of fact on an extensive evidentiary record and concluded that California's restrictions on indoor worship are narrowly tailored to meet its compelling\u2014and immediate \u2014state interest in stopping the community spread of the deadly coronavirus. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion, we affirm its denial of South Bay's request to enjoin California's temporary prohibition on indoor worship under the Regional Stay at Home Orde r and Tier 1 of the Blueprint. We also conclude that South Bay has not demonstrated a like lihood of success on the merits with respect to its challenge to California's state -wide ban on indoor singing and chanting . We cannot, however, conclude that the 100 - and 200 -person attendance caps on indoor worship under Tiers 2 and 3 of the Blueprint survive strict scrutiny .1 I. A. 1. California's Early Response to COVID- 19 In March 2020, ordinary life came to a grinding halt when the severe 1 We grant California's motion to take judicial notice of the updated county and state regulations and federal FAA regulations (ECF No. 26) because they are publicly available and neither party disputes their authenticity or accuracy. See Kater v. Church D owns Incorp., 886 F.3d 784, 788 n.3 (9th Cir. 2018) (taking judicial notice of government documents on government website) . We also grant the County of San Diego's unopposed motion to file a supplemental 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, respiratory syndrome coronavirus type -2 (\"COVID -19\") reached the United States and infections began popping u p across the country. Although much remains uncertain about this novel coronavirus, \"there is consensus among epidemiologists that the most common mode of transmission of [COVID -19] is from person to person, through respiratory particles such as those that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or projects his or her voice through speaking, singing, and other vocalization.\" The scientific community also largely agrees that the virus can be \"spread by individuals who are pre -symptomatic or asymptomatic ,\" i.e., difficult to identify, making it particularly \"difficult to control.\" But not all exposures to COVID -19 will caus e an infection; an infection will occur only when there is a sufficient dose of the virus, known as a \"viral load,\" to overcome the body's defenses. California, in consultation with public health experts, has enacted an evolving series of restrictions on various activities and sectors as its understan ding of the virus has improved and as the virus has spread throughout the state . On March 4, in an early attempt to limit the virus's reach in California, Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency , thereby allowing him to exercise extraordinar y executive powers . See Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 8625 -8627.5 . Two weeks later , within this authority, the Governor issued Executive Order N- 33- 20\u2014the first Stay at Home Order \u2014which required 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 4 of 54 5 State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors. \"2 California's Public Health Officer designated a list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers,\" which included \"[c]lergy for essential support and faith- based services that are provided through streaming or other technologies that support physical distancing and state public he alth guidelines. \" Accordingly, although the Stay at Home Order prohibited in -person worship services, the inclusion of clergy on the list of critical infrastructure workers allowed places of worship to conduct services by streaming them online . In late April, California released a four -stage \"Resilience Roadmap\" for reopening various sectors of the economy based on the risk that any given \"workplace\" posed in transmitting the virus. Stage 2 included \"lower -risk workplaces,\" such as curbside retail, manuf acturing, and dine -in restaurants. In Stage 3, \"higher -risk workplaces\" were permitted to reopen, which included religious services and movie theaters . The Roadmap also imposed guidelines that applied to all sectors (e.g., disinfecting protocols and phys ical distancing), as well as mandatory industry -specific guidance. On May 25, California issued industry- specific guidance for places of worship and providers of religious services. This 2 State of California , Executi ve Order N 54 6 initial guidance explained that \"[e]ven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a relatively higher risk for widespread transmission of the COVID -19 virus.\" Accordingly, in -person indoor worship services were limited to the lesser of 100 attendees or 25% of building capacity. On June 12 , as scientific understanding of the virus revealed that transmission risk dropped significantly outdoors, California remove d capacity restrictions on outdoor and drive -in religious services.3 In mid -June, California issued a state-wide manda te requiring face masks be worn in most public spaces, settings, and workplaces to reduce transmission risk . The scientific community largely agree s that wearing a face covering reduces \u2014but does not eliminate \u2014the risk that a person infected with COVID -19 wi ll infect others, and likely reduces the risk that the wearer will become infected by someone else. But the mask mandate and industry- specific guid ance proved incapable of preventing a summer spike in cases, and California once again began to tighten restrictions. In July, California prohibited singing and chanting at all indoor gatherings \u2014including places of worship , protests, schools, and restaurants\u2014 because when a person sings or ot herwise loudly vocalizes, droplets are expelled 3 Identical restrictions were placed on political protests. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 6 of 54 7 with greater force, travel farther, and thus present a greater danger of transmitting the virus. But despite these additional restrictions, cases continued to rise. On July 13, in light of the \"significant increase in the spread of COVID- 19,\" California issued an order reimposing many previously relaxed restrictions on indoor activities. In addition, counties that demonstrated \"concerning levels of disease transmission, hospitalizations , insufficient testing, or other critical epidemiological markers\" were placed on a \"County Monitoring List.\" Counties on this list were required to close certain indoor activities, including worship services, protests, gyms, and personal care services. Throughout the state, however, outdoor worship services continued without any restrictions on attendance or singing regardless of the individual county's case level. California's Current Restrictions: The Blueprint & Regional Stay at Home Order On August 28, 2020, California enacted the Blueprint for a Safer Economy (the \"Blueprint\"), which serves as the current framework underlying California's COVID -19 restrictions and which South Bay challenge s in this case . The Blueprint provides \"revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities\" based on (1) the prevalence of COVID-19 in the relevant county, and (2) an activity's calculated risk level. The Blueprint assigns each county to one of four tiers, ranging from Tier 1 (\"Widespread\") to Tier 4 7 of 54 8 risk in each county. In assessing to which tier a county belongs, California analyzes a county's case rate (number of individuals who have the virus per 100,000) and the test positivity rate. California r eevaluates each county's tier status on a weekly basis; as local conditions improve, counties are eligible to move to a less-restrictive t ier with more permissive policies. Within each tier, activities are subject to different restrictions based on the activity's risk level. Risk level is determined using seven objective criteria, including the ability to (1) accommodate face coverings at all time s; (2) allow for physical distancing ; (3) limit the duration of exposure ; (4) limit the amount of mixing of people from differing households and communit ies; (5) limit physical interactions ; (6) optimize ventilation ; and (7) limit activities known to increase spread such as shouting, singing, and heavy breathing. In any given tier, t he greater the transmission risk an activity poses, the greater the restrictions California imposes on it. The Blueprint permits higher capacity limits and attendance caps for activities that present lower transmission risks \u2014that is, do not involve a large number of people congregating in close proximity for sustained periods. Some sectors, such as retail and grocery stores, are permitted to operate with greater capacity limits indoors subject to the limitations imposed by statewide requirements (e.g., mask -wearing and social distancing) and industry-wide guidance (e.g., 9 carts ). The Blueprint imposes \"greater restrictions on congregate activities involving groups of people, and particularly indoor congregate activities, because, even after applying precautions required by general and industry-speci fic guidelines, they pose greater transmission risk. \" For example, indoor worship services, political protests, and movie theater attendance are prohibited in counties where COVID -19 is rampant (i.e., Tier 1), but permitted in Tier 2, 3, and 4 counties , albeit subject to limitations on attendance. Notably, however, these activities are permitted to operate outdoors without attendance limits regardless of a county's tier because \"transmission is significantly lower due to airflow and dissipation of any vir us particles.\" Certain activities\u2014 such as bars, live audience sports, and cardrooms\u2014 have been deemed to present so great a transmission risk that they are not permitted to reopen, even outdoors , until a county reaches Tier 3 or 4. The Blueprint's assessm ent of indoor worship services reflects the wide ly shared consensus in the scientific community that this activity present s an \"especially risk y type of public gathering.\" This is because worship services bring together (1) a large number of people from different households, (2) in the same place for an extended period of time, (3) to participate in a communal activity, which necessarily allows respiratory droplets exhaled by an infected, but Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 9 of 54 10 asymptomatic, individual to accumulate in doses large enough to infect others. Moreover, religious services often involve singing and chanting, which propel respiratory droplets farther thereby increasing transmission risk. In other words, indoor worship services \"involve large groups of people who are coming together for the purpose of being together. \" Initially, the Blueprint appeared effective; new COVID- 19 infection rates fell as summer came to a close . But in late October, case rates began to clim b, then to skyrocket exponentially . In an attempt to curb the rising case numbers, California 's Department of Public Health issued additional guidance pertaining to private gatherings.4 The guidance prohibited gatherings that involved more than three ho useholds and prohibited indoor private gatherings in Tier 1 counties. In all remaining Tiers, indoor gatherings are \"strongly discouraged.\" The guidance also prohibited \"singing, chanting, shouting, cheering, and similar activities\" at indoor gatherings. Recently, Southern California has been described as the epicenter of the global pandemic.5 From mid-November to mid -December, the number of new 4 Cal. Dep't of Pub.

The number of COVID- 19 patients hospital ized statewide grew from 777 on November 15 to 13,645 on December 14. In the time since this appeal was filed, there have been reports that paramedics in Los Angeles County have been instructed to conserve oxygen in treating patients and not to bring patients to the hospital who have little chance of survival.6 As of January 19, California became the first state to record more than three million cases.7 On January 21, 2021, the State recorded a record 736 deaths in a single day,8 bringing the total of Californians who have died from the virus to 35,004.9 Residents Have Been Infected by Coronavirus Since Pandemic Vegan, New Estimate Shows (Jan. 01- 14/one 2021); Reuters, For Los An geles -Area Ambulance Crews, the COVID -19 Calls Never Stop Jan. 21, 2021). 6 National Public Radio, LA County Paramedics Told Not To Transport Some Patients Wi th Low Chance of Survival (Jan. 21, 2021). 7 New York Times, California Coronavirus Map and Case Count , https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/california -coronavirus -cases.html (last updated Jan. 21, 2021). 8 L.A.

Following the October case surge , intensive care unit (\" ICU\") capacity decreased , then began to disappear in many counties . On December 3, in an attempt to prevent the \"overwhelm[ing of] the state's hospital system,\" California implemented the Regional Stay at Home Order.10 The new mandate divided the state into five hospital regions.11 For any region in which adult ICU bed capacity has fallen below 15% , the Regional Stay at Home Order requires \"[a]ll individuals living in the Region [to] stay home or at their place of residence except as necessary to conduct activities associated with the operation, maintenanc e, or usage of critical infrastructure.\" When operative in a region, the Regional Stay at Home Order supersedes any prior guidance from the State , including the Blueprint. The Regional Stay at Home Order shutters many businesses that were previously allowed to operate with restrictions under Tier 1 of the Blueprint, such 10 Cal. Dep't of Pub.

The five regions are: Northern California, Bay Area, Greater Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, and Southern California. See About COVID -19 Restrictions , https://covid19.ca.gov/stay -home -except DktEntry: as outdoor dining , barbershops, and nail salons.12 Retail and grocery stores may continue operating at 20% and 35% of capacity, respectively. Outdoor worship services and political protests may continue without capacity restrictions . Once triggered, the Regional Stay at Home Order is effective for a minimum of three weeks, only to be lifted when projected ICU capacity meets or exceeds 15%. Currently, the Regional Stay at Home Order remains in effect in three of California's five hospital regions, including the Southern California region, which encompasses both San Diego County and Los Angeles County.13 2. South Bay United Pentecostal Church is located in the City of Chula Vista, Count y of San Diego, within the hard -hit Southern California region. Bishop Arthur Hodges III has served as Senior Pastor and Bishop of South Bay for the past thirty- five years. South Bay's \"model is the New Testament church founded and described in the book of the Acts of the Apostles: 'And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place .' (Acts: 2:1) (emphasis added).\" Thus, fundamental to the church's creed is that all gather together in one place to worshi p. 12 Attached as Appendix A is a chart comparing the restrictions imposed on various activities and sectors under the Regional Stay at Home Order and the Blueprint. 13 Current Tier Assignments as of Ja nuary 1 9, 2021 , 54 14 Pre-COVID- 19, South Bay held five to seven services each Sunday, with average attendance at some services reaching between 200 and 300 congregants. These services are focused on worshiping together \"both spiritually and physically,\" including gathering around the altar, the laying of the hands around the alt ar, anointment of the sick, and baptism by immersion. South Bay's services conclude with preaching, \"followed by a challenge to physical action, where the congregation is challeng ed to approach the alt ar to 'come believing, come praying.'\" Congregants then participate in \"fellowship both inside and outside the sanctuary . . . 'in the breaking of bread, and in prayers. ' (Acts 2:42).\" According to Bishop Hodges, \"singing is at the heart \" of South Bay's services, and to ban singing in Pentecostal worship \"has the effect of banning those worship services outright.\" Thus, given the particular religious doctrine and practices of the church, South Bay asserts that California's orders prohibiting indoor religious worship and singing and chanting in indoor venues has \"dramatically curtailed\" its ability to carry out its ministry. B. On May 11, 2020, Plaintiff s South Bay United Pentecostal Church and Bishop Hodges (collectively, \"South B ay\") filed a complaint alleging that the four - stage Resilience Roadmap violated the First Amendment's Free Exercise , Establishment, Free Speech, and Page 54 15 Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and rights enumerate d in Article 1, sections 1 through 4, of the California Constitution. South Bay then moved for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction , seeking to prevent enforcement of \"any prohibition on Plaintiffs' engagement in religious services, practices, or activities at which the County of San Diego's Social Distancing and Sanitation Protocol and Safe Reopening Plan is being followed.\" Then followed a series of rulings at every rung of the federal judiciary denying South Bay's request for preliminary injunctive relief. Initially, the district court denied the motion , concluding that South Bay was unlikely to prevail on the merits of its claims. South Bay quickly appealed and filed an emergency motion for an injunction that would allow it to hold in- person religious services pending appeal. On May 22, a motions pane l of our court denied South Bay's request, observing that \"[w]here state action does not 'infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation' and does not 'in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief,' it does not violate the First Amendment.\" S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom , 959 F.3d 938, 939 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533, 543 (1993)). The Supreme Court also deni ed South Bay's application for injunctive relief. S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 140 Page 15 of 54 16 Justice Roberts concurred in the denial of the application, writing that the Roadmap \"appear [ed] consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\" Id. at 1613 (Roberts, C.J., concurring) . The Chief Justice emphasized that : The precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement. Our Constitution principally entrusts \"[t]he safety and the health of the people\" to the politically accountable officials of the States \"to guard and protect.\" When those officials \"undertake[ ] to act in areas f raught with medical and scientific uncertainties,\" their latitude \"must be especially broad.\" Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject to second- guessing by an \"unelected federal judiciary,\" which lacks the background, compete nce, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people. Id. at 1613 -14 (internal citations omitted). On July 10, while South Bay's interlocutory appeal was pending before us , South Bay moved in the district court for an indicative ruling to revisit the denial of its first motion. South Bay had amended its complaint to challenge California's revised restr ictions, and it sought to present additional evidence to the district court. The district court granted the request, reasoning that South Bay had raised a substantial issue. We, in turn, remanded the case \"for the limited purpose of permitting the district court to consider [South Bay's] request in light of the events and case law that have developed since May 15, 2020.\" On October 15, the district court issued an order again denying South Bay's Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 54 17 motion for preliminary injunctive relief, concluding that South Bay remained unlikely to succeed on its Free Exercise claim. The district court observed that \"the evidence shows the [Blueprint] [is] based on the elevated risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus in indoor settings, particularly congregate ac tivities and those involving singing and chanting.\" In reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on the state's experts\u2014 Dr. Rutherford14 and Dr. Watt15\u2014whose 14 As recapped by the district court: \" Dr. George Rutherford is the Salvatore Pablo Lucia Professor of Epidemiology, Preventive Medicine, Pediatrics, and History at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine . He also leads the Division of Infectious Disease and Global Epidemiology in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Further, Dr. Rutherford is an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. He also serves as the 'Director of Global Strategic Information Group in the Institute for Global Health Sciences at U.C. San Francisco. ' Dr. R utherford received his doctor of medicine from the Duke University School of Medicine in 1978. He also received training in epidemiology in the CDC 's Epidemic Intelligence Service and spent ten years in various public health positions before entering acad emia. Since the novel coronavirus emerged, Dr. Rutherford has 'devoted substantial time to researching and studying the virus' as part of his epidemiology roles and has 'spoken extensively on topics related to the novel coronavirus and the disease it cause s during 2020, ' including through presentations to the California Medical Association and the California Health and Human Services Agency. \" 15 Dr. James Watt is similarly highly qualified in epidemiology. He \"is the Chief of the Division of Communicable Disease Control of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the California Department of Public Health ( 'CDPH '). He received his doctor of medicine from the Univer sity of California, San Diego in 1993 and a master 's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley in 1995. Dr. Watt previously worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( 'CDC ') as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Off icer in the Respiratory Diseases Branch. He is also an Associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a Clinical Professor at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, where he teaches graduate students Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 17 of 54 18 qualifications and expertise in epidemiology and public health are undisputed. \"[M]inimal weight,\" however, was assigned to South Bay's expert Dr. George Delgado, a family medicine doctor with no purported training, credentials, or experience in public health or epidemiology . The district court was troubled by Dr. Delgado's \"lack[] [of] significant experience in epidemiology,\" his failure to explain the basis for his comparative risk model, and his failure to \"provide any supporting data for his conclusions.\" Accordingly, the court dismissed Dr. Delgado's comparative risk assessment as like ly inadmissible under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 509 F.3d 1311 (1993). Meanwhile, as scientific understanding of the virus evolved, the legal landscape for resolving COVID -19-related First Amendment issues also shifted. On November 25, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 141 S. Ct. 63 (2020) (per curiam) , which elevated the level of scrutiny that courts are to apply to Free Exercise claims . In light of the Supreme Court's decision, South Bay again moved this court for an injunction pending appeal. We denied the request but vacated the district court's October 15 in public health and medical students about communicable disease control. His professional commendations include the U.S. Public Health Service Achievement medal in 2000, the National Center for Infectious Diseases Honor Award in 2001, and Outstanding Achievement Awards from the CDPH in 2015 and 2016. Dr. Watt has been 'very involved' in the CDPH's response to the COVID -19 pandemic, 'working full time for approximately 60 -70 hours per week to address the pandemic ' from January 2020 to the date of his declaration. \" Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 18 of 54 19 order and remanded the case for further consideration. S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 981 F.3d 765 (9th Cir. 2020).16 On remand, the district court again denied South Bay's request for preliminary inju nctive relief , this time applying the higher level of scrutiny as required by the Supreme Court. T he district court concluded that under Roman Catholic Diocese and Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak , 982 F.3d 1228 (9th Cir. 2020) , the Regional Stay at Home Order was not a neutral, generally applicable regulation because its burden on indoor religious services differed from retail establishments.17 Applying strict scrutiny, it nonetheless found that South Bay was \"not likely to show tha t the Regional Stay at Home Order restricts more than is necessary to advance California's compelling interest in reducing community spread.\" The court noted that to the extent South Bay sought a 20% capacity limitation like that applicable to retail,18 California had already tried percentage of capacity restrictions, which had \"proved insufficient to prevent 16 On November 24, South Bay also filed a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment with the Supreme Court.

On January 14, 2021, the Supreme Court ordered California to file a response. 17 The district court limited its analysis to the Regional Stay at Home Order then in effect in San Diego County. 18 South Bay no longer seeks the lesser restriction of 20% capacity for its indoor services. On appeal, South Bay seeks an injunction allowing churches to hold indoor worship services at \"100% occupancy with social distancing and the 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 19 of 54 20 outbreaks at house s of worship in the San Diego County and the Southern California Region.\" Accordingly, the district court denied South Bay's motion . On December 22, South Bay appealed and filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal. We denied the emergency request without prejudice and expedited the appeal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), and we affirm the denial of the requested injunction. II.

To make this showing , South Bay must demonstrate \"that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irr eparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief , that the balance of equities tips in [its] favor , and that an injunction is in the public interest. \" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). We turn first to South Bay's challenge to the prohibition on indoor worship under the Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Blueprint under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.19 Given the strong evidentiary record before it, we conclude that the distr ict court did not abuse its discretion by denying South Bay's motion for a preliminary injunction and upholding the restrictions on indoor religious worship services under the Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Blueprint .20 Although South Bay h as demonstrated irreparable harm, it has not demonstrated that the likelihood of success, the balance of equities, or the public interest weigh in its favor. 19 The district court did not consider the likel ihood of success of South Bay's other claims brought under provisions of the United States and California Constitutions , and we decline to do so in the first instance here. 20 We note that the district court's analysis was confined to the Regional Stay at Home Order. Because the State considered the same neutral risk criteria in formulating both the Regional Stay at Home Order and the Blueprint, however, we consider the framework as a whole. The parties have briefed, and seek a determination on the validit y of, both restriction regimes. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 21 of 54 22 A. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment provides that the government \"shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" U.S. Const. amend. I; see Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940) (incorporating the Free Exercise Clause against the states). \"In determining whether a law prohibits the free exercise of religion, courts ask whether the law 'is neutral and of general applicability.'\" Dayton Valley , 982 F.3d at 1232 (quoting Church of Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 531). If the law is neutral and of general applicability \u2014that is, the law does not \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment,\" Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 66 \u2014then the law need only survive rational basis review, even if it \"has the incidental effect of b urdening a particular religious practice ,\" Church of Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 5 31. Any law burdening religious practices that is not neutral or of general application, however, \"must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\" Id. at 546. 1. Accordingly, we must first determine whether the Blueprint and the Regional Stay at Home Order are neutral laws of general application . California contends that its framework employs neutral, generally applicable risk criteria , such as the ability to allow physical distancing and limit the number of people Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, 22 of 54 23 mixing from different households , to calculate an activity's transmission risk, and that these risk criteria apply to religious and non -religious activities alike. Thus, in the State's view, because the restrictio ns do not single out religious practices for harsh treatment, but rather only incidentally affect indoor worship , they are subject to rational basis review. But the Supreme Court has recently instructed t hat we apply strict scrutiny review when ever a state imposes different capacity restrictions on religious services relative to non-religious activities and sectors. Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 66 -67. In Roman Catholic Diocese , two houses of worship in New York City sought relief from Governor Cuomo's executive order that placed attendance caps on religious services. Id. at 65-66. In designated \" red zones, \" religious services were limited to 10 people, and in orange zones, services were limited to 25. Id. at 66. However, the order allowed \"essential businesses\" in both zones to \"admit as many people as they wish[ed].\" Id. Included in the list of businesses deemed \"essential\" were \"acupuncture facilities, camp grounds, garages, . . . plants manufacturing chemicals and microelectro nics and all transportation facilities.\" Id. Moreover, i n \"orange zones, \" \"non -essential businesses [could] decide for themselves how many persons to admit.\" Id. (emphasis added). New York's restrictions thus created circumstances 01/22/2021, people\" could shop at \"a large store in Brooklyn\" on any given day, but a \"nearby church or synagogue would be prohibited from allowing more than 10 or 25 people inside for a worship service.\" Id. at 67. Such dichotomous and \"troubling results\" led the Court to conclude that the challenged restrictions were \"not 'neutral' and of 'general applicability, '\" and therefore subject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 66-67 (quoting Church of Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 546). We recently applied the Supreme Court's directive in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolack , 982 F.3d at 1233, where we considered whether Nevada 's COVID-related restrictions violated the Free Exercise Clause. Under the Nevada directive, \"indoor in -person [religious] services\" were capped at 50 people . Id. at 1230 -31. Nevada's directive also imposed a 50% attendance cap on other activities, including casinos, retail, bowling alleys, gyms, restaurants, and body-art and piercing facilities. Id. We held that strict scrutiny review applied because , like the New York order at issue in Roman Catholic Diocese , the Nevada directive \"treat s numerous secular activities and entities s ignificantly better than religious worship services.\" Id. at 1233. For example, \"[c]asinos, bowling alleys, retail businesses, restaurants, arcades, and other similar secular entities are limited to 50% of fire -code capacity, yet houses of worship are limited to fifty people regardless of their fire -code capacities.\" Id. Here, under California's Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 24 of 54 25 Blueprint, religious services are permitted only outdoors. Although the se restrictions do not allow casinos, bowling alleys, or restaurants to operate at greater capacity limits than religious services, the restrictions do permit grocery stores and retail establishments to operate at 35% and 20% of capacity, respectively , under the Regional Stay at Home Order and at 50% and 25% of capacity , respectively, under Tier 1 of the Blueprint. Tier 1 also permits certain personal care services, such as hair and nail salons, to open indoors subject to additional modifications and strict industry guidanc e. This \"'disparate treatment' of religion triggers strict scrutiny review.\" Dayton Valley , 982 F.3d at 1233 (quoting Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 66).21 2. To satisfy strict scrutiny, California must demonstrate that the Regional Stay at Home O rder and the Blueprint are \"'narrowly tailored' to serve a 'compelling' state interest.\" Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S.

California asserts a compelling state interest in reducing community spread of COVID- 19, protecting high-risk individuals from infection , and preventing the overwhelming of its healthcare system as a result of increased hospitalizations. South Bay disputes the veracity of these interests , arguing that the allegedly underinclusive na ture of the restrictions undermines the State's proffered purpose s. This argument is foreclosed by Roman Catholic Diocese , where the Supreme Court held that \"[s]temming the spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably a compelling interest.\" 141 S. Ct. at 67; accord Dayton Valley , 982 F.3d at 1234. This is especially true in California, where the state leads the nation with its seven- day average of total new ca ses.22 As of January 19, the state's test positivity rate sat at 15.2% and ICU capacity has disappeare d.23 South Bay's attempt to minimize the deaths of 35,004 Californians to COVID -1924 in the face of the 62,000 Californians who die each year from heart disease is unavailing. There is a vast difference between the non-contagious nature of heart disease, which poses no greater risk when large groups are permitted to 22 New York Times, Coronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count , https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us -cases.html (last updated Jan. 22 , 2021). 23 Current Tier Assignments as of January 19, 2021, Tracking COVID -19 in California , https://covid19.ca.gov/state -dashboard/ . 24 Update for 54 27 congregate, and COVID- 19, which is lethal for precisely that reason. Because we conclude that California has a compelling interest in reducing community spread of COVID-19, South Bay's likelihood of success on its Free Exercise claim turns on whether California can demonstrate that its restrictions on indoor worship are narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest. Narrow tailoring requires that the State employ the \"least restrictive means\" to advance its objective of stemming the virus's spread. Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981) ; see also Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. Relying on the declarations submitted by California's public health and epidemiological experts, the district court concluded that the Stay at Home Order was narrowly tailored to achieve its compelling interest in stemming the recent case surge . California presented evidence that its public health officials considered seven objective risk criteria in assessing the transmission risk of all activities and sectors: (1) the ability to accommodate face coverings at all time s; (2) the ability to allow for physical distancing; (3) the ability to limit the duration of exposure ; (4) the ability to limit the amount of mixing of people from differing households and communit ies; (5) the ability to limit physical interactions between individuals; (6) the ability to optimize ventilation; and (7) the ability to limit activities known to increase spread such as shouting, singing, and heavy breathing. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 27 of 54 28 The district court found that by \"[a]pplying these factors, California assigns a similar risk profile for religious gatherings, as it does for weddings, funerals, college lectures, and political expression. \" Indeed, the state treats religious services more favorably than several of these comparable secular activities. For although the Regional Stay at Home Order generally prohibits \"all gatherings with members of other households,\" it specifically exempts outdoor religious worship from this prohibition. Only activities involving political expression or the use of outdoor recreation facilities receive a similar exemption . The Regional Stay at Home Order does not grant an exemption for other activities that similarly involve congregating outdoors for a prolonged period. For instance, restaurants must cease dine-in operations , both indoor and outdoor, and overnight stays at campgrounds are prohibited. Museums, zoos, and aquariums, w hich were previously permitted to operate outdoors under Tier 1 of the Blueprint, must close. The Regional Stay at Home Order also permits e ssential workers in c ritical infrastructure to work on -site when remote work is not feasible . However , even these digitally unconvertable workplaces are subject to modifications furnished by the State's strict and mandatory industry-specific guidance. The State has issued industry -specific guidance for every activity and workplace specifying measures Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 28 of 54 29 designed to deal with the unique risks posed by each environment.25 For example, factories are required to screen workers, develop safety plans, and, where individuals must work in close proximity, install engineering controls such as plexiglass or other impermeable partitions.26 Houses of worship are encouraged to \"[c]onsider modifying \" certain religious traditions that pose increased transmission risks, such as kissing ritual objects and sharing a communal cup.27 As it did before the district court, S outh Bay does not dispute that the challenged restrictions treat worship services more favorably than those non- exempted activities with respect to gathering outdoors . Rather, because of the importance that the Pentecostal religion places on worshipping \" in the temple,\" South Bay's argument centers on activities and sectors that are permitted to operate indoors while worship services remain confined to outdoor operation. South Bay contends that the Regional Stay at Home Order and the Blueprint are underinclusive because they \"give[] numerous exemptions \" for activities that involve large groups of people in close proximity for long durations (e.g., factories, 25 See Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health, Industry Guidance to Reduce Risk , https://covid19.ca.gov/industry- guidance/ (last updated Jan. 19, 2021). 26 Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health, COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Manufacturing (July 29, 2020), https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance -manufacturing --en.pdf . 27 Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health, COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Places of Worship and Providers of Religious Services and Cultural Ceremonies (July 29, 54 30 warehouses, transportation28), that are impossible to conduct outdoors (e.g., retail) or tha t require loud vocalizations (e.g., professional sports and film production). The district court carefully examined each activity and sector permitted to operate at greater capacity limits indoors than houses of worship, how those activities compare d under the seven risk criteria, and concluded that California's restrictions are indeed narrowly tailored to meet its compelling interest in reducing community spread of COVID -19. The district court's thorough analysis and conclusions , which we examine below, are fully supported by the record and not contradicted by any evidence submitted by South Bay . We first describe the restrictions applicable to each activity and sector under California's framework, then assess whether the restriction is in fact the leas t restrictive means for regulating the activity. Religious Services : To determine whether the restrictions are narrowly tailored, the district court began by assessing the risk profile of religious gatherings. California's public health officials deemed religious services to \"involve[] an exceptionally high risk of COVID -19 transmission\" because they 28 Although South Bay include d \"political protests\" in this category of allegedly \"exempted\" activities, the record evidence establishes that California imposes the same restrictions on political expression as it does on religious gatherings. Both are permitted only outdoors under the Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Blueprint, and are subject to the same indoor capacity restrictions in Tiers 30 of 31 involve a \"combination of many high risk factors.\" As noted , indoor worship services typically bring together individuals from many different households, assembled in a series of rows or pews that are physically close together, making close proximity highly likely ( Risk Factors 2, 4, 5). Moreover, services last for at least one hour, which increases the risk of a viral load sufficient to infect an individual ( Risk Factor 3). Finally, religious services usually involve singing, chanting, and responsive reading, activities known to increase the spread by \"negat[ing] the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing\" (Risk Factor 7). The risky nature of this activity can, however, be alleviated when there is increased ventilation, such as when services occur outdoors, because aerosolized particles will dissipate into the atmosphere ( Risk Factor 6). This explains why the State permits singing and chanting to occur during outdoor services, but prohibits such behaviors during indoor worship. Retail Establishments & Grocery Stores: While only outdoor religious services are permitted under the Regional Stay at Home Order and Blueprint Tier 1, retail and grocery stores may operate indoors at 20% and 35% capacity, respectively, under the Regional Stay at Home Order, a nd 25% and 50%, respectively, under Tier 1. To justify this disparate treatment, California presented evidence that retail and grocery stores pose a lower transmission risk than indoor worship, primarily Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 31 of because these establishments do not involve indivi duals congregating to participate in a group activity. For example, patrons typically have the intention of getting in and out of grocery and retail stores as quickly as possible (Risk Factor s 3, 5), whereas the very purpose of a worship service is to con gregate as a community. To preserve perishable products and comply with applicable health and safety codes, grocery stores are \"almost always\" equipped with high-functioning air - conditioning systems that increase ventilation and air flow (Risk Factor 6). Singing, chanting, and shouting is uncommon in these establishments (Risk Factor 7). Moreover, as California explains, these entities can only operate \"with modifications,\" which appear in the mandatory industry guidance designed to reduce the transmission risk posed by the particular activity.29 Mandatory industry guidance for retail and grocery stores require additional precautions such as plexiglass at checkout, frequent disinfection of commonly used surfaces such as shopping carts, and the closure of any areas that encourage congregating, such as in-store bars, seating areas, and product sampling (Risk Factors 2, 3, 5). Thus, taking into account these risk criteria, California 's public health officials have concluded that retail, grocery, and big box stores present a lower risk profile than 29 Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health, COVID -19 Industry Guidance: of 54 33 indoor worship services, and allow these establishments to operate indoors subject to strict capacity limits and mandatory industry guidance. Personal Care Services: Like indoor worship, personal care services, such as barbershops, nail salons, and body waxing studios, must close completely under the Regional Stay at Home Order . Under Tier 1 of the Blueprint , however, indoor personal care services may reopen subject to mandatory industry guidance while indoor worship remains prohibited.30 In assessing the risk profile of these services, California's public health experts explain that although personal care services may bring together people in close contact with one another, they \"involve small numbers of individuals interacting,\" in contrast to \"the numbers of individuals commonly present at indoor worship services\" (Risk Factor 4). These sector s are also subject to additional mandatory hygienic requirements. For example, workers that are consistently within six feet of customers or coworkers are required to wear a secondary barrier in addition to a face mask (e.g., face shield or safety goggles). Public Transportation : Under the Regional Stay at Home Order and the Blueprint, public transit is permitted subject to modifications such as reduced occupancy and increased sanitation ( Risk Factor 2). But unlike worship services, 30 Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health, COVID -19 Industry Guidance: Expanded Personal Care Services (Oct. 20, 2020), of 54 34 interactions in a transit setting are likely to be asocial, brief and distant (Risk Factor s 3, 5). Furthermore, c hanting or yelling is uncommon \u2014perhaps even alarming \u2014in these environments (Risk Fact or 7). Worksites in Critical Infrastructure Sectors: The Regional Stay at Home Order allows critical infrastructure employers to designate essential workers to perform on -site tasks that cannot be done remotely, subject to mandatory industry - specific guidelines. Under the Blueprint, these sectors may operate indoors but are subject to strict modifications. The district court credited the statements of California's experts and publi c health officials who explained that job sites present a lower risk profile than non-employment situations because the State has greater control over enforcing specific industry guidelines applicable to each industry: factories must screen workers, devel op safety plans, and install engineering controls such as plexiglass barriers, to protect individuals who work near each other. The employers are also subject to various health and safety requirements enforced by State labor authorities. Binding labor agr eements in certain industries impose other mandatory measures such as routine testing of on-site staff. Work shifts may be grouped to control personnel to whom the employees are regularly exposed, thus diluting the risk presented by likelihood of stranger s from different bubbles randomly mixing at each gathering. Thus, while we agree with South Bay's argument that \"[t]he State cannot 'assume the worst when people go to worship but assume the best when people go to work,'\" S. Bay. United Pentecostal Church , 140 S. Ct. at 1615 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting in denial of application for injunctive relief) (citation o mitted) , California is not \"assuming\" anything by enacting these it is Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page mandat ing additional restrictions through \"detailed, workplace -specific COVID prevention plans subject to enforcement by State labor authorities.\" South Bay non etheless misguidedly asserts that California's seven risk factors are not applied to sectors deemed essential critical infrastructure. Again, the challenged restrictions do cover critical infrastructure, which can only operate with significant mandatory m odifications \u2014industry- specific guidance designed to reduce the transmission risk posed by the specific sector. The industry- specific guidelines applicable to religious gatherings do not impose nearly as stringent requirements in comparison to many other sectors. There are no labor agreements or other strictures mandating testing or contact tracing to combat the spread of the disease through religious worship. Nor do we see how mandated testing would be practicable for those who participate in weekly or daily worship. Finally, South Ba y makes much of an alleged \"Hollywood Exemption.\" But there is absolutely no record evidence to support its assertions. Although film and production studios are permitted to continue operations under the Regional Stay at Home Order and the Blueprint, record evidence demonstrates that Hollywood is not \"exempt \" from restrictions. In fact, this sector is more strictly regulated than many others . For example , the Executive Director of the California Film Commission attested that filming in the state resumed only after the studios and unions reached an agreement concerning safety guidelines. The agreement Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 35 of 54 36 requires tri -weekly testing and special protocols for makeup, hair styling, costumes, and props. Moreover, although singin g and chanting is permitted outdoors for all activitie s (as with religious services) , the Executive Director stated that she was \"unaware of any current film or television productions involving large groups of people singin g.\" South Bay has pointed to no specific evidence to support its assertion that the film industry is permitted to allow singing indoors and we are unable to find any in the record. South Bay's analogous arguments with respect to professional sports teams, which it raises for the first time on appeal, fail for similar reasons . Like the film industry, professional sports may resume training and competition subject to approval by county health officers, which has not always been granted.31 Live audiences\u2014 even outdoors\u2014are prohibite d.32 Unlike religious gatherings, professional sports teams are subject to labor agreements that impose stringent regulations on players, including daily testing and penalties such as suspension if a player fails to follow the rules.33 31 S.F.

United States , 414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974) and then quoting Garcia v. San Antonio Met. Trans. Auth. , 469 U.S. 528, 545 (1985))). Notably, in response to the State's mountain of scientific evidence, South Bay has not pointed to anything in the record to support the notion that the lesser restriction that it seeks\u2014 100% occupancy with a reliance solely on mask- wearing, social distancing, and sanitation measures34\u2014would be effective to meet 34 South Bay has made repeated misrepre sentations on appeal regarding the status of a Los Angeles County ordinance enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Roman Catholic Diocese . On December 19, Los Angeles County passed an ordinance allowing houses of worship to hold indoor servi ces without numerical limits or percentage caps provided that congregants wear masks and adhere to physical distancing. The ordinance was quickly rescinded on December 29\u2014two days before South Bay filed its Opening Brief \u2014to bring the county back into comp liance with the state's Regional Stay at Home Order, which then permitted only outdoor worship. Nonetheless, South Bay continue s to cite to the ordinance as if it were still in effect, even after the State filed a motion for judicial notice confirming it was repealed. When asked about this discrepancy during oral argument, South Bay continued to represent that the ordinance had not been rescinded. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 38 of 54 39 California's compelling interest in controlling community spread. South Bay's self-serving assertion that it has experienced no incidence of the virus among its worshipers is entirely anecdotal and undermined by evidence of outbreaks in similarly situated places of worship. And to the extent that South Bay seeks to be treated like grocery stores under the Regional Stay at Home Order, with indoor capacity capped at 35%, we note that similar percentage caps have applied to indoor worship at various times over the last ten months. In both May and October indoor worship was permitted up to 25% of capacity or 100 people. But as the district court correctly found, these less restrictive measures proved inadequate in reducing community spread as evidenced by increasing case numbers and overfilled ICUs , and, a s such, failed to meet California's compelling state interest here . South Bay also contends that the total prohibition on indoor worship under the Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Blueprint is invalid because it is imposed without regard to t he size of the place of worship. Notably, however, a percentage cap on attendance based on size is not the relief South Bay seeks. Rather, South Bay would have us enjoin California's restrictions such that it may return to \"100% occupancy with social dis tancing and the other health protocols.\" Moreover, even when a percentage of capacity is permitted under Tiers 2 and 3 of the Blueprint, South Bay would still be bound by the mandatory state -wide and Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: of 54 40 industry -specific guidelines, including six feet of phy sical distancing, which would preclude certain religious practices, such as altar calls, the laying of the hands, and fellowship. And even if an individual congregant is willing to accept the risk of contracting the virus by partaking in such conduct, the risk is not an individual 's risk to take . The risk is also to the lives of others with whom an asymptomatic person may come into close contact, to the healthcare workers who must care for the person one infects, and to California's overwhelmed healthcar e system as a whole. California's experts cited studies published by the Centers of Disease Control that estimate, on average, one individual infected with COVID-19 goes on to infect an additional 2.5 people, and each of those persons infects 2.5 more. Thus, the risk of community spread grows exponentially with each additional infected person. 3. Finally, we turn to South Bay's contention that Roman Catholic Diocese and Dayton Valley compel the conclusion that California's restrictions are not narrowly tailored. We disagree. California's restrictions differ markedly from the New York order under review in Roman Catholic Diocese and the Nevada directive at issue in Dayton Valley . To begin, New York's restrictions 40 41 Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 66, whereas California 's objective risk assessment treats all communal gatherings the same across activities and sectors. The Supreme Court seemed to observe as much when describ ing the New York executive order as \"far more restrictive\" than a previous iteration of the California restrictions, which have been incorporated into Tier 2 of the Blueprint. Id. at 67 n.2 (citing S. Bay United Pentecostal Church, 140 S. Ct. 1613 ); see also id. at 74 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (\"New York's restrictions on houses of worship are much more severe than the California and Nevada restrictions at issue in South Bay and [ Dayton Valley ] . . . .\"); id. at 75 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (observing that the New York restrictions are \"distinguishable from those we considered in [ South Bay]\"). Moreover, that the Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Blueprint do not tether maximum indoor worship attendance to the building size, as the Supreme Court suggested in Roman Catholic Diocese , does not automatically render the restrictions unconstitutional. Tying maximum attendance to the size of the church, synagogue, or mosque is one \"[a]mong other things\" that the Supreme Court suggested would be more narrowly tailored than New York's strict numerical caps. Id. at 67. California's framework is narrowly t ailored to stopping the viral spread in each type of endeavor within the state. And, a s test positivity rates drop in a given county \u2014and the State's interest in ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page services in that locale lessens \u2014California permits congregations in the county to expand the size of their indoor services. This sliding scale demonstrates California's careful calibration in its effort to impinge on its inhabitants' Free Exercise rights no more than is required by a once -in-a-lifetime global pandemic. Finally, we note that the evidentiary record before the Supreme Court in Roman Catholic Diocese appears to have been quite different than the one before us. The Court's suggestion that the \"maximum attendance at a religious service could be tied to the size of the church or synagogue,\" id. (emphasis added), does not appear to be supported by the extensive testimony of public health officials and the studies they relied upon, which we have before us now, see also id. (\"It is hard to believe that admittin g more than 10 people to a 1,000- seat church or 400 -seat synagogue would create a more serious health risk than the many other activities that the State allows.\" (emphasis added)). In Dayton Valley , we were faced with a similarly lean record \u2014each party submitted just one expert declaration. T here was certainly no indication that Nevada employed a risk- based activity -tailored analysis in assigning restrictions to different sectors under the challenged directive . Instead, the state enacted regulations that allowed potentially hundreds of individuals to congregate in doors at casinos, but limited religious services to a strict 50-person cap regardless of the size of the church or whether the service was held indoors or out . See Dayton Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, Valley, 982 F.3d at 1233. Here , by contrast, California has closed cardrooms under the Regional Stay at Home Order and requires outdoor operation under Tiers 1 and 2 of the Blueprint . Outdoor worship services are permitted without any attendance limitations . As we have previously observed, we recognize that the issues before us \"strike at the very heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty,\" S. Bay. United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 982 F.3d 1239 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 68); indeed, we appreciate our \"duty to conduct a serious examination of the need for such a drastic measure,\" Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 98. But it is precisely this careful examination that leads us to the conclusion we reach today: given the contagiousness of th is deadly virus and the dire circumstances facing Southern California's healthcare system at this moment in its history, there exist no less restrictive mea ns to alleviate the situation. B. \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\" Id. at 67 (quoting Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)). The district court found that South Bay demonstrated ir reparable harm , and the government does not challenge this finding on appeal . We agree that South Bay is suffering irreparable harm by not Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 43 of 54 44 being able to hold worship services in the Pentecostal model to which it subscribes. C. Where the government is a pa rty to a case in which a preliminary injunction is sought, the balance of the equities and public interest factors merge. See Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell , 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014). The district court did not abuse its discretion in conclud ing that the public interest lay not with enjoining California's restrictions , but rather with the continued protection of the population as a whole so that all who desire to do so may once again return to worship indoors . To be sure, without its requested injunctive relief, South Bay will continue to be deprived of the ability to engage in indoor worship. But u nlike the plaintiffs in Roman Catholi c Diocese , South Bay is permitted to hold in -person services outdoors in unlimited numbers under both the Regional Stay at Home Order and Tier 1 of the Blueprint . Thus, \"personal attendance,\" with which the Supreme Court was principally concerned, is not an issue here. See Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 68. During this time, many Catholic churches throughout California have provided the Sacrament of Communion on a drive -through basis, following the live stream of the Mass to parishioners at home.35 Cf. id. (observing 35 Orange County Register , Drive -through Communion, Online Sermons: Venerable Tustin Church P 44 of 54 45 that in New York, \"Catholics who watch a Mass at home cannot receive communion\"). Other faiths have similarly held regular outdoor services. For example, many Los Angeles-based synagogues held in -person outdoor High Holy Days servic es in their parking lots.36 And, as we have just explained, the Regional Stay at Home Order and the Blueprint permit these outdoor religious services without restrictions on attendance or singing and chanting. San Diego County benefits from a year -round warm climate37 and is full of outdoor spaces that could plausibly accommodate outdoor religious services, such as parks and parking lots . Given the obvious climatic differences between San Diego in the winter and say, New York, the Regional Stay sermons- venerable -tustin -church -adapts- to-pandemic/ (Aug. 4, 2020) (last visited Jan. 21, 2021); Sierra Star, Mountain Area Church Gets Face-time With Parishioners in D rive-thru Communion (May 2, 2020), https://www.sierrastar.com/living/religion/article242454861.html (last visited Jan. 21, 2021). 36 L.A.

See National Centers for Environmental Information, Record of Climatological 54 46 at Home Order's allowance for outdoor services is much more than \"lip service \" to the demands of the First Amendment. Moreover, although the limitations on indoor worship services are of grave concern, they will be in effect only until ICU availability increases beyond a 15% threshold and test positivity rates drop below 8%. On the other hand, if the requested injunctive relief is granted, the record evidence points to the conclusion that the public will be further endangered by both the virus and the collapse of the state's health system . Although there is no record evidence that attendance at South Bay's services in particular has contributed to the spread of the virus, the record does evidence outbreaks tied to religious gatherings in San Diego County and in the Southern California region. And, certainly, California's public health experts have concluded that indoor gatherings of any kind are exactly what magnifies the risk of exposure. Accordingly, unlike in Roman Catholic Diocese , there is strong evidence to conclude that enjoining California's restrictions on indoor worship services to permit gatherings for indoor religious services will in fact harm the public. Cf. id. Indeed, it is difficult to see how allowing more people to congregate indoors will do anything other than lead to more cases , more deaths, and more strain s on California's already overburdened healthcare system. IV. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 46 of 54 47 We next assess South Bay's claim that the 100- and 200 -person attendance limits on indoor worship under Tiers 2 and 3 of the Blueprint, respectively, violate the Free Exercise Clause.38 Although South Bay raised this challenge in its renewed motion for injunctive relief, the district court did not address it in its December 21 order. T he parties have nonetheless briefed the issue on appeal . We believe that the Winter factors counsel enjoining these attendance caps. We conclude that South Bay is likely to succeed on its challenge to the 100 - and 200-person attendance caps under Tiers 2 and 3 of the Blueprint. As with the limitation on indoor worship, after Roman Catholic Diocese , we apply strict scrutiny to these attendance cap s because California has imposed different capacity restrictions on religious services relative to non-religious activities and sectors. See Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 66 -67. Specifically, in Tier 2, indoor worship services are limited to the lesser of 25% or 100 people, whereas retail may operate at 25% capacity and grocery stores may operate at 50% capacity, both 38 South Bay also purports to challeng e the 25% limitation on capacity in Tier 2 of the Blueprint, and the 50% limitation on capacity under Tiers 3 and 4 of the Blueprint. However, the district court did not rule on this challenge, nor did the parties present specific evidence regarding the narrowl y tailored inquiry with respect to the percentage limitations below or make meaningful arguments here . If South Bay desires to challenge these percentage limitations, it must return to the district court. See Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. v. Wu , 626 F.3d 483, 487 (9th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (\"[W] e won 't consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant's opening brief.\" (internal quotations ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 47 of 54 48 without attendance caps. In Tier 3, indoor worship services are limited to the lesser of 50% or 200 people, whereas retail and grocery stores may operate without capacity limits subject to mandatory industry guidance. Whereas the State has submitted substantial evidence as to why indoor worship is unsafe at any level in counties where COVID- 19 is \"widespread\" and ICU capacity is non-existent , we cannot find record evidence to support its assertion that the 100 -person cap in Tier 2 and 200 -person cap in Tier 3 are necessary to achie ve its goal in further slowing community spread. As in Roman Catholic Diocese, \"there are many other less restrictive rules that could be adopted to minimize the risk to those attending religious services.\" Id. at 67. And while 100 or 200 people could o verwhelm a small chapel, a large church the size of South Bay could easily implement social distancing with much higher numbers . Accordingly, we conclude that South Bay is likely to succeed on the merits of its Free Exercise claim with respect to the numerical caps in Tiers 2 and 3. When San Diego County reaches Tiers 2 and 3 of the Blueprint, the numerical attendance caps will undeniably unconstitutionally deprive some of South Bay's worshippers of participation in its worship services , causing irreparable harm. See Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 67. Moreover, the untethered nature of the caps, at least on the record before us, will tip the balance of the equities and public interest in South Bay's favor. See Hernandez v. Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: , 872 F.3d 976, 996 (9th Cir. 2017) (\"[T]he injunction serves the interests of the general public by ensuring that the government's . . . procedures comply with the Constitution. Generally, public interest concerns are implicated when a constitutional right has been violated because all citizens have a stake in upholding the constitution.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The State has not shown that l ess restrictive measures, such as basing attendance limits on the size of the church, synagogue or mosque would cause any greater peril to the public. Accordingly, we remand to the district court with the instruction to enjoin the State from imposing the 100- and 200- person caps under Tiers 2 and 3 of the Blueprint. V. Finally, we separately consider South Bay's claim that California's ban on indoor singing and chanting violates its First Amendment rights under the Free Exercise Clause. Although South Bay raised this challenge in its renewed motion for injunctive relief, the district court did not specifically address it in its December 21 order. We find that the district court's failure to do so, if error, is harmless because the challenge lacks merit. California's ban on indoor singing and chanting applies to all indoor activities , sector s, and private gatherings. South Bay has not pointed to any record evidence that this ban results in disparate treatment of religious gatherings, and we cannot find any. Thus, our analysis of the singing and chanting ban is subject to Case: 20-56358, 01/22/2021, ID: 11978779, DktEntry: 52-1, Page 49 of 54 50 the deferential rational basis review, not strict scrutiny. California's public health offici als explain that \"[s]inging, chanting, [and] shouting . . . significantly increase the risk of COVID- 19 transmission because these activities increase the release of respiratory droplets and fine aerosols into the air.\"39 Such conduct propels respiratory droplets farther and thus mitigates the effects achieved by social distancing. Moreover, mask -wearing cannot completely impede the risk of transmission because of the forceful nature of the expulsion. The State's ban on singing and chanting is therefore rationally related to controlling the spread of COVID- 19, and South Bay has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on this claim. VI. We are mindful that \"even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.\" Roman Catholic Diocese , 141 S. Ct. at 68. But we do not think this is what California has done. Although South Bay may not be able to hold indoor worship services, California has left open other avenues for worship that pose substantially less risk for further spread of COVID-1 9. Accordingly, having evaluated the likelihood of success on the merits, the potential for 39 Cal. Dep't of Pub. Health, Guid ance for the Prevention of COVID -19 Transmission for Gatherings (Nov. 13, 2020), of-COVID DktEntry: 52-1, Page 50 of 54 51 irreparable injury, the balance of equities, and the public interests implicated by this case, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant South Bay's requested injunction.

DENYING PLAINTIFFS' RENEWED MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER OR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION (ECF No. 75). In this action brought by a San Diego church to challenge Calif ornia's COVID-19 regulation, the Court is asked to draw a difficult balance between religious liberty and public health. The applicant church seeks to enjoin the regulat ion in order to provide indoor worship for its congregation, and California seeks to preserve the regulation to curb the Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 12/21/20 PageID.7990 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28community spread of the virus. The Southern California region is now witnessing the pandemic at its peak: record num ber of new daily cases, skyrocketing deaths, and 0% of ICU hospital beds left to spare. The stakes are high. Religion i s all the more essential when disease, desperation, and death surround us; at the same ti me, a unified effort to fight the spread of the virus is desperately needed like never before . In drawing this difficult balanc e between religious liberty and public health, the Court must follow the higher courts' precedents, when the precedents seem to change course as quickly as the various pandemic restrictions. Admittedly, this has been a rapidly evolving\u2014and escalating\u2014pandemic. And in this very case, the Supreme Court declined to intervene after the Court refused to enjoin California's pri or regulation. Now, by all measures, the pandemic is worse and more out of control in Sout hern California than when that decision was made. Nevertheless, the Court is tasked with deciding whether Chief Justice Roberts' rationale for not intervening in this case has now \"expired,\" as Justice Gorsuch's recent concurrenc e in another case suggests. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , --- U.S. ---- (Nov. 25, 2020), 2020 WL 6948354, at *5 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). This decision is the Court's best attempt to interpret and harmon ize the recent decisions on the issue from the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circ uit, in balancing the essential interests in religious liberty and public health. I. BACKGROUND The Court incorporates the background section from the Court's Oc tober 15, 2020 Order. (Order at 3:21-15:2, ECF No. 71.) In that Order, the Cou rt denied Plaintiffs' renewed motion to enjoin California's restrictions in place at t hat time, in the form of a capacity limit on indoor worship services and a ban on singing, c hanting, or shouting indoors.

The Supreme Court's Prior Denial of Plaintiffs' Application In May, Plaintiffs sought emerge ncy relief from the Supreme Cour t. 1After Justice Kagan referred Plaintiffs' application for injunctive relief to the Supreme Court, the Court denied it. S. Bay United Pentecost al Church v. Newsom, 140 S. Ct. 1613 (2020) (mem.). Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the denial of the application. Id.at 1613-14. He reasoned: Although California's guidelines place restrictions on places o f worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of t h e F i r s t Amendment. Similar or more sever e restrictions apply to compar able secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spect ator sports, and theatrical performances, where l arge groups of people gather in c l o s e proximity for extended periods of time. And the Order exempts or treats more leniently only dissimilar activitie s, such as operating grocery stores, banks, and laundromats, in which people neither congregate in large gr oups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods. Id.at 1613. The Chief Jus tice further explained: The precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive m atter subject to reasonable disagreement. Our Constitution principally entru sts \"[t]he safety and the health of the pe ople\" to the politically accountable officials of the States \"to guard and protect.\" Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905). When those officials \"undertake[ ] to act in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties,\" their latitude \"must be especially broad.\" Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974). Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject t o second- guessing by an \"unelected federal judiciary,\" which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.

Cuomo (2020) In late November, the Supreme Court granted Roman Catholic Diocese of Brookyn's emergency application to enjoi n New York's COVID-19 restrictions on houses of worship, which had limited in-person attenda nce to 10 persons in the red zone and 25 persons in the orange zone. Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , --- U.S. ----, 2020 WL 6948354 (Nov. 25, 2020) (per curiam). The Court held that the 10 - and 25-person capacity limits should be reviewed under strict scrutiny, finding that the challenged rules singled out houses of worship for \"especia lly harsh treatment,\" which \"effectively barr[ed] many from attending religious services.\" Id. at *1, 3. The Court opined that, although \"[s]temming the spread of COVID -19 is unquestionably a compelli ng interest,\" New York's restrictions were not narrow ly tailored to the state's interest. Id. at *2. A week after, the Supreme Court vacated a district court's deci sion to not enjoin California's restriction on houses of worship as requested by th e Harvest Rock Church in Los Angeles County, 2and remanded to the Ninth Circuit with instructions to remand t o the Central District of California f or further consideration in light of the Court's ruling in Roman Catholic Diocese .Harvest Rock Church v.

Dayton Valley v. Sisolak , No. 20-16169, 2020 WL 7350247 (9th Cir. Dec. 15, 2020). The Ninth Circuit held that the Roman Catholic Diocese decision compelled strict scrutiny review of Nevada's directive, which im posed a fifty-person cap on houses of worship but a 50% capacity cap on certain other bu sinesses. Dayton Valley , 2020 WL 7350247, at *3. The panel held that Roman Catholic Diocese \"arguably 2Harvest Rock Church, Inc. v.

B. Winter Outbreak in Californi a and the State's Response Meanwhile, COVID-19 rampaged through California, quickly bringin g the State into the worst phase of the pandemic since its inception in Mar ch. In just a month between mid-November and mid-December, t he number of new cases per day in California increased from 8,743 a day to more than 35,000 a day. 3The number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in California grew from 777 on November 15 to 13,635 on December 14.4 In Southern California, ICU bed capacity is now 0%.5 In response to the unprecedented surge in the virus infections an d patients needing hospitalization, California's public health officials reinforced its response to reducecommunity spread of the virus, protect individuals at higher risk of severe illness or death, 3Declaration of Dr. George Ruther ford, ECF No. 81-4. of December 2020, https://covid1 9.ca.gov/state-dashboard/.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28and prevent the state's health care delivery system from being overwhelmed. 6Community spread occurs when residents beco m e i n f e c t e d w i t h t h e v i r u s i n c ommunity settings, making it difficult to identify the source of exposure.7California's response targets three factors that facilitate community spread of COVID-19: (1) prevale nce of COVID-19 in the community, measured by the proportion of individuals infected at a given time, (2) the number of interactions between p eople during which the pathogen can be transmitted, and (3) the average likelihood of transmission per interaction.8Wearing masks, frequent handwashing, and social distancing reduce the likelihood of tra nsmission per interaction (factor 3).9Stay at home orders and limiting the capacity of indoor operati ons reduce the number of interac tions (factor 2).10 In devising its response to manage the second factor\u2014reducing t he number of interpersonal interactions\u2014the State applies neutral risk crite ria to determine the conditions in which a given activity may take place: xability to accommodate wear ing masks at all times; xability to allow physical distancing; xability to limit duration of exposure; xability to limit amount of mixing of people from differing hous eholds and communities; xability to limit amount of of visitors/pa trons; xability to optimize ventilation; and xability to limit activities that a re known to cause increased s pread.

The Present Motion Plaintiffs filed the present renewed motion for a temporary res training order and application for an injunction pending appeal on December 3, 202 0. (ECF No. 75.) Plaintiffs concurrently filed a parallel application with the N inth Circuit. (Emergency Mot., S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom , No. 20-55533 (9th Cir. Dec. 3, 2020), ECF No. 96.) The Ninth Circui t vacated this Court's October 15 , 2020 Order, remanded the case for further considerati on, and denied without prejudic e Plaintiffs' emergency motion for an injunction pending a ppeal. (Mandate and Order, ECF No. 84.) Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief. (ECF No. 80.) California D efendants filed an Opposition (ECF No. 81), and San Diego Defendants filed a Joinder and Opposition (ECF Nos. 82, 83). Plaintiffs filed a Re ply. (ECF No. 85.) The Court held a hearing on December 18, 2020. The Moti on is now ripe for decision. II. PRELIMINARY MATTERS Because the case has been remanded, the Court construes Plainti ffs' application for a stay pending appeal (ECF No. 75) as a renewed motion for a temp orary restraining order or preliminary injunction. California Defendants' request for judicial notice (ECF No. 81- 7), to which Plaintiffs have not objected, is granted. 37 37To the extent that any exhibit does not satisfy the requirement s of summary judgment or trial evidence, \"a preliminary injunction is customarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merit s.\" Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch , 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). This flexibility exists because \"[t]he urgency of obtaining a preliminary injunction necessitates a prompt determination.\" Flynt Distrib. Co. v. Harvey , 734 F.2d 1389, 1394 (9th Cir. 1984). A district court therefore \"may give even inadmissible evidence some weight, when to do so serves the purpose of preventing irreparable harm.\" Id. District courts have exercised this discretion to consider a variety of evidence at the preliminary injunction stage that may otherwise be inadmissible. See, e.g., Flynt Distrib. Co. , 734 F.2d at 1394 ( holding that it was within the district cou rt's discretion to rely on hearsay statements); Moose Creek, that were not individuall y authenticated).Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 2- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28At the hearing, Plaintiffs withdrew exhibits 4 through 7 accompa nying Plaintiffs' counsel's declaration, which consist of evidence submitted to t he Kern County Superior Court in a separate action. (Exs. 4-7 to the Declaration of Jeffrey M. Trissell, ECF No. 85-2 at 76-222.) The withdrawn exhibits are stricken from the r ecord, and California Defendants' objection (ECF N o. 86) is denied as moot. III. LEGAL STANDARD The standard for a temporary restraining order and preliminary inju nction are \"substantially identical.\" Stuhlbarg Int'l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co. , 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001). \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, th at the balance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). The party seeking the injunction bears the burden of pro ving these elements. Klein v. City of San Clemente , 584 F.3d 1196, 1201 (9th Cir. 200 9). \"A preliminary injuncti on is 'an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing , carries the burden of persuasion.'\" Lopez v. Brewer , 680 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)). IV. ANALYSIS A. Irreparable Harm The Supreme Court has made clear that capacity restrictions at houses of worship will cause irreparable harm w ithout temporary or preliminary re lief. See Roman Catholic Diocese, 2020 WL 6948354, at *3. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sh own irreparable harm.// //Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 3- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28B. Likelihood of Success on the Merits The issue is whether Plaintiffs' Free Exercise Clause claim as ap plied to the current restrictions in place is likely to succeed on the merits at a final hearing. Ordinarily, a party seeking preliminary injunction must establish that it will prevail on the merits with a \"reasonable certainty.\" Sierra Club v. Hickel , 433 F.2d 24, 33 (9th Cir. 1970), aff'd sub nom. Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972). In this circ uit, the burden is lessened to a fair chance of success on the merits in cases in which the ha rm that may occur to the plaintiff is sufficiently serious. William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., Inc. , 526 F.2d 86, 88 (9th Cir. 1975). The Court limits its analysis to Plaintiffs' Free Exercise Claus e claim because the Ninth Circuit has remanded the present action \"[i]n light of th e Supreme Court's orders in Harvest Rock Church, Inc. v. Newsom , No. 20A94, 592 U.S. ___ (Dec. 3, 2020) and Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , No. 20A87, 592 U.S. ___ (Nov. 25, 2020).\" 1. Applicable Tier of Scrutiny The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment disallows a Sta te from enacting a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah (\"Lukumi \"), 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993). Any \"law burdening religious practice that is not neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous of scrutiny.\" Id.at 546. California argues that the Regional Stay at Home Order is a neutral law of general applicability, thus triggering on ly a rational basis review. Pl aintiffs argue that the Regional Stay at Home Order's goal is \"to infringe upon or restrict practi ces because of their religious motivation,\" as evidenced by the California governor's statements and by the fact that the Regional Stay at Home Order treats religious instituti ons differently from certain other non-religious entities. Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 533. Plaintiffs point to the following statement by the Governor of California: Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 12/21/20 4- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28Q: Thank you Governor. Can you clarify why churches and salons are in Stage 3 and not Stage 2. Um, what makes them more high risk than scho ols, for example? Uh, what factors are you weighing here when you decide what goes into what phase? A: Yeah, we're, we're looking at the science, epidemiology, looking again at frequency, duration, time, uh, and looking at low risk-high reward, low risk- low reward, looking at a series of conditions and criteria, as well as best practices uh from other states and nations. (Pls.' Br. at 19:8-16 (citing ECF No. 47 at 13-14).) The Court cannot draw a reasonable inference from this exchange that the Governor implied that religion is a \"low reward\" activity, as Plaintiffs suggest. 38The Court would have to make multiple assumptions and leaps in logic to so inte rpret the statement. A more plausible interpretation of the statement is that the State con sidered a cost-benefit analysis in addition to \"science, epidem iology, frequency, duration, [an d] time\" in formulating its COVID-19 restrictions. Plaintiffs also fail to mention that, in the same exchange, the Governor stated that the State was \"very sensitive to those tha t want to get back into church\" and that the State was going to \"see what [it] can do t o accommodate that.\"39The Court finds no evidence of statements made in connection with t he challenged rule that can be viewed as targeting Plaintiffs' faith or singling out any ot her religion. In this regard, Plaintiffs have not shown that California's Regional Stay at Home Order harbors \"an official purpose to disapprove of a particular religion or of r eligion in general.\" See Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 532. The Court is nonetheless bound by precedent in this circuit to conclude that the Regional Stay at Home Order is subject to strict scrutiny revie w. See Hart v. Massanari , 266 F.3d 1155, 1171 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that all courts wi thin a circuit are bound by 38The Court also notes that this statement is from May 2020, befo re the current Regional Stay at Home Order was implemented. 39Press Conference Tr. 50:58-51:23, 53:25-54:20 (May 7, 5- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28vertical stare decisis authority of a circuit panel's precedential opinion). A Ninth Circuit panel, in a published opi nion, has held that Roman Catholic Diocese mandates strict scrutiny review when a state imposes different capacity restrict ions on religious worship services as compared to non-religious activities and entities, like retail stores, in response to the pandemic. Dayton Valley , 2020 WL 7350247, at *4. There, the panel found that strict scrutiny review was trigge red because a Nevada directive imposed a fifty-person cap on houses of worship, and only a 50% cap on other activities and entities including casinos, bowling alleys, and restaurants. Id.Although California's Regional Stay at Home Order does not allow casinos, bowling alle ys, and restaurants to open at a greater capacity than religious services, it does allow retail establishments to do s o. Thus, the Court is bound to analyze the Order un der strict scrutiny. 2. Strict Scrutiny Analysis Strict scrutiny review requires that the challenged restriction \"be 'narrowly tailored' to serve a 'compelling' state interest.\" Dayton Valley , 2020 WL 7350247, at *4 (citing Roman Catholic Diocese , 2020 WL 6948354, at *2). Although strict scrutiny imposes a high bar, courts have \"upheld laws\u2014even under strict scrutiny.\" See Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar , 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015) (collecting cases); cf.A d a m W i n k l e r , Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts , 59 Vand. L. Rev. 793, 809 (2006) (explaining that the Supreme Court, appl ying strict scrutiny review, has frequently upheld free exercise challenges to religio us exemptions from generally applicable laws). i. Compelling Interest Plaintiffs argue that California's goal of reducing community s pread of COVID-19 is \"not even a rational \" interest, much less a compelling one. (Pls.' Reply at 7:14-24, ECF No. 85.) Contrary to Plaintiffs' position, the Supreme Court ha s clarified that \"[s]temming the spread of COVID-19 is unquestionably a compelling interest. \" Roman Catholic Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 12/21/20 PageID.8004 6- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28Diocese, 2020 WL 6948354, at *2. Although Plaintiffs urge this Court to find that focusing on community spread would not serve the ultimate promotion of pu blic health and safety, courts lack both the expertise and the authority to make such d etermination. See id. at *8 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (\"The Constitution 'principally entru sts the safety and the health of the people to the politically accountable officials o f the States.'\"); cf. Williams- Yulee , 575 U.S. at 449 (\"[P]olicymakers may focus on their most press ing concerns.\"). Following the precedents, the Court concludes that California ha s a compelling interest in reducing the co mmunity spread of COVID-19. See Roman Catholic Diocese, 2020 WL 6948354, at *2; Dayton Valley , 2020 WL 7350247, at *4 (\"[S]lowing the spread of COVID-19 is a compelling interest.\"). ii. Narrow Tailoring Having found that California has a compelling interest in reduc ing community spread of COVID-19, the Court turns to determining whether Califo rnia's Regional Stay at Home Order is narrowly tailored to the compelling interest. Narrow tailoring requires that the law restrict no more than is necessary to advance the g overnment's compelling interest. See Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Sec. Div. , 450 U.S. 707, 718 (1981) (\"The state may justify an inroad on religious liberty b y showing that it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state interest.\" ). California explains that the Regional Stay at Home Order narrowly tailors the restrictio ns to its objective of slowing the community spread, by assessing the risk profile of an activity based on seven-factor risk criteria, which consider: an activity's (1) ability to acco mmodate wearing masks at all times; (2) ability to allow physical distancing; (3) ability to limit the duration of exposure; (4) ability to limit the amount of mixing of people from differing households and communities; (5) ability to limit the amount of physical intera ctions of visitors/patrons; (6) ability to optimize ventilation; and (7) ability to limit ac tivities that are known to cause increased spread. (Grabarsky De cl. Ex. 7, ECF No. 81-1 Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 7- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28Applying these factors, California assigns a similar risk profile for religious gatherings, as it does for weddings , funerals, college lectures, a nd political expression. California requires those activities to take place outdoors. Da nce studios and gyms must also only operate outdoors. The Regional Stay at Home Order does not grant an exemption for other activities that similarl y may involve gathering in grou ps for a prolonged period. All operations at amusement parks , museums, zoos, aquariums, ca mpgrounds must stop, and so must convention centers, concert venues, movie theatres, family entertainment centers, live performances, and live audience participation in professional sports. 40 Restaurants may not open for dine-in.41Plaintiffs do not dispute that California treats a church more favorably than those non-exempted activities with resp ect to gathering outdoors. Plaintiffs direct the C ourt's focus on other exempted a ctivities that can proceed indoors. A law's underinclusiveness\u2014its fa ilure to reach all activities th at implicate the interest\u2014can constitute evidence that \"raise[s] doubts about whet her the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.\" See Williams-Yulee , 575 U.S. at 448 Entm't Merchants Ass'n , 564 802 (2011)). For example, in Lukumi , \"[i]n a textbook illustration of that principle, [the Court] invalidated a city's ban on ritual anima l sacrifices because the city failed to regulate vast swaths of conduct that similarly diminished its asserted interests in public health and animal welfare.\" Id.(citing Lukumi , at 543-47). \"Underinclusiveness can also reveal that a law does not actually advance a compelling interest.\" Id. at 449.

Religious Gatherings California explains that religious gatherings, weddings, funerals, college lectures, and political expression involve features that raise the risks associated with the second through fifth factors in California's risk criteria: many people gathering at one time and socializing with each other; p eople from different households g athering nearby each other for a prolonged time; and vocalizi ng, conversing, or singing explain s that these risks can be mitigated when the gatherings ta ke place outdoors because aerosolized transmission is slowed in open air. (Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 93.) As to the seventh factor, California has shown that there have been known COVID- 19 outbreaks tied to religious gatherings in the San Diego County 42and in the Southern California Region.43Both outbreaks occurred when religious gatherings could take pl ace indoors at limited capacity.44Plaintiffs do not deny the existence of these outbreaks. California's health experts also considered reports and studies of known outbreaks tied to religious gatherings in other states. (Watt (West Virginia).) b. Retail, Limited Services, and Transportation Grocery stores and retail shops can operate indoors at fixed cap acity. 45Limited services, including laundromats, t hat do not require close cont act may remain open with 42Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 17, ECF No. 81-1 at 174 (County of San Dieg o's letter to Awaken Church, COVID-19 Outbreak Notification). 43Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 21, ECF No. 81-1 at 187-91 (Grace Community Church outbreak in Los Angeles). 44The outbreak in San Diego County occurred on or around November 23, 2020, and the outbreak in Los Angeles County occu rred on or around October 22, 2020. See supra n.43 and 44. 45Find the status for activitie s in your county, https://covid19. ca.gov/safer-economy/.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 9- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28modifications. 46The transportation sector, such as airports and train stations, may also remain open with modifications.47California explains that these activities have a lower risk profile because interactions between patrons in these places are typically asocial, distanced, and short in time\u2014with patrons generally seeking to le ave the store as soon as possible. (Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 \u00b6 62, 117, 126.) Singing, recitation , or speaking in unison, such as reciting a prayer together, is not common in retail, lim ited services, or transportation settings. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 119, 127.) These assumptions lower the third through fifth risk factors. The record before the Court does not include know n cases of an outbreak tied to retail, grocery shopping, la undromats, or transportation hubs. c. Worksites in Critical Infrastructure Sectors The Regional Stay at Home Order allows employers in the critical infrastructure to designate essential workers to perform on-site tasks that cannot be done remotely\u2014subject to specific industry guidelines. (Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 13 at \u00b6 2 .d, ECF No. 81-1 at 153.) California explains that job sites present a lower risk profile than in non-employment situations because the State has greater control over enforcing specific industry guidelines applicable to each industry: fact ories must screen workers, dev elop safety plans, and install engineering controls such as plexiglass barriers, to protect ind ividuals who work near each other. ( Id.Ex. 30, ECF No. 81-1 at 264-73.) The employers are also subject to various health and safety requirements enforced by State labor authoriti es. (Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 121, ECF No. 81-4.) Binding la bor agreements in certain indus tries impose other mandatory measures such as routin e testing of on-site staff. ( Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 33 at \u00b6 4, ECF No. 81-2 at 5 (describing testing requirements in work protocols implemented by Screen Actors Guild); Id.

Work shifts may be grouped to control personnel to whom the employees are regularly exposed, thus diluting the risk presented by likelihoo d of strangers from different bu bbles randomly mixing at each gathering. (Rutherford Decl. Ex. 19 (CDC guidance for emplo yers), ECF No. 81-4 at 549.) Besides, an employer is better positioned to control its employees' behavior affecting the risk factors. (Watt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 87, 104.) 48The record lacks evidence of known outbreaks associated with jobsites in Southern California. In sum, California assigns different risk profiles to different sectors based on a neutral, seven-factor risk analy sis, which explains the different restrictions that apply to various exempt sectors. While some courts may disagree with the l ocal public health officials' assessment of what constitutes comparable activities ba sed on the seven risk factors, the Court finds that such risk assessment\u2014which necessarily reflects the local climate, infrastructure, and pub lic health outcomes of prior po licies\u2014is a question of policy-making better deferred to t he local public health officia ls. California applied a neutral seven-factor risk criteri a and concluded that the risk pr ofile of religious gatherings, college lectures, political expre ssion, weddings and funerals, cultural ceremonies, dance studios, and gyms, called for outdoor restriction but not an en tire closure order. California applied the same risk factors a nd concluded that activities wit h a higher risk profile, 48Our legal system already recognizes that \"[c]ontrol or right of control by the employer . . . characterizes the relation of the employer and employee.\" See Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell , 269 U.S. 514, 521 (1926)). And our legal system imposes certain obligations on employers that are not imposed on other entities. For example, strict lia bility is only imposed on empl oyers in workers compensation law. See Lawrence M. Friedman & Jack Ladinsky, Social Change and the Law of Industrial Accidents, 67 Colum. L. Rev. 50, 71 (1967) (explaining the development of a workers compensation system that \"fix[es] liability upon the employer regardless of fa ult\" in industrial accidents). In torts, the strict-liability principle of respondeat superior may hold an employer liable for a negligent act of its employee committed during the course of performing the job. See generally David Jacks Achtenberg, Taking History Seriously: Municipal Liability Under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 and the Debate over R espondeat Superior, 73 Fordham L. Rev. 2183, 2204 (2005) (explaining that the respondeat superior doctrine is traditionally explained by (1) an employer's power to control th e direct tortfeasor, (2) the l egal unity between the tortfeasor and his employer, (3) the master's implied warranty of the servant's fi tness, or (4) the need for reciprocity between benefits and responsibility). There is no equivalent legal doc trine recognizing a house of worship's control over its congregation.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 1- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28including amusement parks, museums, zoos, aquariums, dine-in res taurants, on-site consumption at wineries, conven tion centers, concert venues, movies, family entertainment centers, live performances, cardroom s, tattoo shops, hair salons, barbershops, nail salons, body waxing studios, indoor pools, hot tubs, saunas, and hotels ( for in-state reservations or out-of-state reservations not exceeding the minimum quarantine p eriod) should be closed. Based on the same risk factors, California concluded that retail , transportation, and limited services activities\u2014with better ability to limit duration of ex posure, amount of mixing of people from differing households, amount of physical interaction s of visitors, and limit activities that are known to caus e increased spread\u2014could proce ed indoors with specific limitations. The Court concludes that California did exactly what the narrow t ailoring requirement mandates\u2014that is, Calif ornia has carefully designed the different exemptions to match its goal of reducing community spread, based on a neutra l, seven-factor risk analysis. The Court does not find that California's Regional S tay at Home Order is underinclusive as to exceed the boundaries drawn by the First Amen dment. Therefore, based on the record before the Court, Plaintiffs are not likely to show that the Regional Stay at Home Order restricts more than is necessary to advance the California's compelling interest in reducing community spread. 3. Consistency with Precedents The Court's strict scrutiny analysis does not conflict with the recent decisions issued by the higher courts. In Roman Catholic Diocese , the Supreme Court found that the 10- or 25-person ban instituted by New York was an effective ban on al l religious activities in the applicable zones. See2020 WL 6948354, at *3 (\"The restr ictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from atte nding religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty.\"). The same cannot be said about the Regional Stay at Home Order's exemption allowing outdoor religio us gatherings, given that the climate in Southern California Region is warm year-rou nd. The record does not Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 12/21/20 PageID.8010 2- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28contain evidence that various entities that had been limited to operate outdoors in the past versions of California's COVID-19 response, such as gyms and re staurants, have not been able to follow the outdoor manda te. Further, no capacity limit is placed on outdoor worship. Based on the above, the Court does not find that the R egional Stay at Home Order, as applied to San Die go County and the Southern Californi a Region, places an effective ban on religious services. But see Burfitt v. Newsom , BCV-20-102267 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Dec. 10, 2020). InDayton Valley , the Ninth Circuit considered the State of Nevada's regulatory scheme and concluded that Nevada's restrictions were not narrow ly tailored to the State's proffered interest. Nevada \"ha [d] not explained why a 50% occu pancy cap is good enough for secular businesses where pe ople congregate in large groups or remain in close proximity for extended periods\u2014such as at restaurants, bars, ca sinos, and gyms\u2014but is not good enough for places of worship.\" See Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Ct. 2603, 2613 (2020) (Mem.) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). Here, California places similar or greater limits on restaurants, bars, card rooms, gym s, and other activities that share a similar risk profile with religious entities. See supra Part I.B. Many other activities with heightened risk profiles are entirely closed. Retail stores, m anufacturing plants, and certain other activities are allowed to operate indoors with additional limitations and industry-specific measures to reduce the risks, but California explains that those activities have dissimilar risk profiles compared to houses of worship. Beca use California has shown that it applied a neutral, multi-factor risk analysis to place e ach activity on a risk spectrum and imposed no more restriction on houses of worship than necessar y, the Court finds that Dayton Valley is factually distinguishable. Plaintiffs have not shown that a lesser restriction\u2014for example, a llowing indoor worship relying only on mask wearing, social distancing, and sanitization measures\u2014 would have achieved California's compelling interest in curbing the community spread of the virus. Mask wearing, social distancing, and sanitization reduc es the likelihood of transmission per interaction, whereas stay-at-home orders and c apacity regulations reduce Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 Filed 12/21/20 3- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28the number of interactions of Decl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 81-5.) To the extent that Plaintiffs seek to hold indoor worship ser vices at 20% of the church's maximum capacity, 49the Court notes that California has already tried a similar measure, which allowed indoor worship at 25% capacity. That restriction proved insufficient to prevent outbreaks at houses of worship in the San Diego County 50and the Southern California Region.51If the dire trend of COVID-19 in Southern California\u2014 which has left the Reg ion's ICU capacity at 0%52\u2014proves anything, it is that the State's efforts to implement curfews and less restrictive restrictions were not enough. Plaintiffs do not dispute the existence of these outbreaks or th e unavailability of hospital beds in the Southern California Region. Plaintiffs merel y proffer that they are not aware of any confirmed COVID-19 cases tied to Plaintiffs' churc h. In general, a local government is not required to prove that a particular individual has contributed to a known social harm, before implementing a law that seeks to prevent the harm. Just as a restaurant with no known COVID-19 cases tied to it is bound by a valid public health regulation, so must a house of worship that has no known COVID-19 cases tied to it. This is especially so when the social harm sought to be mitigated is community spre ad of a deadly virus, whose exact path of cont agion is hard to trace. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed o n their Free Exercise Clause claim at a final hearing. // // // 49At the hearing held on December 18, 2020, Plaintiffs requested that the Court match the restrictions in place for the retail sector, which is currently capped at 20% of maximum capacity under the Regional Stay at Home Order.

Balance of Equities and Public Interest COVID-19 poses a significant health risk to everyone in Southern California, the nation, and in fact, the world. In San Diego, emergency rooms ar e having to turn patients away, and the hospitals are being quickly overwhelmed with the m ost recent surge of patients infected with COVID-19. The Court is mindful that a San Diego Superior Court judge rece ntly enjoined enforcement of the Regional Stay a t Home Order, as applied to st rip clubs and restaurants, based in part on the finding that the plaintiff strip clubs \"ha ve done nothing to contribute to the spread of COVID.\" See Midway Venture LLC v Co. of San Diego, No. 37-2020- 00038194-CU-CR-CTL (Cal. Sup. Ct. Dec. 16, 2020). The injunction is now stayed, 53but it is worth highlighting the dichotomy between that ruling and t his one as an example of the dangers of having individual judges make public health policy . See Roman Catholic Diocese , 2020 WL 6948354, at *3 (holding that, although the Court needs t o conduct \"serious examination\" of restri ctions placed on religion, \"[m]em bers of this Court are not public health experts, and we should respect the judgment of tho se with special expertise and responsibility in this area\"); Id. at *8 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (recognizing that \"[f]ederal courts . . . must afford substantial deference to sta te and local authorities about how best to balance competing policy considerations during the pandemic\" while not abdicating the courts' responsi bility to assess the constitutionality of a challenged law); S. Bay United Pentecostal Church , 140 S. Ct. at 1613 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in the denial of application for injunctive relief) (\"Our Constitution principally entrusts '[t]he safety and the health of the people' to the politically accountable officia ls of the States 'to guard and protect.'\"). It is for that reason that this Court gives \"substantial deference\" to the California public health officials' attempt to protect the safet y of its people. The Court does not doubt that not being able congregate indoors imposes a burden on Plaintiffs' religion. Nevertheless, the Court also recognizes t hat the burden is a 53Midway Venture LLC v Newsom , No. D078375 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2020).Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 92 5- 20cv08651 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28temporary one, with widespread vaccination in close sight. The Court concludes that it serves the public interest to continue to protect the population as a whole, in this dire phase of the pandemic. V. CONCLUSION Plaintiffs have not shown that they are entitled to injunctive relief before a trial on the merits. Consequently, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' renewed motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminar y injunction (ECF No. 75). IT IS SO ORDERED.

This is Stephanie . We have everybody on the line, I believe. I'm going to go ahead and get started with a few reminders of everyone . I know it's been a little while. The courtroom decorum is the same even though it's a teleconference . There are no recordings of the proceedings of any type, and the transcript may be obtained by Dana Peabody, our wonderful court reporter , who is also on the line. I ask that everybody please keep their phones muted, especially while others are speaking because we pick up a lot of background noise, and all members of the public must keep their phones muted at all times. And please do not hang up until the proceedings are over as we get a beep in the middle of the proceedings , and it makes things difficult . With that, I'm going to go ahead and call the matter. Calling matter Number 1, 20cv0865, South Bay United Pentecostal Church, et al., versus Newsom, et al., on calendar for a telephonic hearing. If we can start with plaintiff . MR.

LiMANDRI : Charles LiMandri is also present on behalf of the plaintiffs . MR. MEUSER: Mark Meuser from the Dhillon Law Group, also here on behalf of plaintiff . THE COURT: Okay. And who do we have for defendants ? MR. GRABARSKY : Good morning. This is Deputy Attorney General Todd Grabarsky on behalf of the state defendants . MS. PLANK: Good morning, Your Honor. This is Lisa Plank, Deputy Attorney General, also on behalf of the state defendants . MR. WHITE: Timothy White on behalf of the County of San Diego defendants . THE COURT: Okay. Good morning, everyone . First of all, I have reviewed the plaintiffs ' ex parte motion for injunction , the state's response , the plaintiffs ' reply on the issue of the request for delayed briefing schedule , the plaintiffs ' supplemental briefing , the state's response with the declarations of Dr. Watt, Dr. Rutherford , Dr. Stoto, S-T-O-T-O, Dr. Maldonado , and the open letter signed by 98 Stanford University -- various experts, the county's response and joinder, and the state's response , the county's Order of Emergency Regulations effective December 10th, the Ninth Circuit's mandate that remanded this case that was filed on December 16th, and then I also saw that plaintiff filed over [29] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 29 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 200 pages of expert declarations and supplemental material the day before yesterday after the briefing was over. And I can tell you, I'm happy to consider those materials , but if I do, I need to let the defendants peruse them and respond in writing. And I understand plaintiffs are saying time is of essence here, so it's up to you. If you want me to consider those additional materials , even though they were filed late, I will, but I'll set a supplemental briefing schedule allowing the state and county to respond. To plaintiff , do you want me to consider those supplemental filings? MR. JONNA: Good morning, Your Honor. This is Paul Jonna for the plaintiffs . I think there's sufficient material in our other filings that the Court can proceed today without the supplemental material . THE COURT: Okay. That's what I'll do then. And let me just start before I hear argument from the parties by saying how sorry I am that the two periods of soaring pandemic right -- I hear someone talking in the background . Hello? Sounds like it's muted now. No. MR. JONNA: Your Honor, I'm not sure who that is. This is Paul Jonna. I'm not sure what that sound is. THE COURT: Yeah, I'm not sure either. Someone is talking in the background . I hear you say, Page 30 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 court.\" If that's you saying, \"They're talking in court,\" could you mute your microphone so you don't interrupt the court proceedings ? There you go. Mute it. Someone is having a hard time figuring out their mute button. Okay. Hopefully we've got them muted now. As I started to say, I'm sorry that the pandemic rates are corresponding to the weeks before Easter and Christmas . I mean, the irony is not lost with me that the last time we had one of these telephonic hearings , we all recognized that Easter is one of the most important days in the Christian faith, and yet we'll all stuck at home, and here we are, the week of Christmas , and it's sad, and I really wish it was not the case. And I do think that both sides recognize the validity of the other parties' argument . I think the church recognizes that the state has an obligation to protect its citizens from contracting the disease, and I think the state recognizes the importance of allowing citizens to gather to practice their religion . When one is surrounded by death and disease, I think religion becomes more, not less, of an important part of our lives, and I know the church doesn't want to do anything that would harm the lives and the well-being of their parishioners . So it's a tough balancing act, and I think that's reflected in the various court opinions on the issue. Even the supreme court opinion had little in the way of 31 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 and much more non-precedential , one- or two-judge concurring or dissenting opinions , which isn't quite as helpful as a majority opinion might be. And I think the nature of the pandemic is such that the regulations and restrictions are constantly fluctuating , which also makes it difficult . Overlaid over all of this is what appears to be a consensus from the supreme court and the federal court -- the supreme court -- the federal court should give substantial deference , not total deference , but substantial , to state and local authorities on how to best balance these competing policy interests . So I think I should take a hard look at the current restrictions and whether similarly situated businesses and services are treated the same as religious services because that's what was so offensive about the New York rules. Religious services were treated harshly than similarly situated activities . So let me hear from South Bay Pentecostal Church first about how religious institutions are treated harsher than other institutions . Isn't just about everything shut down right now? MR. JONNA: Your Honor, good morning. It's Paul Jonna. Yes, let me just start by saying that, as the Court likely recognizes , the landscape has fundamentally changed in 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 32 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 of the Diocese of Brooklyn case as well as the Calvary Chapel case. The landscape has dramatically changed, and the issues are actually quite simple. And Justice Gorsuch noted it well in the Diocese of Brooklyn case when he said, \"It's now time, it's past time, to make it plain that while the pandemic poses many grave challenges , there's no world in which the constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores and bike shops, but shutter churches , synagogues , and mosques.\" And as the Court knows in that case, we were dealing with the 25-person cap on indoor worship, and as the Court also knows, in California over 99 percent of the state currently is in a total indoor worship ban, which is far worse than the restrictions in New York. There is no argument that the state can make in light of the binding precedent on this court to support an indoor worship ban other than an appeal to the Brooklyn Diocese dissent, which I'll explain in a little bit and which sort of advocates a deference to medical experts and a focus on transmission risk. The Court -- THE COURT: Before you get there, let me just interrupt you for a minute. There is no cap on the number of people that can gather outdoors . Is that correct? MR. JONNA: That is correct, Your Honor, but that's not the standard . There are numerous -- and so let Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 33 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 what the Court said initially , which was -- you focused on, and what the state focuses on, which is the Diocese of Brooklyn comment on there being especially harsh treatment to religious institutions . And what they use as an example, what they said, that there's an example of a store in Brooklyn , for example, where hundreds of people could be shopping whereby as in a nearby church or synagogue would be barred from having more than ten or 25 people inside. So that was the example the Court used as especially harsh treatment . In San Diego and throughout California we've got thousands of stores with hundreds of people, but not one person's allowed to worship inside a church right now. Worship in a church belongs in a church, it doesn't belong in a parking lot, just like shopping at a grocery store belongs in a grocery store, not in a parking lot. So it's not sufficient to say that, you know, worship outdoors is permitted ; therefore , churches are treated okay. Now, if you look at the Diocese of Brooklyn case, what they said was that the orders weren't neutral towards religion because they restricted them to a greater degree than essential businesses . And they use examples like acupuncture facilities , campgrounds DktEntry: 18-2, Page 34 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 facilities , factories , schools, and, like I said, the large stores, hundreds of people shopping there in a given day. The standard articulated by the court, which is binding on this Court, is that if some secular activities are privileged over religion , then strict scrutiny is triggered , and the Ninth Circuit made that clear in the Calvary Chapel case referring to the Diocese of Brooklyn decision represented a seismic shift in the litigation concerning these restrictions on religious gatherings , and courts throughout the United States -- and, you know, we had other supreme court rulings vacating denials of injunctions out of the Third Circuit in Colorado , and the governor in Colorado actually completely lifted the restrictions on churches in response to the Brooklyn Diocese case. So, Your Honor, I think the issue today, really, is just simply, you know, there's no way that justifies the indoor worship ban. The only question before the Court is, you know, what occupancy limits can the state actually place on church, and our position is that it has to be treated just like an essential business . And that's made clear in both the Diocese of Brooklyn case as well as the Calvary Chapel case. If you look at the current Regional Stay-At-Home Order, every -- churches are closed indoors completely [35] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 35 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 essential businesses are allowed to open with no restrictions , and retail is at 20 percent. So it's clear that the documented restrictions are greater on churches than they are on any other industry , and so, therefore , the orders are not neutral and not generally applicable . And then the same thing applies with the entire \"Blueprint ,\" if you look at all the different tiers, and I don't think it would be productive for me to give all the examples , but basically in the purple tier, you've got churches closed, but you have all essential retail open, all government offices, appliance stores, convenience stores, gas stations , pharmacies , hotels. You know, the list goes on. Hair salons. THE COURT: I thought hotels were closed. MR. JONNA: This is in purple tier 1. THE COURT: I thought they say you couldn't allow anyone from out of state to stay in a hotel, and if they came to a hotel, they had to close -- I'm trying to listen because I think retail -- I agree retail is treated differently , but other than retail, I'm trying to figure out what else is treated differently . MR. JONNA: Okay. So it's important to remember there's a lot of different restrictions . Currently there's a Regional Stay-At-Home Order, and 99 percent of California , there's a total ban on indoor worship. So a lot of industries [36] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 36 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 are closed, but all essential businesses are open. Schools are open, professional sports and film production is open, and retail at 20 percent, and churches are completely closed indoor, and essential businesses , it's important to remember , include gas stations , liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries , retailers , like Best Buy, Home Depot, Walmart, pharmacies , grocery stores. All of these entities currently are allowed to have indoor operations . And then when I mentioned hotels, I was actually referring to purple tier 1 under the \"Blueprint ,\" and in purple tier 1, you've churches again closed indoors, but all essential retail open, all government offices, all appliance repair shops, convenience stores, day camps, farmers' markets, gas stations , hotels. That was in purple tier 1. Laundromats , auto repair shops, banks and credit unions. The list goes on and on. And they even subsequently modified purple tier 1 to allow hair salons, barber shops, personal care services , like tattoo parlors and massage therapy. So that's all allowed while churches are closed indoors. And to say that, you know, outdoor worship suffices is -- that is absolutely not the correct analysis at all. And you look at the other tiers, though, Your Honor. You've got the red tier, the same issue. Houses of worship were limited to 25 percent or a hundred people, whatever was less, while you had food packaging , laundromats Page 37 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 with no limits. And then you have, you know, other subject to more generous limits. And then the orange tier and the yellow tier, all of the tiers treat religious institutions worse than similar secular industries . In order to satisfy strict scrutiny and advance a compelling interest , the law also can't leave any appreciable damage to the supposedly vital interests unprohibited . That's from the Church of Lukumi case. We know that the \"Blueprint \" and the Regional Stay-At-Home Order leave unprohibited a vast amount of damage to the interest of stopping COVID because there's so many exceptions for activities that involve large groups of people in close proximity for long durations . Like I said, factories , warehouses , meat packing plants, and the like. (Interruption by the court reporter .) MR. JONNA: And then we also know from Judge O'Scannlain in his dissent in the Harvest Rock case that the state has conceded that there have been outbreaks at a range of workplaces the state is allowing to stay open, like food production , warehouses , meat processing plants, and grocery stores. It's also important to know that the only court to date that has substantively applied the Diocese of Brooklyn case to the California framework was a court just last Friday in the Burfitt versus Newsom case, the state court 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 38 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 that California 's total and complete ban of indoor religious services are, arguably , harsher than any other set of restrictions considered by the courts in all of the cases cited. And the Court found that the Tier 1 discriminatory restrictions on the latest worship services , as well as Tier 2 and 3, were not neutral or generally applicable and were subject to strict scrutiny under Diocese of Brooklyn . Also, this is something the Court asked about in the beginning , and this is a very important point. The state makes the point that the application of strict scrutiny here depends on whether there's -- that there's evidence of statements targeting churches for discriminatory treatment , and that's not the standard at all. The supreme court made it clear in the Diocese of Brooklyn case that their decision did not hinge on any statements made by the governor . They said that they put those statements aside and that the restrictions still could not stand. And in the Calvary Chapel case, which struck down the restrictions in Nevada -- which, again, were far more generous to churches than the ones in California because they allowed indoor worship with a cap whereas it's completely banned in California -- they struck those down even though there was no statements targeting religious services in the -- in that case. And the Ninth Circuit didn't say in Calvary 18-2, Page 39 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 directive to treat secular activities with a similar transmission risk better than religion . They just said strict scrutiny is triggered because secular activity entities were treated better than religious services . And in California , the governor 's \"Blueprint \" does, in fact, target churches for discriminatory treatment . We do have some evidence in the record that the Court already reviewed about the governor 's comments regarding a church being a higher risk/lower reward, but in Brooklyn Diocese, what Justice Gorsuch said was that the only -- this is a quote. \"The only explanation for treating religious places differently seems to be a judgment that what happens there just isn't as essential as what happens in secular spaces. Indeed, the governor is remarkably frank about this. In his judgment , laundry and liquor, travel and tools are all essential while traditional religious exercises are not. That is exactly the kinds of discrimination the First Amendment forbids.\" And Judge Collins previously noted in his dissent in the Ninth Circuit ruling in this case, the constitutional benchmark is government neutrality , not government avoidance of bigotry. So the other thing, Your Honor -- and again, this is a point that Your Honor addressed in the outset and that the state has mentioned -- the state is appealing to the dissenting positions in the Diocese of Brooklyn case, and I think it's very important that the Court carefully considers this because [40] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 40 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the state is leading the Court into reversible error. The position advanced by the state and the position that the Court sort of alluded to at the outset is this deference to experts and this focus on the transmission risk, which if you read the dissent opinion in Diocese of Brooklyn , that's all Justice Sotomayor and all the dissenting justices talk about. That position was rejected . THE COURT: Let me just interrupt you. Justice Kavanaugh says it as well in the opinion. He says substantial deference should be given to the state. MR. JONNA: He said -- he made it very clear that -- and this is a quote. \"Judicial deference in an emergency does not mean wholesale judicial advocation .\" THE COURT: Absolutely , right. No, I agree, but he also says substantial deference needs to be given. MR. JONNA: When you look at what Justice Breyer said, though, he emphasized the fact that members of the scientific and medical communities tell us that the virus is transmitted more easily in gatherings with features of religious worship services , and Justice Sotomayor said, \"Medical experts tell us that large groups of people gathering , speaking , and singing in close proximity pose a greater risk.\" And then she also said that, \"Epidemiologists generally agree that religious services are among the Page 41 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And they focused on what the state is focusing on, which is this transmission risk test, which is not what the supreme court adopted. If you look at the decision , it did not apply that test. And the test is that worship services need to be treated the same or better than all secular activities . And if that appears to be a break from supreme court precedent , then that's a break the Ninth Circuit recognizes when it said, \"The Diocese of Brooklyn represents a seismic shift in free exercise law.\" And it said, \"It compelled them to treat churches no less favorably than any secular industry .\" And in that regard, Your Honor, it's important to note, as it was in the Diocese of Brooklyn case, that South Bay United Pentecostal Church has a perfect track record. They've had no COVID infections from services , and that's unchallenged . The state can't produce one shred of evidence linking their church to the spread of COVID-19. And the only evidence they referred to -- THE COURT: Let me just interrupt you there. You're not asking for the state rule -- to carve out an exception just for your religious services , correct? I mean, just because you're -- just because South Bay Pentecostal Church has done a good job at successfully stemming the spread, if other religious institutions -- you're not asking me to rule South Bay Pentecostal can hold their services but no of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. JONNA: What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that this was something relevant to the supreme court in the Brooklyn Diocese case. The fact of the matter is, they can't point to evidence that churches have been, you know, these deadly sources of viral spread. And in our case, in particular , they've got no evidence that our church, our client's church, has been any problem whatsoever in terms of spreading the virus. So -- THE COURT: That's why I'm asking you, should I be looking at the -- any evidence of your church or should I be looking at evidence of any religious gatherings spreading the virus? MR. JONNA: I think that there is no evidence of any -- let me just -- let me answer your question in a more nuanced way. We know, for example, Your Honor -- and this is referenced in the Delgado declaration -- that there was a study of a million church services , a million, with 17 parishes , and this was a study referenced in the Delgado declaration , paragraph 6. And they were not able to identify -- I think they were able to identify five in-person exposures , but zero transmissions of the coronavirus . And this is a Thomas McGovern \"Evidence -Based Guidelines That Celebrate Mass Safely.\" And if you look at the state experts, like Stoto, for example, they criticized Dr. Delgado saying that 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 43 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 done a sufficient comparison of the risk of infection between different industries and how they worship. So basically what they're saying is that it's not possible to do a comparison . They haven't, they can't, and it's their burden, so I don't think there is evidence in the record suggesting that churches -- and there has been no study, there's been no study, for example, can the state point to a study where they've looked at people attending church the way Bishop Hodges is handling church services ; social distancing , mask-wearing, temperature checks, following every CDC guideline . Have they done a study to show that that's not a safe way to attend church, that that's more dangerous than going to a grocery store? According to their expert, there is no way to compare it. They tear apart the Delgado comparison . They say you can't compare transmission risks, so I think that the question is -- is -- I mean, I think the supreme court obviously found it relevant to ask if there was any evidence of the church at issue in that case spreading the virus. There wasn't, and that's the same point I'm making with respect to South Bay Pentecostal Church and more broadly if the Court wants to consider the issue. I think there's plenty of evidence that you can attend church safely if you follow CDC protocols . And there's no studies in the record anywhere to suggest that attending church with following the protocol proposed by Bishop Hodges and the [44] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 44 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 CDC is an unsafe or more dangerous activity than going to Costco shoulder to shoulder and, you know, with people facing every direction , and, you know, we've seen all the pictures , I don't have to explain it, but there's no study comparing those. And the state basically says that's not even possible to do when they criticize the Delgado study. And as Judge O'Scannlain noted in Harvest Rock defense, he basically said Dr. Watt and Dr. Rutherford are not qualified as experts to opine on what takes place at religious worship services or how people interact there as opposed to other settings in other public life. And California can't credibly argue that it regulates industries solely because of the transmission risk. I mean, they say that, but they can't make that argument because if you look at the most recent stay-at-home order, every essential business is allowed to stay open regardless of transmission risks. So the list of essential workers was never about transmission risk. They thought groceries store should stay open because people need to eat. And churches need to stay open because they're engaging in Constitutionally protected activity , and people need to go to church. So the transmission risk assessment is not what they're using. They're using it to justify their ban on worship, but they're not using it to justify their allowing all these essential businesses to stay open. The Supreme Court in the Diocese of Brooklyn case and the [45] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 45 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Calvary Chapel case, Ninth Circuit, were both clear that churches can't be treated worse than essential businesses . And again, it's important to look at the examples the Court gave. The examples were acupuncture facilities , campgrounds , garages, manufacturing plants, transportation facilities , large stores, factories and schools, and then casinos, restaurants , bars, amusement and theme parks, gym and fitness centers, movie theaters , mass protests . They didn't just limit the comparison to this transmission risk assessment . That was a minority opinion in the dissent in Diocese of Brooklyn . That is what the state is advocating . They're advocating the dissent and the minority opinion. I also have some points on singing, Your Honor. I don't know if you have questions about that, but the singing ban is also not neutral. It applies to certain industries and not others. And in the Robinson case, recently that the supreme court vacated the lower court's denial of an injunction against the mask mandate where there was secular exceptions allowed and instructed them to reconsider in light of Diocese of Brooklyn , so we think the supreme court is clear to us that they believe that the ruling in Brooklyn Diocese is broad enough to impact issues beyond just occupancy cap. And we think there is no compelling interest in banning singing only in church, but allowing it, for example, in Hollywood productions and sporting events. There's no evidence of deaths caused by congregational [46] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 46 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 singing. They can't just use anecdotes from back in March in Washington . And we do have studies that we referred to, again, that church -- that singing in churches is safe, and we cited that in the Delgado declaration . It was a report produced by a collaboration between university and three music institutes in Germany called \"The Risk Assessment of Coronavirus Infections in the Field of Music,\" and it basically said singing can safely take place in worship services so long as social distancing and mask-wearing is adhered to and the ventilation is adequate . The other thing I would point out, Your Honor, is that the courts in these recent cases, including the supreme court -- this is a very important point -- were not persuaded by the defendants ' doom-and-gloom statistics of the COVID-19 rates of infection . The supreme court heard all of these arguments in the Diocese of Brooklyn case, and they weren't persuaded that that impacted the constitutional analysis when you're restricting houses of worship. And it's clear -- we read the briefs in the Diocese of Brooklyn case, but it's even more clear from reading the dissent, no matter how serious the pandemic is, the free-exercise analysis required equal treatment for churches . And we submitted evidence from the supplemental Delgado declaration that the COVID-19 statistics in 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 47 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 New York are essentially identical . I mean, if you look at the new daily cases and you look at the daily deaths, actually , in some respects , it's worse in New York. If you look -- THE COURT: What about -- let me ask you this: What about the availability of ICU beds? Is that something I should consider ? MR. JONNA: I think that Dr. Delgado looked at that in his comparison , and I think -- I think overall the situation in New York and California is comparable . I think that there's no -- that the stats here in California don't warrant departing from the supreme court framework for analyzing these issues, so I think that to the extent -- THE COURT: Delgado's declaration is -- unfortunately , things keep changing , but it's dated, right? I mean, there's a lot of things that have happened since his declaration was filed as far as ICU beds and numbers in California . MR. JONNA: Here's what I would say about Your Honor's question . No matter how bad the pandemic is and no matter how few IC beds there are, if it's okay to keep Costco open, it's okay to have churches open. They can't have it both ways. If they're going to regulate churches with a total indoor ban, then they have to treat secular institutions the same way. They're letting secular industries stay open, like Costcos, like liquor stores, like marijuana dispensaries . They can't say, oh, but the ICU beds have fallen to zero. We have to [48] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 48 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 close churches . That's not how it works. That would be a direct contradiction of the binding precedent now in Diocese of Brooklyn and Calvary Chapel. So I think that it's worth looking at the numbers to show that it really does not make a difference , but even if you accept their doom-and-gloom statistics and even if you accept that the world's coming to an end, if it's okay to keep a Costco open, it's okay to keep churches open. And that's the fundamental principle that we've now learned from the supreme court. There's also been recent rulings that the Court may be interested in from state courts in California . I'm sure you've heard about the ruling concerning strip clubs, concerning restaurants in San Diego. There's been another ruling concerning outdoor dining in Los Angeles, and I don't have to necessarily quote those, but those obviously involve far less important rights than worship. And courts have found that the -- looked at these precise orders in California and issued injunctions . So I think that the courts are now looking more carefully at what's going on, and I think that when you're dealing with fundamental constitutional rights, the right of worship, you can't just say, oh, but they're allowed to do it outdoors . I mean, that's not how it works. Most churches can't do it outdoors . A lot of churches can't do it Page 49 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 places in California , it's very cold. People get -- so that's a flawed approach to this analysis . And I would urge the Court to reject the state's invitation to adopt the dissenting position in the Brooklyn Diocese case, and I'd like to reserve some time for rebuttal , Your Honor. THE COURT: Okay. Let me hear from the state first, and the first question I have is, doesn't the Ninth Circuit opinion in Calvary Chapel compel me to apply strict scrutiny because retail establishments are treated differently ? MR. GRABARSKY : Good morning, Your Honor. This is Deputy Attorney General Todd Grabarsky . The short answer to your question is no. Roman Catholic Diocese and the recent Ninth Circuit opinion in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley make clear that the restrictions on issues in those cases were especially harsh, this proportionate restriction that singled out and targeted religion , and again -- THE COURT: But the Calvary Chapel -- let me just -- Calvary Chapel specifically says basically retail establishments are treated differently than church; therefore , strict scrutiny applies. Doesn't it? MR. GRABARSKY : Not entirely . In Calvary Chapel there's a list of the activities on page 9 of the list opinion that -- the Ninth Circuit was looking at was the totality of Nevada's restriction . So it included retail, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 50 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 included casinos, which were subject to a 50 percent cap, bowling allies, arcades, and restaurants , which were also subject to a 50 percent cap, which was extremely -- the 50-person cap for worship services was extremely harsh and disproportionate when you compare it with a 50 percent cap on casinos, let's say, and, you know, we have a sense of what, you know, a humongous casino on the Las Vegas Strip looks like. 50 percent cap can -- would probably include hundreds , if not thousands , of people in a single casino whereas worship services , we're capped at 50. In California casinos are treated the same or if not worse than worship services . THE COURT: Let me ask you about some of the areas of -- some of the businesses that the church raises. What about professional sports? What about day camps? What about meat packing plants? What about transportation facilities ? I mean, those are all singled out in California beyond retail. Doesn't that make it that we need to take a look at -- with strict scrutiny ? MR. GRABARSKY : No, Your Honor, and to correct a point that Mr. Jonna had made, for all those sectors or industries , there's no outright exemption for those industries that, for example, meat packing plants or the entertainment industry , it's not true that those industries can operate as they could before the pandemic . There are specific tailored particular restrictions that are imposed on those industries to address [51] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 51 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the particular risk of transmission that those industries pose. So, for example, in factories or meat packing plants, there's a state requirement that there are Plexiglass barriers that separate the workers, especially the workers who have to work in close proximity with one another. In addition , generally , factories , meat packing plants, the entertainment industry are subject to be a whole host of employment regulations that exist in a pre-COVID world. So, for example, if one factory worker gets sick, it's a requirement that the employer 's notified , and precautions about that illness can be made to separate that worker from the rest of the factory. Quarantining , contract tracing is much easier than in large, indoor, congregated gatherings that are open to the public, including concerts , including spectator sporting events, and including worship services . In addition , the entertainment industry is required to do frequent , if not daily, testing of the employees who work in that industry . Plaintiffs aren't suggesting , the state's not suggesting , that that that's even feasible for worship services . And, you know, we all understand the importance of testing, so if, again, an employee , whether in the entertainment industry , whether in a meat packing plant, or elsewhere , tests positive , immediately that employee 52 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 can contact trace that employee to understand on which shift he or she was, to immediately test the other employees that they were working with and quarantine and isolate those employees as well. So again, the restrictions that California imposes on various industries are particular , and they're particular to address the specific risk of harm that those industries pose. Again, it wouldn't be feasible , and I don't think plaintiffs are suggesting , that the -- that the requirements for factories , meat packing plants, or the entertainment industry be carried over to houses of worship or concerts or spectator sporting events. So to go back to Your Honor's initial question in Calvary Chapel and in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn , both courts were dealing with especially harsh restriction that singled out and targeted religion and imposed disproportionate restrictions on religious activities that was disproportionate to the harm, especially when you compare the much more lenient restrictions on other activities . So, for example, in New York, ten percent or 25 percent cap for religious services . I'll note that that cap applies both for indoor and outdoor religious services . As Your Honor has recognized in California , outdoor religious services is permitted statewide in unlimited numbers, and the state's not suggesting that's the ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 53 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 for indoor services , but I think the point about the lack of numerical restriction for outdoor services goes to the idea that this isn't a particularly or especially harsh restriction on indoor services unlike was the case in New York. In addition , just to address Mr. Jonna's comments about the comments from Governor Cuomo that targeted or threatened religious service -- threatened religious groups, that might be dicta, but the supreme court was concerned about that targeting , and that's completely absent here. We addressed the comments from Governor Newsom in our brief, and I don't think there's anything more to say about that, but even putting aside those comments from Governor Cuomo, there was evidence in the record that -- in addition to those comments and separate from those comments , that New York targeted Orthodox Jewish groups via the ad hoc zones that were drawn; specifically to encapsulate large neighborhoods that had large Orthodox Jewish population . Here all of the zones and the tiers and even the Regional Stay-At-Home Order is based on preexisting political boundaries , not the ad hoc zones. So there's simply no evidence , and I don't think plaintiffs are alleging , that California is gerrymandering the zones and the tiers to include religious groups. As I said, the list of activities in Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley, the list of activities on page 9 of the opinion that so [54] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 54 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 concerned the Court, the only -- you know, casinos, arcades, restaurants , that's not an issue in California because in California , those activities are subject to the same or more stringent numerical stats. THE COURT: Let me ask you this. Kind of an interesting twist. Should I be analyzing the rules as initially established by the state and county or should I be analyzing the rules that are now going to be enforced because of the Midway Venture ruling, allowing restaurants to open and strip clubs to open? Clearly if it's the latter, that limits your argument that they're treated harsher. MR. GRABARSKY : It's the state's position that the \"Blueprint \" and the Regional Stay-At-Home Order, as they are, are in force and effect. Plaintiff in this case, that's what they're challenging in their renewed preliminary injunction and TRO motion. They're challenging the \"Blueprint \" and the Regional Stay-At-Home Order. If Your Honor would like additional briefing on how the Midway Venture case affects plaintiffs ' motion or request or how it affects California 's restrictions , then the state would be happy to provide additional briefing on that issue, but again, it's the state's position that the executive orders as encapsulated by the \"Blueprint ,\" Regional Stay-At-Home Order, and the limited stay-at-home order, those are the orders that are Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 55 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 THE COURT: Can you address -- I don't need anything more on that. I mean, point me to where -- what are you relying on as far as the scientific evidence that there's increased risk of contracting COVID if someone goes to religious services indoors even if they're socially distanced and wearing masks and following all the rules, as the plaintiff indicates they'd be willing to follow? MR. GRABARSKY : The pin cite from our declarations are: Rutherford declaration , paragraph 90 through 94, also, paragraphs 101 through 110; Dr. Watt's declaration , paragraphs 38, 53, 70, 99; Dr. Stoto's declaration , 37 through 40. To address further evidence of the particularly great risk of COVID community transmission posed by large indoor gatherings , including worship services , the declaration -- my declaration , declaration of Todd Grabarsky , contains numerous articles about super-spreader events from throughout the entire time of the pandemic . Initially when, unfortunately , the virus came to this country from back in March, we briefed that extensively . I'm sure Your Honor is well familiar with those super-spreading events. That continued to the present. THE COURT: Yeah, you know, I have difficulty -- I don't think I can rely on newspaper articles or magazine articles as a source of -- you know, I don't think that's an expert opinion, and I think it -- I have difficulty relying on those for my expert opinions at this point. [56] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 56 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. GRABARSKY : Your Honor, I understand that. Our experts do opine about the particularly great risk of community transmission posed by large, especially indoor, gatherings . THE COURT: Even if they socially distance and wear masks? MR. GRABARSKY : Yes, and the pin cites that I said before. THE COURT: Okay. MR. GRABARSKY : And Dr. Rutherford also does talk about the so-called super-spreader events. I believe he attributes -- he points to reports and studies indicating that about 80 percent of COVID infections are tied to group gathering . And that's at paragraph 37 of Dr. Rutherford 's declaration . So when you look at those -- that expert testimony coupled with the newspaper articles , those newspaper articles are not -- may not be dispositive , but they must be given some weight. I believe in the state's request for judicial notice that we filed along with our opposition , we cite the cases that explain the extent to which newspaper articles and other reports that might not otherwise be given weight, let's say, at trial or possibly at summary judgment , but they may be given weight at this posture, at the preliminary injunction or Temporary Restraining Order phase of litigation , Page 57 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Docket Number 81-7 in which we explain the Ninth Circuit -- this Court's authority explaining that, again, newspaper articles and other evidence that might otherwise not be given much weight can be considered when deciding a preliminary injunction . And this is especially true when we supplemented those articles with the expert testimony from Dr. Watt, Dr. Rutherford , and Dr. Stoto. Another comment I would like to make about Roman Catholic Diocese and Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley, those opinions did not overturn the supreme court's, you know, 30-year-old precedent in Employment Division versus Smith or The Church of Lukumi matter, which requires courts to engage in the comparisons with other secular activities to determine what secular activity might be comparable . Again, in Lukumi, the Court defined \"comparable secular activity \" as activity that endangers the government 's interest in a similar or greater degree than the religious activity at issue. And that's at 508 U.S. pin cite 543. So that -- there's nothing in Roman Catholic Diocese that suggests that that's been overturned . To the extent the Ninth Circuit identified a potential arguable seismic shift in the precedent , it's the state's reading of that opinion, but that's -- what Roman Catholic Diocese might have done and probably could do is expand the definition of \"neutrality \" where religious activity ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 58 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 to particularly harsh, especially harsh and disproportionate restriction , when you look at the particularly lenient restriction for secular activity . That suggests that those restrictions are no longer neutral, and that's -- that is possibly what the arguable seismic shift that was identified in the Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley Ninth Circuit opinion. Again, in New York worship services were subject to ten-person and 25-person capped indoor and outdoor whereas in the red zone, essential businesses had no cap, no percentage cap, no restriction . In the yellow zone -- even nonessential businesses had no percentage cap, no restriction . Again, in California presently under the Regional Stay-At-Home Order, there's as 20 percent cap on retail. In the \"Blueprint \" under Tier 1, there's a 25 percent cap. And to address Mr. Jonna's point about that -- suggesting that Roman Catholic Diocese stand for the proposition that any time you have any more lenient restriction on any secular activity , that automatically mandates strict scrutiny , that simply can't be the case for two reasons: First, the supreme court had this exact question in front of it. One week later, one week after Roman Catholic Diocese, the plaintiff in the Harvest Rock Church matter, California church, asked the supreme court, said, look, you all just decided Roman Catholic Diocese. You applied strict scrutiny , and you enjoined a portion of New York's restriction . So we ask you 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 59 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 to California 's restriction . Just take the New York Roman Catholic Diocese opinion, apply it to California , apply strict scrutiny , find strict scrutiny is not met, and enjoin California 's restriction . The supreme court denied that request, said, no, we're not going to issue that injunction , remanded it not just to the Ninth Circuit, but all the way back down to the district court for the district court to engage in a factual inquiry to determine to what extent the Roman Catholic Diocese opinion, again, about especially harsh restriction applies to the particularity to California 's restriction . And that's what's happening in Harvest Rock. As Your Honor might be aware, that case has been briefed, and there's a hearing this afternoon before Judge Bernal in the Central District . And that's what the Ninth Circuit did in this case. Again, plaintiff asked, the Ninth Circuit said, look, Roman Catholic Diocese controls this, so we're requesting the Ninth Circuit to issue an injunction against California 's restriction based on Roman Catholic . The Ninth Circuit declined that -- the Ninth Circuit declined that request, remanded back to this Court, and here we are for this Court to engage in that factual inquiry as to whether California 's restrictions are disproportionate , are especially harsh, are not nuanced, and not tailored , are not find-tuned as they were in New York. And we briefed that extensively -- that question [60] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 60 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 extensively as to -- and demonstrating that the answer to that question is no. But there are stark differences with the particularly harsh restrictions that were at issue in Roman Catholic Diocese. The second reason we know that it can't be the case that strict scrutiny is automatically mandated is when we look at the extreme of what plaintiffs are asking, and I think one apt example is hospitals . Right now hospitals are permitted to operate at 100 percent and, in fact, are probably operating much more over capacity , whatever capacity , but their -- whatever numerical or capacity is mandated under, say, the fire code given the dire circumstances of the state pandemic right now. So it simply can't be the case that because hospitals are permitted to operate at 100 percent capacity and, in fact, are operating at over 100 percent capacity , that houses of worship automatically need to be permitted to operate at 100 percent capacity or, in fact, over 100 percent capacity . That just simply can't be the case, and that, you know, is absurd, to say the least. Another example would be zoning laws. THE COURT: I think what they're saying is -- wait a minute. What they're saying is not that it must mean that houses of worship have to operate at 100 percent, but that strict scrutiny applies. And so then you look at the strict [61] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 61 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 scrutiny , why do you apply 100 percent to hospitals and not apply it to religion ? I think probably under your example, if you're only considering hospitals and religious establishments , it would probably pass strict scrutiny muster, but you'd have to look at strict scrutiny as opposed to a rational basis. MR. GRABARSKY : Possibly , but that would entirely eviscerate the comparison that Lukumi and Employment Division versus Smith require, and, again, Roman Catholic Diocese did not overturn those opinions , and there's nothing about Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley that suggests that, that Lukumi or Smith is no longer operative law and the definition for a comparable secular activity no longer applies. I think it would also be worth noting -- we didn't cite this case in our brief, but the Sixth Circuit issued an opinion in Commonwealth versus Beshear, and it's a Westlaw citation 2020WL7017858, in which the plaintiff -- the issue was Kentucky 's order shutting down all schools, religious and secular schools alike, and the plaintiffs in that case were making a similar argument to plaintiffs here saying, look, our religious mandate compels us to educate our children in religious settings , a religious school, and religious schools are shut down, but movie theaters and stores are given favorable treatment , and those are allowed to be open, so, therefore , you have to open the religious schools just like movie theaters and shopping malls and other retails are open. [62] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 62 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 The Sixth Circuit denied that request, and yesterday the supreme court refused to stay the Sixth Circuit opinion. And I would implore the Court to read the way -- and the Sixth Circuit opinion was issued after Roman Catholic Diocese, and I would implore the Court to read that opinion and to see the way the Sixth Circuit distinguished Roman Catholic Diocese and found that strict scrutiny wasn't appropriate in that case, even though there were secular activities that was treated more favorably than the religious activity issue in that case; namely, religious schools. Again, so the overall point is that the Court -- you know, for the reason that Harvest Rock remanded back to district court and the Ninth Circuit remanded in this case back to this court, this Court must engage in the comparative risk assessment between religious worship services and other secular activities that plaintiffs are pointing to, and plaintiffs present no evidence calling into question the comparative risk assessment that Dr. Watt, Dr. Rutherford , and, to an extent, Dr. Stoto engage in. California applies a host of objective , neutral, scientific , and data-driven risk factors that apply generally to all activities , religious and secular alike, to determine what risk of COVID transmission those activities pose and what the appropriate restrictions would be to minimize that risk in the appropriate way. [63] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 63 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Again, plaintiffs don't call into question any of those comparative risk assessment . To the extent that they continue to rely on Dr. Delgado for that comparative risk assessment , I believe we've addressed that, and this Court has already found that Dr. Delgado's opinions on that issue are entitled to minimal weight and are simply -- must be rejected . A point about the Burfitt case. I'll also draw the -- just to note that that case was decided under California state law to which the state defendants are immune in this case and also draw the Court's attention to the People versus Calvary Chapel San Jose case, also a state court case, which also was looking at Roman Catholic Diocese, refused to adopt that opinion wholesale and distinguish California 's restrictions to New York restrictions that were at issue in Roman Catholic Diocese, and we've included that order in -- I believe it's Exhibit 2 of the first Grabarsky declaration . But even if strict scrutiny were applied, it's the state's position that it's clear that in this case, strict scrutiny -- that state's restrictions would meet strict scrutiny . I'll draw Your Honor's attention to Your Honor's first -- very first ruling in this case in which Your Honor found that strict scrutiny was met on the state's previous total ban on in-person religious worship services , indoor and outdoor. Your Honor had found strict scrutiny was met in that [64] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 64 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 case. It's clear that the \"Blueprint \" and the Regional Stay-At-Home Order is much more nuanced and fine-tuned, to use Your Honor's words in the October 15th ruling. It's much more nuanced and fine-tuned, and, therefore , it narrowly tailored to address the great undisputable compelling interest in stemming the spread of COVID, and plaintiffs don't appear to dispute that. To walk through, you know, we've addressed the evolution of the state's restriction since March in our briefings , and Your Honor's well familiar with it, with that evolution , having walked through it in the October 15th order, but the evolution , the loosening , the restricting , when cases move up, the imposition of a statewide mask mandate, the imposition of a statewide indoor singing and chanting ban, all demonstrate that the state is exploring less restrictive alternatives , but the numerical and percentage cap on all indoor gatherings , spectator sporting events, concerts , movie theaters , and worship services , it's simply necessary to curb the spread, and I think the state's evolution of how it's been imposing these restrictions over time demonstrate that, and that's exactly what strict scrutiny is required . It required the state to explore other options and figure out what's best, and that's exactly what's gone on here. Plaintiffs don't appear to dispute that. In plaintiffs ' reply they seem -- initially in [65] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 65 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 plaintiffs ' initial briefing they appear to offer alternative -- what they argue are less restrictive alternatives , one of which is the Great Barrington declaration , which it appears on page 9 of their reply that they're walking away from and taking a step back from. That's great that they're -- that plaintiffs are now disavowing the Great Barrington declaration and the focus protection or herd immunity strategy that that declaration proposes . We've addressed thoroughly in our briefing why that declaration is unscientific and harmful and radical, and it is really a fringe theory about how you address the COVID pandemic . So, therefore , the only alternative that plaintiffs are left with, having disavowed the Great Barrington declaration , are social distancing , masks, and hygiene, and potentially quarantining those who have the symptoms in their church. And as I pointed to the pin cite as Your Honor asked earlier, our experts unequivocally opine that those are insufficient to curb -- insufficient measures to curb the spread at large indoor gatherings , and that's especially true given that this virus can spread even among those who exhibit no symptoms and who may not know that they're infected . And just a point to -- to address Mr. Jonna's comment about the perfect record or the supposed perfect record at plaintiffs ' church, there is evidence that members of plaintiffs ' church have been infected with the COVID-19 virus. [66] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 66 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 There's evidence that the community , the Chula Vista community , has over 12,000 infections . Although plaintiffs point to the pastor's declaration that he is unaware that anyone from -- that anyone, any congregant , has been infected as a result of the worship services , the pastor doesn't purport to be an expert in the way that the virus spreads. There's no evidence that the person -- the congregants from plaintiffs ' church who were infected , that they've been contact-traced to figure out the source of their infection , and again, as Your Honor suggests , we may not just analyze this on a church-by-church basis. That -- and I don't think -- it appears Mr. Jonna agrees that we shouldn't carve out exceptions for certain churches that may be able to show that they -- that congregants haven't been infected as a result of worship services . You know, I think what plaintiffs are asking for are -- is this Court to enjoin the restriction statewide and for the reason -- the evidence of Dr. Rutherford , Dr. Watt about outbreak tied to indoor gatherings , like worship services , coupled with the newspaper articles and other accounts of such super-spreader events, including those in San Diego -- and I think I might have forgot to mention the Awaken Church outbreak that happened very recently that we attached to the Grabarsky declaration . So all that evidence in the totality shows that, know, [67] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 67 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 the indoor worship services pose an exceedingly great risk of outbreak . As Your Honor had indicated , a majority of the supreme court advocates for substantial deference to publicly accountable public health officials who are acting in the space of scientific and medical uncertainty . I'll also note that Justice Kavanaugh signed on to this principle in addition to his concurrence in Roman Catholic , but his concurrence in Andino versus Middleton , the case that we cite in our briefs, and that principle has been applied for over a hundred years by the supreme court, even when individual rights and liberties are at stake and even in nonemergency context. And we cite to a list of cases dating back to 1912 and extending all the way into this century on page 20 of our opposition brief. Plaintiffs -- no response to that. Another point that plaintiffs addressed in their reply, and I think Mr. Jonna made some comments today, plaintiffs suggest that Dr. Watt and Dr. Rutherford are entirely unqualified to opine about what goes on in worship services , and I think the word in their reply brief that they use is that their declarations and their opinions are worthless because, quote, they have no idea what happened in a Pentecostal Sunday service. Plaintiffs haven't pointed out anything ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 68 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Dr. Watt or Dr. Rutherford 's declarations or opinions about the way the virus spreads in large indoor gatherings . They haven't said, well, here's the way that our church service is wrong based on -- or different based on what Dr. Watt or Dr. Rutherford presumed . It doesn't appear that plaintiffs are disputing that what they seek to do is hold large -- hold an indoor gathering of hundreds of people limited only to the fire code, to have people sit together , distance among households albeit, but sit together and engage in a communal activity , communal experience for hours. It doesn't appear that plaintiffs or Mr. Jonna today is disputing that, and that's what Dr. Watt and Dr. Rutherford are basing their opinion about community spread in such large indoor, in-person gatherings , and again, there's a pin cite that I referred to earlier. Those opinions hold true even when distancing , even when masking, even when hygiene precautions are imposed. Even when all those precautions are imposed, the large indoor gatherings pose an exceedingly and -- exceedingly great risk of community transmission . About the singing and chanting ban, just to address Mr. Jonna's comments about that, Dr. Rutherford and Dr. Watt do opine that singing and chanting , even while wearing masks, even while distancing , poses an exceedingly great risk based on the way that this virus spreads. It's increased in forceful exhalation that expels a much Page 69 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 particles , infected viral particles . That poses much increased risk. We've addressed that in our briefing , and Dr. Watt and Dr. Rutherford specifically attest to that. And I'll note that courts have adopted the California Court of Appeal in the County of Los Angeles versus the Superior Court case that we cite, takes that position exactly, that singing and chanting pose an even greater risk even when masking and even when distancing precautions are taken. The Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church case from the Seventh Circuit that we cited to also takes that position . To the extent Dr. Delgado has changed his position on that, you know, we've addressed why Dr. Delgado is not qualified to give opinions on epidemiology or public health with the way that the virus -- or infectious diseases spread in the community . We've addressed that, and his opinion, which I'll note has changed over time, should be rejected . Lastly, and I really hope that this doesn't get lost in the analysis , I would like to address the balance of equities prong of preliminary injunction . Everything that we've been talking about -- when we're looking at this prong, everything we've been talking about can be put aside. The constitutional analysis as to whether plaintiffs are likely to succeed under the free exercise claims, that's not relevant to the balance of equities . And it's a bit shocking that in plaintiffs ' brief [70] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 70 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 they don't even address this prong at all. And there's really barely two paragraphs in their initial motion addressing the harm that the virus is really reaping on California , especially right now. And we've addressed this extensively in our briefings that were filed on Monday. Today's Friday. Those briefings are already outdated . Yesterday nearly 400 people died in California and 50,000 were infected . Today, as it stands right now, ICU capacity statewide is at 3 percent. In Southern California -- sorry, ICU availability in California statewide is at 3 percent. In Southern California there is no ICU availability . It's at zero percent. Or around zero percent. In the San Joaquin Valley, it's less than 1 percent. I'll note that ICU availability isn't just about treating those who are -- become greatly ill from the disease. It's about other illnesses and injuries , severe illness -- and immediate illnesses or accidents , car accidents , gunshot wounds. This state had a particularly dire situation , and it seems -- you know, plaintiffs use -- plaintiffs ' counsel, Mr. Jonna, uses the term \"doom-and-gloom statistics .\" I hope that's not flip or sarcastic . I mean, that's the reality of what's going on. These are grim statistics , but they're true. Plaintiffs don't appear to dispute them. There simply couldn't be a worse time to enjoin the restriction that are doing their best to curb the spread of this dangerous and deadly disease that's really 71 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 throughout the state, also in San Diego, in Southern California , where plaintiffs ' church is located, right now. To the extent the supreme court looked at the statistics in New York, the Roman Catholic Diocese was decided about a month ago. Probably the statistics , you know, weeks before, so we're talking about New York statistics that might have been different and are certainly outdated given the fact that briefings were filed this week are now greatly outdated . As I've indicated in the brief, in our briefing , in the past month in California , cases, hospitalizations , and deaths have tripled, and that's the daily rate for cases, hospitalizations , and deaths have tripled. Again, enjoining the restriction that plaintiffs are asking for would exacerbate , would definitely exacerbate , the situation that -- the really dire situation that's going on now. And I don't -- I don't think plaintiffs dispute that, that lifting these restrictions would cause, at a minimum, an increased spread in churches throughout the state. So again, there simply can't be a worse time, and I wish plaintiffs had addressed the balance of equities more in their briefing so we could look at the particular statistic that they're identifying in their briefing , in their reply briefing , but, you know, the fact that they've just left that necessary prong for the preliminary injunction analysis out seems to indicate that they might not dispute the statistic , Page 72 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 might not dispute the great harm that would occur if the restrictions were lifted. Your Honor, I know I've been talking for a while. I'm happy to answer any particular additional questions that you might have. One other sort of administrative housekeeping matter I would like to address, since Your Honor has indicated , and plaintiffs , I think, agree, that Your Honor's not going to look at these new declarations that were filed on Wednesday . We would ask that those be stricken from the record. We would ask that Your Honor do that. But again, I'm happy to answer any additional questions about the state's restrictions . I know they're complicated , I know things are changing almost daily. So if Your Honor has any other questions , I'd be happy to answer them. THE COURT: No. Does the county have anything to add? MR. WHITE: Not much, Your Honor. We join completely in Mr. Grabarsky 's arguments that they state just because there is no daylight between the county's public health order and the state's restrictions . The county's public health order does not reference or contain any restrictions on religious services other than incorporating the state's industry guidances and regulations would impose guidance of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 When the state has eased the restrictions on the County of San Diego, for example, when we're placed in the red tier, the county did not impose any additional or more restrictive restrictions upon worship services or other industries . And so the arguments , again, with the state are the same as against the county, and the county's order would rise and fall with the Court's ruling on the state's restrictions because they pass through. To the extent there are claims under the California Constitution , we've made the argument Judge Curiel's decision in Porter V. Gore is applicable here. The Court ruling under the California Constitution on the county's order is, in effect, a direct ruling by the Court judging the state's restrictions under the California Constitution , which we believe is barred by the 11th Amendment . And finally, to the extent the Court would hold strict scrutiny applied under the California Constitution applicable to the state guidelines in this case, we would adopt Mr. Grabarsky 's defense of those guidelines , even under strict scrutiny that he's put forth ably here today. THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. Mr. Jonna. MR. JONNA: Yes. Thank you, Your Honor. I'll try to be brief. I mean, the big-picture summary that we're hearing ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 74 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 defense is that they're making distinctions that the supreme court and the Ninth Circuit have rejected , and they're advocating positions that the minority has taken. I mean, the issues before the Court are really not that complicated , and I want to explain -- I want to respond to a few points that Mr. Grabarsky made, but I really think, though, that the issues are crystalized and clear in light of Brooklyn Diocese, in light of Calvary Chapel. When we talk about treating -- singling out churches for harsh treatment , again, it's important to look at what the supreme court thought was harsh treatment . They gave two examples . One example was allowing essential businesses to stay open, and they gave a list. I'm not going to repeat the list. It was, you know, transmission -based risk assessment . It was a list of essential businesses : Acupuncture , campgrounds , garages, manufacturing plants. They said it was especially harsh to allow essential businesses like that to stay open but to limit churches to ten or 25 people. They also said it was especially harsh to have department stores with hundreds of people shopping on any given day when churches couldn't have more than ten or 25 people. Again, we have a total indoor worship ban in California . The State of California is trying to justify a total indoor worship ban, and they're trying to suggest that that's narrowly tailored . I mean, the argument is -- at this point absurd [75] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 75 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 on its face. In Calvary Chapel the Court said, and I'm reading from the Ninth Circuit's decision , \"Just like the New York restrictions , the directive treats numerous secular activities and entities significantly better than religious worship services . The example they give were casinos, bowling allies, retail businesses , restaurants , arcades. They don't cite studies based on transmission -risk analysis and assessments . That was what the dissent advocated . They said since they treated secular activities better than religious services , and they gave examples , strict scrutiny was triggered , and strict scrutiny was not satisfied . In that case 50 people were allowed inside churches . In California , no one is allowed inside a church. Not one. 99.1 percent of the state has an indoor worship ban. Another point that Mr. Grabarsky made is that there's -- oh, there's other operational adjustments for these essential businesses , but that's not the point. The point is they're allowed to have indoor operations . Churches are not. So that's a red herring. As far as the experts that he refers to, these pin cites, obviously , I didn't have time to read every pin cite, but the ones I looked at, and I'm sure the Court will look at them. They don't say churches are more dangerous . They're general citations to principles of -- about indoor gatherings . There's not one study that assesses the safety of ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 76 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 following CDC protocols and whether that's inherently riskier or more dangerous than having retail open right now and Costco. And again, I mean, they've talked about the doom and gloom. Of course I'm not being sarcastic . I realize this pandemic poses challenges . Our client realizes that too. But if it poses challenges that allow retail to stay open at 20 percent, then they can't close down churches . It's that simple. It's very simple. As far as the argument , the Court pointed out that those are not admissible . We had another judge in a case in Los Angeles who said the same thing; you can't just make things up to regulate churches . There's no newspaper article exception to the Free Exercise Clause. As far as why church should be outdoors , why aren't they saying that outdoor shopping and liquor purchases should be outdoors ? I mean, so another point we heard -- another point I want to make is that the supreme court heard this evidence that you are hearing today and that is before this Court about the transmission risk and -- of churches . They rejected that analysis . That was not the approach the majority of the court accepted . And Calvary Chapel was clear that the analysis in Brooklyn Diocese represents a seismic shift. And if you want -- and what they considered comparable secular activities -- and again, they gave examples , and that DktEntry: 18-2, Page 77 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 they considered to be comparable . What the state is advocating is that -- very complicated and nuanced scientific analysis that really doesn't have a valid basis where they're going to say, this is what we consider to be comparable . Well, that's not what the supreme court says. That's not what the Ninth Circuit said. What they said was comparable was a list of essential businesses that I read off to the Court. What they're saying is no, that's the wrong approach . The right approach is you've got to listen to our expert, Watts and Rutherford , and they dictate what's comparable . That's just not the controlling authority as it stands right now. I have heard no explanation , and I still -- I don't think there is one on how a total ban on indoor worship is narrowly tailored . I mean, the suggestion is, like I said, absurd on its face. There's no way that's narrowly tailored . If the Court leaves in place an indoor worship ban in California , that would be reversible error. The other point -- hello? THE COURT: I don't know where that's coming from. Could whoever is playing the music, please turn it off. MR. JONNA: Can you hear? THE COURT: Yes, I can hear you now. MR. JONNA: The other thing I would say that Mr. Grabarsky criticizes the comparative risk assessment that our -- Delgado made. That's not our burden. We don't Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 78 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 do a comparative risk assessment . That's not the standard before the Court right now. That's not what Brooklyn Diocese stands for, and that's, again, leading the Court down to the defending position . As far as trying to distinguish the Burfitt case, which is a case that our firm was involved in, that's, you know -- there's no distinction , and the Court made it clear between the free exercise rights under the California Constitution or the Federal Constitution and any attempt to distinguish the outcome in that case is just -- you know, quite frankly, it's not legitimate . As far as the -- I didn't address all the things our expert said, and of course, we didn't disavow anything in any of our expert declarations . I don't think we need to do that. The reason why we even attached the expert declaration was to show that there are many more tailored restrictions that actually comport more closely with public health. And so we refer to things that the state obviously would agree help in terms of allowing other businesses , mask-wearing, social distancing , ventilation . And we also talk about the rise in suicide and drug overdoses , the benefits of church attendance for mental health. All of these things are in those declarations to support the overall position that, you know -- THE COURT: You're talking about the declarations -- are you talking about the declarations that you [79] Case: 20-56358, 12/31/2020, ID: 11949858, DktEntry: 18-2, Page 79 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 agreed to withdraw ? MR. JONNA: No, I believe even the ones that we didn't withdraw . I believe in the ones that were submitted with the initial filing, all those points were made. And I mean, as far as our client having a COVID infection , I think the only -- at its church, I think the only allegation the state can make, and it's pretty pathetic to hear that they're going to justify an indoor worship ban because they heard that one person at my client's church had a COVID infection -- in fact, and we made this clear. Once they prayed for someone in their church who had COVID, and there's zero evidence , because it wasn't the case, that he got it at the church. The fact that they're praying for someone in their church, and they went through a YouTube video and they found that they had prayed for someone is kind of ridiculous , what we're hearing right now. Dr. Watt and Rutherford , again, they were criticized not by us but by Judge O'Scannlain in his dissent in explaining that they were not qualified to -- and they admit it. I think Mr. Grabarsky conceded that they're not qualified to opine on how -- what takes place at religious gatherings . I'm not quoting exactly what he said, but it was along those lines. The reason why I said this is a simple issue is it goes back to what I said earlier. Despite the statistics , it is okay to allow people in retail establishments . It is DktEntry: 18-2, Page 80 of 821 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 allow exemptions for Hollywood in the case of singing. But it is definitely okay for churches to be open, and the indoor worship ban cannot survive. It needs to be struck down. It should be treated like other essential businesses , and it's that simple. There's really nothing else to say. The indoor worship ban has to be struck down. As far as San Diego, I mean, we briefed all the issues in our papers, and, you know, the county has their own order. They didn't have to implement their own order. We assert federal and state claims against the county, so I don't think those issues are dispositive for them. I think those are the main points I wanted to make. I'm happy to answer any questions the Court has. THE COURT: Okay. I will, as a housekeeping matter, grant the state's request to strike the declarations that were filed on Wednesday after the briefing was over with. Otherwise , I'll take the matter under submission . Thank you. MR. JONNA: Thank you, Your Honor. MR.

GAVIN NEWSOM, in his official capacity as the Governor of California, et al., Defendants.Case No. 20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFFS' RENEWED MOTION FOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER OR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION (ECF No. 53) I. INTRODUCTION This case arises from the State of California's efforts to limi t the spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV- 2) that has upended society. The illness caused by the virus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has killed more than ten thousand people in California and sickened many mor e. There is no known cure, widely available effective treatment, or approved vaccine for the disease. And because people infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, they may unintentionally infect others around them. Therefo re, physical distancing that li mits physical contact is essential to slow the spread of the virus.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728To ensure physical distancing, the Governor of California has i ssued a series of restrictions on public gatherings. This case centers on the re strictions for in-person, indoor religious worship services. Plaintiffs South Bay United Pentec ostal Church and Bishop Arthur Hodges III allege these rest rictions violate their constit utional rights by limiting their ability to freely exercise their religion. An earlier version of Californi a's restrictions prohibited Plai ntiffs from holding any in-person worship services. In May 2020, Plaintiffs asked the Co urt to enjoin those restrictions while this case proceeded. After the Court denied Pl aintiffs' request for extraordinary relief, they appea led to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and concurrently requested an emerge ncy injunction, which was denie d. Plaintiffs next asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief, but it, too, denied the ir request. Plaintiffs later requested that their appeal be sent back to this Court to allow t h e C o u r t t o r e c o n s i d e r whether California's restrictions should be enjoined in light o f new developments. The Ninth Circuit granted their request. Now before the Court is Plaintiffs' renewed motion for a tempora ry restraining order or preliminary injunction. In San Diego County, California's re strictions currently limit Plaintiffs' indoor worship services to 25% of building capacity or 100 people, whichever is fewer. The restrictions also forbid group singing and chant ing indoors. Thus, the challenged restrictions are more nuanced and lenient than the ru les the Court previously considered in May. Plaintiffs now argue, however, that California's \"scientific pronouncements\" are \"largely baseless,\" and that by \"all scientific measurements,\" the COVID-19 health emergency \"has ended.\" (ECF No. 61 at 1:12-15.) They also argue the State's rest rictions treat certain secular bu sinesses more favorably than religious organizations and have been enforced in a discriminato ry manner. Consequently, Plaintiffs argue the restrictions regarding indoor worship services and singing are unconstitutional and should be enjoined before trial. California paints a different picture of the current circumstan ces. It stresses the crisis is ongoing and filled with uncertainty. California highlights that COVID-19 infections and Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 PageID.5678 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728deaths surged after the Court cons idered Plaintiffs' first reques t to enjoin the State's rules. And although Plaintiffs' renewed motion cites that \"[a]s of July 14, 2020, California ha[s] only reported a total of 7,227 deaths from COVID-19,\" the State points out that this count had swelled to 12,407 as of August 31, 2020. (State's Opp'n 9:18-21, ECF 57; see No. 53-1.) California argues \"these nu mbers are enormous, far greater than the number of people killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks and those who lost their lives in Hurricane Katrina.\" (State's Opp'n 9 :21-23.) The State also claims Plaintiffs \"ignore the reason for why the State has been able to slow the spread of the disease: the imposition of the very types of public health restrictions that Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin.\" ( Id.10:14-17.) \"Enjoining restrictions because they have proven effective in curbing COVID-19 would be 'like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet,'\" the State argues. ( Id.10:26-28 (citing Shelby Cty. v. Holder , 570 U.S. 529, 590 (2013) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)).) Theref ore, both California and the County of San Diego urge the Court to again refuse Plai ntiffs' request for extraordinary relief. Ultimately, the Court concludes Plaintiffs have not met their b urden to demonstrate they are entitled to a preliminary injunction\u2014\"an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.\" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). Therefore, for the following reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs' renewed motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. II. BACKGROUND A. SARS-CoV-2 Transmission. Although much remains uncertain about the novel cor onavirus, \"there is consensus among epidemiologists that the most common mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is from person to per son, through respiratory drople ts such as those that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or projects his or her voice through Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 PageID.5679 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728speaking, singing other 57-3.2) The virus can also \"live on certain surfaces for a period of time, suggesting that fomite transmission (throu gh touching a surface where the live virus is present) is possible,\" but this method of tran smission \"is not believed to be a common method by which individuals can be infected by the vir us.\" (Dr. Watt Decl. \u00b6 29; see also Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 30.) There is also \"broad consensus that people who are not experiencing symptoms can still spread SARS-CoV-2.\" (W att Decl. \"Therefore, individuals who themselves may have been unknowingly infected by others can themselves become u nknowing transmitters of the virus.\" (Dr. Watt Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 27.) 1Dr. James Watt is the Chief of th e Division of Communicable Dis ease Control of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the California Department of Public Heal th (\"CDPH\"). (Dr. Watt Decl. \u00b6 2.) He received his doctor of medicine from the University of California, San Diego in 1993 and a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berk eley in 1995. ( Id.\u00b6 3.) Dr. Watt previously worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC \") as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer in the Respiratory Diseases Branch. ( Id.\u00b6 4.) He is also an Associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a Clinical Professor at t he University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, where he tea ches graduate students in public health and medical students about communicable disease control. ( Id.\u00b6 5.) His professional commendati ons include the U.S. Public H ealth Service Achievement medal in 2000, the National Center for Infe ctious Diseases Honor Award in 2001, and Outstanding Achievement Awards from the CDPH in 2015 and 20 16. ( Id.\u00b6 8.) Dr. Watt has been \"very involved\" in the CDPH's response to the COVID-19 pandemic , \"working full time for approximately 60-70 hours per week to address the pandemic\" fro m January 2020 to the date of his declaration. ( Id.\u00b6 15.) The Court addresses Plain tiffs' objections to Dr. Watt's declaration and other evidence below. See infra note 7. 2Dr. George Rutherford is the Salvatore Pablo Lucia Professor of Epidemiology, Preventive Medicine, Pediatrics, and Histor y at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. (Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 4.) He also leads the Division of Infectiou s Disease and Global Epidemiology in the Department of Epidemio logy and Biostatistics. ( Id.) Further, Dr. Rutherford is an adjunct professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. ( Id.) He also serves as the \"Director of Global Strategic Information Gr oup in the Institute for Global Health Sciences at U.C. San Francisco.\" (Id.) Dr. Rutherford received his doctor of medicine from the Duke University School of Medicine in 1978. ( Id.\u00b6 2.) He also received training in epidemiology in the CDC's E pidemic Intelligence Service and spent ten years in various public health positions before e ntering academia. ( Id.\u00b6 3.) Since the novel coronavirus emerged, Dr. Ruthe rford has \"devoted substantial time to researching and studying the virus\" as part of his epidemiology roles and has \"spoken extensively o n topics related to the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes during 2020,\" including through prese ntations to the California Medical Association and the California H ealth and Human Services Agency .

(Dr. Watt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-43; see also Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-52.) \"The more people that gather, the higher the likelihood that an infected person will b e present. Also, the larger the gathering, the higher the number of people who may be second arily infected by that infected person.\" (Dr. Watt Decl. see also Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 47.) \"Evidence indicates the risk of transmission at a gathering increases when individuals are in close proximity to one another for an extended period.\" (Dr. Watt De cl. \u00b6 43.) The transmission risk also \"increases with both the length of time the gathering lasts and the proximity of people to each other at the gathering.\" ( Id.) Indoor Gatherings and Singing. Although gatherings increase the r isk of transmission of the virus, this risk \"is much higher when the g athering takes place indoors rather than outdoors.\" (Dr. 43; Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 50 (\"There is a lower risk of COVID-19 transmission when a group gathering takes place outdoors; there is a much decreased likelihood of aerosolized transmission of the vir us outdoors because aerosolized particles will dissipate into the atmosphere.\").) The r e i s a l s o \" s c i e n t i f i c consensus that vocalization, even normal speech, produces aerosols, and that louder and more forceful expression such as singing and chanting produces more aerosols.\" (Dr. Watt Decl. \u00b6 45.) \"Most scientists believe that group singing, parti cularly when engaged in while i n c l o s e p r o x i m i t y t o o t h e r s i n a n e n c l o s e d s p a c e , c a r r i e s a h i g h risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus through the emission of infected droplets (which typically travel <6 feet) and aerosols.\" ( Id.; see also Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 54 (explaining that engaging in \" si n gi n g, c ha nt i ng, s ho u ti ng, a nd s pe a k in g lo u dl y . . . in a n i ndoor or enclosed space\" increases the risk of transmission).)

Plaintiff Bishop Art Hodges III has served as the senior pastor of the Church for thirty-five y ears. ( Id.\u00b6 2.)

The Church \"also perform[s] baptisms, funerals, weddings, a nd other religious ceremonies.\" (Id.\u00b6 15.) Bishop Hodges explains that \"singing is at the heart of our wor ship services, and comprises 25-50% of our typical Pentecostal worship gathering e xperience at (Bishop 3, ECF No. 53-2.) \"In a Pentecostal Church worship service, everyone is instructed and expected to sing praise to God, just as everyone is instructed and expected to pray to God. In our worship services, praying, singing, and praising God is not for spectators, it is for participants.\" ( Id.\u00b6 10.) A service at the Church also \"concludes with fellowship both inside and outside the sanctuar y.\" (Bishop Hodges Decl. \u00b6 14, further explains: \"'Zoom Mee tings' and other conferencing applications are inadequate substitutes [for in-pe rson services] as they curtail a minister's ability to lay hands upon a congregant or perform a baptism.

On March 19, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-33-20, which states that to protect the public's health, \"all individuals living in the Sta te of California\" are \"to stay at home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintai n continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors.\" (SAC Ex. 1-1.)3 California's Public Health Officer designated a list of \"Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers.\" (SAC Ex. 1-2.) Included in that list were \"[f]aith based services that are pro vided through streaming or 3The Court considers the public r ecords and government documents attached to the Second Amended Complaint because their authenticity is not questioned. The Court similarly grants the State's and Plaintiffs' requests for judici al notice as to the contents of p ublic records and government documents. (ECF Nos. 57-7, 69.) See, e.g., Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians the Colusa v. California F.3d 962, 2008).Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG 8 9 101112 21 222324 25 262728other technology.\" ( Id.at 16.) Meaning, Plaintiffs could conduct services over online streaming video or teleconferencing, but not in person at the Chur ch's sanctuary. ( See id. ) The State later released a \"Resilience Roadmap\" that categorize d workplaces into four stages. (SAC Ex. 1-3.) The roadmap placed \"religious ser vices\" in Stage 3, along with movie theaters, museums, and bars\u2014instead of Stage 2, which included retail storesand dine-in restaurants. ( Id.) The County of San Diego adopted the State's restrictions, list of essential workers, and roadmap through a series of publ ic health orders and emergency regulations. ( See SAC Exs. 2-2, 2-3, 2-4.) On May 8, 2020, Plaintiffs filed this action against various Stat e and County officials. 4(ECF No. 1.) On May 11, 2020, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended C omplaint raising claims under the First Amendment's Free Exercise, Establ ishment, Free Speech, and Assembly Clauses; the Fourte enth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses; and rights enumerated in Article 1, sections 1 through 4, of the California Constitution. (ECF No. 11.) Plaintiffs then moved for a tempor ary restraining order and an order to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction. (ECF No. 12.) Plaintiffs sought an injunction that would prevent the State and County \"from enfo rcing . . . any prohibition on Plaintiffs' engagement in religious services, practices, or a ctivities at which the County 4After changes to the pleadings and personnel, the Defendants ar e: Name Title Gavin Newsom Governor of California Xavier Becerra Attorne y General of California Sandra Shewry* Acting Director of the CDPH Wilma J.

The Court concluded Plaint iffs are unlikely to prevail on the merits of their claims f or several reasons. First, apply ing Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11 (1905), the Court found that the State \"may limit a n individual's right to freely exercise his religious beliefs whe n faced with a serious health crises\" like that presented by COVID-19. (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 25:19- 25, ECF No. 38.) The Court reasoned: \"The right to practice religion freely does not include the liberty to expose the community to communicable disease or to ill health or death .\" (Id.26:1-3.) Second, citing Church of the Lukumi Babalu A ye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520 (1993), the Court reasoned that the then-operative restrict ions did not place a burden on in-person worship services \"because of a religious motivatio n , b u t b e c a u s e o f t h e manner in which the service is held, which happens to pose a gr eater risk of exposure to the virus.\" (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 26:9-25.) The Court highlighted tha t \"the services involve people sitting together in a closed environment for long periods of time.\" ( Id.26:19-20.) The Court further determined that Plaintiffs had \"not demonstra ted arbitrary exceptions to [the] classification\" level that in-person worship servi c e s . ( Id.27:5-6.) The Court also found the reopening restrictions were \"rationally ba sed on protecting safety and stopping\" the spread of the virus. ( Id.27:10-11.) Third, the Court reasoned that, even if the equivalent of strict scrutiny applied to Plaintiffs' state constitutional free exercise claim, the restri ctions were narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest\u2014the State's intere st in protecting public health. (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 27:12-28:17.) Finally, the Court determ ined Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their federal equal protection and due p rocess claims. ( Id.29:18- 30:2.) And after further finding that neither the balance of e quities nor the public interest supported issuing a temporary restraining order, the Court deni ed Plaintiffs' motion. ( Id. 30:3-19.)Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728D. Appeal and Changing LandscapeNinth Circuit. Plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit and filed an emergency motion for an injunction that would allow them to hold in-person religious services pending appeal. (ECF Nos. 35, 41-42.) On May 22, 2020, the Ninth Circui t denied Plaintiffs' request. S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom , 959 F.3d 938 (9th Cir. 2020). The Ninth Circuit concluded Plaintiffs had \"not demonstrated a suff icient likelihood of success on appeal.\" Id.at 939. It explained: Where state action does not \"infringe upon or restrict practice s because of their religious motivation\" and do es not \"in a selective manner i m p o s e burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief,\" it does not violate the First Amendment. See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533, 543, (1993). We're dealing here with a hig hly contagious and often fatal disease for which there presently is no known cure. In the words of Justice Robert Jackson, if a \"[c]ourt does not temper its doctrinaire logic with a little practical wisdom, it will conve rt the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.\" Terminiello v. City of Chicago , 337 U.S. 1, 37 (1949) (Jackson, J., dissenting). Id.at 939. The Ninth Circuit also determined the remaining injunct ion factors \"do not counsel in favor of injunctive relief.\" Id.at 940. Judge Collins dissented. Id.at 940-47. He reasoned the State's then-operative reopening plan is not fac ially neutral or generally applicable, is subject to strict scrutiny, and does not pass mu ster under this standard. Id.at 943-46. On the last point, Judge Collins reasoned California's \"undeniably compelling interest in public health\" could be achieved through narrower re strictions that regulated the \"specific underlying risk-creating behaviors , rather than banning the particular religious setting within which they occur.\" Id.at 946-47. On May 25, 2020, California issued guidelines that allow places o f worship to resume in-person services with limitations. (SAC Ex. 1-5.) Th e guidelines contain instructions and recommendations for physical distancing during worship services as well as cleaning and disinfection protocols, training for employees a nd volunteers, and individual screening. ( Id.) Further, while citing the increa sed risk of transmission of the virus in an indoor setting, the guidelines limit attendance for in-person worship services Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728\"to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is fewer.\" ( Id. at 3.) Supreme Court. When California relaxed its restrictions, Plaintif fs were seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court. (Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 6, ECF No. 57-1.) They filed a supplemental brief to challenge the State's May 25 guide lines. ( Id.Ex. 7.) After Justice Kagan referred Plaintiffs' application for injunctive r elief to the Supreme Court, the Court denied it. S. Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom , 140 S. Ct. 1613 (2020). Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the denial of the application. Id.at 1613-14. He reasoned: Although California's guidelines place restrictions on places o f worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the Free Exercise Clause of t h e F i r s t Amendment. Similar or more severe restrictions apply to compara ble secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spect ator sports, and t h e a t r i c a l p e r f o r m a n c e s , w h e r e l a r g e g r o u p s o f p e o p l e g a t h e r i n c l o s e proximity for extended periods of time. And the Order exempts or treats more leniently only dissimilar activities, such as operating grocery stores, banks, and laundromats, in which people neither congregate in large gr oups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods. Id.at 1613. The Chief Justice further explained: The precise question of when restrictions on particular social activities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive m atter subject to reasonable disagreement. Our Constitution principally entrus ts \"[t]he safety and the health of the people\" to the politically accountable officials of the States \"to guard and protect.\" Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11, 38 (1905). When those officials \"undertake[ ] to act in areas fr aught with medical and scientific uncertainties,\" their latitude \"must be especially broad.\" Marshall v. United States , 414 U.S. 417, 427 (1974). Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject to second- gu e s si n g b y a n \" une l e c te d f e de r a l j ud ic ia r y, \" w hi c h l a c k s t he b ackground, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not ac countable to the people. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority , 469 U.S. 528, 545 (1985). Id.Justice Kavanaugh dissented. He reasoned that indoor worship se rvices are comparable to \"factories, offices, supermarkets,\" and various other secula r establishments that wereCase 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728not subject to the same occupancy cap. Id.at 1614. And although \"California undoubtedly has a compelling interest in combating the spread of COVID-19 a nd protecting the health of its citizens,\" Justice Kavanaugh reasoned California's restr ictions discriminate against religion because the State lacks a compelling justification for distinguishing between worship services and the aforementioned secular businesses. Id.at 1615. E. Continued Developments and Limited Remand Singing Restrictions. After the Supreme Court's decision, the Sta te and County officials continued to \"actively shap[e] their response to chan ging facts on the ground.\" See 140 S. Ct. at 1614 (Roberts, C.J.). In early July, the State is sued revised guidance that requires places of worship to \"discontinue indoor singing and cha nting activities\" because such activities \"negate the risk reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing.\" (SAC Ex. 1-9.) This prohibition on indoor group singing and chan ting similarly applies to political protests, schools, and restaurants.5(See Dr. Watt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 88-90 (explaining why the State imposed restrictions on these activities and notin g that other gatherings that involve \"an elevated risk of COVID-19 virus spread through singi ng, chanting or similar activities, such as those at live concerts, live music venues, l ive theatrical performances, spectator sports, recreational team sports, theme parks and indo o r p r o t e s t s , r e m a i n prohibited throughout the State\").) July 13 Closure Order. Then, on July 13, 2020, due to the \"signi ficant increase in the spread of COVID-19,\" the Stat e issued an order re-imposing many previously relaxed restrictions on indoor activities. (SAC Ex. 1-13.) In addition, for those counties on the State's \"County Monitoring List,\" which are those the State believ ed showed \"concerning levels of disease transmission, hospitalizations, insufficient t esting, or other critical 5(Gabrasky Decl. Ex. 14 (providing \"singing and chanting activiti es are discontinued\" for \"indoor protests\"); Ex. 15 (providing \"[a]ctivities where there is incre ased likelihood for transmission from contaminated exhaled droplets su ch as band and choir practice a nd performances are not permitted\" and any activities \"that involve singi ng must only take place outdo ors\"); Ex. 16 (providing restaurants \"must discontinue\" concert or performance-like entertainment \"until th ese types of activities are allowed to resume\").)Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728epidemiological markers,\" the order closed various busine sses, as well as \"places of worship.\" ( Id.) Limited Remand. Meanwhile, on July 10, 2020, while Plaintiffs' in terlocutory appeal was pending, Plaintiffs moved this Court for an indicati ve ruling to revisit its denial of their initial motion. (ECF No. 45.) The Court granted thei r request, reasoning it raised a substantial issue. (ECF No. 46.) Plaintiffs then filed thei r Second Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 47.) And on July 29, 2020, the Ninth Circuit remanded t he a p pe a l \" f o r t he limited purpose of permitting the district court to consider Pl aintiffs' request in light of the events and case law that have developed since May 15, 2020.\" (EC F No. 49.) Four-Tier System. On August 10, 2020, Plaintiffs filed their re newed motion for a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction. (Rene wed Mot., ECF No. 53.) While the motion was being brief ed, circumstances again changed . On August 28, 2020, due to \"increased knowledge of disease transmission vulnerabiliti es and risk factors,\" the State established a new four-tier system for reopening, which super seded the State's July 13 order. (Grabarsky Decl. Exs. 50-53.) Under this four-tier system, which nuanced than the State's prior restrictions, lower-risk activit ies and sectors are permitted to resume sooner than higher-ris k ones based on a series of \"ris k criteria.\" These criteria include the ability \"to physically distance between individuals from different households,\" \"to limit the number of people limit dura tion of exposure,\" \"to optimize ventilation (e.g. indoor vs outdoor, air exchange and f iltration),\" and \"to limit activities that are known to cause increased spread\" like singi ng and \u00b6\u00b6 57-71 (discussing risks of indoor religio us worship and cultural events, grocery shopping, restaurant dining, and facto ries and whether those environments involve the \"heightened risk created by group sing ing\").) Counties are assigned to a tier based on their reported COVID-19 case rate and percentage of positive COVID-19 tests. (Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 50.) For example, Tier 2 is the red-colored tier, which marks \"substantial\" risk of community disease transmission. (Id.) The State placed San Diego County into this tier when Plaintiffs' motion was being Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728briefed, County remains there now. ( Id.Ex. 52-1.) 6In this tier, Plaintiffs again may hold indoor worship services up to 25% of building capacity o r 100 persons, whichever is fewer. ( Id.Exs. 52-23.) Indoor restaurants and movie theaters in the Coun ty are subject to the same attendance restrictions as worship servi c e s , b u t b a r s , w i n e r i e s , cardrooms, concerts, sporting events, family entertainment cente rs, and theatrical performances remain either closed entirely or restricted to outd oor activities only. ( Id.Ex. 53.) Retail stores\u2014except standalone grocers\u2014are limited to 50% capacity indoors with modifications. ( Id.) Non-critical office spaces ar e de signated \"remote,\" and gyms are limited to 10% capacity indoors. ( Id.) The State and County filed oppositions to Plaintiffs' renewed m otion, and Plaintiffs filed a reply to each opposition. (State's County's Opp'n, ECF No. 61-1.)7Further, on September 4, 10, 11, and 14, and on October 1, 6, 7, 6Although the facts underlying the State's decision making with respect to its four-tier system may be subject to dispute, the fact that the State has placed a nd kept San Diego County in Tier 2 is not subject to reasonable dispute. See Blueprint for a Safer Economy\u2014Cu rrent Tier Assignments as of October 13, 2020, https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/; see also Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); King v. Cty. of Los Angeles, 885 F.3d 548, 555 (9th Cir. 2018) (taking judicial notice of \" undisputed and publicly available information disp layed on government websites\"). 7Plaintiffs lodge 142 evidentiary objections to the evidence sub mitted by California and the County. (ECF No. 61-6.) Among ra ising other objections, Plaintiffs argue certain evidence is hearsay, irrelevant, \"more prejudicial than probative,\" or lacks foundati on. ( Id.at 1:12-142.) The State responds. (ECF No. 65.) The Court overrules these objections. Evidence submitted in co nnection with a request for a preliminary injunction is not subject to the same requirements that would apply at trial. See Flynt Distrib. Co. v. Harvey , 734 F.2d 1389, 1394 Cir. 1984); , 572 F.3d 1067, 1083 (9th Cir. 2009) (\"A district court may, however, consider hearsay in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.\"); Nat'l Rifle Ass'n of Am. v. City of Los Angeles , 441 F. Supp. 3d 915, 926 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (\"Because of the extraordinary nature of injunctive relief . . . a district court may consider evidence outside the normal rule s of evidence, including: hearsay, exhibits, declarations, and pleadings.\"); Rosen Entm't Sys., LP v. Eiger Vision , 343 F. Supp. 2d 908, 912 (C.D. Cal. 2004) (applying the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in Flynt to objections to the defendant's e vidence). Rather, the eviden ce's form impacts the weight it is given when the court assesses the merits of equitable relief. Rosen, 343 F. Supp. 2d at 912. Indeed, the Court notes that both parties, including t heir proposed experts, routinely rely on various reported sta tistics for COVID-19. (See, e.g. , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 105-112 (citing statistics prepared by California and the County); Cicchetti Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19 (citing dat a from Politico and The New York Times ); Dr. Delgado Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-14 (rely ing on Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728and 13, 2020, the parties filed notices of supplemental authority , all of which the Court has considered. (ECF Nos. 60, 62-64, 66-68, 70.) III. LEGAL STANDARD T h e s t a n d a r d f o r a t e m p o r a r y r e s t r a i n i n g o r d e r a n d p r e l i m i n a r y i n j u nction are \"substantially identical.\" Stuhlbarg Int'l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co. , 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001). \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary inju nction must establish that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, th at the balance of equities tip s in [its] favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\" Winter , 555 U.S. at 20. The party seeking the injunction bears the burden of proving these elements. Klein v. City of San Clemente , 584 F.3d 1196, 1201 (9th Cir. 2009). \"A preliminary injunction is ' an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing , carries the burden of persuasion.'\" Lopez v. Brewer , 680 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)). IV. ANALYSIS Against this backdrop, the Court considers Plaintiffs' renewed request for injunctive relief against the State and County officials. Plaintiffs tailor their renewed motion to their \"Free Exercise Claims under the U .S. and California Constitutio ns.\" (Renewed Mot. 8 n.4.) Therefore, the Court focuses its analysis on these claim s. Further, the Court analyzes these claims in light of the current restrictions that apply to the Church. As summarized abov e, San Diego County is in the S tate's \"red\" tier\u2014Tier 2. Thus, worship services may be held outdoors and include singing and chanting outdoors. Indoor worship services, however, are limited to up to 100 peop le or 25% of building capacity, whichever is fewer, and may not include singing or cha nting. See supra Part II.E. 10-18, 27 (citing information from the European CDC and an assor tment of news sources like Bloomberg and US News and World Report ); Trissell Decl. Exs. A-C (a ppending CDC and Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 93-103; Dr. Rutherford Decl. \u00b6 25.) To the extent the Court cites to evidence that Plaintiffs object to, the Court has determin ed Plaintiffs' objections are meritless or the evidence deserves some weight at this stage notwithstanding concerns over its admissib ility at trial.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728Because Plaintiffs wish to hold indoor worship services that in clude group singing and exceed the Tier 2 limit on attende es, the Court considers whethe r Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claims that these restrictions violate their federal and state constituti onal free exercise rights. ( See Renewed Mot. 6:25-7:6.) At bottom, Plaintiffs' renewed motion asks the Court to second guess decisions made by California officials concerning whether COVID-19 contin ues to present a health emergency and whether large indoo r gatherings with singing pose a risk to public health. Although not binding, the Court finds Chief Justice Roberts's re asoning in this case to be compelling. The background set forth above shows the State and County \"are actively shaping their response to changing facts on the ground.\" See 140 S. Ct. at 1614 (Roberts, C.J.). And the evidence demonstrates the COVID-19 pandemic rema ins an area \"fraught with medical and scientific unce rtainties,\" where the State and C ounty's latitude \"must be especially broad.\" See id. at 1613 (quoting Marshall , 414 U.S. at 427). Moreover, neither Plaintiffs' evidence nor their arguments conv incingly show that the current restrictions exceed \"those broad limits.\" See 140 S. Ct. at 1613. Hence, the Court finds Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of suc cess on the merits of their free exercise claims. See id. at 1614 (\"Where those broad limits are not exceeded, they should not be subject to second-guessing by an 'unelected feder al judiciary,' which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public heal th and is not accountable to the people.\" (quoting Garcia , 469 U.S. at 545)). Consequently, Plaintiffs are not entitled to the \"extraordinary and drastic remedy\" that is injunctive rel ief before trial. See Lopez , 680 F.3d at 1072 (providing the court should not issue a prelim inary injunction \"unless the movant, by a clear showing , carries the burden of persuasion\"); accord City & Cty. of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs. , 944 F.3d 773, 789 (9th Cir. 2019). The Court further expands upon its analysis below while addressin g Plaintiffs' claims that (i) COVID-19 no longer presents a public health eme rgency, (ii) the State's restrictions discriminate against places of worship, and (iii) the State's restrictions have been discriminatorily enforced. Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728A. Public Health EmergencyThe Court previously reasoned that the State \"may limit an individ ual's right to freely exercise his religious beliefs when faced with a serious h e a l t h c r i s e s \" l i k e t h a t presented by COVID-19. (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 25:19-25, ECF No. 38 (ci ting Jacobson v. Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11 (1905).) In Plaintiffs' renewed motion, they arg ue the COVID-19 pandemic has stabilized in California, as the State \"h ad only reported a total of 7,227 deaths\" as of July 14, 2020. (Renewed Mot. 1:24-25 (citi ng COVID-19 Statewide Update for July 15, 2020, SAC Ex. 5-3).) They also argue curbi ng the virus is no longer \"a compelling interest\" given \"the flattening of the death and hospitalization rates, regardless of the infection rate,\" as \"numerous experts have co ncluded that the worst of the pandemic is absolutely over.\" ( Id.11:3-5.) Plaintiffs later argue that baseless,\" and that by scientific measurements,\" the COVID-19 health emergency \"has ended.\" (Rep ly to State's Opp'n 1:12-15.) Plaintiffs' position is not convincing. For one, arguments of co unsel are not evidence. See, e.g. ,Carrillo-Gonzalez v. I.N.S. , 353 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir. 2003). In determining whether to grant extraordinary relief, this Court is not bound by Plaintiffs' counsel's interpretation of CDC statistics or what they believe is an acceptable death rate for COVID-19 compared to other causes of death\u2014many of which are not contagious and are well-understood by the scientific community. ( See Renewed Mot. 1:13-3:4; Reply to State's State's evidence DC updated its coronavirus stati stics to reveal that for 94% of coronavirus related deaths, 'in addition to COVID-19, on average , there were 2.6 additional' comorbidities.\" (Reply to extrapolate this 94% statistic to determine a much smaller infect ion-fatality rate for those who \"are healthy and have no other comorbidities.\" ( Id.1:21-22.) That characteriza tion is problematic. The \"comorbidities\" listed in the CDC's data include not only commo n health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, but also conditions that COVID-19 itself can cause before death\u2014like \"pneumonia\" and \"respiratory failure.\" (Trissell \u00b6 21 (\"The disease typica lly starts as a fever and cough that progresses to respiratory distress and pneumonia in some individuals. I n its most severe form it caus es respiratory and/or myocardial failure.\").)Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728regarding infections and deaths amply demonstrates that SARS-CoV -2 and COVID-19 continue to present a public health emergency in California, inc luding in the County of San Diego. (Dr. Watt Decl. is compelling. At best, Plaintiffs' evide nce confirms that \"[t]he precise question of when restrictions on particular social acti vities should be lifted during the pandemic is a dynamic and fact-intensive matter subject to reasonable disagreement.\" 9 See S. Bay Church , 140 S. Ct. at 1613 (Roberts, C.J.). And because Plaintiffs do n ot show \"the broad limits\" of the State and County's discretion in this context are being exceeded, second guessing their decisions is not appropriate. See id. ;see also San Francisco ,9 4 4 F.3d at 789 (providing the court should not issue a preliminary i njunction \"unless the movant, by a clear showing , carries the burden of persuasion\"). Accordingly, the Court The State, of course, has a comp elling interest in protecting a ll of its residents from a communicable disease\u2014including those residents with conditions like obesity and diabetes that may ultimately be \"comorbidities\" along with COVID-19. 9Compare Cicchetti Decl. \u00b6 20, ECF No. 53-5 (claiming, as an economist, t h a t t h e r e \" i s n o scientific evidence that supports California continuing to restrict religious worship\"), andKauffman Decl. \u00b6 the state's clai m, there is no rational and legitimate scientific or public health bas is supporting the sweeping bread th and scope of the State of California's above-described closure mandate\"), and Lyons-Weiler Decl. \u00b6 29, ECF No. 53-7 (opining that the increasing cases in the United States \"are not as large of a con cern as they were in the beginning of the pandemic\" because the \"infection case fatality rate . . . is fa lling fast\" and \"COVID-19 is we was\"), andDr. Bhattacharya than 0.2%\" f or \"the non-elderly congregant s,\" whereas the mortality risk for those over seventy who contract the disease is \"still small, with 98.7% of infected elderly people surviving the infection\"), and T r i s s e l l D e c l .

B. Discriminatory Restrictions \"Where state action does not 'infringe upon or restrict practic es because of their religious motivation' and does not 'in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious belief,' it does not violate the First Am endment.\" S. Bay Church , 959 F.3d at 939 (quoting Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 532). In determining whether a law discriminates against religion, courts compare the treatment of religious conduct and \"analogous non-religious conduct\" and consider whether the gove rnmental interests \"could be achieved by narrower ordinances that burden[] religion to a f ar lesser degree.\" Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 546. As mentioned, the Court's decision to deny Plaintiffs' initial request for injunctive relief also rested on the Court's determination that the then-o perative restrictions did not place a burden on in-person worship services \"because of a reli gious motivation, but because of the manner in which the service is held, which happe ns to pose a greater risk of e x p o s u r e t o t h e v i r u s . \" ( M o t . H r ' g T r . 2 6 : 9 - 2 5 . ) T h e C o u r t f u rther determined that Plaintiffs had \"not demonstrated arbitrary exceptions to [the] classification\" of restrictions that included in-person worship services. ( Id.27:5-6.) Plaintiffs argue the revised restrictions do not pass muster under Free Exercise Clause stan dards for an assortment of reasons, including that the Stat e's four-tier system gives prefe rential treatment to secular businesses like supermarkets, retail stores, and factories. ( See Renewed Mot. 8:11-17:22.) In resolving Plaintiffs' free exercise arguments, the Court fin ds persuasive Judge Bernal's decision from the Central District of California that considered the same four-tier system in Harvest Rock Church, Inc. v. Newsom LACV 20-6414 JGB (KKx), 2020 WL and the Ninth Circuit's s ubsequent opinion, No. 20-55907, 2020 WL 5835219 (9th Cir. Oct. 1, 2020). Judge Berna l denied Harvest International Ministry and Harvest Rock Church's comparable req uest for injunctive relief, reasoning in part that they had not shown a likelihood of succe ss on the merits of their free Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 PageID.5695 8 9 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728e xe r c i se c l a i m s. 2 0 20 W L 5 2 65 5 64, a t *2 - 3. T he p la in t if f s a p pealed, and the Ninth Circuit similarly denied their emergency motion to enjoin \"Calif ornia Governor Gavin Newsom's COVID-19 Executive Orders and related restrictions (Or ders) as they apply to in-person worship services.\" 2020 WL 5835219, at *2. The Ninth Circuit explained: We find that Harvest Rock has not shown a likelihood of success on its argument that the district court abused its discretion by decli ning to enjoin the Orders. The evidence that was before the district court does no t support Harvest Rock's arguments that the Orders accord comparable secu lar activity more favorable treatment than religious activity. The Orders ap ply the same restrictions to worship services as they do to other indoor con gregate events, s u c h a s l e c t u r e s a n d m o v i e t h e a t e r s . S o m e c o n g r e g a t e a c t i v i t i e s are completely prohibited in every county, such as attending concer ts and spectating sporting events. The d issent states that the restric tions applicable to places of worship 'do not apply broadly to all activities th at might appear to be conducted in a manner similar to religious services,' but does not provide support for this point. By our read the restrictions on theater s and higher education are virtually identical. Harvest Rock also contends that the Governor failed to provide a rationale for the more lenient treatment of certain secular act ivities, such as shopping in a large store. However, the Governor offered the de claration of an expert, Dr. James Watt, in support of the claim that the ris k of COVID-19 is elevated in indoor congregate activities, including in-perso n worship services. Harvest Rock did not offer a competing expert or any other evidence to rebut Dr. Watt's opinion that congregate events like worship services are particularly risky. Because the district court based its order on the only evidence in the record as to the risk of spreading COVID-19 in different settings, Harvest Rock is unlikely to show that the district co urt abused its discretion. Id.at *1. The question, then, is whether the evidence before the Court poi nts to a different outcome than in Harvest Rock. It does not. As set forth above, the evidence shows that the State's restrictions are bas ed on the elevated risk of tran smission of the novel coronavirus in indoor settings, particularly congregate activities and those involving singing and chanting. See supra Part II.A, E. The restrictions are tailored to the State's understanding of the risk of certain activities and the potenti al spread of SARS-CoV-2, not Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728the targeted conduct's religious motivation. See S. Bay Church , 959 F.3d at 939 (citing Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 532); see supra Part II.E. And the State has continued to fine tune its restrictions \"to changing facts on the ground.\" See S. Bay Church, 140 S. Ct. at 1614 (Roberts, C.J.). ( See also Dr. Watt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-106.) That said, unlike the Harvest Rock plaintiffs, Plaintiffs here submit evidence that includes a declaration from the medical director of a family me dical group, Dr. George Delgado, who has \"been intimately involved in planning for the current coronavirus disease . . . for \u00b6\u00b6 ECF other things, Dr. Delgado states, \"I feel that going to one's church, synagogue or mosque should be much safer than going to the grocery store, participating in a protest, or working at a manufacturing facility.\" ( Id.\u00b6 14.) To support this statement in his supplemental declaration, 10Dr. Delgado sets forth a \"comparative risk analysis\" that state s the risk of contracting COVID-19 at a house of worship is \"0.12 5 or 12.5% the risk at the grocery store,\" \"0.01 or 1% the risk at public protests,\" and \" 0.25 or 25% the risk at [a] manufacturing facility.\" (Dr. Delgado Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 33, 43.)11 The State argues Dr. Delgado's comparative risk assessment is b oth baseless and inadmissible for a litany of reasons. (State's Opp'n 18:5-20:17 .) The State also supplies the opinion of Peter B. Imrey, Ph.D., a Professor of Medicine a t Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University. Imray explains why Dr. Delgado's br oad-brushed assessment that leads to precise probabilities of the risk of COVID-19 spr ead is not accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community. (Imrey Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-40 (e xplaining that Dr. Delgado's incomplete model \"is unscientific\" because it does not include supporting data and there is no \"practical scientific basis\" for \"assessing the reliability of such numbers\"). See also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. , 509 U.S. 579, 592-94 (1993) (providing the court 10Dr. Delgado provided a similar declaration in support of Plaint iffs' initial motion for injunctive relief. ants make statements about the danger of COVID-19 to religious congregants and the broader public as part of the debat e referenced above, see supra note 9, they do not provide this type of com parative risk assessment.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728can consider whether a technique is acceptable in the relevant scientific community). In rebuttal to Imrey's detailed critique, Dr. Delgado states that \" there are presently no adequate models or methodologies to compare risks, and so I cit e none\" and that his assessment is based \"on common scientific sense.\" (Dr. Delgado Decl. \u00b6 Dow Pharm., Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1995) (explaining that when peer review scrutiny is unavailable, expe rts should \"explain precisely how they went about reaching their conclusions and po int to some objective source\u2014a learned treatise, the policy statement of a profession al association, a published article in a reputable scientific journal or the like\u2014to show t hat they have followed the scientific method, as it is practiced by (at least) a recognize d minority of scientists in\" the relevant field). The Court assigns Dr. Delgado's declaration minimal weight. Alth ough he may have treated \"people with infectious diseases including viral i llnesses such as influenza which tend to occur in epidemics,\" Dr. Delgado lacks significan t experience in epidemiology. (Dr. Delgado Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-5.) Moreover, he does not explain the basis for his model used to assess the precise comparative risk of religi ous services and other activities\u2014nor does he provide any supporting data for his concl usions. ( See id. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 31, 41 (broadly assigning values for \"relative risk\" factors like \" touching objects\" and being in \"[c]lose contact with others\" for various different environmen ts without offering any data to support them); see also Imrey Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-40 (dissecting Dr. Delgado's comparative risk model).) Therefore, although the Court has opte d to not strictly apply the Rules of Evidence to the parties' submissions, see supra note 7, the Court does not believe Dr. Delgado's comparative risk assessment survives scrutiny und erDaubert .See509 U.S. 579; see also Fed. R. Evid. 702 (providing expert testimony must be \"based on sufficient facts or data\" and be \"the product of reliable principles and m ethods\"). And finally, aside from being unreliable, Dr. Delgado's comparative risk assessment is simply not convincing in light of the evidence before the Co urt. The COVID-19 pandemic remains an area \"fraught with medical and scientific u ncertainties.\" See S. Bay Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728Church , 140 S. Ct. at 1613 (Roberts, C.J.). It is one thing for an exper t to explain why epidemiologists believe there is a higher risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in large gatherings, indoor spaces, and where groups are singing indoors , it is quite another for someone to purport to calculate\u2014without data\u2014that the risk of c ontracting COVID-19 at a house of worship is \"12.5% the risk at the grocery store\" or \"1% the risk at public protests.\" \u00b6\u00b6 27-45; \u00b6\u00b6 25, 33, 43.) See also supra note 7. Probabilities are not derived from only \"common scientific s e n s e . \" ( See Dr. Delgado Decl. \u00b6 36, ECF No. 61-3.) Hence, the Court assigns some weight to Dr. Delgado's opinions about COVID-19, but the Court assigns no weig ht to the conclusions of his comparative risk assessment. On balance, having reviewed the parties' evidence, the Court fin ds Plaintiffs have not shown they are likely to succeed in demonstrating the State a nd County's restrictions \"infringe upon or restrict practices because of their religious motivation\" or \"in a selective manner impose burdens only on conduct motivated by religious be lief.\" See S. Bay Church , 959 F.3d at 939 (quoting Lukumi , 508 U.S. at 533, 543); see also Harvest Rock Church , 2020 WL 5835219, at *1-2. This determination does not mean Pl aintiffs could not prevail at a trial on the merits. Rather, they merely have not shown they are entitled to the extraordinary remedy that is injunctive relief before trial . See San Francisco , 944 F.3d at 789 (providing the court should not issue a preliminary injunc tion \"unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion\"). C. Discriminatory Enforcement Last, the Court addresses Plaintiffs' argument that California' s restrictions \"have been enforced discriminatorily.\" (Renewed Mot. 9:13-28; see also id. 20:16-23:9.) Plaintiffs argue that \"despite enforcing its restrictions agains t houses of worship, California has steadfastly refused to enforce its restrictions against poli tical protests,\" making \"places of worship\" of protestors . lpable 1064, 1083- 84 (9th Cir. 2015) (analyzing a claim of whether Washington's Pha rmacy Quality Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728Assurance Commission selectively enforced rules concerning emerg ency contraceptives \"against religiously motivated violations but not against secula rly motivated violations\" in contravention of the Free Exercise Clause). The Court is unconvinced. Plaintiffs are challenging the State and County's restrictions on indoor worship and group singing\u2014not outdoor ga therings or protests. The operative restrictions do not limit attendance for outdoor reli gious services or outdoor protests. ( See SAC Ex. 1-7; Grabarsky Decl. Ex. 14.) And the challenged restri ction on group singing applies equally to indoor religious services and indoor protests. See supra Part II.E. Further, as described above, the distinction between i ndoor and outdoor gatherings is based on the State's understanding of the increase d risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus indoors. The same is true for the distinction between indoor and outdoor group singing. See supra Part II.A, E. Hence, the Court agrees that by focusing on outdoo r protests, \"Plaintiffs are comparing apples and oranges.\" (Stat e's Opp'n 28:3-4.) Indeed, Judge Bernal rejected a similar argument in Harvest Rock Church .See 2020 WL 5265564, at *2 (reasoning that \"how the Orders treat outdoor protests is irrelevant to whether the Orders' restriction on indoor religious services is constitution al\" and \" whether the Governor encouraged outdoor protests that violated earlier stay -at-home orders is\" likewise \"irrelevant\").12The evidence in this case leads the Court to the same conclusio n. Moreover, the Court agrees that P laintiffs do not otherwise demo nstrate a pattern of discriminatory enforcement. On this point, the County shows th at as of August 26, 2020, it \"had issued 144 citations for violations of the County's COVI D-19 public health orders.\" (Jordan Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 58-1.) None of those 144 cita tions was issued to places of worship or persons engaged in religious services. ( Id.\u00b6 3.) 12For this same reason, the Court finds distinguishable the distr ict court's discussion of protests inCapital 2020). ( See ECF No. 70.) In that case, the District of Colombia contended it \"has a compelling interest in capping the number of attendees at the Church's outdoor services .\" Id.at *8 (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, the State and County are not limiting the at tendees at outdoor religious services, and the State's restrictions are b ased on its understanding of the increased risk posed by large indoor gatherings that include group singing.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728In addition, through August 26, 2020, the County had served ten cease-and-desist orders or compliance letters to businesses and other entities w ith respect to reported violations of the County's public health orders. (Johnston Decl . \u00b6 7, Ex. B, ECF No. 58- 2.) Only three of those items were issued to places of worship .(Id.) The remaining seven were issued to businesses\u2014including gyms and a restaurant with a bar\u2014as well as a college and a public school district. ( Id.) Finally, aside from issuing citations and cease-and-desist order s , t h e C o u n t y h a s issued health officer orders that require a business or other o rganization to immediately close down and cease operations. (Jordan Decl. \u00b6 9, Ex. C.) As o f August 26, 2020, the County had issued only five of these orders\u2014none to places of wo rship. ( Id.)T h r e e o f the five immediate-closure orders were served on gyms that conti nued indoor operations in violation of the applicable rules, and the other two were iss ued to restaurants with bars for repeated violations of social distancing, sanitation, and fa cial covering requirements. (Id.) The County submits that this evidence shows its \"enforcement of COVID-19 public health orders and regulations has been uniform, evenhanded, and in no way has treated secular businesses or activities more favorably than religious organizations or services.\" (County's Opp'n 10:11-16.) In response, Plaintiffs claim the County \"misses the point\" because the County \"treats protestors as first-class citizens.\" (Reply to County Opp'n 8:16-9:12.) The Court disagrees. The manner in which the County is enforcing the Sta te's COVID-19 restrictions goes to the heart of whether there has been discriminatory enfo rcement. The evidence does not show a pattern of discrimina tory enforcement against religio us organizations. Nor does the evidence show the County has treated comparable secular bus inesses or activities more favorably than religious organizations. Therefore, Plaintiffs do not meet their burden on this point. See Stormans , 794 F.3d at 1083-84 (concluding there was no evidence of selective enforcement by the state commission against religious ly motivated violations). Overall, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not shown they are likely to succeed on their claim that the challenged restrictions are unconstitution al in light of discriminatory Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 PageID.5701 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17 181920 21 222324 25 262728enforcement. Hence, injunctive relief is similarly not appropria te on this basis. See San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 789 (providing the court should not issue a prelimin ary injunction \"unless the movant, by a clear showing , carries the burden of persuasion\"). V. CONCLUSION In sum, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that new developments mean they are likely to succeed on their free exercise claims under the federal and state constitutions. The Court's analysis of the remaining injunctive relief factors rem ains the same. ( See Mot. Hr'g Tr. 30:3-19.) Plaintiffs thus have not shown they are entit led to injunctive relief before a trial on the merits. Consequently, the Court confirms its prior conclusions and DENIES Plaintiffs' renewed motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (ECF No. 53). For the same reasons, the Court also confirms that an injunction pending appeal is not appropriate. IT IS SO ORDERED. DATED: October 14, 2020 Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 71 Filed 10/15/20 State of California\u2014Health and Human Services Agency California Department of Public Health \u0014\u0012\u0014\u0013COVID-19 Blueprint for a Safer Economy California has a blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities. Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its test positivity and adjusted caserate for tier assignment. Additionally, a health equity metric took ew ect on October 6, 2020. In order to advance to the next less restrictive tier, each county will need to meet an equity metric or demonstrate targeted investments toeliminate disparities in levels of COVID-19 transmission, depending on its size. The California Health Equity Metric isdesigned to help guide counties in their continuing ew orts to reduce COVID-19 cases in all communities and requires more intensive ew orts to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among Californians who have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic. Updates as of 12/08/2020: CDPH continues to implement and operate the Blueprint For a Safer Economy under the emergency brakesaction announced on November 9, 2020. Counties who are not currently under a regional Stay at Home Ordermay be moved to a more restrictive tier based on Blueprint data assessed each week. Once announced, thecounty is required to implement tier related restrictions by 11:59pm the next day. Thereax er, if a county enters into a regional Stay at Home Order based on ICU capacity, the restrictions associated with that order would take e wect. In light of the recent, unprecedented surge in rate of increase of cases, notwithstanding the Blueprintframework outlined below, the following changeshave been ew ective since 11/9/2020 and will stay in place until further notice: Tier assignments may occur any day of the week and may occur more than once a week when CDPHdetermines that the most recent reliable data indicate that immediate action is needed to addressCOVID-19 transmission in a county. Counties may be moved back more than one tier if CDPH determines that the data support the moreintensive intervention. Key considerations will include the rate of increase in new cases and/or testpositivity, more recent data as noted below, public health capacity, and other epidemiological factors. The most recent reliable data will be used to complete the assessment. TheCalifornia Blueprint Data Chart(Excel) has been updated to show county tier status, date of tier assignment, adjusted case rate for tier assignment,countywide test positivity, and the Health Equity quartiletest positivity. County requests for tier adjudication will not hold the county in the current tier during adjudication, and given the current environment of rapidly escalating cases and widespread disease transmission acrossCalifornia, tier adjudication requests are unlikely to be approved unless unique, extreme circumstances anddata are submitted justifying how the county is not impacted by the statewide increases.Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 Filed information about the Blueprint: Find the status of activities in your county Understand which activities and businesses are open in the four tiers (PDF) Learn more about the California Health Equity Metric and the Targeted Equity Investment Plans from each county County Tier Adjudication Request Explore the complete data by county - California Blueprint Data Chart(Excel) Find archived California Blueprint Data Charts Proyecto para una econom\u00eda m\u00e1s segura | For other languages, visit our Multilingual Documents page Plan for Reducing COVID-19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe This guidance outlines an updated framework for a safe progression of opening more businesses and activities in light of the pandemic. The framework for this guidance is informed by increased knowledgeof disease transmissionvulnerabilities and risk factors and is driven by the following goals: 1. To progress in phases based on risk levels with appropriate time between each phase in each county so impacts of any given change can be fully evaluated. 2. To aggressively reduce case transmission to as low a rate as possible across the state so the potential burden of flu and COVID-19 in the late fall and winter does not challenge our healthcare delivery system's ability tosurge with space, supplies and staw . Also, with winter weather pushing more activities indoors, low levels of transmission in the community will make large outbreaks in these riskier settings less likely. 3. To simplify the framework and lay out clear disease transmission goals for counties to work towards. Tier Framework This framework lays out the measures that each county must meet, based on indicators that capture diseaseburden, testing, and health equity. A county may be more restrictive than this framework. This framework alsonotes signals of concern, including impacted healthcare capacity that may lead towards a dimming intervention.This framework replaces the former County Data Monitoring metrics. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be an evolving situation and new evidence and understanding emerges, the California Department of Public Health(CDPH), in collaboration with other State owicials,will continue to reassess metrics and thresholds. See chart below for the framework metrics as set according to tiers based on risk of community disease transmission. Calculation of metrics is described in Appendix 1. Description of the Health Equity Metric can befound on the Health Equity Metric page.

Large counties with populations greater than approximately 106,000 must also meet the health equity metric described on the Health Equity Metric page in order to advance to a less restrictive tier. The case rate is adjusted based on testing volume per 100,000 population as described below. Due to variability in data, this adjustment does not apply to small counties (defined as those with a population less than 106,000 residents). As counties focus on increased testing in their health equity quartiles and to support school openings, they are likely to experience an increased number of cases. We want to avoid disincentivizing increased testing, providedthat test positivity is low and there is su wicient capacity for contact tracing and isolation. We are therefore increasing the adjustment for higher volume testing. For counties with testing volume above the state median, the factor is less than 1, decreasing in a linearmanner from 1.0 to 0.5as testing volume increases from the state median to 2x the state median. The factor remains at 0.5if the testing volume is gr eater than 2x the state median. For counties with testing volume below the state median, the factor is gr eater than 1, increasing in a linear manner from 1.0 to 1.4 as testing volume decreases from the state median to zero. However, this adjustment for low testing volume will not be applied to counties with a test positivity < 3.5%. California COVID-19 Case Rate Adjustment FactorCase 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 1.4 0.25* State Median 1.30.50* State Median 1.20.75* State Median 1.1State Median 1 1.25* State Median 0.875 1.5*State Median 0.75 1.75* State Median 0.625 2.0*State Median and above0.5 Counties with fewer than 106,000 residents,will be exempted from case rate adjustments, and counties with test positivity <3.5% will be exempted from adjustment for testing rates lower than the state median. If the two metrics are not within the same tier, the county's tier assignment will be determined by the morerestrictive of the two. For example, if a county's test positivity corresponds to tier 3 (orange, moderate), but the case rate corresponds to tier 1 (purple, widespread), the county will be assigned as tier 1.Movement willbe determined by criteria described below. Moving through the Tiers Rules of the framework: 1. CDPH will assess indicators weekly on Mondays and release updated tier assignments on Tuesdays. 2. A county must remain in a tier for a minimum of three weeks before being able to advance to a less restrictive tier. 3. A county can only move forward one tier at a time, even if metrics qualify for a more advanced tier.4. If a county's adjusted case rate for tier assignment and test positivity measure fall into two di werent tiers, the county will be assigned to the more restrictive tier. 5. The health equity metric is applied to jurisdictions with populations greater than 106,000. Rules of the health equity metric are described on the Health Equity Metric page. 6. City local health jurisdiction (LHJ) data will be included in overall metrics, and city LHJs will be assigned the same tier as the surrounding county 7. An LHJ may continue to implement or maintain more restrictive public health measures if the local health owicer determines that health conditions in that jurisdiction warrant such measures. 8. Tier status goes into ew ect the Wednesday following each weekly tier assignment announcement on Tuesdays. To advance:Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 Filed \u0018\u0012\u0014\u00131. A county must have been in the current tier for a minimum of three weeks. 2. A county must meet criteria for the next less restrictive tier for both measures for the prior two consecutive weeks in order to progress to the next tier. 3. In addition, counties must meet the health equity criteria to demonstrate the county's ability to address the most impacted communities within a county. To move back: 1. During the weekly assessment, if a county's adjusted case rate and/or test positivity has fallen within a more restrictive tier for two consecutive weekly periods, the state will review the most recent 10 days of data, and if CDPH determines there are objective signs of improvement the county may remain in the tier. If the county's most recent 10 days data does not show objective signs of improvement the county must revert to the morerestrictive tier. For subsequent weekly assessments, the above rules apply. 2. At any time, state and county public health owicials may work together to determine targeted interventions or county wide modifications necessary to address impacted hospital capacity and drivers of diseasetransmission, as needed, including movement across more than one tier. Key considerations will also include the rate of increase in new cases and/or test positivity, more recent data as noted above, public healthcapacity, and other epidemiological factors. 3. Counties with a population less than 106,000 will have a small county criteria applied to it to ensure movement to a more restrictive tier is appropriate. Description of the small county framework is below. 4. Counties will have three days, beginning the Wednesday a xer tier assignments are announced on Tuesdays, to implement any sector changes or closures unless extreme circumstances merit immediate action. Small County Framework Because California's case rate metric is normalized per 100,000 population, a number of counties with small populations have experienced large swings in their daily case rate as a result of a small number of newly reportedcases. For some counties, this has raised the specter of needing to move back to a more restrictive tier despiteoverall disease stability and a demonstrated ability to trace, follow up with, investigate and support cases. For example, once a small county is in yellow tier, a small number of cases - as low as 1 case per week for 2 consecutive weeks - could cause it to return to a more restrictive tier. While the overall proportion of cases may bethe same as a larger county, the absolute number of cases is also an important consideration in gauging countycapacity to control transmission through disease investigation, contact tracing and supportive isolation. It is not in the interest of the public health of communities to close or restrict entire business sectors on the basis of such a small number of cases, and in some situations a small swing in week over week case counts can move acounty from yellow tier all the way to purple tier. Because the state wants to avoid swi x shix s in tier status based on small absolute case number changes, we are creating an alternate case assessment measure to apply to smallcounties. Small counties are defined as having fewer than 106,000 residents.[1] Alternate Case Assessment Measure. Small counties are subject to all existing Blueprint rules (test positivity thresholds, minimum duration of 3 weeks in a tier before moving to a less restrictive tier, inability to skip over a tier while moving from more restrictive to less restrictive tier designations, etc.) with the exception of the case rate thresholds as delineated below. Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 \u0019\u0012\u0014\u0013The alternate case assessment measure provides a small county protection against sudden tier changes as a result of small increases in cases. For a small county that has test positivity that meets the threshold of that county's currently assigned tier, but is flagged for potentially moving to a more restrictive tier based on its weekly case rate assessment, the followingcriteria shall be applied in lieu of the Blueprint case rate thresholds. If the county exceeds the following absolute weekly case numbers based on its population and tier for two consecutive weeks, it will be required to move to a more restrictive tier: CurrentTier Pop \u0094 35K Pop 35K-70K Pop 70K-106K Yellow 7 14 21 Orange 14 21 28 Red 3 54 24 9 Movement into Yellow Tier In moving from purple to red or red to orange tiers, small counties are subject to all existing Blueprint rules (test positivity thresholds, minimum duration of 3 weeks in a tier before moving to a less restrictive tier, inability to skip over a tier while moving from more restrictive to less restrictive tier designations, etc.). For a small county to move from the orange to yellow tier, it must meet the existing test positivity threshold of less than 2%. However, in lieu of meeting the established daily case rate threshold for yellow tier of less than 1 case per 100,000, a small county is allowed to have a daily case rate of less than or equal to 2 cases per 100,000. Of note, these are the same parameters used for the health equity acceleration criteria to yellow tier. Criteria Activities and sectors will begin to open at a specific tier based on risk-based criteria (PDF), as outlined below. Lower risk activities or sectors are permitted sooner and higher risk activities or sectors are not permitted until later phases. Many activities or sectors may increase the level of operations and capacity as a county reduces its level oftransmission. Criteria used to determine low/medium/high risk sectors Ability to accommodate face covering wearing at all times (e.g. eating and drinking would require removal offace covering) Ability to physically distance between individuals from di werent householdsCase 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 to limit the number of people per square foot Ability to limit duration of exposure Ability to limit amount of mixing of people from diw ering households and communities Ability to limit amount of physical interactions of visitors/patrons Ability to optimize ventilation (e.g. indoor vs outdoor, air exchange and filtration) Ability to limit activities that are known to cause increased spread (e.g. singing, shouting, heavy breathing; loud environs will cause people to raise voice) Schools Schools may reopen for in-person instruction based on equivalent criteria to the July 17School Re-opening Framework (PDF)previously announced. That framework remains in e wect except that Tier 1 is substituted for the previous County Data Monitoring List (which has equivalent case ratecriteria to Tier 1). Schools in counties withinTier 1 are not permitted to reopen for in-person instruction, with an exception for waivers granted by local healthdepartments for TK-6 grades. Schools that are not authorized to reopen, including TK-6 schools that have notreceived a waiver, may provide structured, in-person supervision and services to students under the Guidance forSmall Cohorts/Groups of Children and Youth. Schools are eligible for reopening at least some in-person instruction following California School Sector Specific Guidelines once the county is out of Tier 1 (and thus in Tier 2) for at least 14 days, which is similar to being ow theCounty Data Monitoring List for at least 14 days.The first day a county is considered in Tier 2 is the Wednesday a xer the weekly county tier assignments are announced and posted on the CDPH website (Tuesdays). For example, if acounty is assigned to Tier 2 on Tuesday, October 13, the first full day the county is in Tier 2 is Wednesday, October14. The county will have completed 14 days in Tier 2 on Tuesday, October 27 and may reopen schools for in-personinstruction on Wednesday, October 28. As noted above, an LHJ may continue to implement or maintain morerestrictive public health measures if the local health owicer determines that health conditions in that jurisdictionwarrant such measures. As stated in the July 17 School Re-opening Framework (PDF),schools are not required to close if a county moves back to Tier 1, but should consider surveillance testing of sta w.However, if a school or district had not already reopened for in-person instruction while in Tier 2 and is then moved to Tier 1, it may not reopen those schools until the county moves back to Tier 2 and remains in Tier 2 for 14 days.

APPENDIX 1: Calculation of metrics Metric DefinitionCase 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 with 7-day lag)Calculated as the average (mean) daily number of COVID-19+ cases, this excludes: (a) persons out of state or with unknown county of residence and (b)persons incarcerated at state or federal prisons, ICE facilities, US Marshal onlydetention facilitiesor Department of State Hospitals (identified as cases with anordering facility name or address associated with these locations), over 7 days(based on episode date), divided by the number of people living in thecounty/region/state.This number is then multiplied by 100,000. Due to reportingdelays, there is a 7-day lag built into this calculation. For example, for dataupdated through 8/22/20, the case rate will be dated as 8/15/20 and will includethe average case rate from 8/9/20 - 8/15/20. Linear adjusted case Rate per100,000 per day,excludingprisoners (7-dayaveragewith 7-day lag)Calculated as the case rate multiplied by a case rate adjustment factor that isbased on the diw erence between the county testing volume (testing volume, tests per 100,000 per day, described below) and the median county testing volume calculated across all counties. The median testing volume thus forms ananchor for this adjustment and is recalculated every four weeks to preventundue fluctuation while remaining sensitive to evolving testing trends. Forcounties with a testing volume above the median, the adjustment factor is lessthan 1, decreasing in a linear manner from 1.0 to 0.5 as testing volume increasesfrom the anchor point to 2x that value. The adjustment factor remains at 0.5 ifthe county testing volume is gr eater than 2x the state median. For counties with a testing volume below the state median, the adjustment factor is gr eater than 1, increasing in a linear manner from 1.0 to 1.4 as county testing volume decreasesfrom the state median to zero. The linear adjustment formula can be expressedmathematically as follows: For counties testing above the state median: 1-(((county testing rate - state median testing rate)/state median testing rate) * 0.5) For counties testing below the state median:1-(((county testing rate - state median testing rate)/state median testing rate) * 0.4) There are two conditions in which this formula is not applied. The first is small counties, those with a population less than approximately 100,000 based on CADepartment of Finance population projections (see reference * in tier frameworktable). The small county exception prevents potential spurious adjustment dueto fluctuations in testing influenced by secular events unrelated to underlyingtransmission risk. As a second condition for exception from the adjustment,counties with a testing volume below the state median and testing positivity <3.5% are not adjusted, based on the assumption that volume of testing in thesecounties may not need to be as high with low test positivity. Under both theseconditions, the adjusted case rate is equal to the unadjusted rate. Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 81-1 Filed 12/14/20 only,7-day lag) Calculated as the total number of positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testsfor COVID-19 over a 7-day period (based on specimen collected date) divided bythe total number of PCR tests conducted; this excludes tests for: (a) persons outof state or with unknown county of residence and (b) persons incarcerated atstate or federal prisons, ICE facilities, US Marshal only detention facilities andDepartment of State Hospitals(identified as cases with an ordering facility nameor address associated with prison/state hospitals locations). This number is thenmultiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Due to reporting delay (which may bediwerent between positive and negative tests), there is a 7-day lag. Example: For cumulative lab data received on 6/30/20, reported test positivity is dated as 6/23/20 and is calculated based on tests with specimen collection datesfrom 6/17-6/23 Testsper 100,000 per day, excluding prisoners (7-dayaveragewith7-day lag)Calculated as the number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day overa 7-day period (based on specimen collection date), excluding tests for personsincarcerated at state or federal prisons, ICE facilities, US Marshal only detentionfacilities and Department of State Hospitals (identified as cases with an orderingfacility name or address associated with prison/state hospitals locations), anddivided by the number of people living in the county/region/state. This numberis then multiplied by 100,000. Due to reporting delay, there is a 7-day lagincluded in the calculation. Example:For cumulative lab data received through 8/22/20, the reported 7-day average number of tests will be dated as 8/15/20 and will include PCR tests withspecimen collection dates from 8/9/20 - 8/15/20.

This Order is issued based on scientific evidence regarding the most effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID-19 specifically, as well as best practices as currently known and available to protect vulnerable members of the public from avoidable risk of serious illness or death resulting from exposure to COVID-19. The age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population of the county places it at risk for serious health complications, including death, from COVID-1 9. Although most individuals who contract COVID-19 do not become seriously ill, persons with mild symptoms and asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 may place other vulnerable members of the public\u2014such as older adults, and those with underlying health conditions\u2014at significant risk. 18. The actions required by this Order are necessary to reduce the number of individuals who will be exposed to COVID-19, and will thereby slow the spread of COVID-19 in the county. By reducing the spread of COVID-19, this Order will help preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in the county and will save lives. 19. This Order is issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference: a) the Declaration of Local Health Emergency issued by the Health Officer on February 14, 2020; b) the Proclamation of Local Emergency issued by the County Director of Emergency Services on February 14, 2020; c) the action of the County Board of Supervisors to ratify and continue both the local health emergency and local emergency on February 19, 2020; d) the Proclamation of a State of Emergency issued by the Governor of the State of California on March 4, 2020; e) Executive Order N-25-20 issued by the Governor of the State of California on March 12, 2020 which orders that \"All residents are to heed any orders and guidance of state and local health officials, including but not limited to the imposition of social distancing measures, to control COVID-19\"; f) Proclamation 9984 regarding COVID-19 issued by the President of the United States on March 11, 2020; g) Executive Order N-33-20 issued by the Governor of the State of California on March 19, 2020; h) the \" Interim Additional Guidance for Infection Prevention and Control for Patients with Suspecte d or Confirmed COVID-19 in Nursing Homes\" issued by the CDC; i) COVID-19 guidance issued by the California Department of Public Health on including, but not limited to the Face Coverings Guidance Exh. 1-7Case 3:20-cv-00865-BAS-AHG Document 83-1 283Page 8 of 9 ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER AND EMERGENCY REGULATIONS issued on November 16, 2020; j) the State of California's \"Resilience Roadmap;\" k) the State of California's Plan for Reducing COVID-19 and Adjusting Permitted Sector Activities to Keep Californians Healthy and Safe; l) the California Statewide Public Health Officer Order dated August 28, 2020; and m) the Regional Stay At Home Order issued by the California Public Health Officer on December 3, 2020. 20. This Order is issued to prevent circumstances often present in gatherings that may exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, such as: 1) the increased likelihood that gatherings will attract people from a broad geographic area; 2) the prolonged time period in which large numbers of people are in close proximity; 3) the difficulty in tracing exposure when large numbers of people attend a single event or are at a single location; and 4) the inability to ensure that such persons follow adequate hygienic practices. 21. This Order is issued to provide additional opportunities for recreational activities while also requiring additional protections from the spread of COVID-19 to the public who are taking advantage of these opportunities for recreational activities. And providing additional protections for employees of essential businesses or businesses or entities in State authorized sectors and their customers/clients. 22. This Order is issued to protect the public health as businesses are allowed to reopen by requiring businesses to implement procedures necessary to ensur e their employees and customers comply with social distancing, sanitation and screening practices. 23. This Order comes after the release of substantial guidance from the Health Officer, the California Department of Public Health, the CDC, and other public health officials throughout the United States and around the world. 24. The statement of facts and circumstances set forth as justification for each Guidance issued by the California Department of Health Services that is referenced in this Order are hereby accepted and incorporated by reference into this Order. 25. Pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 120175.5 (b) all gov ernmental entities in the county shall take necessary measures within the governmental entity's control to ensure compliance with this Order and to disseminate this Order to venues or locations within the entity's jurisdiction where gatherings may occur.

County Surpasses 600,000 COVID-19 Cases as Hospitalizations Continue to Soar 60 New Deaths and 13, 756 New Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 in Los Angeles County The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has reported more than 600,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County. More than 100,000 new cases have been reported since December 11, when L.A County reached 500,000 COVID-19 cases. LA. County is experiencing the fastest acceleration of new cases than at any other time during the pandemic. To date, Public Health identified 610,372 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County and a total of 8,817 deaths. Today, Public Health has confirmed 60 new deaths and 13,756 new cases of COVID-19. There are 5,424 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 21 % of these people are in the ICU. Today's number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 is again a new high and an increase of more than 300 patients since yesterday. Hospital capacity across the county is limited, and healthcare workers are hard-pressed to keep up with the need for care. And the only means available to improve the situation at the hospitals is to reduce the number of people becoming newly infected with COVID-19. A recent decision by the Court of Appeal affirms Los Angeles County's duty to prevent disease transmiss ion and protect public health through existing Health Officer Orders, and the suspension of outdoor dining remains in effect. Public Health reminds all sectors and businesses that all other requirements, safety directives, and temporary business closures also remain in effect. The Los Angeles County Health Officer Order will be modified today to align with recent Supreme Court rulings for places of worship. Places of worship are permitted to offer faith-based services both indoors and outdoors with mandatory physical distancing and face coverings over both the nose and mouth that must be worn at all times while on site. Places of worship must also assure that attendance does not exceed the number of people who can be accommodated while maintaining a physical distance of six feet between separate households. Public Health strongly recommends that places of worship continue to hold services outdoors, with physical distancing and the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to congregants and to the entire commun ity. Because Los Angeles County is experiencing an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, every effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to congregants and to the entire community is critical. Yesterday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the second vaccine to prevent COVID-19 severe illness. The EUA allows the Modern a COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed throughout the country. Public Health expects doses of this vaccine to arrive in L.A. County next week. Once these doses arrive, they will be used to vaccinate staff and residents at skilled nursing facilities, frontline EMS EMT's and paramedics, and vaccinators . Currently, the Pfizer COVID-19 initial allocation of vaccine is being used by acute care hospitals to vaccinate frontline health care personnel . A second allotment of Pfizer vaccine is anticipated to arrive next week and will be used to vaccinate additional healthcare workers at acute care hospitals. Of the 60 new deaths reported today, 29 people that passed away were over the age of 80 years old, 17 people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79 years old, nine people who died were between the ages of 50 and 64 years old, and two people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49 years old. Forty-six people who died had underlying health conditions including 25 people over the age of 80 years old, 13 people between the ages of 65 and 79 years old, six people between the ages of SO and 64 years old, and two people between the ages of 30 and 49 years old. Two deaths were reported by the City of Pasadena and one death was reported by the City of Long Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. \"We are bearing witness every day to the terrible suffering caused by a virus that is spreading out of control throughout the county. Places where people from different households gather and do not follow safety directives contributes to unnecessary COVID-19 spread that results in hospitalizations and deaths that could have been avoided. Following the safety measures saves lives and is our only way to protect essential workers and our hospitals. Stay home as much as possible, do not mingle with others, and do not travel. Always wear a face covering, keep distance from others, frequently wash hands, and limit all non-essential activities.\" If you have symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 , isolate immediately from your family and others. Individuals with underlying health conditions and those that are older should remain in their home and not be around others unless seeking essential health and dental care.

This order may be extended if the projections of the Southern California Region's total available adult ICU bed capacity is less than 15%. Pleas.e read this Order carefully. Violation of or failure to comply with this Order is a crime punishable by fine, imprisonm ent, or both. (California Health and Safety Code \u00a7120295; Los Angeles County Code\u00a7 11.02.080.) SUMMARY OF THE TEMPORARY ORDER: This Revised Temporary Targeted Safer At Home Order for Control of COVID-19: Tier 1 Substantial Surge Updated Response (Revised Temporary Order) is issued to temporarily replace both the most recently issued Temporary Order and Reopening Safer At Work And In The Community For Control of COVID-19 Order (Order) issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Officer (Health Officer). This Revised Temporary Order will be effective from 11 :59pm (Pacific Standard Time (PST)) on December 19, 2020 to, at least, 11 :59pm (PSn on December 27, 2020, and may be extended if the projections of the Southem California Region's total available adult ICU bed capacity is less than 15%. This Revised Temporary Order has been updated and is issued as a response to the sustained and substantia l rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths.. This Revised Temporary Order has been revised to align and comply with the State's December 3, 2020 Regional Stay At Home OrdenL9S well as the Sum>lement to the Regional Stay At Home Order issued Decembe n 6, 2020. County Health Officer Orders may not be less restrictive than Orders issued by the State Public Health Officer. The County is part of the Southern California Region (Region). Over the last seven (7) calendar days, the County of Los Angeles is averaging 13,727 newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases per day. Between November 13, 2020-Decem ber 18, 2020, hospitalizations of confirmed COVID-19 patients have increased by 330% to 5, 100. In addition, the adult ICU bed admissions in the Southern California Region rose. And, per the California Department of Public Health, there is no additiona l adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity within the Region. Because of both the rapid continuing increases in new cases and test positivity rates within the County and the Region Revised Temporary Targeted Safer at Home Health Officer Order for Control of COVID-19-Tier 1 Substantial Surge Updated Response Page lof 18 [87] .... ff coutm 90 Filed 12/19/20 PagelD.7913 Page 5 of 25 REVISED TEMPORARY TARGETED SAFER AT HOME HEALTH OFFICER ORDER FOR CONTROL OF COVID-19 : TIER 1 SUBSTANTIAL SURGE UPDATED RESPONSE I ~ and the lag between case identification and hospitalizations , the Health Officer expects both the number of new cases and hospitalizations, including adult ICU admissions in the Region, to continue to increase. Per the State Public Health Officer, current projections show that without additional intervention to slow the spread of COVID-19, the number of available adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the State of California will be at capacity in mid-December. ICU beds are a critical resource for individuals who need the most advanced support and care and the ability to add additional ICU capacity is limited by the lack of available ICU nurses and physicians as a result of the nationwide surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions. Without additiona l public health interventions and widespread public adherence to the personal preventive actions to avoid being exposed to this virus and spreading it to others, the high levels and rate of rise in both cases and hospitalizations, if either continues, are at risk of overwhelming the ability of hospitals to deliver healthcare to people suffering from COVID-19 and from other illnesses requiring hospital care. This Revised Temporary Order is issued to ensure that County of Los Angeles (County) residents remain in their residences except as necessary to conduct activities specifically permitted in this order, to limit close contact with others outside their household in both indoor and outdoor spaces and to further reduce the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of new daily cases. This Revised Temporary Order is issued to reduce capacity at sites where non-household members interact. Limiting interactions among non\u00ad household members, especially in places where persons are in close proximity without a face covering or mask, is essential to slowing the spread of COVID-19. It is imperative that all persons and businesses within in the County take personal responsibility and follow all restrictions and infection control precautions required by this Revised Temporary Order. Changes from the previous Temporary Order are highlighted. This Revised Temporary Order is effective within the County of Los Angeles Public Health Jurisdiction, defined as all cities and unincorporated areas within the County of Los Angeles, with the exception of the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena that must follow their respective City Health Officer orders and guidance. This Revised Temporary Order is effective 11 :59PM December 6, 2020 and will continue for at least 21 days.

This Revised Temporary Order replaces both the most recently issued Temporary Order and Reopening Safer At Work And In The Community For Control of COVID-19 Order (Order) issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Officer (Health Officer). That Order is suspended until the expiration of this Revised Temporary Order. This Revised Temporary Order is issued to slow the current high rates of COVID-19 community transmission and hospitalizations within the County. The Health Officer will continue to assess COVID-19 indicators within the County and the effectiveness of this Revised Temporary Order on an ongoing basis and determine, after consultation with the Board of Supervisors, whether this Revised Temporary Order needs to be modified or extended if the public health risk associated with COVID-19 increases in the future. 2. This Revised Temporary Order's intent is to continue to ensure that County residents remain in their residences except as necessary to conduct activities as required by law or as specifically permitted in this order, to limit close contact with others outside their household in both indoor and outdoor spaces and to further reduce the increased risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of new daily cases. All persons who can telework or work from home should continue to do so as much as possible during this pandemic. The public's adherence to sustained Social (Physical} Distancing, consistent and correct use of face coverings/masks, and other infection control measures will slow the spread of COVID-19 and diminish its impact on the delivery of critical healthcare services. Failure to comply with any of the Revised lemporary Order's provisions constitutes an imminent threat and menace to public health, and a public nuisance, and is punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. a) This Revised Temporary Order does not supersede any stricter limitation imposed by a local public entity within the County of Los Angeles Public Health Jurisdiction. b) Except for restrictions on Places of Worshi~, this Order is consistent with the provisions in the Governor's Executive Order N-60-20 and the State Public Health Officer's May 7, 2020 Order, that local health jurisdictions may implement or continue more restrictive public health measures in the jurisdictio n if the local health officer believes conditions in that jurisdiction warrant them.

This Revised Temporary Order requires all persons wear a face covering or mask over both the nose and mouth whenever they leave their place of residence and are or can be in contact with or walking near or past others who are non-househo ld members in both public and private places, whether indoors or outdoors. This includes wearing a face covering or mask when patronizing a business. Wearing a face covering or mask reduces the risk of transmission to others from people who do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. Wearing a face covering or mask has also been shown to provide 'Burfitt v. Nemom, No. BCV-20-102267 (Kern Ct>unty Sup. Cl Dec. 10, 2020); Roman Catholic Dioce~e of Brooklyn v.

Please read this Order carefully. Violation of or failure to comply with this Order is a crime punishable by fine. imprisonment, or both. (California Health and Safety Code \u00a7120295; Los Angeles County Code \u00a7 11.02.080.) SUMMARY OF THE TEMPORARY ORDER: This Revised Temporary Targeted Safer At Home Order for Control of COVID-19: Tier 1 Substantial Surge Updated Response (Revised Temporary Order) is issued to temporarily replace both the most recently issued Temporary Order and Reopening Safer At Work And In The Community For Control of COVID-19 Order (Order) issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Officer (Health Officer). This Revised Temporary Order will be effective from 11 :59pm (Pacific Standard Time (PST)) on December 29, 2020 and will remain in effect for as long as the State Public Health Officer's Regional Stay At Home remains in effect in the Southern California Region. This Revised Temporary Order has been updated and is issued as a response to the sustained and substantial rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. This Revised Temporary Order has been revised to align and comply with the State's December 3. 2020 Regional Stay At Home Order. as well as the Supplement to the Regional Stay At Home Order issued December 6. 2020. County Health Officer Orders may not be less restrictive than Orders issued by the State Public Health Officer. The County is part of the Southern California Region (Region). Over the last seven (7) calendar days, the County of Los Angeles is averaging 13,819 newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases per day. Between November 13, 2020-December 27, 2020, hospitalizations of confirmed COVID-19 patients have increased by 474% to 6,815. In addition, the adult ICU bed admissions in the Southern California Region rose. And, per the California Department of Public Health, there is no additional adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity within the Region. Because of both the rapid continuing increases in new cases and test positivity rates within the County and the Region and the lag between case identificat ion and hospitalizat ions, the Health Officer e\u00b7xpects both the Revised Temporary Tarceted Safer at Home Health Officer Order for Control of COVI0-19- Tier l Substantial Surge Updated Response TEMPORARY TARGETED SAFER AT HOME HEALTHI OFFICER ORDER FOR CONTROL OF COVID-19: TIER 1 SUBSTANTIAL SURGE UPDATED RESPONSE I l!1mm number of new cases and hospitalizations , includingi adult ICU admissions in the Region, to continue to increase. Per the State Public Health Officer, current projections show that without additional intervention to slow the spread of COVID-19, the number of available adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the State of California will be at capacity in mid-December . ICU beds are a critical resource for individuals who need ithe most advanced support and care and the ability to add additional ICU capacity is limited by the lack of available ICU nurses and physicians as a result of the nationwide surge in hospitalizations and ICU admissions. Without additional public health initerventions and widespread public adherence to the personal preventive actions to avoid being exposed to this virus and spreading it to others, the high levels and rate of rise in both cases and hospitalizations , if either continues, are at risk of overwhelming the ability of hospitals to deliver healthcare to people suffering from COVID-19 and from other illnesses requiring hospital care. This Revised Tempora ry Order is issued to ensure that County of Los Angeles (County) residents remain in their residences except as necessary to conduct activities specifically permitted in this order, to limit close contact with others outside their household in both indoor and outdoor spaces and to further reduce the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of new daily cases. This Revised Temporary Order is issued to reduce capacity at sites where non-household members interact. Limiting interactions among non\u00ad household members, especially in places where persons are in close proximity without a face covering or mask, is essential to slowing the spread of COVID-19. It is imperative that all persons and businesses within in the County take personal responsibility and follow all restrictions and infection control precautions required by this Revised Temporary Order. Changes from the previous Temporary Order are highlighted. This Revised Temporary Order is effective within the County of Los Angeles Public Health Jurisdiction, defined as all cities and unincorporated areas within the County of Los Angeles, with the exception of the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena that must follow their respective City Health Officer orders and guidance . This Revised Temporary Order is effective 11 :59PM December 29, 2020 and will remain in effect for as long as the State Public Health Officer's Regional Stay At Home remains in effect in the Southern California Region.

This Revised Temporary Order replaces both the most recently issued Temporary Order and Reopening Safer At Work And In The Community For Control of COVID-19 Order (Order) issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Officer (Health Officer). That Order is suspended until the expiration of this Revised Temporary Order. This Revised Temporary Order is issued to slow the current high rates of COVID-19 community transmiss ion and hospitalizations within the County. The Health Officer will continue to assess COVID-19 indicators within the County and the effectiveness of this Revised Temporary Order on an ongoing basis and determine , after consultation with the Board of Supervisors, whether this Revised Temporary Order needs to be modified or extended if the public health risk associated with COVID-19 increases in the future. 2. This Revised Temporary Order's intent is to continue to ensure that County residents remain in their residences except as necessary to conduct activities as required by law or as specifically permitted in this order, to limit close contact with others outside their household in both indoor and outdoor spaces and to further reduce the increased risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of new daily cases. All persons who can telework or work from home should continue to do so as much as possible during this pandemic. The public's adherence to sustained Social (Physical) Distancirng , consistent and correct use of face coverings/masks, and other infection control measures will slow the spread of COVID-19 and diminish its impact on the delivery of critical healthcare services. Failure to comply with any of the Revised Temporary Order's provisions constitutes an imminent threat and menace to public health, and a public nuisance, and is punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. a) This Revised Temporary Order does not supersede any stricter limitation imposed by a local public entity within the County of Los Angelles Public Health Jurisdiction . b) This Revised Temporary Order is consistent with the provisions in the Governor's Executive Order N-60-20 and the State Public Health Officer's May 7, 2020 Order, that local health jurisdictions may implement or continue more restrictive public health measures in the jurisdiction if the local health officer believes conditions in that jurisdiction warrant them. Where a conflict exists between this Order and any State public health order related to controlling the spread of COVID-19 during this pandemic , the most restrictive provision controls, unless the County of Los Angeles Revised Temporary Tarceted Safer at Home Health Officer Order for Control of COVI0-19-- Tier l Substantial Surge Updated Response TEMPORARY TARGETED SAFER AT HOME HEALTHI OFFICER ORDER FOR CONTROL OF COVID-19: TIER 1 SUBSTANTIAL SURGE UPDATED RESPONSE I l!1mm is subject to a court order requiring it to act on, or enjoining it from enforcing , any part of this Revised Temporary Order.1 3.

Places of Worship should engage in outdoor or remote faith\u00ad based services and other related activities for all attendees , especially those who are vulnerable to COVID-19 including older adults and those with co-morbidities , given the increased risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of new daily cases, hospitalizations, and premature deaths, as well at the severely reduced Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed capacity.

Further, it is strongly recommended that Places of Worship continue to facilitate outdoor or remote services and other related activities for all attendees, especially those who are vulnerable to COVID-19 including older adults and those with co-morbidities, given the increased risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of new daily cases, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. This Protocol is not intended for food preparation and service, delivery of items to those in need, childcare and daycare services, school and educational activities, in-home caregiving, counseling, office work, and other activities that places and organizations of worship may provide. Those activities must follow specific guidance and protocols provided by the State and County Department of Public Health. Recent Updates (Changes highlighted in yellow): 12/19/2020: Places of Worship are permitted to offer faith-based services, or otherwise allow access for faith-based practices, indoors and outdoors, provided that strict physical distancing is followed, which requires a minimum of six feet between persons from different households. Face coverings or masks that cover both the nose and mouth must be worn at all times while on site. Places of Worship are strongly encouraged to continue to hold faith-based services outdoors to the maximum extent practicable. Face coverings must be worn by staff working in cubicles, including cubicles equipped with partitions. This is a temporary measure in compliance with the temporary HEALTH OFFICER ORDER issued on November 28, 2020. The requirement is effective from 12:01AM (PST) on November 30, 2020 until further notice. At all times when eating or drinking, staff must maintain a 6-foot distance from others and should do so outdoors. Eating or drinking at a cubicle or workstation is preferred to eating in a breakroom. Staff and visitors arriving on-site must also be screened for whether they are currently under isolation or quarantine orders. **Please note that the County of Los Angeles is experiencing an unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Indoor gatherings and activities with others not in your household present significant risk to your health and the health of others due to COVID-19 transmission. Public Health strongly recommends that persons only attend faith-based services outdoors or remotely.

Vulnerable staff (those above age 65, those with chronic health conditions) are assigned work that can be done from home whenever possible. All staff have been told not to come to work if sick and to follow DPH guidance for self- isolation, if applicable. Information on employer or government-sponsored leave benefits the employee may be entitled to receive that would make it financially easier to stay at home. See additional information on COVID-19 Families First Coronavirus Response Act the work-relatedness of COVID- Executive Order N-62-20 Work processes are reconfigured to the extent possible to increase opportunities for staff to work from home. Upon being informed that one or more worker/practitioner, independent contractor and/or temporary worker tests positive for, or has symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (case), the employer has a plan in place to have the case(s) isolate themselves at home and require the immediate self-quarantine of all workers that had a workplace exposure to the case(s). The be tested for COVID-19 in order to determine whether there have been additional workplace exposures, which may require additional COVID-19 control measures. See Public Health guidance on responding to COVID-19 in the workplace . Entry screenings are conducted before employees may enter the workspace. Checks must include a check-in concerning cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and fever or chills and if the employee is currently under isolation or quarantine orders. These checks can be done at the worksite if feasible. In the event that 3 or more cases are identified within the workplace (including cases among staff and/or congregants) within a span of 14 days the employer must report this cluster to the Department of Public Health at (888) 397-3993 or (213) 240-7821. If a cluster is identified at a worksite, the Department of Public Health will initiate a cluster response which includes providing infection control guidance and recommendations, technical support and site- specific control measures. A public health case manager will be assigned to the cluster investigation to help guide the facility response. Employees who have contact with others are offered, at no cost, an appropriate face covering that covers the nose and mouth. The covering is to be worn by the employee at all times during the workday when in contact or likely to come into contact with others. Employees who have been instructed by their medical provider that they should not wear a face covering should wear a face shield with a drape on the bottom edge, to be in compliance with State directives, as long as their condition permits it. A drape that is form fitting under the chin is preferred. Masks with one-way valves should not be used. Employees need not wear a face covering when the employee is alone in a private office or a cubicle with a solid partition that COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER APPENDIX F: Reopening Protocol for Places of Worship Page 4 of 10 Revised 12/19/2020 exceeds the height of the employee when standing.

At all times when eating or drinking, staff must maintain at least a six-foot distance from others. When eating or drinking, it is preferred to do so outdoors and away from others, including visitors. Eating or drinking at a cubicle or workstation is preferred to eating in a breakroom if eating in a cubicle or workstation provides greater distance from and barriers between staff.
