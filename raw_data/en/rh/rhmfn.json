COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORT 2019 Fiscal Year July 2018 - June 2019 Institute for Community Partnerships - Community Benefit Office: 11175 Mountain View Avenue, Suite M Loma Linda, Office: (909) 558-3841 icp@llu.edu Juan Carlos , PhD, MPH Assistant Vice President Megan Daly , MHA Director, Community Benefit For additional information, the LLUH 2016 & 2019 Community Health Needs Assessments and Community Health Implementation Strategies, and previous annual reports at: https://lluh.org/about-us/community- benefit/reports-and-resources Transforming lives through education, health care and research Dear Community Members, This has been a formative year for the LLUH community benefit program with the completion of an updated Community Health Needs Assessment in the spring, the adoption of the next Community Health Implementation Strategy this summer, and this annual report on fiscal year 2019 this winter . We have spent time in conversation with our community and translated into action the priorities you have told us are important. We look to the future of working with our partners in the region to meet the un-met health needs of the most vulnerable and underserved members of our community. Loma Linda University Health has been responding to the needs of people in our region in fulfillment of our health care and educational mission for over 100 years. Community benefit reporting is always an exciting and meaningful summary of how we take our institutional mission of both the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ to our community above and beyond the standards of care in our hospitals. The community investments identified here are examples of how LLUH invests institutional resources and time to improve the un-met health needs of people in our two-county region. While the annual report is always one of accounting for the programs, activities, and partner investments in the health of people in our region , this report is ultimately a message of hope and a sharing of the resiliency and strength of the people of the Inland Empire : The PossAbilities program members show us that disability is not a limitation; the Coachella Connect health service fairs deploy health services to extend access to the hard-working people who are under-resourced in rural regions ; and our pipeline programs invest in youth, their education, and the ir future economic success. LLUH is here for the long-term with a focus on our health and social determinate investments to alleviate poverty and promote equity and opportunity in our region .

San Bernardino and Riverside counties make up the geographic area historically named \"the Inland Empire\" due to the region's rich diversity of native peoples and agricultural history. That identity is becoming more inclusive of the greater \"Inland Region\" of California as the Central and Coache lla Valley's share geographic, cultural, economic, and agricultural characteristics with the Inland Empire. Situated approximately 60 miles east from the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Pacific Ocean, the Inland Empire is home to over 4.5 million people and is the 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the State of California and the 13th most populous metropolitan area in the United States. Population Demographics The geographic landmass of both San Bernardino and Riverside Counties total over 27,000 square miles. The two- county region has grown steadily over the last two decades with America's largest county- to-county population shift occurring between LA County and San Bernardino and Riverside Counties for the years 2007 - 2011. While the region has a mix of densely populated urban areas, almost 5% of the population of both counties is rural. The two counties are home to some of the most diverse people in California: Hispanic populations now represent the majority of the population with the region being slightly higher than the state average for people below age 18. While the population growth was experienced some of the highest rates in the nation over the past decade, a report by the United States Conference of Mayors found that this trend will continue: the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metro area is expected to grow from 4.5 million to 7.2 million people in the next 30 years, making it one of the top 10 largest metro areas by 2046. San Bernardino and Riverside County Health Rankings Published online at countyhealthrankings.org , the rankings help counties understand what influences the health of residents and average lifespans by geographic region . The rankings are unique in their ability to measure the current overall health of nearly every county in all 50 states. They also look at a variety of measures that affect the future health of communities, such as high school graduation rates, access to healthy foods, rates of smoking, obesity and teen births. Communities use the rankings to help identify issues and opportunities for local health improvement, as well as to garner support for initiatives among government agencies, health care providers, community organizations, business leaders, policy makers and the public. Although there are a range of factors which are important for good health, every county has communities that lack both opportunities to shape good health and strong policies to promote health for everyone. As noted in the California County health ranking data, the Inland Empire communities Population growth: 57,017 \"With the third -highest house prices among the top 10 fastest-growing metro areas, but the fourth-lowest household income, many residents of the Inland Empire have to stretch to afford a home.\" - The Washington Post, Oct. 3, 2018 will need to collaborate and strategize their efforts to improve the health factors and health outcomes of the community. LLUH's go al is to bring people together to look at the many factors that influence health and opportunities to reduce health gaps. For programs and interventions to have a lasting impact, they must focus on strategies that improve health from a population standpoint. For LLUH, we are strategically positioned in two counties that together, face significant economic challenges. San Bernardino ranks 44th out of 58 counties in California in terms of health factors while Riverside ranks 39th. In November of 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported through a documentary on the impact of the 2008 recession to our region called \"San Bernardino: Broken City .\" San Bernardino is still recovering from the recession as recently, the California Budget & Policy Center identified the poverty rate in San Bernardino was higher at 19% in 2015 than it was in 2007 at 11%. Despite the challenge, LLUH believes that our community is resilient and with our community partners, we are addressing poverty through workforce development and education. About Our Service Area Loma Linda University Health System is a 1 ,045 hospital beds system. As an academic medical provider, LLUH offers primary and specialty care services and programs that are the safety-net for the people in our region. Without LLUH in the community, patients would need to travel great distances for access to the most advance continuum of health care services and a major gap in community- based interventions, programs, and unique community outreach activities would be created. LLUH invests in community services outside the traditional walls of our health care facilities. It is these programs and outreach activities that extend access to the more vulnerable or disenfranchised members and how LLUH is able to address the root causes of illness. Consistent with our Christian mission of extending the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, the LLUH health care system is honored to be an important part of the lives of people in our community whether it is through community programs, our educational system, or our health care system. The four non-profit hospitals in the LLUH System are: 1. Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) which includes two additional campuses: Loma Linda University Medical Center East Campus (LLUMCEC), Loma Linda University Surgical Hospital (LLUSH), 2. Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH), 3. Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC), 4. Loma Linda University Medical Center - Murrieta (LLUMC - M). While our hospitals are the flagships of our comprehensive health system, LLUH is advancing our health care delivery system as we extend access to care in the outpatient and community settings. Our system includes a robust offering of outpatient services in primary and specialty care clinics. Additionally, for many of the hospital-based services, LLUH is the only provider of these services. This includes services like the outpatient specialty children's clinics where many of our neonatal and Children's Hospital patients receive extensive follow -up to manage their complex conditions; the outpatient rehabilitative services for children and adults that provides therapy services for many of those in our region with disabilities or developmental challenges as we maintain an institutional commitment to growing their ability to thrive; and our inpatient and outpatient behavioral medicine clinics and programs that provide behavioral health service s in high -demand as California is under- resourced for behavioral health care. The LLUH system serves a large number of people who qualify for means-tested programs like Medi- Cal and it is core to our Christ-centered mission to serve those living near or at the poverty level, as we increase access to the full continuum of care for the most vulnerable children, families, adults, and seniors in our region with the greatest unmet health needs. People from marginalized communities or those living in difficult socioeconomic conditions account for almost 1 in every 3 patients seen at LLUH, based on patient Medi-Cal status. As an academic health center, LLUH has the ability to go beyond serving the marginalized, and actually addressing the root causes of poverty and disease through education and training, and workforce development: it is this ability that sets LLUH apart from other hospitals. As a leader in patient care we are not only investing in a comprehensive network of care, we are dedicated to offering state- of-the-art care for the most vulnerable while working with community partners to move the needle on health in our region. SAC Health System Service Area One of LLUH's primary community benefit investment strategies has been to sustain the capacity of the SAC Health System to provide primary and specialty care services to the most underserved people in our region , particularly to those living in poverty in the City of San Bernardino . The SAC Health System is one of the largest federally qualified health centers (FQHC) providers of primary and specialty outpatient care in our region with over 120,695 total patient visits in 2018 representing 30,907 unique patients. The primary and secondary service regions show critical access to care from patients that come from a broad distribution of the two-county region, as SACs serves patients primarily in the East and West Valley regions of San Bernardino and the High Desert, with their secondary service region reaching patients as far as Coachella Valley (Indio Clinic) to the California State line. SACHS is an FQHC that has the most specialty services of any FQHC in the country as a patient-centered medical home for many of the residents living in vulnerable communities.

Overview of Community Benefit in FY 2019 A Centralized Community Benefit Plan Implemented by the Institute for Community Partnerships LLUH is unique among many health systems as the hospitals have made a consistent and historic investment in the operations necessary to effectively coordinate and partner with our community. The Institute for Community Partnerships (ICP) and the office of Community Health Development are the strategic arm of the four hospitals community benefit programming. The four licensed hospitals within the LLUH system coordinate their community benefit investments through the Institute for Community Partnerships in order maximize the strategic use of funds to have a greater impact on behalf of the communities they serve. While ICP centralizes and coordinates implementation efforts, all community benefit allocations are tracked and reported, per licensed hospital's 9 90 Schedule H. The Institute for Community Partnerships serves as the primary portal for connecting hospital resources to the needs and people as the LLUH liaison to our community. The mission of ICP is to ensure LLUH remains responsive and relevant to the community. The institute is committed to strategically working with our community partners to better understand and address the needs of the community through activities such as research, teaching, and service-based learning. Community partici pation is at the core of our efforts, with structured learning opportunities for underrepresented minority students, training programs for community health workers and community research projects. ICP implements the LLUH-operated community benefit programs and assessment and provides the research necessary to better target health system interventions to the underrepresented people and in under-estimated communities to promote resiliency and hope. The Institute implements research and programs operated by LLUH and oversees the office of Community Health Development to ensure the strategic investment with partner organizations, and the coordination and reporting of community benefit outcomes on behalf of LLUH. This unique model allows LLUH to focus our impact on the community towards the social determinants (workforce development and education) and in the health priorities where we are working to increase access to care for vulnerable populations. ICP manages the following community engagements on behalf of LLUH to ensure that LLUH is both relevant and responsive to the communities we serve: 1. Community-based partnerships with non-profits on assessment and interventions for target populations. This incl udes funding community partner's work or collaborating with partners to extend access to vulnerable populations, like through the Coachella Connect health access events where screenings, ophthalmology, and dental services are provided to lower income communities. 2. ICP leads LLUH's efforts in listening to the community and documenting the needs in order to maximize our responsiveness through various methods: Maintaining a community based advisory council, a community member advisory council, and regular town hall meetings to bring external and internal members of LLUH together on important topics and interventions in the community. Additionally, ICP conducts ongoing community conversations in order to maintain an open dialogue with our community. 3. Developing the community health worker workforce in non-profits (both health systems, community-based organizations, and in school districts). LLUH is developing a community health worker program in our system with the goal of maintaining 60% of the CHWs time in the community working with patients and their families to overcome undue burdens due to the social determinants of health. These CHWS conduct home visits and provide linkages and accompaniments with patients to social services, the patient's outpatient primary and specialty care providers (regardless of the health system), and peer support and informal coaching to increase self-efficacy of those who face undue burdens. 4. Service learning coordination for all of LLUH's graduate schools and implementation of the CAPS program, or Community-Academic Partners in Service, so the LLUH graduate student populations are serving or volunteering in our local communities as part of their education here at LLUH. 5. Through the Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) program, ICP implements all pipeline programs designed to introduce underserved youth to the health professions in order to encourage youth to pursue higher education and consider the health professions as part of the workforce development goals of LLUH. Approximately 240 middle and high school students attend the LLUH pipeline programs per year producing impactful success stories that improve the lives of the students, their families, and their communities. Overview of Community Benefit PATIENT CARE SERVICES LLUH is committed to providing patients with the very finest possible medical care. Our community benefit patient care services program offers free or low-cost coverage for children and adults with limited resources. LLUH reports only net benefit, or the amount unreimbursed care provided after all revenue has been accounted for, and reports uncompensated dollars as community benefit patient care services. 1. Medi-Cal and other Means tested Government Sponsored Programs: a. Medi-Cal Medi-Cal offers low-cost or free health coverage to eligible Californian residents with limited income. Medi-Cal covers low-income adults, families with children, seniors, persons with disabilities, pregnant women, children in foster care and former foster youth up to age 26. Covered California is the state 's health insurance marketplace where Californians can shop for health plans and access financial assistance if they qualify and LLUH serves patients enrolled in Covered California plans. b. State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHI P) The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a partnership between the federal and state governments that provides health coverage to uninsured children whose families earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to afford private health coverage. Benefits vary by state and by the type of CHIP program, but all states provide comprehensive coverage, like immunizations and well-baby/well-child care, at no cost. The federal government establishes general guidelines for the administration of CHIP benefits. Eligibility depends on your income, the number of people in your family and state rules. In almost every state, children in families with income up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level are covered ($48,500 per year for a family of four). In more than half the states, the income eligibility for children can be even higher. c. California Children's Services California Children's Services (CCS) is a state program for children with certain diseases or health problems. Through this program, children up to 21 years old can get the health care and services they need. CCS connects families to doctors and trained health care providers and professionals who know how to care for children with special health care needs. Examples of CCS-eligible conditions include, but are not limited to, chronic medical conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, cerebral palsy, heart disease, cancer, traumatic injuries, and infectious diseases. CCS also provides medical therapy services that are delivered at public schools. 2. Financial Assistance Program/Charity Care Charity Care is defined as any medically necessary inpatient or outpatient hospital service provided to a patient who has an income below 200% of the current federal poverty level and who has established qualification in accordance with requirements outlined in the LLUH Charity Care and patient financial assistance policies. 3. Subsidized Health Services Discount Payment through the Subsidized Health Services is defined as partial charity care which results from any medically necessary inpatient or outpatient hospital service provided to a patient who is uninsured or whose insurance coverage does not otherwise provide a discount from the usual and customary rates of LLUMC. The requirements for subsidized care are that a patient 1) desires assistance with paying their hospital bill; 2) has an income at or below 350% of the federal poverty level; and 3) has established qualification in accordance with requirements contained in the LLUMC Charity Care Discount Payment Policy. LLUH supports the training of 650 Residents and 97 Fellows HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION At Loma Linda University Health, our experienced health care workforce is committed to helping health professionals in training succeed in their graduate medical education. Students from various medical professions such as medicine interns and residents, and pharmacy, chaplain cy and the allied health professionals are offer ed diverse clinical experiences and are mentored through a collaborative , team-based learning environment to complement their education as they discover ways to improve patient care. The residency programs give students the unique opportunity to learn at the only Level 1 Trauma Center in San Bernardino County and the Inland Empire. LLUCH the only Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in the region and is the only area facility equipped to provide pediatric transplants in Southern California. Residents and students receive comprehensive education and an opportunity to participate in clinical trials and train on multidisciplinary teams in the medical simulation laboratory. Our Medical Simulation Center (MSC) is one example of how we combine technology and practical clinical simulations to create a compressive learning experien ce to enhance patient safety, quality of patient care, and inter-professional health care provider education. The MSC provides: An adequately staffed, professional, and cohesive team; A leadership role in providing best practices in simulation methodology; Proactive standardized processes in providing quality simulation learning experiences RESEARCH The world-renowned scientists at Loma Linda University are striving to advance the understanding and care of human health in order to fulfill the institution's mission \" To further the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ to make man whole.\" The office for Research Affairs facilitates and promotes high quality research conducted at Loma Linda University, Loma Linda University Medical Center and all affiliated entities. As an academic medical provider, LLUH offers the research community a shared responsibility for the ethical conduct of research and compliance. Our research program is an integral part of learning and important to the development scientists for the health care workforce of tomorrow. The institution is invested in growing not only clinical research, but has an extensive portfolio of community health and community-based research projects offering students and medical professionals in-training a diverse range of settings for research studies. 1. Clinical Trials and Research Operating as a centralized logistics office with the highest level of efficiency and customer service, the Clinical Trial Center promotes clinical trial quality and development through consultation, training, and the pursuit of new trial opportunities. The center ultimately seeks to ensure that stakeholders have the information that they need to facilitate the compliant execution of clinical trials. The Clinical Trial Center (CTC) offers various services to assist Loma Linda investigators and their study staff with all aspects of clinical research. From the planning stages to the study close-out and everything in between, the CTC staff brings extensive training and years of experience. 2. Community Health Research With the mission to serve and enhance the health of our communities, our research activities are strategically designed to focus on reducing health disparities, improving health, and promoting wholeness in the region. We achieve this by fostering academic and community-based partnerships that help and support our research endeavors. Our institution works closely with community members and partner organizations in these research efforts . One such example is the \" Community-Engaged Research at San Ber nardino School District.\" Loma Linda University Health holds a memorandum of understanding with San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD) to aid with its strategic plan of Health, Wellness & Safety. This plan aims to build an environment and foster a culture which sustains good health, lifelong wellness, and safety for all members of the SBCUSD community. The San Bernardino City Unified School District is the 8th largest school district in California serving over 54,000 students. Community Health Services Investing in primary care providers that serve the most vulnerable populations: LLUH has made a significant community benefit health services investments in a partner organization that provides access to health services for the most underserved residents near downtown San Bernardino. SAC Health System (SACHS) is a non-profit community health care corporation serving the Inland Empire and a regional partner of LLUH in the care of vulnerable populations. The SAC HS clinics provide affordable health care services for all, and primarily serve uninsured patients and their families. SAC Health System Leadership and LLUH work closely together in collaboration as federally qualified health center and academic health system in primary and specialty care services. In 2018, the SAC Health System had 120,695 total patient visits and LLUH had over 1.6 million outpatient visits. Together the two systems are committed to health care and service to all people, especially the underserved people of our region History of SACHS Social Action Corps (SAC) began in the late 1960s as an outreach effort from students and staff at Loma Linda University and Medical Center. Over the course of 30 years these volunteers offered temporary medical clinics in donated spaces within the community. In the early 1990's, SAC began to look for a permanent location and by 1992 Norton Air Force Base was closing and provided an opportunity for SAC to acquire a medical facility. SAC incorporated into a 501(c) (3) community health care corporation and evolved into an independent community health system operating community clinics. SACHS has recently received the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program designation for Family Medicine, Pediatrics and Psychiatry resulting in one of the nation's largest programs. In 2015, SACHS acquired the Federal Qualified Health Center Status. Cash Sponsorships and In-Kind Donation LLUH is committed to supporting community-based organizations with our cash and in-kind donation program to empower and build capacity at these organizations. Our contributions to annual resource fairs, health initiatives, health fairs and community programs are strategically designed to help and serve the in-need members of our community. In-kind services include hours contributed by staff to the community while on health care organization work time, the cost of meeting space provided to community groups and the donations of food, equipment, supplies, and operational support for non-profits. Every year, LLUH hospitals provide supportive resources and services above and beyond the standards of patient care in order to encourage the health, wellness, and in order to address the whole-person need of the people we serve. For some populations, LLUH is the only provider in the region for specialty services. These are cash and in-kind services provided to community members as part of our community benefit and reported financially under the corresponding hospital's 990 Schedule H. Only outreach events that ar e advertised to the community, free, and extend access and outreach to education through screenings and referrals to health services, including other non-LLUH providers in the region, are accounted for in cash and in-kind donations under hospital community benefit . Implementing Community Health Benefit: Community Building & Investments Community-based Partner Investments LLUH has made significant investments in our partner organizations over the 2017-2019 funding cycle through grants, investments in capacity-building of local partners, and in-kind contributions of resources to support the operations of local partners who serve our primary community benefit populations, by community benefit priority areas:3 3 CEO San Bernardino is th e \"Center for Employment Opportunity,\" a non -profit that works with adults who are re- entering the workforce from previous incarceration. ICP & Community Engagement Through the Institute for Community Partnerships, LLUH is able to partner with organizations on community-based participatory research initiatives and is able to provide community partner organizations assessment, implementation, and evaluation and research expertise. ICP, funded by the LLUH hospitals, increases access to the resources of the academic medical, graduate institution, including graduate student researchers, in order to support the region through assessment, implementation on projects, and research. Additionally, ICP manages the service learning projects for LLUH students to go out and serve the broader community in volunteer hours and time spent in service working with community members. For the 2017-2019, three-year cycle of community benefit, LLUH implemented the following community programs, a representation of efforts across the institution towards the community benefit priority areas and as part of the commitment to increasing access to health resources and care. ICP Pipeline Programs - Workforce Development & Education The pipeline programs run by the Institute for Community Partnerships are intended to provide disadvantaged youth exposure and access to exercise, healthy lifestyle education, and career options in health care in order to increase access to education, as part of the community benefit investments made by the LLUH hospitals. The pipeline programs Goal 4 Health, My Campus, and Summer Gateway are run by the Community-Academic Partners in Service (CAPS) office and funded by hospital community benefit. In 2018, CAPS served 522 youth from the surrounding areas, and predominantly from disadvantaged and low income neighborhoods, by providing a safe place for children to play in a community soccer league; quarterly My Campus events, where local high school students attend informative sessions on healthcare careers and tours of the campus; and the Summer Gateway summer-camp, a three-week intensive for local underrepresented minority high school students to spend time on the LLUH campus and learn about the potential for healthcare graduate school and career options to increase their likelihood of pursuing a 4-year bachelor's degree upon graduating from college. Community Benefit Spotlight - Coachella Connect Health Service Fairs ICP, local community partners, and local partner health systems organized a community health services fair in order to bring basic medical and dental services to under-served populations out in the East Coachella Valley ; populations that often lack access to services due to socioeconomic, and geographic realities. Services provided by the LLU team focused on vision, and comprehensive dental services.

The implementation plan for this effort includes the following major initiatives : ICP contracts and provides technical assistance to School Districts to create CHEW jobs: LLUH through ICP is building community health education worker teams (CHEWs) in local school districts in order to extend outreach to at-risk populations of students, or youth who are at-promise, based on what districts most need addressed. The CHEWs are trained to work in the education system and through relationship building and home visits, extend outreach, social supports, linkages and accompaniments to families, resource support, and informal peer counseling to help students who are chronically absent, face undue health challenges, or are experiencing mental or behavioral health crisis have additional, intensive supportive resources. ICP currently contracts with 2 school districts and employs eight CHEWS working in the community, a manager of integration to oversee the project, and is conducting interventions with families who have children who are chronically absent (one district) and the other district is a focused intervention to prevent against suicidal ideation or action (behavioral health prevention). All four licensed hospitals invest in ICP operations in order to carry out this level of partnership, responsiveness, and intervention in our communities. Only expenses above and beyond contractual revenue are reported as community benefit . ICP is investing in non-profit, community-based organizational partners who want to expand outreach to their populations through the addition of community health workers through either seed funding for community health worker positions or, through technical assistance with grant activities to help increase partner potential to acquire dollars to hire community health workers. ICP invested in a community health worker integration program with a non-profit partner in the Coachella Valley where FIND Food Bank added a CHW to their outreach team. The position will be sustained by Cal Fresh enrollment dollars as a sustainability plan while the CHW working there is focused on intensive outreach visits to at-risk families. Community-based Services: Integration of the CHW workforce in the LLUH system with Deployment in the Community In FY 2019 LLUH conducted a pilot with 2 CHWs who integrated into high-risk areas where vulnerable populations access our health system but face undue health burdens in trying to address their health and wellness post-encounter in either inpatient our outpatient settings. This includes linkages to LLUH's priority on disease related to poverty through a focus on at-risk infants and mothers in the NICU and at-risk adults with diabetes in the outpatient Diabetes Treatment Center. Due to the initial success of the pilot program in 2019, LLUH is formally creating a CHW Integration and Intervention Program through the Institute for Community Partnerships based on the following parameters: LLUH hospitals will invest in hiring six CHW positions and two operations positions (Manager & coordinator/supervisor) to run the program. The ICP management/operations positions oversee the CHEW contracts in school districts in addition to the establishment of the CHW program at LLUH. The LLUH CHWs will be entirely focused on the target population, those from underserved communities who lack access to services and face poverty, based on the community benefit investment in this community intervention. It is the goal of this program to use the hospital's investment to intervene and lighten the burden of the social determinants of health through community peers who are expertly trained in recognizing and navigating the social determinants of health. While the CHWs are employed by LLUH and meet people who represent vulnerable populations in our region, they are assigned to work in the community with patients and their families who represent the target population, as defined by community benefit parameters. To ensure this is upheld, CHWS working within the LLUH program will abide by the following metrics: A 51% minimum of time in the community with a stretch goal of 60% time spent in the community will serve as the macro indicator for the program. Secondary outcomes related to special populations, as well as demographic information, will be captured to study the impact of CHWs working with underserved or marginalized populations. Outcomes will be presented in community benefit reporting and in research published and presented on in professional circles by ICP to help increase the access and technical assistance available to health systems on how to integrate and create this resource in other health systems. LLUH CHWs will focus on home visits and community outreach classes/peer support groups for vulnerable populations with the following programmatic goals: Time is the Medicine - Unlike health care providers and clinical staff, the CHWs are able to do time- intensive interventions outside the four walls of our clinical settings. This is accomplished through a trusted relationship as CHWs are able to quickly establish as community peers and engage with community members once they are home. CHWs work with community members and their family members to navigate complex social and health systems to address, manage, and maintain their help once these community members are no longer \"patients\" in our facility, but integrating back to the home to get the care they need. Intervention & Accompaniment - CHWs are able to provide supportive coaching and mentoring to help those they work navigate complex social services and benefits like (DMV, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, etc.). CHWs are also able to provide accompaniment by meeting with community members at appointments and in outpatient and inpatient systems of care (both LLUH and non-LLUH), and CHWs are able to support individuals in accessing resources for survival needs like food banks, housing and rental assistance, and other supportive sources in the community offered by non-profits and community organizations. Special Populations Focus - The LLUH CHWs will be stationed in critical access areas of the health system in order to become connected to community members who are experiencing the highest levels of need. The following are special populations the CHW program will address: 1. At-risk infants and mothers Time is the Medicine. 2. Adults with diabetes 3. Children and youth with diabetes 4. Homeless individuals in our Emergency Department 5. Individuals experiencing escalation of symptoms related to Sickle Cell Diseases 6. Individuals experience a lack of access to mental health or behavioral health services and resources. 7. High utilizers of the LLUH system who experience undue social determinant burden and require extensive, supportive accompaniment and linkage to health and social services upon discharge from the LLUH inpatient system. Finally, special to this program is the two-for-one investment that creating the CHW workforce does to create jobs and develop the workforce. To give CHWs jobs is an act of economic development as people doing the work of a CHW often need the same access to employment as those they are tirelessly serving. CHWs are traditionally, not part of the systems they support, nor do they have access to the workplace benefits. Employment reduces the reliance on grant-based or project\u2014 based employment for CHWs, a source of income insecurity and provides them full benefits . In addition to the programmatic outreach and intervention provided by the CHWs, the creation of the jobs for community members who are trained in this work is also a fulfillment of the community benefit workforce development strategy as priority hiring is reserved for people with lived experience in navigating the social determinants of health, having lived experience with poverty, and those who have received training to become community health workers in the communities from which they are from or with special populations of which they have special knowledge or lived experience. Piloting the Integration of CHWs in Community- Based Settings ICP is investing in non-profit, community-based organizational partners who want to expand outreach to their populations through the addition of community health workers through either seed funding for community health worker positions or, through technical assistance with grant activities to help increase partner potential to acquire dollars to hire community health workers. ICP invested in a community health worker integration program with a non-profit partner in the Coachella Valley where FIND Food Bank added a CHW to their outreach team. The position will be sustained by Cal Fresh enrollment dollars as a sustainability plan while the CHW working there is focused on intensive outreach visits to at-risk families. CHW's Conducting Needs Assessments in Rural Communities : Dream Homes Community Health Assessment 2018 LLUH partnered with Desert Healthcare District (DHCD), El Sol Neighborhood Education Center, and many other partners including Cathedral City to implement a community health needs assessment for the Dream Homes neighborhood. The project was funded by DHCD and centered on CHWs working with residents of Cathedral City to assess their health status. The CHWs were provided by the El Sol Neighborhood Educational Center and exemplified the reality that when CHWs can build trust in communities, they do what external evaluators and assessors of community needs cannot: they collect the data but more importantly, simultaneously empower community members to act on community priorities. Through the assessment, the CHWs worked with the community, ICP, and local organizations to host a health fair and to host community forums to support the civic empowerment of residents of the neighborhood. In community forum meetings, CHWs facilitated conversations with the city and county in relation to policing, public works and neighborhood beautification, and conversations about the need for a safe green space for residents to walk and exercise. Among the top health priorities identified for residents were high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, depression, and anxiety; with access to parks and green spaces and food insecurity as some of the top social determinants of health needs identified. As part of the sustaining work in the community, LLUH is partnering with other local non-profits to continue to deploy CHWs into under-resourced neighborhoods. Out of five CHWs trained, at least three found full-time employment and one serves on the Desert Healthcare District Board as a board member. LLUH is d eploying community health works through community partners to reach under -resourced neighborhoods and peoples.

Cancer Center Outreach Program The cancer objectives for Healthy People 2020 support monitoring trends in cancer incidence, mortality, and survival to better assess the progress made toward decreasing the burden of cancer in the United States. The objectives reflect the importance of promoting evidence-based screening for cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer by measuring the use of screening tests. For cancers with evidence-based screening tools, early detection must include the continuum of care from screening to appropriate follow-up of abnormal test results and referral to cancer treatment. At LLUH we are committed to treating interrelated factors that contribute to the risk of developing cancer. These same factors contribute to the observed disparities in cancer incidence and death among racial, ethnic, and underserved groups. The most obvious factors are associated with a lack of health care coverage and low socioeconomic status (SES). SES is mos t often based on a person's: Income Education level Occupation Social status in the community Geographic location Identified Need 1. Lower than average breast cancer risk although higher than average breast cancer mortality in the Inland Empire. 2. Higher than average lung cancer rates in the Inland Empire. 3. Higher rates of colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates among Inland Empire males than the statewide average. 4. Higher incidence and mortality rates for cervical cancer among Inland Empire women than the statewide average. 5.

Early Intervention & Prevention and Increasing Access to Care for School-age Children Early Intervention & Prevention Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH) currently holds a First 5 Grant6 for the Help Me Grow initiative. Help Me Grow (HMG) is a system that builds multi-sector collaborations and assists families, child health care providers, early education providers, and human service providers to recognize early signs of developmental or behavioral concerns. HMG motivates providers to conduct systematic, standardized developmental screenings of young children and providing them the electronic linkages to improve care across the region for children with developmental delays. HMG assists, when needs are identified, in finding programs designed to address those needs. It is an efficient and effective system that builds on existing resources by improving access to services for families, infants and children through age eight. First 5 San Bernardino and First 5 Riverside, in partnership with Loma Linda Children's Health, convened key stakeholders and experts across diverse sectors, including health departments, early intervention and preschool education, and medical providers to engage in the planning of a dual county HMG system model for the Inland Empire. LLUCH is investing significant workforce time in the leadership of this regional collaboration to ensure it improves the health and well-being of the children not only served by the hospital, but in our entire region. Between our two counties, over 400,000 children ages 0-5 have the potential to benefit from the Ages and Stages (ASQ-3) screening tools and benefit from referrals and increased provider connectivity in addressing their needs. LLUH and regional pediatric care providers will now have the ability on the LLUH Epic platform, the electronic health record system, to access the screening and resource needs of children in the program. Making the LLUH Epic platform available to LLUH physicians, non-LLUH physicians, and other providers of care for children in early start programs is one way LLUH is operating above and beyond the standard of care for people in our region. The linkages provider on behalf of children enrolled in the program will help all providers in responding to critical interventions, preventions early in children's lives. Increasing Access to Care for School-Age Children LLUH and the FQHC Partner SAC Health System, is providing consultative support on the establishment of school-based districts in order to extend care to families where they are more easily able to access community- based services: local schools. In October 2019, San Bernardino City Unified School District and SAC Health System launched a school-based clinic in the district's Enro llment Center where families can access health care resources for their children and family members. The clinic is focused on providing access to children who currently lack access to care and for children who need vaccines and annual check-ups in order to enroll in school. In addition to the school-based clinic, the ability to ensure linkages between families and this new school-based clinic can be facilitated by the community health education workers currently overseen by ICP to help increase linkages to resources for families and their school-age children. With school-based clinics and CHEWs working in school districts, the collaboration potential between LLUH and the multi-sector partners is opening a new chapter of increasing access to care for at- risk populations: this is a new phase of development and possibility in the region. 6 Only costs incurred by LLUH above and beyond grant funding are counted as community benefit in the reporting of dollar amounts. Operation Fit Children Served: 360 Children 2017 - 2019 4. Baby Conference LLUH operates a free baby conference offered to expecting mothers and mothers with infants in order to provide moms with community-based services and support. The conference is open to the community and free and designed to help mothers who may face challenges find access to supportive community services, health care services, and behavioral health services. 5. Reach Out and Read Program LLUH is participating in an institutional wide ROAR program sponsored by SBC First 5 providing this literacy grant to address the low literacy rates in children. LLUH will have given out over 25,000 new books through 9 clinics (Pediatrics, Med/Peds, and Family Medicine) over a 12 month period, where every child at their well child visits will receive an age appropriate book starting at 6 months through 5 years of age. The child will have received 10 books on this program by the age of 5 years. LLUH has concentrated selections of children's books that address lifestyle, healthy eating, active living, community engagement and health family relationships. LLUCH donates staff time to implement the program through ICP. 6. Operation Fit Over the 2017-2019 cycle, LLUH community benefit has sponsored the program Operation Fit, a summer camp for children who are underrepresented minority youth from low-income households. The program recruits children to enroll from families seen at the SACHS clinic. The program, Directed by Dr. Marti Baum, Medical Director for Community Health Development at LLUH, provides a week-long program, led by medical students and residents on exercise and nutrition to encourage healthy lifestyles among youth and to provide early-intervention for childhood obesity. Since 2017, Operation Fit has run four camps with 30 children served per camp, per year, or an average of 120 children served annually . FY 2019 Community Benefit: Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC) Total Economic Value: 4,873,792 Medi -Cal and other Means Tested Government Programs, $3,590,654 Financial Assistance Programs/Charity Care, $3,501 Health Professions Education, $1,087,461 Community Health Benefit, $192,186 Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center - Community Health Benefit Selected Program Highlights LLUBMC provides a range of services to the community through behavioral health fairs designed to provide screenings and educate the community on behavioral health conditions. The LLUBMC community benefit activities are designed to challenge the stigma and barriers to seeking behavioral and mental health services. 1. Stand up to Stigma 5k LLUMBC sponsors a unique community event to reduce the stigma of mental illness by encouraging community members to participate in the 5K. Held in May during Ment al Health Awareness month, the walk creates community dialogue about mental illness to stand up to stigma. Proceeds from the 2018 were dedicated to a children's playground for children receiving mental health services. 2. Mental/Behavioral Health Education and Awareness - Outreach Behavioral Health Education and Awareness activities involve trainings, presentations, and in -service opportunities typically geared towards professionals, clinicians, general community and/or employer organizations. LLUBMC staff provides outreach and education in the community. The goal is to provide information on topics within the scope of behavioral health that will reduce stigma, increase knowledge, and assist community members in accessing services. Topics include awareness around mental health and substance abuse for children, adolescents, and adults. 3. Senior Behavioral Health Services Activities addressing senior behavioral health typically are in the form of general education, screenings, and awareness activities as much of the geriatric population are often reluctant to access mental health services due to the stigma and shame they ma y be feeling. Additionally, the Medical Director collaborates with other providers and educates them on signs and symptoms to look for in their patients so they are better able to detect any underlying psychiatric conditions that need to be addressed. 4. Behavioral Health Screenings LLUBMC sponsors the psychiatric interns in training to conduct screenings geared towards the general community in the Inland Empire, senior facilities, and or employer organizations , or with vulnerable populations who may require treatment . At least one clinical therapist or program representative handles program specific questions and interprets depression screening and mental health assessment results. 5. Support for Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) LLU BMC provides meetings space to AA free of charge , five -days -a- week all year long, as a supportive service to community members who are in recovery from addition. Space in the LLUBMC gymnasium allows for a large regional meeting space to support community members who are committed to their sobriety. FY 2019 Community Benefit: Loma Linda University Medical (LLUMC - Murrieta) Total Economic Value: $24,745,326 Medi -Cal and Other Means Tested Government Programs, $23,987,975 Charity Care, $751,616.00 Health Professional Education, ($20,265) Community Health Benefit, $26,000 Loma Linda University Medical Center - Murrieta - Community Health Benefit Selected Program Highlights LLUMC - Murrieta: Outreach Activities LLUMC-M dedicates staff time for outreach activities in the community and for patients and families. The Diabetes education classes aimed to increase community awareness on the importance of identifying their cholesterol, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The goal was to increase the overall self-reported health status as good or excellent. Additionally, the Living with Cancer support group is an open forum for sharing personal challenges, practical suggestions and everyday triumphs. All sessions will be hosted by a licensed therapist or health care specialist. The support group is designed for anyone living with cancer and their families. Healthy Valley Coalition The Healthy Valley Coalition was established in 2014 with the mission to grow, promote, and increase community health and awareness in Murrieta, Temecula, and the surrounding communities. This coalition is a collaboration of community partners from local businesses, non-profit organizations, hospitals, city and county representatives, and civically engaged citizens. The coalition focuses on aging, chronic illness education, children's health services, and behavioral health initiati ves whereby disparities are identified and prevention is promoted. The vision of the Health Valley Coalition is to support improvement in health indicators of the Southwest Riverside communities. The mission is to provide individuals, businesses, and institutions access to information, resources, ideas, and initiatives that support the community's wellness. The Healthy Valley Coalition meets monthly to discuss ways to improve education and knowledge of health care related events and activities in the Murrieta and surrounding areas. LLUH current has the Murrieta Community Advisory Committee and the Pediatric Advisory Committee. Workforce Development The hospital, City of Menifee, and LLU are opening pathways for local residents to have a bridge to the health professions and higher education. The hospital is currently planning in FY 20 to invest dollars in workforce development dollars to provide pathways to education and to develop community health workers in their service region. The Year Ahead: FY 20 - FY 22 CHIS LLUH - COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSEMENT Findings during FY 2019 Assessment The FY 20 - FY 22 CHIS Priorities: July 1, 2020 - June 30, 2022 Community Benefit FY 2020 Like many academic medical providers, LLUH implements a number of community-based programs and services as well as outreach activities that impact the lives of many people in our region. LLUH is fortunate with the blessing of having many system activities we can identify that benefit the community. While LLUH has a good financial accounting and tracking of these community benefit activities, the collection of standardized data remains the primary focus of the 2020-2022 CHIS cycles to increase our ability to tell the story of the impact we have on the community. The following initiatives will be primary strategies for the 2020- 2022 community health implementation strategy: Better measure the social determinant of health burden on low-income populations: Strategy 1: Through the Institute for Community Partnerships, LLUH will conduct continuous assessments and evaluations through community-based surveying and community conversations, in order to assess the needs and strengths of communities as they evolve, and in order to have comparison data to the baseline data collected in the CHNA. Strategy 2: LLUH is committed to implementing a social determinants screening through the electronic health record system for our patients to improve data collection and enhanc e physician decision-making on how to better care for populations of people who experience health barriers due to the burden of the social determinants of health. Standardize data collection across community benefit initiatives, programs, and outreach for improved outcomes tracking: Strategy 1: ICP will create standardized data collection required of all ICP projects and studies in order to capture the same data across all efforts. While the project-specific outcomes will differ, the primary data collection will allow for enhanced data capture of number of people served and any changes in health status across programs. Strategy 2 : Working with hospital leadership, ICP will create standardized data collection for community benefit activities in order to begin to increase data collection and reporting on the wide variety of activities and services provided across our health system. Implement the CHIS priorities, through community health benefit investments and programs, as adopted by our Board in August of 2020. The Fy2020-2022 CHIS is available on the ICP website, Reports & Resources page: https://lluh.org/about-us/community-benefit/reports-and-resources Planned Collaborations Central to ICP's work on behalf of the four licensed hospitals is coordinating our engagement with community partners on regional initiatives. For the FY 2020-2022 CHIS, two regional collaborations are in development with potential partners. Projects mentioned here will have status updates reported in the annual community benefit reports: Regional Dialogue, Community Conversations, and Continuous Assessment & Engagement The Institute for Community Partnerships is implementing on-going community conversations across the four major regions of our service area in order to uphold the mission of the institute to ensure LLUH remains relevant and responsive to our community over the course of the 3-year CHIS cycle. To achieve this goal, there are some major efforts: 1. Developing tools for the screening of social determinants of LLUH patients. LLUH is taking a leadership role in developing the adoption of EPIC platform's social determinant screening tool in order to screen patients for SDOH and food, housing, and other risks. 2. Conducting two community conversations in our four major regions per year of the CHIS cycle in order to ensure that the decisions to make investments of community benefit dollars according to the priority areas are in relevant to community needs over 3 years. - LLUH Service Regions: East/West Valley Murrieta/Temecula High Desert Coachella Valley Mountain Communities 3. Updating and deploying community health workers to conduct SDOH screenings in the community when necessary to reach typically under-surveyed, low income communities and neighborhoods. Alignment with County-wide Efforts: Workforce Development for Youth With a county-wide investment and focus on youth, LLUH through ICP is involved in regional collaborations to increase the bridge from high school to college by connecting our pipeline programs to the larger county efforts. Uplift SB City is an initiative to incentivize students to do well, achieve good grades, and stay in school in order to decrease disengaged youth and increase graduation rates. Uplift SB City engages a multi-stakeholder advisory to help guide the strategic plan for change in the county and unify partners on collective goals, below. The program is focused on the long-term outcomes for local youth in graduating from college, getting jobs in our region, climbing career ladders in the local market, owning local businesses, and buying homes in the region. Strategic Framework of Uplift San Bernardino: Additionally, LLUH is partnering with the county efforts of GenerationGo!, a program run by the San Bernardino County Workforce Development Board, that offers volunteering, apprenticing, and work- experience opportunities to youth ages 16- 24. The program enrolls students in participating partner's workforce training and apprentice during college in order to explore career opportunities and experiencing mentoring. LLUH is participating as a workforce site and will take-in young high school students in internships and apprenticeships in order to introduce them to health professional careers. Regional Effort to Address Homelessness In September 2019, ICP brought together hospital partners from across our more immediate region, within 30 miles of the hospital, to discuss potential shared approaches on dealing with homelessness. Hospitals in close proximity to one another have a degree of overlap between the homeless patients, ICP facilitated a preliminary discussion to determine the feasibility and likelihood of a regional approach and use of community benefit dollars to add resources that do not currently exist into the continuum. LLUH, through ICP, is currently in discussions with major health systems and hospitals in our region to discuss a potential collaboration over this three-year cycle. While a potential project concept is in the development phase, the following was discussed: 1. Hospitals are having to navigate the long-term policy discussion and potential investment in housing discussions (long-term impact projects) at the same time they are navigating the demand for resources and the increased pressure to show responsiveness (short-term impact projects). All hospitals are facing a resource shortage and this is intensified based on geography (like for mountains or desert communities). Additionally, given the complexity of long-term housing development investments city- to-city, hospitals may need to focus on more immediate responsiveness and projects in a regional collaboration or collective impact model. 2. The homeless population can be divided into chronically homeless and the situationally or short-term homeless. Hospitals may be better positioned to focus new resources or interventions on populations that are situationally homeless given the County efforts on the chronic population. There is interest to partner on projects for the situationally homeless locally for collective impact regionally. Micro Financing - Increasing Access for Historically Under-invested Communities LLUH through ICP is in the preliminary phase of learning about regional microfinancing efforts that have a willingness to provide financing to either a) loans to people who have lower socioeconomic status or come from communities that are historically under-invested b) local non-profits that may benefit by micro- financing to support capacity building in order to create \"proof of concept\" and identify sustainability for interventions or resources they seek to establish. As low-income communities often face the economic burden of under-investment and decreased access to small business development, revitalizing neighborhoods through increasing access to non-predatory lending and affordable microloans may be a way LLUH can influence and support the economic empowerment of people with the desire to start small businesses to overcome cycles of poverty. This is a potential in the research and development stage only. Building Community Gardens: Huerta del Valle and SAC Norton Clinic One of the most promising opportunities of FY20 is the installation of a community garden in San Bernardino at the SAC Norton Clinic in fulfillment of the need for safe green spaces for children and families (identified in the 2019 CHNA). The garden will be managed by Huerta del Valle and will feature more than just gardening opportunities as Huerta builds community, offers health programming, and has expertise in building resiliency, health, and engagement through gardens, environmental justice, and community. The garden will be a Service Learning and ICP programs site to bring students in graduate programs at LLUH out into working with the community through after school programs, health education, and potentially workforce development and tutoring for children and youth. The project is a partnership between LLUH community benefit, Huerta, and SAC Health System to increase access to safe green spaces and healthy, affordable food options. Technical Assistance to Non-profit Organizations for Workforce Capacity Building ICP is currently planning the following capacity-building activities to leverage the LLUH investment in ICP & community benefit staff to further serve our community through skill-building of emerging workforces. Workforce Integration - Professional Skills Training Free professional skills training, conducted by community benefit staff and community partners, will be offered to workforce entry professionals who require access to continuing education and support in order to maintain employment and to ensure the transition into the workforce is successful and maintained to help alleviate poverty due to unstable employment. The target audience for this population is: 1. Entry-level health professionals who require support to maintain and maximize work opportunities; 2. Individuals from low-income communities; 3. People of color and/or people with low socio-economic status; 4. People who are part of emerging workforces or first-generation workforce; 5. People who have traditionally lacked access to professional development resources such as training and/or coaching and mentorship due to an inability to pay. ICP and partners will recruit professionals who meet the above criteria in order to fill cohorts for training. The FY 20 will be a pilot test year of 2-3 cohorts to test if this will become a longer-standing community benefit activity implemented by ICP and community benefit staff. Technical Assistance - Organizational Capacity Building for Non-profit Partners ICP's community benefit staff are also working on an initiative to increase support of non-profit partner's ability to test expanded interventions and the addition of community health workers to their operations. As many non-profits struggle with tight operating margins, ICP will assist selected non - profit partners in the following activities: 1. Support in grant development and management 2. Financial and/or project financing consultation 3. Program design and evaluation 4. Pilot testing of integrating community health workers into operations with a plan for sustainability to ensure job creation. This project is currently in-design and will be tested with one-two partners in the coming months. The workforce development and technical assistance projects piloted by ICP are one of the implementation strategies so LLUH can leverage the investment in the institute's operations and staff on behalf of the community so our professional team working in community partnerships also professionally contributes to workforce development. Our Community Benefit in FY 2020- FY 2022 LLUH is taking the mission of being relevant to the community, of listening to the community, and responding to the community to a new level with this new CHIS cycle. The four hospitals in the LLUH system have expanded their outreach and partnerships with organizations that serve some of the most vulnerable or underserved populations in our region. In 2020 , we are aligning our efforts on workforce development and education as a direct response to poverty and in response to what the community told us is most important: more jobs, affordable housing and responses to homelessness, and healthy and affordable food choices. It is difficult to gain and maintain health without access to income, housing, and nutritious food. Education and employment are incredibly strong determinants of health as an increasing number of studies correlate the lifespan and quality of life of a person to their zip code. LLUH has transitioned from a sole focus on disease to a strategic focus on key social determinants for health investment: workforce development and education. LLUH lives the mission of education for the health professions, but many high school students in our region don't and cann ot access this dream . Our health career pipeline programs are aimed at increasing educational attainment for students of all ages and we are investing in community partners who give access to education or career development services through unique approach es that provide supportive service to people as they increase their education or entry into the workforce . As a health care system we continue to seek to improve the health of our community. However, to meet our priority health areas of obesity, diabetes, and mental health, LLUH begins by investing in the workforce development of community health workers in the health care system, school districts, and community-based organizations as of our double-impact strategy. When community health workers can build trust and work with vulnerable populations who lack access to care and services, incredible change can happen in health outcomes of people and families. CHWs build the self-efficacy of individuals and teach them the vital skills of how to navigate the resources available to them in order to improve health and well-being. For this last year of the current CHNA cycle, LLUH is partnering with community organizations who are hiring community health workers to achieve a greater impact in linking vulnerable, under-served, and under-resourced members of our region to the services and care they need. LLUH is targeting new community investments in order to reach resilient community members in some of the most under-served communities. Most importantly, we are dedicated through a strengths-based approach, to build hope in some of the most under-estimated communities in our region.
