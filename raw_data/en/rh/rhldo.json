Shouldn't that be the other way around? You've heard of Hippocrates, the Greek physician who said, \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" If anybody would be doing more rolling in their graves, it would be him. Why do they call healthy whole foods \"alternative medicine\" when it's the original medicine we've been using for thousands of years? Chemical medications were invented about 100 years ago. THAT'S the alternative medicine. EAT YOUR MEDICINE Get this... Whatever your age, your body is many years younger. In fact, even if you're middle-aged, most of you may be just 10 years old or less. It's true. Your body (your cells) rebuilds itself every day with new cells. And it's rebuilding with the foods (raw materials) you give it. You really are what you eat! Now\u2014imagine you tearing down a neglected house with a weak foundation that was built with cheap materials, and then rebuilding it with the same cheap materials that caused the weak foundation in the first place. Why bother, right? So, as you're-creating all these new cells, what kind of condition do you think they are in? Your immune system is the greatest \"pharmacist\" ever created. Would you expect your pharmacist to be able to formulate the healing medicines for you if you denied him the very ingredients he needs to make them? Of course not. Well, it's the same with your \"internal pharmacist,\" which is your immune system. Your immune system is the greatest pharmacist ever created. It knows how to make more than 100 billion types of medicines, called antibodies. The medicines made by your own internal pharmacist give you virtually no side effects, they come to you free of charge, and they are the most potent healing agents on earth. The only thing your immune system asks of you is the right raw materials it needs to manufacture all the internal medicines you need to get and stay well from minor and major health issues. In this video, I'll show you a list of foods to choose and foods to lose. I show you: - why corn, one of America's most popular food, isn't popular for your heart and brain - why milk, for a lot of people, is slowly taking away their health instead of giving it - Why olive oil is not as healthy as you think - why eating this time of the day can really change your life for the better Get pen and paper ready to write down what you need to get you started. Then get ready to eat "}
