To gain the most benefits from probiotics, they should be consumed on a daily basis. By taking them regularly, probiotics are able to live in, or \"colonize\" the digestive tract and fight off bad bacteria. If your child has stomach problems, such as diarrhea caused by antibiotics, probiotics may help rebuild a healthy colony of good bacteria, which can aid the immune system when your child may need it most.1-3 References: 1.

Isolauri E et al. Probiotics: effects on Am J Clin Nutr 2001;73(suppl):440S-50S. Q:What exactly do probiotics protect my kids from? Probiotics are healthy bacter ia that must be consumed in order to build up in our digestive system -in the lining of the GI tract.

Most importantly, they help keep our immune system healthy by increasing disease-fighting antibodies.1,2 References: 1. Tuohy KM et al. Using probiotics prebiotics to improve gut health.
