Meditation has been practiced throughout history by adherents of all the world's religions. In [Roman Catholicism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-Catholicism), for example, meditation consists of active, voluntary, and systematic thinking about a biblical or theological topic. Mental images are [cultivated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultivated) and efforts are made to empathize with God or with figures from the [Bible](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bible). Eastern religious practices that involve thinking in a controlled manner have been described as meditation in the West since the 19th century. The [Hindu](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism) philosophical school of [Yoga](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yoga-philosophy), for example, prescribes a highly elaborate process for the purification of body, [mind](https://www.britannica.com/topic/mind), and [soul](https://www.britannica.com/topic/soul-religion-and-philosophy). One aspect of Yoga practice, dhyana (Sanskrit: \"concentrated meditation\"), became the focus of the [Buddhist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buddhism) school known as Chan in China and later as [Zen](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zen) in Japan. In the late 1960s the British rock group the [Beatles](https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Beatles) sparked a vogue in the West for Hindu-oriented forms of meditation, and in the following decade [Transcendental Meditation](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Transcendental-Meditation) (TM) became the first of a variety of commercially successful South and East Asian meditative techniques imported by the West. Academic psychological studies of TM and other forms of meditation followed rapidly. [ More From Britannica Indian philosophy: Theories and techniques of self-control and meditation ](/topic/Indian-philosophy/The-Yoga-sutras#ref314656) In numerous religions, spiritual purification may be sought through the verbal or mental repetition of a prescribed efficacious syllable, word, or text (e.g., the Hindu and Buddhist [mantra](https://www.britannica.com/topic/mantra), the Islamic [dhikr](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dhikr), and the Eastern Christian [Jesus Prayer](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jesus-prayer)). The focusing of attention upon a visual image (e.g., a flower or a distant mountain) is a common technique in informal contemplative practice and has been formalized in several traditions. [Tibetan Buddhists](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tibetan-Buddhism), for example, regard the [mandala](https://www.britannica.com/topic/mandala-diagram) (Sanskrit: \"circle\") diagram as a collection point of universal forces, accessible to humans by meditation. [Tactile](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Tactile) and mechanical devices, such as the [rosary](https://www.britannica.com/topic/rosary) and the [prayer wheel](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prayer-wheel), along with music, play a highly ritualized role in many contemplative traditions. Most meditative practices concentrate attention in order to induce [mystical](https://www.britannica.com/topic/mysticism) experiences. Others are mindful of the mental character of all contents of [consciousness](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consciousness) and utilize this insight to detach the practitioner either from all thoughts or from a selected group of thoughts\u2014e.g., the [ego](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ego-philosophy-and-psychology) (Buddhism) or the attractiveness of [sin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sin-religion) ( [Christianity](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity)). Meditation may also serve as a special, potent preparation for a physically demanding or otherwise strenuous activity, as in the case of the warrior before battle or the musician before performance. The doctrinal and experiential truths claimed by different practices of meditation are often inconsistent with each other. [Hinduism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism), for example, asserts that the self is divine, while other traditions claim that God alone exists ( [Sufism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism)), that God is immediately present to the soul (Christianity and [Judaism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Judaism)), and that all things are empty ( [Mahayana](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mahayana) Buddhism). In the West, scientific research on meditation, beginning in the 1970s, has focused on the psychological and physical effects and [alleged](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged) benefits of meditation, especially of TM. Meditative techniques used by skilled practitioners have proved to be effective in controlling pulse and respiratory rates and in [alleviating](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleviating) symptoms of migraine headache, hypertension, and hemophilia, among other conditions. Disenchantment with materialistic values led to an awakening of interest in [Indian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indian-philosophy), [Chinese](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chinese-philosophy), and [Japanese](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Japanese-philosophy) philosophy and practice among primarily young people in many Western countries in the 1960s and '70s. The teaching and practice of numerous techniques of meditation, most based on Asian religious traditions, became a widespread phenomenon. For example, the practice of \" [mindfulness meditation](https://www.britannica.com/science/mindfulness-meditation),\" an [adaptation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adaptation) of Buddhist techniques, was popularized in the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States) beginning in the 1980s. Its medical use as an adjunct to psychotherapy was widely embraced in the late 1990s, leading to its adoption in many psychiatric "}
