I CARE Acknowledge with Empathy Respond with Respect End with Excellence Make genuine connections with our patients, their f amilies and each other. Acknowledge others and anticipate their needs. Respect all persons. Go above and beyond in closing every interaction Connect with Compassion Lee Health has a strategy for achieving our vision through these four priorities Lee Health's Mission, Vision & Values reflect who L ee Health is today, and where we are headed. 4 SECTION TWO Performance Improvement Performance Improvement is designed to provide an o ngoing review of processes and outcomes in all departments with continual improvement as our goal. Please share your observations and suggestions to help us continually improve. Our Performance Improvement model is the Plan, Do, Check, Act Cycle (PDCA). The four stages take us from problem identification to problem resolution. 1. PLAN: What is the problem? What can be done to solve the problem? 2. DO: Put changes in place to improve processes on a smal l scale -then test. 3. CHECK: Ask, \"Have the changes we put in place achieved the desired results?\" 4. ACT: When changes are successful, implement on a larg er scale to get the greatest benefit. DNV-GL Accreditation & ISO Certification Lee Health participates in an annual DNV-GL accredi tation survey to determine our compliance with Medicare's regulations. Passing an accreditati on survey helps ensure we provide safe, quality care and is a requirement for reimbursement from Medicare. Documented Information ISO-9001 is a quality management system to ensure t hat services are being performed consistently. The expectation is that all employees must have acc ess to the most current information available to do their jobs safely and effectively. This is done th rough document control. Ways to participate in control of documented inform ation include: Use materials provided to you by your supervisor. Do not copy or stockpile forms. The copies you mak e and store may become outdated. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards This standard is designed to ensure that all compan ies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain it in a s ecure environment. The key requirements include: Full credit card account numbers, CVV Codes and ex piration dates are NOT to be stored on a computer or Lee Health network. Limit to only the last four digits of the card. Credit card account numbers cannot be relayed via e-mail. Credit card receipts must abbreviate card numbers to the last four digits and completely abbreviate the expiration date. All paperwork containing credit card information m ust be secured in a locked area with limited access. Any paperwork no longer needed should be cr oss-shredded immediately. Fines ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month can be assessed to a company for noncompliance. Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act ( HIPAA) HIPAA is a federal law that protects the privacy of patients and all information about them. It gives patients the right to have the ir information kept private and secure. Violating these laws may result in civil an d criminal penalties and result in termination. All Lee Health entities must comply with the HIPAA rule s. 5 Protected Health Information (PHI) Defined as any information that can be used to iden tify a patient. It relates to the patient's past, present or future health condition including health care services provided and the payment for those services. Sensitive information exists in various forms: 1. Written 2. Spoken/Heard 3. Electronic We are all responsible for protecting the privacy o f sensitive information in ALL forms. If you access PHI without consent or without a job-related reason, you are violating HIPAA and L ee Health policy. Steps to Protecting Patient Privacy: 1. View only what you need to know. 2. Keep information away from prying eyes. 3. Keep your username and password secure. 4. Never leave your workstation unattended unless it h as been locked or it is logged off. Change your password immediately if you suspect it has bee n compromised. 5. Respect every patient's privacy; do not disclose in formation without the patient's permission. 6. Avoid unintentional disclosure. Patient information discussions should only take place in appropriate work settings (not in elevators or cafeteria lines, e-ma ils, telephone conversations.) 7. Promptly report suspected HIPAA violations to your schools instructor . 8. Abide by all policies and procedures for safeguardi ng patient information. Privacy/Security Regulations Enforcement Enforcement of either Florida State Laws or Federal Privacy/Security regulations can be hefty, including but not limited to the loss of an individ ual's professional licensure, significant cash fine s, lawsuits or jail time. Patient Information & Access: All patient medical records (paper or electronic) are confidential. Access to this information is on a need-to-know ba sis by a person who is directly involved in the care of the patient. Being a student or employed by Lee Health does not entitle access to patient information even if that patient is a friend, family member or co-worker. Unauthorized access to a patient's medical records (paper or electronic) by any employee/volunteer/student is unlawful and grounds for immediate termination. Patient records should not be left in areas access ible to non-care givers. Camera Cell Phones Use of cameras or cell phones pose a threat to pati ent and workforce privacy, as well as the privacy and security of protected health information; their use is not permitted whil e on duty. Utilize HIPAA Resources: Lisa Whitacre, System Information Privacy Officer o r HIPPA Help Line 239-343-5247 Donna Brock, System Privacy Coordinator Compliance Hotline 877-807-5647 239-343-6434 Email: Hipaa@leehealth.org 6 Compliance Guidelines The Lee Health's Compliance Program was develop ed to promote full and continued compliance with all federal, state an d local laws and regulations including those related to particip ation in government healthcare programs and the Florida Code of Ethics. Standards of Conduct Lee Health's Standards of Conduct establish expecte d behaviors and are a part of the Compliance Program. Some of the major sections of the Standards of Conduct a re described below. Gifts Sometimes patients or patient's family members want to express their appreciation for the good care they received by offering gifts. Gifts of merchandise (candy, baked goods, flowers, gift cards, etc.) can be accepted up to a value of $25. Gifts of cash or cash gift cards can never be accepted. Cash should be donated to the Lee Health Foundation or y our hospital auxiliary. Vendors might also offer gifts. Nominal gifts such as pens and note pads can be accepted. An occasional meal of modest value or sponsoring lunch for the office staff when a vendor plans to provide an educational presentation would be accept able. Merely dropping off food for the office staff, however, is not appropriate. Gifts over $100 in val ue should not be accepted from a vendor. Conflict of Interest A conflict of interest may occur if an employee/vol unteer/student outside activities or personal interests influence or appear to influence their ability to make ethical decisions related to their employment with Lee Health. Employees/volunteers/s tudents are required to disclose potential conflicts of interests to their school's instructor . If you question whether a situation or activity creates a conflict of interest, reach out to the Compliance D epartment for guidance. Copyrights Copyright laws give legal protection to the author or owner of a product and give them exclusive right to reproduce and distribute copies. Ask for permission from the author or owner of copyrighted works before you rep roduce them. Examples of copyrighted items are: printed works, CD's, DVD's, and computer software. Public Record Inquiries Because Lee Health is a public entity, we are subje ct to Florida Public Record laws. Keep in mind that the documents you create as an employee/volunteer could be released to the public. Hotline Individuals at Lee Health can report compliance que stions or concerns using the Compliance Hotline. The Hotline is available 24/7, and any caller can c hoose to remain anonymous. Employees are encouraged to follow the chain of command first. The Hotline phone number is 1-877-807-5647 and is a vailable \"24/7\". Lee Health has a Whistle-Blower Protection from Reprisal Policy to protect employees who, in good faith, disclose wrongful or illegal acts. No adverse personnel action may be taken against an employee who makes a report in a ccordance with this policy. 7 SECTION THREE Risk and Students Students should perform only duties within their as signed job description. Licensed professional (retired or active) may not perform licensed functi ons as a student. The Purpose of Risk Management in Healthcare Risks to patients, staff, and organizations are a r eal part of healthcare. Risk Management seeks to id entify, reduce or eliminate actual and potential sources of risk, as well as to minimize damages . For example: Risks may include: risk of injury to a patient or staff, or risk of financial damage to t he organization due to property losses, legal actions or damage to the System's reputation. You can assis t by always providing competent patient care, working in a safe manner, using Error Prevention Tools and demonstrating compassionate, caring behaviors. Caring behaviors, such as good communication with p atients and their families, increase the likelihood of compliance with treatment, good outcomes and a posi tive patient experience. It is important to encour age patients and family to tell us whenever they are co ncerned, upset or unhappy with their care. This feedback should be seen as a \"gift\" and accepted wi thout defensiveness or annoyance and used as a basis for positive problem solving. Guest Services and Risk Management staff are available to help if needed. Lee Health's Caring Behaviors 1. Keep Patients Safe a. Give patients your full attention, be responsive to their needs.

Our Error Prevention Tools 1. Questioning Attitude: ask clarifying questions a nd always question and confirm. 2. Cross-monitoring: Be a good \"Wingman\"; maintain situational awareness. 3. Speak up - C.U.S.: I'm Concerned; I'm Uncomfortable; Please Stop. This is a safety i ssue! Our Three Safety Behaviors 1. Safety First, Every Time. 2. Work Well Together. 3. Better Every Day - We improve patient care every day by owning our personal development, reporting events and problems, fixing problems as we go, and learning from others. Prevention Tips for Caregivers /square4 Respond to patients in a timely manner. Watch for c all lights. /square4 Get staff assistance for patients who require help for toileting, a shower or ambulation. /square4 If patient's bedrails are raised keep them raised. (this may be done for patient safety; for those pat ients who are medicated or confused). /square4 Report any significant changes in a patient's condi tion in a timely manner. Safety Absolute Our LEE HEALTH Safety Absolute - Red Rule : Two Patient Identifiers In order to avoid errors and harm caused by misiden tification, it is a system-wide expectation that ev ery Lee Health team member will Match and Verify 2 pati ent identifiers - every patient, every procedure, every time. The reliable identifiers include: Patient's FULL Name *Date of Birth (patient verbalizes day and year) Account/Epic CSN Number Medical Record Number Name & MR# in nursery * Date of birth may not be used for NICU and for un known trauma patients. The most commonly used patient identifiers are: The patient's FULL name and date of birth The practice of always using two patient identifier s to match and verify every patient's identity ever y time is so important to the safe care of our patients that it has been elevated to the status of Red. \"Red\" designates the rule as a safety absolute with the highest priority for exact compliance. An act that has the highest level of risk or conse quence to patient or employee safety if not performed exactly as expected each and every time. Remember: It ALWAYS Takes Two! (2 patient identif iers) 9 Safety Report Safety Reports are the primary communication link b etween you and the Risk Management team. A Safety Report must be completed whenever an event occurs which causes (or could cause) harm to a pati ent or visitor . For example: Falls /square4 Equipment failure which causes (or could cause) inj ury WHEN should the Safety Report be completed? Please contact your supervisor immediately. The Saf ety Report should be completed as soon as possible after the event and before you leave your shift. S afety Reports must reach the Risk Manager within th ree days (72 hours). Please remember all information should be complete and factual; do not use the Safety Report to blame, complain or retaliate against others. WHAT happens to Safety Reports and how are they use d? The Risk Managers receive and review all reports an d conduct additional investigations, if necessary. The sole purpose of a Safety Report is to improve p atient safety and quality of care. Safety Reports are not used in a punitive manner. Events are analyzed for trends and patterns to help identify problem areas so that they can be corrected. Notice of Injury A Notice of Injury form must be completed if a student or employee is injured. These forms can be filled out in the Employee Healt h Office or the Emergency Department during off hours. Once the completed document is received it is sent to Workers' Compensation for review and follow-up. SECTION FOUR Populations Served Age, culture and spiritual beliefs are important el ements in healthcare. The interwoven relationships between these elements impact how care is provided. Populations Served Com petency refers to a staff or student's ability to meet the special needs of spec ific patient populations such as: Age specific needs Cultural/Spiritual values Gender Economic background Education Cognitive/communication impairment Population served competency assessment is a requir ement for every Lee Health employee who regularly interacts with patients or whose judgment, based on population served consideration, may impact patien t safety, communication or outcomes. Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation Every employee, volunteer and students has the obli gation to look for, recognize and report suspected or actual abuse of patients. The abuse may be child abuse, elder abuse, intimate partner abuse (domestic violence) or abuse from an assault. Any person who has reasonable cause to suspect abus e, neglect, or exploitation shall 10 immediately report knowledge or suspicion to the Central Abuse Registry and Tracking System for the State of Florida Hotline: 1-800-96-A BUSE (1-800-962- 2873). Staff/volunteers/students may contact the Care Man agement department for assistance with reporting. Diversity By promoting and embracing diversity and cultural c ompetence, we draw on the diversity of our volunteers and employees and meet the diverse needs of the community we serve. For Diversity Resources and Diversity and Cultural Responsiveness training tailored to the needs of your department, visit our website on IntraLee/Departmen ts/DiverseLee [Diversity/Language Services] or call 239-424-3806. Discrimination, Harassment, Retaliation Discrimination, harassment or retaliation of any in dividual on the basis of any protected category wil l not be tolerated. If you have observed, or if you b elieve you are the victim of discrimination, harass ment, or retaliation, speak to the harasser, and clearly request the offending behavior to stop. If the beh avior does not stop, or if you are not comfortable speaki ng to the harasser, contact your leader, and/or Hum an Resources. Disability Awareness The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a Civil Rights Law. The purpose of this law is to ensure that patients, visitors and guests with disabilities can fully and equally access and enjoy the goods, serv ices and facilities of healthcare system without being segre gated. People who have vision, hearing or speech disabilit ies use different ways to communicate. Lee Health is required by law to communicate effect ively with people who have disabilities. Effective communication with our patients is essen tial to providing care. When there are barriers to communication, such as hearing loss and failure to provide interpretation, healthcare suffers and both the pat ient and the healthcare provider are at risk. Protect our patients and become familiar with the resources Lee Health has to help effectively communicate with those who are deaf, hard of hearin g, or have vision, speech, cognitive or other disabilities. Talk with your supervisor for a ssistance. To obtain an ADA Compliance kit for the Deaf and H ard of Hearing hospital patients or special Patient Communication Board, contact the Ad ministrative Supervisor or Guest Services Manager at your facility. What is a Disability? Any condition or chronic illness that limits major life activities or ability to care for oneself . Major categories include: Behavioral health Physical disabilities Hearing loss Vision loss DiverseLee Lee Health is a community that puts diversity and i nclusion into practice. At Lee Health, we work together to achieve positive result s. We are dedicated to providing a positive work environment of inclusion where ever y individual who walks through our doors is welcomed, valued and treated with resp ect and dignity. Speech impairment Learning disabilities Intellectual and cognitive disabilities 11 General Disability Awareness Tips Treat adults as adults. Be patient, some people may react in different way s to emotionally charged topics. Talk to the person, not the companion. Ask them for the best way to communicate or assist . Use your normal tone of voice. Don't make assumptions about what someone can or c annot do, or what they feel. Be aware that people may have difficulty processin g information or expressing emotions. Patient Care Civil Rights Section 1557 is the non-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act [ACA]. The law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, nationa l origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or disability in certain health programs or activit ies. If a patient feels that they have been discriminate d against, please have them contact Guest Services at their location. In addition, the patient can al so call the Diversity office hotline at 844-616-043 7 to submit a complaint. Patient Discriminatory Bias Any patient request or demand based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation , gender identity, age or disability is an unlawful d iscriminatory bias. Accepting, consenting or comply ing with a patient's discriminatory request violates fe deral law. Examples of discriminatory biases include: Allowing a patient to refuse care from a nurse or doctor based on his/her race. Allowing a patient to refuse access to his/her ro om to individual hospital employees based on their skin color or perceived race. Allowing a patient to refuse care from a nurse or doctor based on his/her speaking voice or accent or the nurse or doctor's perceived religion. If you experience direct discriminatory bias from a patient, or a patient requests that you comply wi th a demand that appears to be based on discriminatory reasons, you should alert your supervisor and contact Lee Health's Diversity and Patient Care Civ il Rights department. Language Interpreters Lee Health offers language assistance service to it s customers at no cost. According to federal and state laws, a qualified interpreter should be prese nt (in a reasonable amount of time) in all situatio ns in which the information exchanged is lengthy or compl ex or requires interactive communication. Interpretation services at Lee Health are provided in the following ways: 1. Staff Interpreters 2. Cyracom Telephonic Interpreter Service 3. Video Remote Interpreting [VRI] 4. Contracted Sign Language Interpreters Translated Documents Lee Health provides various system-wide documents and communic ations in different languages. Contact Forms Management at 239-343-2687. 12 Service Animals Every disabled person has the right to be accompani ed by a service animal in Lee Health facilities, subject to infection control standards and other co nditions and limitations established by law. Contact your supervisor/instructor or security with questions or concerns. A service animal is a dog (or in some cases a minia ture horse) that is trained and performs work or tasks for the benefit of an individual with a di sability. There must be a direct link between the task the animal is trained to do and the individual 's disability. Some examples of service dogs include: Balance dogs Seizure detection dogs Guide dogs A service dog MUST be allowed to accompany the indi vidual with a disability it serves to any area open to the general public, UNLESS : The owner refuses to answer questions about the do g The owner is not in control of the dog The admittance of the animal would be a direct thr eat to the safety, such as: o The risk of contagious disease ( NOT allergies ) o An aggressive, growling animal Questions you are permitted to ask: \"Is your animal required because of a disability?\" \"What work or tasks has your service dog been trai ned to do?\" Questions you CANNOT ask: \"Do you have a certification or documentation for your animal?\" \"What is your disability?\" \"Do you have vaccination history for the dog? Patient Rights & Responsibilities Lee Health wants patients to be well informed, part icipate in their treatment decisions and communicate openly with doctors and the healthcare team. All patient-related customer practices will uphold a fundamental right to consid erate care that includes personal dignity and respect for cultural, psychosocial and spiritual va lues. Patients and families have a rightto be informed of their care responsibilities. Patients, and when appropriate, families have a right to be informed by their physician about outcomes of care, including unanticipated outcomes. Patient End of Life - Dying With Dignity Both Federal and Florida State laws provide for the individual's right to make decisions regarding his or her medical treatme nt. Congress passed the Patient Self-determination Act in 1990, and \"Ad vance Directives\" are the means by which we recognize that right. Advance Directive - This is a legal document that tells caregivers what treatment the patient wants (or does not want) to receive if they become unable to give instructions. The most common type of Advance Directive is a \"Living Will\" and designation of a \"Healthcare Surrogate.\" If the pat ient has an advance directive, a copy of the document is pla ced in the patient's medical record. Hearing dogs Autism service dogs Mobility dogs 13 Living Will - This is a document that lets a patient explain in writing, which medical treatment a patient does or does not want to receive at the end of his or her life. It takes ef fect when the patient can no longer make his or her own decisions, and af ter the physicians caring for the patient determine that the patient is in a terminal conditi on or persistent vegetative state, or has an end- stage condition. Once completed, living wills are v alid indefinitely, but can be changed or canceled at any time by the patient Healthcare Surrogate - This designation names the person the patient has selected to be his or her agent to make healthcare decisions if the patient is unable to do so. The su rrogate can speak for the patient only after it has been determined t hat the patient is not able to voice his or her own wishes. Organ Donation The LifeLink Foundation is a non-profit community service organization ded icated to the recovery and transplantation of high quality organs and tissues for transplant. The Foundation attempts to work sensitively, diligently, and compassionately with d onor families to facilitate the donation of desperately needed organs and tissues for waiting patients. Do not discuss donation with patients or their fami lies. LifeLink/Lions are the designated requestors and must determine medical suitability and obtain medic al examiner clearance before discussing organ, tissue, or eye donations with families. SECTION FIVE Hand Hygiene Hand hygiene is the single most important means of preventing the spread of infections to yourself or others. Hand washing, using either a System approve d soap and running water or an alcohol hand gel, helps prevent the spread of infection. It is important that caregivers prompt each other to wash their hands if an opportunity has been missed, and patients or visitors should be empowered to remind their caregivers about hand hygiene as well. Clean hands save lives! Alcohol Gel (hand sanitizer) Use a full pump of gel - as that is the determined optimal amount for proper hand hygiene. Rub hands together, covering all surfaces of the h ands and fingers. Be sure to allow hands to dry completely. Don't wi pe on clothes . Traditional Handwashing Soap and warm water (proven to cause less irritati on to the skin). Rub hands together with friction for a minimum of 15 seconds. Rinse hands thoroughly to remove all the soap. Gently pat hands to completely dry with paper towe ls. Use paper towels to turn off the faucet and open t he bathroom door. Wa sh your hands with soap and water if: Your hands are soiled. Hands are visibly contaminated with blood, urine, feces, vomit, formula, sputum, food, etc. Before and after eating. After using the restroom. Use alcohol gel (hand sanitizer): Before and after having contact with patients. Before putting on and after removing gloves. After touching equipment or furniture near the patient. 14 /head2right Artificial Nails are NOT permitted for direct patient caregivers an d is discouraged. This includes: extenders, overlays, wraps, acrylics, tip s, tapes or other appliques. These products have been proven to harbor germs and are a danger t o patients. /head2right Keep natural nails less than \u00bc-inch long. /head2right Nail polish may be worn but must be well maintaine d so that microorganisms do not get trapped on your hands. /head2right Use Lee Health approved lotions for patients and employees, as other lotions can k eep the gels and antimicrobial soap from being effectiv e. /head2right Hand hygiene must be performed exactly where you a re delivering health care to patients. Before entering and when leaving a patient's room i s the standard . \"Gel in - Gel out \" During health care delivery there are 5 moments whe n it is essential that you perform hand hygiene: Standard & Transmission Based Precautions Standard Precautions are infection control procedures used in the care of ALL patients to prevent contact with blood, mucous membranes or any infectious material. Standard Precaution practices include good hand hygiene, cough etiquett e, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Transmission-Based Precautions are directed at controlling the pathways infectious agents travel from one person to the nex t. Transmission-Based Precautions will be clearly marked for your protect ion : A \"STOP\" sign should hang from the top of the door frame, in the middle, and should hang at eye level. When you see a stop sign at the room entrance, do not enter the room. Do not transport these patients. Ask the nurse for help. BEFORE TOUCHING A PATIENT When? Why? Clean your hands before touching a patient when app roaching him or her to protect the patient against harmful germs ca rried on your hands. BEFORE CLEAN/ ASEPTIC PROCEDURE When? Why? Clean your hands immediately before performing a cl ean/aseptic procedure to protect the patient against harmful ge rms, including the patient's own germs, entering his or her body. AFTER BODY FLUID EXPOSURE RISK When? Why? Clean your hands immediately after an exposure risk to body fluids (and after glove removal) to protect yourself and the he althcare environment from harmful patient germs. AFTER TOUCHING A PATIENT When? Why? Clean your hands after touching a patient and his o r her immediate surroundings when leaving to protect yourself and t he healthcare environment from harmful patient germs. AFTER TOUCHING PATIENT SURROUNDINGS When? Why? Clean your hands after touching any object or furni ture in the patient's immediate surroundings, when leaving - even without touching the patient to protect yourself and the healthcare envi ronment from harmful patient germ. 1 2 3 4 5 15 Influenza Prevention & Control Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that can become serious enough to require hospitalization, and in some instances, can cause d eath. Vaccination is the primary strategy to prevent infection or development of illness from fl u. Flu symptoms are similar to those caused by other respiratory illnesses, but when the influenza virus is present in a local area; symptoms like fever, muscle aches, and extreme tiredness usually mean the sufferer has the flu. Employees, volunteers and students suffering from t hese symptoms must not return to work until free of symptoms for 24 hours . This protects the patients and other staff member s from exposure. Flu is transmitted from person to person when an in fected person coughs or sneezes. Infected persons can start spreading the virus for one to tw o days before they feel ill or have symptoms. Because of this we require influenza vaccination or a valid exemption for all physicians, staff, volunteers, students, or any healthcare workers tha t enter our facilities and might come in contact with patients. To be effective everyone must be vac cinated each year, as there are many flu viruses and each year's vaccine is developed to tar get the viruses that are most likely to cause disease in the coming flu season. Getting the vacc ine annually helps protect patients as well as the employee and his/her loved ones from an illness taken home from the work environment. ALL Employees, volunteers and students are required to get a flu vaccine or qualify for an exemption annually by the designated deadline. Employees may apply for an exemption for medical re asons or for religious/strongly held personal beliefs or convictions. 16 Employee Health will affix a \"Flu Proof\" sticker to the ID badge of each employee receiving the flu vaccine. Employees granted an exemption will receive an \"I'm Covered\" sticker for their ID badge indicating they are requ ired to properly wear a surgical mask when within 6 feet of patients duri ng flu season. Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that usu ally affects the lungs. TB germs may be spread when a person who has the active disease cou ghs, sneezes, laughs, sings or even talks. The bacterium becomes airborne and is inhaled by a person nearby. Symptoms of TB Include: Fever, night sweats Loss of appetite, weight loss Fatigue Chest pain Coughing up blood Cough which persists longer than 3 weeks A PPD (skin) test is used to screen for TB. If the PPD is positive, further testing is done to determine whether the person has an inactive TB inf ection or has active TB disease. Measures to prevent patients with TB from spreading the infection : All patients who are suspected of having TB are pl aced in private, negative airflow rooms with the door closed. Patients with suspected or known TB who must be transported will wear a regular mask during the time they are out of their room. Workers caring for these patients must wear specia l respirators (N-95). They are fitted to the face. (Students do not assist with patients under t ransmission-based precautions.) PPD tests are conducted annually on all healthcare workers with direct patient contact and twice a year in high-risk areas. Bloodborne Pathogens Bloodborne pathogens are disease causing organisms present in blood and other body fluids. Transmission can happen as the result of a needle s tick (used needle), getting blood on your skin if you have open cuts or sores, or a blood spl atter to the eyes. Examples of these bloodborne pathogens are: Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Human Immunodeficienc y Virus (HIV). Bloodborne Pathogens Safety Tips: Know where to locate personal protective (PPE) equ ipment, how to use it, which PPE to use, (depends upon task, or risk of exposure and type of precautions) and how to dispose of it properly. Students do not assist with care of patients where PPE is needed. Occupational exposure means contact with any infec tious material to the skin, eye, mucous membrane, non-intact skin or parentally (needle sti ck). Report exposures promptly to your supervisor and report to Employee Health. For your safety do not eat, drink, apply cosmetics or handle contact lenses in patient care areas. Eating is only allowed in staff lounges or c afeteria and other designated areas. Use proper cleaning methods: All blood and body f luid spills are to be cleaned as soon as possible. Healthcare workers should wear the appro priate PPE and use Lee Health approved disinfectant according to manufacturer's direction. Students do not clean up these spills. 17 Sharps Safety The use of needles, scalpels, and other sharp objec ts is common in the healthcare setting. Employees, students and others are put at risk for exposure to blood borne pathogens if this equipment is not used and disposed of using safe-ha ndling techniques. A sharp is defined as an object capable of puncturi ng, lacerating or otherwise penetrating the skin. SECTION SIX Hazardous Materials Employees and students need to be aware of the haza rdous chemicals stored or used in their work place. Safety Data Sheets (SDS) can be obtained from the manufacturer or our online resource - MSDS Online, accessible from IntraLee home page under \"LMHS Favo rites\" by clicking on MSDS and SDS. Lee Health participates in the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) adopted by OSHA and health care accrediting agencies. This system incor porates the use of hazard-specific icons affixed to the SDS and container labels for easier recognition of a chemical or hazardous material's potential dangers. Students should familiarize themselves with the mat erials found in their area by reading the label and SDS. Remember to always store, use, and d ispose of all chemicals/materials properly and to affix a corresponding label to all secondary containers which display the same information as the label on the original container. If a needle stick occur s: 1. Wash area with soap and water 2. Report incident to your school instructor 3. Fill out \"Notice of Injury Form\" 4. Report to Emergency Department for a confidentia l medical evaluation . NOTE - All needle sticks/blood exposures that occur must go to the Emergency Department. 18 Proper Labeling All hazardous material must be properly labeled at all times. With the exception of radioactive material, containers of hazardous or unknown substa nces without proper labels should be reported to Supply Chain Management for disposal. Hazardous Material Waste Disposal Hazardous material must be disposed of in accordanc e with local, state and federal regulations. It should not be discarded in the regular trash or poured down s inks or drains. Check the System and your department's Policies & Procedures for proper disposal information. Students do not handle hazardous material waste. Biomedical Waste The symbol shown to the right, when found on waste containers, refrigerators or freezers, indicates the content is \"bio hazardous\" which mean s dangerous to living things. In the healthcare setting we also refer to it as biome dical waste. Biomedical waste includes the following: Used, absorbent materials saturated with blood , blood products, regulated body fluids, or excretions or secretions contaminated with visib le blood, and absorbent materials saturated with blood or blood products that have dr ied. Non-absorbent, disposable devices that have been contaminated with blood , regulated body fluids or secretions or excretions visibly con taminated with blood. Body Fluids NOT Regulated (unless VISIBLY contaminated with blood): Urine Saliva Sweat Vomit Feces HCS Pictograms and Hazards Safety Data Sheets (SDS) provide specific information about hazardous chemicals and materials such as: How to properly store the material What actions to take if exposed to a hazardous chemical or material The contents of the chemicals/materials used in your area What to do in the event of a spill or exposure How to dispose of the material 19 Compressed Gas Cylinder Guidelines Oxygen gas cylinders (tanks) can pose safety hazard s if not operated and transported properly. The contents of full gas cyli nders are compressed to a pressure of 2000 pounds per square inch. That amou nt of pressure is capable of propelling the metal cylinder with explosive force if its integrity is breached due to being dropped or otherwise misused. It is essentia l all staff handling any compressed gas cylinders be trained and have docume nted competencies established prior to using cylinders without superv ision. Follow these guidelines for safe cylinder use: /square4 Secure compressed gas cylinders in approved carts o r stretcher brackets to prevent the tank from dropping, slipping or falling. /square4 Cylinders should never be carried by the built-in h andle, except when moving the tanks from one storage area to another storage area or pl acing the tank into the cart or stretcher. /square4 When returning cylinders to identified locations fo r replacement, do not mix empty and full cylinders on the storage racks. /square4 Do not leave cylinders near stairwells, exits, behi nd doors or in corridors. /square4 NEVER leave a cylinder \"free standing.\" It must be secured in a cart or holder. Radiation Safety Guidelines To protect yourself from radiation exposure , respect the yellow and purple or yellow and black, radiation/radioactive material signs posted promine ntly on doors and containers. Entering these areas requi res special permission. Check with authorized personnel before entering the se posted areas. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Safety Guidelines The MRI suite is an area where special precautions must be taken due to the strong magnetic field generated by equipment. The magnetic field is always on, even when a patien t is not being scanned. All staff must be aware of particular safety guid elines when working in or near the MRI. To prevent injury follow these guidelines: /square4 Never enter the MRI Scan Room unless an MRI staff member is present and gives permission after screening you to determine that it is safe fo r you to enter. This includes all personnel, i.e., housekeeping, security, emergency response p ersonnel and medical staff. /square4 No ferrous objects (containing iron/metal) or elect ronic objects may enter the scan room. o Oxygen tanks o Crash carts o IV pumps o Regular stretchers o Monitors (unless specifically designed as MRI safe o Stethoscopes, scissors, loose change in pockets o Cell phones, pagers, or two-way radios o Credit cards NOTE: Even very large objects can be instantly pulled int o the magnet injuring staff and patients in the process. 20 Medical Equipment Medical equipment is a significant contributor to t he quality of care. It is essential that the equipm ent is appropriate for the intended use; that staff (inclu ding licensed independent practitioners) be trained to use the equipment safely and effectively; and that the equipment is maintained appropriately by qualified individuals. Before using medical equipment or devices, ensure t hat the following prerequisites have been met: 1. The medical equipment has a preventive maintenan ce \" PM \" label with a date that has NOT expired. 2. Medical equipment that does not have a scheduled PM is identified with a blue \"NO PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE REQUIRED \" label. 3. The medical equipment does not have any evidence of physical damage. 4. The equipment appears to be performing its expec ted functions when initially powered on or set up for use . Emergency/Disaster Management Safety Resource One resource located with your employee ID badge is on the \"badge backer\" card (the card behind the photo ID badge). This information can always be use d as a reference during emergencies and as a helpful reminder during surveys. Badge backers were revised May 16, 2016. Check the revision date in the bottom right corner of your card to ensure you have the latest card. NOTE: If any one of these prerequisites is not met, the equipment should not be used. 21 Overhead/Intercom Emergency Pages Emergency overhead pages are used at the hospital l ocations to alert staff to potential emergency situations and to summon staff who are responsible for responding to specific emergency situations. If you do not know what the color code means when a nnounced overhead, refer to the Emergency Information on the badge backer. You may hear the following emergency codes called w hile you are working: Our number one priority remains the safety of our e mployees, patients, and visitors. Based on recent recommendations of the Florida Hosp ital Association (FHA), Lee Health has adopted and is now using overhead plain language codes for four security alerts in our hospitals. The use of plain language emergency codes will help to ensure transparency and patient and public safety in our facilities. People understand the inf ormation received without further extensive explana tion, and know what actions are required based on the inf ormation received. Listed below are the 4 Plain Language Overhead Aler ts: 1. Hostage Situation: Overhead alert: \"Attention - Attention + Description\" (i.e., there is a hostage situation, Room 304, 3 rd Floor North, Stay Away). 2. Child Abduction: Overhead alert: \"Attention - Attention + Description\" (i.e. there is a newborn baby who has been abducte d from the CCH 2 nd Floor by a middle aged female wearing blue scrubs, carrying a green bag) 3. Warning Stay Away : Overhead alert: \"Attention - Attention + Description\" (i.e., there is a hazardous material spill (code or ange) Dialysis Department, First Floor, CCH , Stay Away)\" 4. Active Shooter: Overhead alert: \"Attention - Attention + Description\" (i.e., there is a life threatening situation in th e lobby, white male with a gun, Take Cover). NOTE: While an Active Shooter situation is in effec t there will be NO OTHER overhead pages or any othe r code or emergency calls made. In each situation the overhead page will repeat the message 3 times. As updates are received, the overhead page will again repeat 3 times. If no updates are received, the ann ouncement will continue every 5 minutes until canceled by the Incident Commander. When the alert is canceled the PBX Operator will make an announcement that the issue h as been resolved or that the issue has been cancele d . EMERGENCY CODES Code Black Bomb Threat Code Blue Cardiac / Respiratory Arrest Code Brown Severe Weather / Tornado Alert Code Green Mass Casualty Incident Code Orange Hazardous Materials Incident Code Red Fire Code Yellow Facility Lockdown Manpower STAT Additional Personnel Needed Nurse STAT Medical Emergency / Injury / AED MET Medical Emergency Team 22 Emergency Reporting Process To report an emergency from a Lee Health phone dial the following numbers: Do not hang up the phone until the Operator or Disp atcher tells you to do so. Hurricane Safety Tornado / Severe Weather Safety We will maintain preparedness /capability to respon d to threats from tornadoes or severe weather. Tornado Watch: Be Prepared ! Tornadoes are possible in and near the watch area based on weather conditions. Be ready to act quickly if a wa rning is issued. Tornado Warning: Take Action! A tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather radar. There is imminent danger to life and property. Move to an interior room or the lowest floor of a sturdy building making sure to avoid windows. Code Brown will be enacted when the area is under a \"Tornado Warning Only.\" Overhead alert: \"Attention - Attention - This is a Code Brown. We h ave been advised by the National Weather Service that a tornado is in the area. All employees will immediately take precautions to protect patients. Visitors and others are instructe d to remain inside the building away from windows and glass doors until the \"All Clear\" is given.\" The page will be repeated 3 times. All employees and students will act promptly to hel p protect visitors and others by directing them to safe interior corridors away from windows, pull win dow blinds, etc. and urge all to remain calm. In the event a tornado strikes any facility - Lee Health will immediately activate the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) and establish contac t with Lee County Emergency Management advising them of this fact. The following will also take place: The Operator will immediately announce \"Warning - Stay Away\" and provide the location of the unsafe area. Security and Plant Operations will immediately com mence a search and recovery effort in coordination with local fire, law enforcement, and EMS personnel. Plant Operations will conduct a damage assessment and report information regarding the extent of damage, degree of impairment of our ability to func tion and any other details as required to Incident Commander.

In the event a tornado strikes some other area of L ee County - we may receive notification from Lee County Emergency Management to immediately enac t the Lee Health External Disaster Plan. Upon receiving this notification, the Operator will immediately announce \"Code Green (External Disaster).\" See your supervisor or the Mass Casualt y External Disaster Response Plan (S08 08 558) for details and department specific assignment s. (All policies are located on Intralee). Fire Safety Lee Health has fire-response procedures that all st aff must know and be prepared to implement in order to protect patients, themselves and property from f ires. In patient-care areas within a hospital location, i t is preferable to \" defend in place \" by closing doors unless the fire or smoke is directly threatening pa tients. If evacuation is necessary, evacuate horizontally, staying on the same floor but proceeding past a set of fire doors in the corridor. If you must leave the floor, try to go vertically down a few floors using the stairways (not the elevators), but stay in the buil ding. In other locations evacuate the building and meet a t the designated meeting place according to your department/location fire response plan. Fire Response Plan The basic fire response plan for our system utilize s the acronym RACE: RR RR RESCUE: Remove the endangered people from the involved area beyond doorways marked \"Smoke partition.\" Once a room is evacuated, signa l the response team by placing a white cloth on the door handle or base of door. ALARM: Sound the alarm ; \"CODE RED ,\" the best method is use of the pull station. This activates the computer system, calls the fire department, telepho ne operator, smoke partition doors close and air conditioning in that area stops. CONTAIN: Contain the fire by closing the doors and windows and leave the are a. If you cannot leave, place a wet cloth at the base of the door to conserve air and energy. Remember - smoke and heat rise! EXTINGUISH/EVACUATE: Extinguish the fire using a fire extinguisher if it is safe to do so. Or Evacuate as directed by Fire Dept. or Administration. AA AA CC CC EE EE 24 How to Use a Fire Extinguisher (PASS) While holding the fire extinguisher upright: P PULL Pull the pin (located at handle) A AIM Aim the nozzle at the base of fire S SQUEEZE Squeeze handles together S SWEEP Sweep from side to side What can every Lee Health Team Member do to help wi th Fire Safety Management? /square4 Keep corridors free of obstructions. /square4 Never block exit doors, smoke doors or fire extingu isher cabinets. /square4 Store NOTHING in stairways. /square4 Report broken or malfunctioning Exit lights. /square4 Maintain at least 18 inches free space below all fi re sprinkler heads. /square4 Know the location of fire-safety equipment in your work area. /square4 If you are not at the fire's point of origin, conti nue to listen to overhead pages to obtain updates. Safety Safety Management strives to reduce hazards and pre vent accidents and injuries. Lee Health Environmental Safety Officer is Rocky Rhoads (phone : 424-3536). Every Lee Health team member plays an important part in Safety Management. Each employee is responsible for completing all required safety education, staying alert to hazards in their work area and correcting or reporting haz ards to the proper people. Work-Related Injuries All students injured on the job should report the i njury to their School Instructor as soon as possibl e, document the event on the \"Notice of Injury/Illness \" form # 5422 and report the Emergency Room. All Workers' Compensation laws will be followed. The employee/volunteer/students may be required to submit to drug and alcohol testing see Drug Free Workplace Policy (S09 06 189). Always report all safety related incidents accordin g to the following: TYPE OF INCIDENT REPORT TO Employee or Volunteer Injury /square4 Schools Instructor Patient or Visitor Injury /square4 Schools Instructor, Unit Supervisor (House Superv isor evenings or weekends) Medical Equipment Failure /square4 Schools Instructor, Unit Supervisor (House Supervis or evenings or weekends) 25 Security Personal security for oneself and one's work enviro nment is influenced by knowledge of surroundings and available resources. All Lee Health employees, volunteers and students a re required to wear a health system issued picture identification badge at all times while in any of t he Lee Health facilities.

Violence in the Workplace Lee Health is committed to providing a safe environ ment for patients, employees and visitors. Healthcare workers are 5 times more likely to experience violence in the workplace than other industries. Workplace vio lence can be any incident in which a co-worker, patient or visitor is verbally abused, threatened or physically assaulted by any other individual. Workplace Violence includes: Threats: Expressing the intent to cause harm, including verb al threats, threatening body language, harassment, intimidation and written thre ats. Physical Assaults: Attacks ranging from slapping and beatings to rape, homicide, and use of weapons such as firearms, bombs or knives. Muggings: Aggravated assaults, usually conducted by surprise and with intent to rob. Warning Signs of Impending Violence Verbally expressed anger, frustration Body language such as threatening gestures Signs of drug or alcohol use Presence of a weapon Pacing or restlessness Clenched fists If you experience or witness violence or disruptive behavior, take these steps: Nonphysical violence (threats, harassment, intimidation, disruptive behavior): Maintain calm Provide personal space Listen Find Assistance: Know your limits Contact Lee Health Public Safety and a supervisor from hospital locations. Contact local law enforcement from non- hospital locations. Physical violence: Provide personal space Have an exit route Consider person's state of mind Observe body language Remember your wingman Contact Lee Health Public Safety and a Supervisor from hospital locations. Contact local law enforcement from non- hospital locations. 26 Active Shooter Situation What would you do if there was an active shooter in your vicinity? Quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own life and remembe r patients and visitors are likely to follow the lead of staff and volunteers. Follow these steps: RUN / ESCAPE - If there is an accessible escape path, attempt t o evacuate the premises. Have an escape route and plan in mind. Leave your belongings behind except cell phone (if you already have it with you). Help others escape, if possible. Call 911 when you are safe. HIDE - If escape is not possible, find a place to hide whe re the shooter is less likely to find you. FIGHT - As a last resort, and only when your life is in imm inent danger, you may choose to attempt to disrupt and / or incapacitate the active shooter by: Acting as aggressively as possible against him / h er. Throwing items and improvising weapons. Yelling Committing to your actions and following through. When Law Enforcement Arrives: Follow the instructions of police officers Drop any object Keep hands visible You should : Be sure to: Be out of the active shooter's view. Turn off lights. Be where there is protection if shots are fired in your direction (for example, an office with a closed locked door). Blockade the door with heavy furniture. Not trap or restrict your options. Silence your cell phone. 27 SECTION SEVEN Disruptive Behavior Disruptive behavior by healthcare professionals is a threat to patient safety, quality of care and the patient experience. It also negatively affects sta ff morale and increases costs to our healthcare organization. Disruptive behaviors can be open or subtle and, typ ically, fall into 3 categories: 1. Physical: posture with hands on hips, rolling eyes, making fa ces, throwing up hands, shaking head, toe tapping, using technology inappropriately, etc. 2. Verbal: sighing, clipped abrupt speech, sarcasm, shouting, cursing, whispering, belittling or criticizing a colleague in front of others or using electronic communication or social media (includin g but not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Wh at Sapp, etc.) to harass, demean or belittle others. 3. Emotional: talking behind a co-worker's back, turning away, no t being willing/available, not giving the information/cooperation needed, setting another up to fail, gossiping, isolating, silent treatment or excluding a team member from group activities, e tc. Dealing with Disruptive Behavior Do not engage in disruptive behaviors yourself; ins tead, try to resolve the issue directly with the pe rson displaying the disruptive behaviors. Often, work r elated complaints, concerns or similar issues are resolved more quickly by speaking directly with the involved co-worker or following the chain of command process. Strategies to address disruptive behaviors include: Speak Up: \"If you see it, you own it!\" means that you must sp eak up and address the situation, even if the behavior is not directed toward you. Address the behavior to resolve conflict directly , in real time or as soon as possible after the behavior occurs. The goal is to reach an agreement so all parties can move forward with the expectation that the behavior or situation does not happen again. Work with your Chain of Command if you are unable to resolve the situation yourself . Keep detailed records if it becomes a pattern-include: date, who was invo lved, what was said or done and how you felt. Make a formal, written complaint to HR Employee Relations if your Chain of Command is unab le to resolve the issue. Lee Health is committed to the safety and health of all patients and staff - physical, mental and emotional. By dealing effectively with disruptive b ehaviors, Lee Health strives to provide a healthy w ork environment. Tobacco FREE LEE Lee Health is tobacco free. All forms of tobacco, i ncluding cigarettes, E-cigs, vaping and smokeless tobacco like chewing tobacco or dip, are prohibited from use on Lee Health properties both owned and leased. 28 Drug Free Workplace Lee Health is committed to providing quality health care and a safe environment for its patients and employees. We cons ider the use of alcohol or illegal drugs on the job to be an unsafe and counte rproductive work practice. Because safety is very important, all employees, vo lunteers and students, have a responsibility to report suspected use of illegal drugs or the abuse of alcohol and may use the confidential reporting process. Patient Experience It's not enough to be safe and clinically competent . We each have a responsibility to create an environm ent where patients can feel confident and positive about their experience in our healthcare s ystem ; confident they will be included in decisions affecting their care; confident the envir onment is clean; confident they will be able to get help when they need it; confident that people truly care about their comfort, and confident they will have the information they need to care for themselves when t hey are discharged.
