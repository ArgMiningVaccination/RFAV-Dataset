Meet them all online. Newmarket's Asha Frost is the best-selling author of \"You are the Medicine\" and the \"Sacred Medicine Oracle,\" both published by Hay House. As a respected teacher and speaker, she shares her wisdom and teachings with audiences at conferences, retreats and workshops. At 27, Frost opened a homeopath business to support people in their wellness. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \"As the years went by, my Indigenous roots became a really important part of my identity and I felt the calling to weave in the medicine, wisdom and healing of my ancestors,\" she said. \"This led to me sharing my gifts in bigger ways through speaking and community events and eventually feeling the call to share in a global way. I want people to know that they carry wisdom within their bones and blood that they can return to. I want them to know they aren't broken. I want them to know that they came here to shine their light in the way they know how. Rising into my path as an author has given me the gift of sharing that message with the world and I continue to feel passionate about people finding their way back home, to themselves.\" For years, Frost didn't see anyone doing what she wanted to do in wellness/new age spaces. \"So, I decided to be the one to do it. I hold a dream for younger Indigenous folks to know that they are worthy of taking up space, sharing their voice and gifts with the world,\" she said. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \"I walk together with other trailblazers and visionaries weaving traditional knowledge in a new way. I want the next seven generations, my children included, to know that their Indigenous lives matter and that they are valued, seen and loved.\" As part of Indigenous History Month, Frost hopes non-Indigenous Canadians grasp the lasting effects of colonialism. \"I would love for them to see that the impacts of generational harm and trauma still live within our bodies, hearts and lives. The most painful comment to read is when people tell us to 'just get over it,' \" she said. \"We are still living in conditions without clean water, we are still experiencing racism in hospitals, we are still reclaiming our Indigenous ways of knowing and being, after genocide and land theft. The ripple of this trauma continues and standing with us goes a long way towards reconciliation.\" Lisa Queen has been a reporter for more than 30 years.
