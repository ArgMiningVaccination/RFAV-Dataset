Revised: Dec 2020 SIDE EFFECTS Overall Safety Summary It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID-19 following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. To the extent feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to Pfizer Inc. Please see the REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS section for details on reporting to VAERS and Pfizer Inc. In clinical studies, adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older included pain at the injection site (84.1%), fatigue (62.9%), headache (55.1%), muscle pain (38.3%), chills (31.9%), joint pain (23.6%), fever (14.2%), injection site (10.5%), nausea (1.1%), [malaise](https://www.rxlist.com/malaise/definition.htm) (0.5%), and [lymphadenopathy](https://www.rxlist.com/lymphadenopathy/definition.htm) (0.3%). Severe allergic reactions have been reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in two clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase \u00bd, two-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 44,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these, approximately 43,448 participants (21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine; 21,728 placebo) in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 (18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 18,785 placebo) participants 16 years of age or older have been followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Participants 18 years and older in the reactogenicity subset are monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of [antipyretic](https://www.rxlist.com/antipyretic/definition.htm) medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination]. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, were Black or American](https://www.rxlist.com/african_american/definition.htm), 28.0% Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Local And Systemic Adverse Reactions Solicited In The Study 2 Table 1 and Table 2 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo in the subset of participants 18 to 55 years of age included in the EUA safety population who were monitored for reactogenicity with an electronic diary. Table 3 and Table 4 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days of each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo for participants 56 years of age and older. Across both age groups, the mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 2 was 2.5 days (range 1 to 36 days), for redness 2.6 days (range 1 to 34 days), and for swelling 2.3 days (range 1 to 34 days) for participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Solicited reactogenicity data in 16 and 17 year-old participants are limited.

Unsolicited Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In Study 2, among participants 16 to 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7960, placebo = 7934), serious adverse events were reported by 0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events Overall in Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 to 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7960 participants 56 years of age and older received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in 23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events among Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset and presented in Tables 3 and 4. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by four participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Management Of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Altered Immunocompetence [Immunocompromised](https://www.rxlist.com/immunocompromised/definition.htm) persons, including individuals receiving [immunosuppressant](https://www.rxlist.com/immunosuppressant/definition.htm) therapy, may have a diminished [immune response](https://www.rxlist.com/immune_response/definition.htm) to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Limitation Of Effectiveness The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of [birth defect](https://www.rxlist.com/birth_defect/definition.htm), loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and [miscarriage](https://www.rxlist.com/miscarriage/definition.htm) in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. Lactation Risk Summary Data are not available to assess the effects of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. Pediatric Use Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in adolescents 16 and 17 years of age is based on extrapolation of safety and effectiveness from adults 18 years of age and older. Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine does not include use in individuals younger than 16 years of age. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine include participants 65 years of age and older and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Overall Safety Summary and Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA]. Of the total number of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients in Study 2 (N=20,033), 21.4% (n=4,294) were 65 years of age and older and 4.3% (n=860) were 75 years of age and older. OVERDOSE No Information provided CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., [anaphylaxis](https://www.rxlist.com/anaphylaxis/definition.htm)) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine [see DESCRIPTION]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action The modRNA in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated in [lipid](https://www.rxlist.com/lipid/definition.htm) particles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm). The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19. Clinical Trial Results And Supporting Data For Eua Efficacy In Participants 16 Years Of Age And Older Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate\u00e2\u20ac\"selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. [Randomization](https://www.rxlist.com/randomization/definition.htm) was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with [human [HBV](https://www.rxlist.com/hbv/definition.htm)). In the Phase 2/3 portion approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo separated by 21 days. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. Table 5 presents the specific demographic characteristics in the studied population. Table 5: Demographics (population for the primary efficacy endpoint)a |Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine| all vaccination(s) as randomized within the predefined window, have no other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician, and have no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2.| b Includes multiracial and not reported. c Number of participants who have 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease Efficacy Against COVID-19 The population in the primary efficacy analysis included all participants 12 years of age and older who had been enrolled from July 27, 2020, and followed for the development of COVID-19 through November 14, 2020. Participants 18 to 55 years of age and 56 years of age and older began enrollment from July 27,2020, 16 to 17 years of age began enrollment from September 16, 2020 and 12 to 15 years of age began enrollment from October 15, 2020. The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 6. Table 6: Vaccine Efficacy \u00e2\u20ac\" First COVID-19 Occurrence From 7 Days After Dose 2, by Age Subgroup \u00e2\u20ac\" Participants Without Evidence of Infection and Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection Prior to 7 Days After Dose 2 \u00e2\u20ac\" Evaluable Efficacy (7 Days) Population |First COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection*| |First COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection| determined by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and at least 1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 (symptoms included: fever; new or increased cough; new or increased shortness of breath; chills; new or increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhea; vomiting).| * Participants who had no evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., N-binding antibody [serum] negative at Visit 1 and SARS-CoV-2 not detected by NAAT [nasal swab] at Visits 1 and 2), and had negative NAAT (nasal swab) at any unscheduled visit prior to 7 days after Dose 2 were included in the analysis. a N = number of participants in the specified group. b n1 = Number of participants meeting the endpoint definition. c Total surveillance time in 1000 person-years for the given endpoint across all participants within each group at risk for the endpoint. Time period for COVID-19 case accrual is from 7 days after Dose 2 to the end of the surveillance period. d n2 = Number of participants at risk for the endpoint. e No confirmed cases were identified in participants 12 to 15 years of age. f Credible interval for VE was calculated using a beta-binomial model with a beta (0.700102, 1) prior for =r(1-VE)/(1+r(1-VE)), where r is the ratio of surveillance time in the active vaccine group over that in the placebo group. g Confidence interval (CI) for vaccine efficacy is derived based on the Clopper and Pearson method adjusted to the surveillance time.
