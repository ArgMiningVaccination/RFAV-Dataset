The parties shall agree on the appointment of a mediator to assist them in reaching agreement and, failing agreement, as the chair of the Board of Arbitration set out below. The parties agree to share the costs of the mediator/arbitrator. 6. The mediator will determine the process and procedure for mediation in consultation with the parties. 7. If the parties have not reached an agreement on all of the wage rates and job classifications by December 31, 2000, or such later date as may be agreed upon in writing, either Local 79 or the City may refer the outstanding rates and classifications, including all matters relating to implementation dates (retroactivity) to a Board of Arbitration for a final and binding determination. The Board will be composed of one person nominated by each of the parties with the mediator as the Chair. 8.

If the former position has been filled, the employee will be reverted to a position reflecting the wage rate earned by the employee prior to the placement.

Where it is determined that an employee is to be placed under the Full-Time Collective Agreement, the following will apply: (a) The employee will be moved to the full-time unit as of the date of agreement in writing that they work full-time and will be entitled to the rights and privileges accorded in the Full-Time Local 79 Collective Agreement, including enrolment in the City's health benefits plan. Enrolment in the pension plan will be in accordance with OMERS regulations.- M3 - (b) In the first year the employee is moved into the full-time unit his/her vacation will be calculated in accordance with the provisions outlined in the letter to Anne Dubas, dated November 27, 2000 regarding Temporary Employees' Transition from Vacation Pay to Paid Vacation Days. The dates in that letter will be amended, as necessary, to reflect the year the employee is moved into the full-time unit. (c) The employee will have placed to his/her credit, eighteen (18) sick days. (d) Service and seniority will be brought into the full-time unit in accordance with clause 20.06(a) and calculated in accordance with clause 20.06(b) of the Full-Time Collective Agreement. 4. The classification occupied by the employee upon placement of the employee under the Full-Time Collective Agreement shall be included under the Full-Time Collective Agreement. (a) If the employee to be moved to the full-time unit appears to be performing duties that mirror an existing position in the full-time unit the City is willing to review the employee's duties. If it is confirmed that they are, in fact, substantially performing the duties of a position that already exists in the full-time unit, the person will be reclassified and paid in accordance with the appropriate wage grade. (b) If the employee is mis-classified, e.g. they are classified as a skating instructor and they are actually a dance instructor and neither classification exists in the full-time unit the employee will be moved over as a skating instructor and retain their salary. Local 79 will inform the Compensation Division of the mis-classification and Compensation will make the correction prior to harmonization. (c) If the employee is correctly classified in the part-time unit e.g. Square Dance Caller, but there is no mirror position in the full-time unit, the person will be moved over as a Square Dance Caller and take their salary with them. 5. The parties agree that if an employee and his/her classification are moved into the full-time unit this will not constitute a new or changed classification as contemplated in the provisions of clause 6.04 of the Full-Time Collective Agreement. 6. Employees deemed to be full-time in accordance with 1 above, shall move into the full-time unit as a temporary employee. As soon as possible thereafter a review of the status of the employee will take place. If the review determines that the employee has been continuously employed in the same position full-time for longer than two (2) years prior to movement into the full-time unit the employee will become a permanent employee and confirmed in the position unless the position is one to which a permanent employee has a claim or the position is expected to be eliminated in the near future. It is understood that the job posting provisions of the agreement will not apply in this situation. If, following movement into the full-time unit, the temporary employee has been continuously employed in the same position for longer than one (1) year, the status of the position will be reviewed with Local 79 and the City and if the position is considered permanent, the position will be posted in accordance with Article 15, (Job Postings) 7. The classifications of the employees moved into the full-time unit will not be used during wage harmonization of the full-time unit classifications nor the wage harmonization in the part-time unit the employee was transferred from. Instead, after wage harmonization of the full-time unit and the part-time unit the group of - M4 - employees who have moved into the full-time unit through this process will be looked at separately for wage harmonization. 8. The parties recognize the need on a continuing basis to ensure that employees are placed in the appropriate bargaining unit and, accordingly, agree that on an annual basis the City shall provide to Local 79 for its review a detailed listing of all employees covered by Local 79 Part-Time Collective Agreements with as much work-related detail as possible. 9. If at any time the parties find it necessary to amend the terms of this Agreement in order to address any unanticipated matters that may arise, the parties agree to meet to discuss any such matter(s) and provided there is mutual agreement, effect any such amendments(s) that may be appropriate. 10. Should any concerns or disputes arise out of the operation of this Letter of Intent, the Director of Employee and Labour Relations or his/her designate shall meet with the representatives of Local 79 within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of the concerns or disputes. 11. Any dispute concerning the interpretation, application or administration of this Agreement including but not limited to whether an employee should be placed under the Full-Time Collective Agreement shall be dealt with in accordance with the grievance and arbitration provisions of the Full-Time Collective Agreement. Dated at Toronto this 9th day of August 2002 For Local 79 For the City Ann Dembinski (signed) Catherine Bossuyt (signed) Nancy Murphy (signed) Derek Lue (signed)- M5 - Article 8 WAGES AND SALARIES The parties agree to a four (4) year term with wage adjustment increases as follows: Effective January 1, 2012 0% Effective January 1, 2013 1.5% Lump Sum payment on gross regular pay; 0.5% Base increase on gross regular pay; Effective January 1, 2014 1.75% Base increase on gross regular pay; Effective January 1, 2015 2.25% Base increase on gross regular pay.

The lump sum payment does not form part of the employee's base salary and is not pensionable and is subject to normal statutory deductions and union dues. Article 12 SENIORITY Confirmation of Employee's Seniority Date An employee who has been notified of his/her seniority in accordance with clause 12.01(f) may, in conjunction with Local 79, challenge such seniority if he/she has sufficient documentation to support such challenge. In the event of such challenge, Local 79 will write to the Director of Employee and Labour Relations within sixty (60) working days of the employee's receipt of his/her seniority information, requesting a meeting and the Director of Employee and Labour Relations shall review such documentation and render a decision in writing.

The City will provide Local 79 with thirty (30) days notice prior to amending and/or deleting this schedule. Within five (5) days of the date on which the City provides the Union with notice, the Union may request a meeting with the City in order to discuss any issues arising out of any such change. This Memorandum shall not form part of the Collective Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2013. Following the termination of this Memorandum, changes to the Early Childhood Educator Grade II (ECE II) Pool Schedule will be implemented in accordance with Article 27 of the CUPE Local 79, Unit B Part-Time Collective Agreement. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR GRADE II (ECE II) POOL SCHEDULING CHILDREN'S SERVICES DIVISION 1. Each ECE II assigned to a pool shall indicate in writing on a form provided: (a) his/her availability to work between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (b) his/her availability to work partial shifts of less than seven (7) hours (c) the days of the week on which he/she is available for work (d) the age group(s) with which he/she is prepared to work (e) any sites (within the employee's assigned pool) at which he/she does not wish to be assigned to work. Taken together, these will constitute the employee's \"availability\" for the purpose of offering work. 2. Employees may change their availability by submitting an amended availability form to the Staffing Supervisor or designate. A minimum of one week's written notice of any change in availability is necessary and must be submitted before the schedule for the following week is prepared. Longer notice would be preferable.- M7 - 3. The seniority of the employees will be determined in accordance with clause 12.03 (as updated three times annually on or about January 1, May 1, and September 1). 4. Respecting the part-time nature of Unit B, it is understood that no employee can work more than the equivalent of eight (8) days/fifty six (56) hours per pay period. 5. When the Staffing Supervisor or designate is unable to contact an ECE II to offer work, the work will then be offered to the next most senior employee. The Staffing Supervisor or designate shall wait a reasonable amount of time for the employee to acknowledge acceptance of the work. 6. It is agreed that once an assignment has been offered and accepted, the employee will remain on that assignment, even if another assignment later becomes available, it being understood that \"assignment\" herein does not include Full-time Temporary Assignments under Article 14. 7. It is understood that an assignment may not last as long as was originally expected (for example, if an absent employee returns to work earlier than anticipated). 8. Work will be assigned in each pool by seniority in two different streams (\"Known Available Work\" and \"Call-In Work\"), beginning with Known Available Work. 9. Definitions: \"Known Available Work\" is the work that is known to be available as determined on the Thursday prior to the week in which it is available. \"Known Available Work\" can be for a partial day (less than seven (7) hours) to five (5) days (thirty five (35) hours) and the nature of the work is that it is known in advance. Employee(s) shall have the right to decline assignments offered which include one (1) or more shifts that are less than a full shift (i.e., seven (7) hours) and retain his/her right to be offered the next largest assignment of known work. \"Call-in Work\" is work that is not known to be available by 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday for the following week. \"Call-in Work\" can be for a partial day (less than seven (7) hours) to five (5) days (thirty five (35) hours) and the nature of the work is that it is without notice. 10. Known Available Work for the Following Week (for Week 1) (a) When the Staffing Supervisor or designate receives notice prior to 6:00 p.m. on Thursday of the work which will be available in the following week (Week 1), as early as feasible on Friday, he/she will offer the most senior ECE II in the pool the largest assignment which is consistent with his/her availability, up to a maximum of thirty five (35) hours for Week 1. For this purpose, assignments at the same site may be combined in one offer (consecutive days or not). Assignments at different sites within the pool that do not overlap (e.g. Monday - Tuesday at one site and Thursday at another site) may also be combined in one offer. This could include assignments that are for different age groups or replacing different absent staff. (b) The Staffing Supervisor or designate will offer the next largest assignment to the next most senior ECE II consistent with his/her availability, up to a maximum of thirty five (35) hours for Week 1, and so on until the known available work for Week 1 has been offered to members of the pool in order of seniority, consistent with their availability. (c) If a senior ECE II's availability does not allow him/her to be offered the largest assignment available at that time, and that assignment is therefore offered to the next most senior employee, the more senior \"skipped\" ECE II will be offered the next largest assignment consistent with his/her availability, if one is available, before it is offered to another employee.- M8 - Call-In Work (During Week 1) (d) Once all the known available work for Week 1 has been offered in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the second stream of assignments (call-in work which occurs during Week 1) will be offered in order of seniority, beginning with the most senior employee next in line after the first stream was complete. (e) As Week 1 actually unfolds (including assignments which are communicated to the Staffing Supervisor or designate on Friday of the preceding week), call-in work would go to the most senior person in order on the list: who is available for the assignment and has not been scheduled for any work in that week. (f) If additional work is still available after the remaining members of the pool have been contacted, it may be offered to employees who have already been assigned work, provided that they are available for the additional work. Known Available Work for the Following Week (For Week 2) (g) When the Staffing Supervisor or designate receives notice, prior to 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, of the work which will be available in the following week (Week 2), as early as feasible on Friday, beginning with the first ECE II in the pool who was not assigned known available work in the preceding week (Week 1), he/ she will offer that ECE II the largest assignment which is consistent with his/ her availability to the maximum hours of work for the pay period (as per number 4 above). For this purpose, assignments at the same site may be combined in one offer (consecutive or not). Assignments at different sites within the pool that do not overlap (e.g. Monday - Tuesday at one site and Thursday at another site) may also be combined in one offer. This could include assignments that are for different age groups or replacing different absent staff. (h) The Staffing Supervisor or designate will offer the next largest assignment to the next most senior ECE II consistent with his/her availability, to the maximum hours of work for the pay period (as per number 4 above), and so on until the known available work for Week 2 has been offered to members of the pool in order of seniority, consistent with their availability. (i) If a senior ECE II's availability does not allow him/her to be offered the largest assignment available at that time, and that assignment is therefore offered to the next most senior employee, the more senior \"skipped\" ECE II will be offered the next largest assignment consistent with his/her availability to the maximum hours of work for the pay period (as per number 4 above), if one is available, before it is offered to another employee. Call-In Work (During Week 2) (j) Once all the known available work for Week 2 has been offered in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the second stream of assignments (call-in work which occurs during Week 2) will be offered in order of seniority, beginning with the most senior employee next in line after the first stream was complete. (k) As Week 2 actually unfolds (including assignments which are communicated to the Staffing Supervisor or designate on Friday of Week 1), call-in work would go to the most senior person in order on the list: who is available for the assignment and has not been scheduled for any work in that week has not exceeded the maximum hours of work for the pay period (as per number 4 above).- M9 - (l) If additional work is still available after the remaining members of the pool have been contacted, it may be offered to employees who have already been assigned work, provided that they are available for the additional work and have not exceeded the maximum hours of work for the pay period (as per number 4 above). 11. The foregoing pattern will continue on a rotating basis, ensuring that employees have access by seniority to both known available work and call-in work, until the list has been exhausted or for a period of up to four (4) weeks, whichever comes first, at which time the schedule will commence again at Week 1 beginning with the most senior employee. The sequence of work offers for both known and call- in work by pool will be prepared and accessible to the employees as early as feasible on Friday of each week. 12. Nothing in this Letter of Intent shall affect or limit management's ability to utilize full-time staff (temporary or permanent) or its rights to utilize the Trial Program- Children's Services (Article 14).

Within five (5) days of the date on which the City provides the Union with notice, the Union may request a meeting with the City in order to discuss any issues arising out of any such change. This Memorandum shall not form part of the Collective Agreement and shall terminate on December 31, 2013. Following the termination of this Memorandum, changes to the Child Care Aide (CCA) Site-Specific schedule will be implemented in accordance with Article 27 of the CUPE Local 79, Unit B Part-time Collective Agreement. 1. Each Child Care Aide (CCA) with regularly assigned hours of work assigned to a Centre will indicate in writing on a form provided: (a) His/her availability to work morning and/or afternoon hours; (b) His/her preference(s) as to age group.- M10 - 2. Employees may change their availability by submitting an amended availability form to the Centre Supervisor. A minimum of one week's written notice of any change in availability is necessary and must be submitted before the schedule for the following week is prepared. Longer notice would be preferable. 3. The Centre Supervisor will determine the level of CCA staffing which is anticipated to be required in the following week, and post a schedule by Thursday of the week before the schedule is in effect. 4. In the event that a regularly assigned CCA is absent, wherever possible the work will be first offered to the other CCA's assigned to that Centre (and not already scheduled for conflicting hours), in order of seniority, where practicable, provided that the employee has indicated a willingness and has the ability to work with the age group in which the work is available. 5. The seniority of the employees will be determined in accordance with Clause 12.03. 6. It is understood that changes in arrival/departure times, other than employees arriving later/leaving earlier, delays in children's busing to/from school, inclement weather, etc., may result in CCAs being asked to work longer than initially scheduled from time to time. 7. When additional regularly assigned work becomes available in a Child Care Site (for example, as a result of increases in enrolment, changes in attendance patterns, or because a CCA has left), it will be first offered to the other Unit B employees in that classification working at that Centre, in order of seniority, provided that the employee has indicated a willingness and has the ability to work with the age group in which work is available. 8. It is also understood that circumstances may affect the amount of work available from week to week, or indefinitely. Examples would include changes in enrolment patterns, arrival/departure times, full-time staff shift arrangements, attendance patterns, or the impact of illness on the Site. When the amount of work decreases, the remaining work will be allocated each week to CCAs on the basis of seniority, subject to the employee's willingness and ability to work with the age group in which the work is available. Bulletin Boards Dedicated space on bulletin boards will be made available to the Union for the posting of official Union notices in convenient locations determined by the City and the Union. Such bulletin boards shall be in areas where employees will have access to them. The Union shall have the right to post notices of meetings and such other notices as may be of interest to its members. Problems may be identified by either party and shall be the subject of discussion.- M11 - The following Article from the Local 79 Full-Time Collective Agreement is appended hereto for information purposes only.

Approved by Executive Management Team Date Approved July 29, 1999 Revised September 7, 2007- P5 - Human Resources Policies Family Medical Leave Category: Absence From Work Policy Statement The City of Toronto provides up to eight weeks unpaid Family Medical Leave to employees who need to take a leave to provide care and support to a family member who has a serious medical condition where there is a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks. Application This policy applies to all City of Toronto employees and shall be administered in accordance with the Employment Standards Act. Definitions For the purpose of this policy, family member is defined as: 1. The employee's spouse ( includes common law and same sex partner) 2. A parent, step-parent or foster parent of the employee 3. A child, step-child or foster child of the employee or the employee's spouse. 4. A brother or sister of the employee. 5. A grandparent of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 6. A grandchild of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 7. The father-in-law or mother-in-law of the employee. 8.

An uncle or aunt of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 11. The nephew or niece of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 12. The spouse of the employee's grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece. 13. A foster parent of the employee's spouse. 14. A person who considers the employee to be like a family member. Note: In numbers 4 to 8 a reference to a relationship includes the corresponding \"step\" relationship. Provide care and support: providing psychological or emotional support, arranging for care by a third party provider or directly providing or participating in the care of the family member.- P6 - Conditions Requirement for medical certificate An employee is entitled to a leave of absence without pay of up to eight weeks to provide care or support to a family member, if a qualified health practitioner issues a certificate stating that the individual has a serious medical condition with a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks or a shorter period. Duration of leave When the health practitioner issues a certificate, an employee may take the Family Medical Leave within the 26-week period specified in the medical certificate. For example an employee may begin the leave as soon as the certificate is issued or may choose to wait to start the leave, as long as the leave does not extend beyond the designated end of the 26-week period. The employee may remain on a leave for eight weeks or the last day of the week in which the family member dies. The eight (8) weeks of a Family Medical Leave do not have to be taken consecutively but an employee may only take a leave in periods of entire weeks. \"Week\" is defined for Family Medical Leave purposes as a period of seven consecutive days beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday. Week is defined in this way to correspond with the beginning and end of the week set for Employment Insurance (EI) entitlement purposes. Sharing the leave If two or more employees (employed by the same or different organisations) take this leave to provide care and support for a specific family member, the eight weeks of Family Medical Leave must be shared between them. For example if one spouse takes six weeks to care for his or her child, the other spouse would be able to take only two weeks of Family Medical Leave. Extension of leave If employees request an extension beyond the eight weeks leave, they must submit a written request to their supervisor. The supervisor decides if this extension can be granted. If the request is approved, the extended leave can be covered by vacation, Voluntary Leave, Leave without Pay as well as personal leave provisions contained in the applicable collective agreements. Subsequent leaves If an employee takes a leave and the family member does not die within 26 weeks, the employee may take another leave at a later time and requires another medical certificate for that purpose. Employment Insurance Benefits All employees covered under the Employment Standards Act are entitled to take a Family Medical Leave. Those employees who qualify can also access Compassionate Care Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for up to six weeks.- P7 - In order to access these benefits, employees must serve a two-week unpaid waiting period. Employees entitled to EI benefits can apply for employment insurance. Employees are required to provide a medical certificate to Employment Insurance in order to receive the benefit. The medical certificate can be found on the EI website. Employment Insurance permits the sharing of the six-week benefit by two or more working members of the family. If the benefit is shared, only one employee serves the waiting period. Employees may take the eight-week leave all at once or divide it into parts with a minimum of one-week segments. Note: For details on eligibility on employment insurance benefits refer to the Employment Insurance (EI) Compassionate Care Benefits website (see link below) Examples Jane takes leave from Sunday August 8th to October 2nd and returns to work on October 4th, having completed the eight-week leave with six weeks EI benefit. Abdul takes leave from August 8th to September 4th and returns to work on September 6th. (Four weeks: two-week waiting period and two-week leave with benefit). Abdul takes further leave from September 19th to October 2nd and returns to work October 4th (two- week leave with benefit). Abdul takes further leave from November 14th to November 27th and returns to work on November 29th (two-week leave with benefit). Julia takes leave from October 10th to October 30th and returns to work on November 1st. She takes three weeks leave with benefit. Her brother had previously taken leave with three weeks benefit and had served the waiting period. The EI benefits can be paid regardless of where the family member lives. If employees are required to travel to other countries to look after a dying family member, they are still entitled to the benefit and can access the benefit by application through the Internet. The EI benefit ends at the end of the week in which the person dies if this occurs during the benefit period. Salary & Benefits Benefits Basic benefits coverage (health, dental, group life insurance, STD and LTD) continues during Family Medical Leave. Benefit coverage for part-time employees continues to be on a pro-rated basis. Employees are responsible for premiums that they would normally pay for benefits that are not covered by the basic plan, for example additional coverage for group life insurance. - P8 - Pension If employees want to maintain pension service credits they must pay their pension contributions for the duration of the leave. The city will match these contributions. Vacation Employees' annual vacation entitlement is not affected by this leave. Sick Pay Employees, who accumulate sick leave credits, continue to earn sick credits during the period of leave. Service and Seniority Employees accumulate full service and seniority during the leave. However, Family Medical Leave days are not counted towards the completion of the probationary period. Increments and Pay for Performance Bargaining unit employees' increments are not affected by this leave. Non-union employees receive the full merit level increase based on their performance for the duration of the Family Medical Leave. Any further leave without pay is subject to pro- ration of the merit level increase and market rate adjustment. Approved by Executive Management Team Date Approved November 8, 2004 Revised December 6, 2006 - P9 - Human Resources Policies Leave without Pay Category: Absence From Work Policy Statement This policy allows employees who wish to take an extended period of leave for personal reasons to do so. Application All employees listed below are eligible for Leave without pay. Non-union full-time permanent employees who have completed their probationary period CUPE local 79 employees CUPE local 416 employees Definitions Leave without Pay : an authorized leave for up to a year without pay or benefits. Conditions Employees may apply for a leave period of up to one year. An employee must give notice of leave to his/her executive director/division head to give the division time to plan for the employee's extended absence. The minimum advance notice should be one month. Employees may apply for a leave without pay at any time of the year. The leave of absence must be approved by an employee's executive director/general manager/division head or designate. When he/she receives a request, he/she may: approve the request approve the request but defer the leave deny the request. The executive director/general manager/division head or designate must send written approval, deferral or denial of the request to the applicant. If the request is deferred or denied he/she must explain the reasons to the employee and indicate whether the employee's request can be granted at some future date. The executive director/general manager/division head or designate should evaluate applications on the basis of consistent criteria to ensure employees are treated in a fair and equitable manner. In a situation where a number of employees within the same division or section apply for leave at the same time the executive director/general manager/ division head or designate may need more information to prioritize requests. Guidelines for Assessing Competing Requests are included in this policy under the Implementation section. The terms of the plan leave are documented and agreed to by both parties, when a leave is approved. This can be changed only by mutual consent.- P10 - Return from leave An employee returning from leave without pay will return to his/her former position or a suitable alternate position if available. While an employee is on leave a position may be filled with acting or temporary staff, or left vacant. Implementation Guidelines for Assessing Competing Requests for Leaves On some occasions, two or more employees may request leaves at the same time. If it is not possible to accommodate all applicants, an attempt should be made to negotiate some satisfactory alternative schedule with the parties involved. If no satisfactory resolution can be obtained, the following criteria may be taken into account when making the decision. Priority should be given to employees requesting a leave under the following circumstances: an employee plans to use the leave as a means of easing the transition to full retirement a leave is being requested on \"compassionate\" grounds, for example to provide care to an ill family member an employee has been appointed to a leadership position with a professional or volunteer organization, and requires a leave in order to take the position a leave has been requested for a specific time-dated activity that cannot easily be postponed (e.g. attendance at a course of studies). The executive director/general manager/division head or designate may also wish to take the following factors into account when determining priority among competing requests: a leave date has been requested to co-ordinate with that of other family members a leave date has been requested to provide for a specifically seasonal activity. If it is not possible to resolve the situation given these factors, it is recommended that an objective criterion such as date of application be used to determine priority. Salary & Benefits Benefits This is a leave without pay and at no cost to the city. An employee has the option of discontinuing benefits or maintaining all benefits coverage at his/her own expense. An election form must be completed prior to the commencement of the leave and the employee must pay the benefit premiums before the leave begins. OMERS Pension A leave without pay is a break in service. If an employee wants to maintain pension service credits he/she must pay both the employee's and city's pension contributions for the - P11 - duration of the leave. An election form will be forwarded to the employee following the completion of the leave. Vacation Vacation is reduced for the period of the leave taken, on a pro- rated basis. For example, if an employee is on leave for six months he/she does not earn any vacation during the period on leave but earns vacation for the balance of that year. The period of leave is not counted towards service requirements for calculating increases in vacation entitlements. Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance On a leave without pay an employee does not contribute to the Canada Pension Plan or employment insurance and the leave period is not counted as insurable employment. If this is of concern to an employee he/she should check the implications of his/her particular situation by contacting his/ her local Employment Insurance Commission office. Sick pay No sick pay is accrued during the leave. Approved by Workforce Strategy Team for the Executive Management Team.
