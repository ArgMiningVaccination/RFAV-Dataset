Prior to the modern history of science, scientific questions were addressed as a part of metaphysics known as natural philosophy. Originally, the term \"science\" (Latin scientia) simply meant \"knowledge\". The scientific method, however, transformed natural philosophy into an empirical activity deriving from experiment, unlike the rest of philosophy. By the end of the 18th century, it had begun to be called \"science\" to distinguish it from philosophy. Thereafter, metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence. Metaphysics continues asking \"why\" where science leaves off. For example, any theory of fundamental physics is based on some set of axioms, which may postulate the existence of entities such as atoms, particles, forces, charges, mass, or fields. Stating such postulates is considered to be the \"end\" of a science theory. Metaphysics takes these postulates and explores what they mean as human concepts. For example, do all theories of physics require the existence of space and time, objects, and properties? Or can they be expressed using only objects, or only properties? Do the objects have to retain their identity over time or do they change? If they change, then are they still the same object? Can theories be reformulated by converting properties or predicates (such as \"red\") into entities (such as redness or redness fields). Is the distinction between objects and properties fundamental to the physical world or to our perception of it? What is Metaphysics? The Definition of Metaphysics is often given as \"the philosophical study of that which cannot be perceived with the five physical human senses\". The branch of philosophy that deals with first principles and seeks to explain the nature of being or reality (ontology) and of the origin and structure of the universe (cosmology): it is also closely associated with the study of the nature of knowledge (epistemology) speculative philosophy in general. A branch of philosophy for exploring the fundamental questions, including the nature of concepts like being, existence and reality. A person who does, or is doing, metaphysics is called a metaphysician. The metaphysical equates to the non-physical: thus, \"metaphysical healing\" means healing by means of remedies that are not physical. What is MetaPhysical Healing? Metaphysical healing is a holistic treatment modality based on the understanding that negative mental processes can result in physical disease - and, in turn, that the establishment of positive mental processes can lead to physical healing. \"Creative energy has been placed by GOD in your entire being, and in everything that proceeds from it. Thoughts, words, and deeds are the Three Tools of Creation. When you know this, you can choose to be the cause of your experience, rather than being at the effect of it.\" What is a MetaPhysical Practitioner? Metaphysical Counseling is a holistic-approach therapy based on spiritual principles. When we are out of alignment with our True Self we experience conflict and difficulties. The work of a MetaPhysical Practitioner is to help uncover these imbalances in our belief system and restore harmony. Metaphysical healing is based on the belief that negative mental patterns, left unchecked, can eventually result in physical disease or illness; and that the reversing of those negative mental patterns into positive patterns can in turn lead to healing. Though western medicine dismisses the notion of metaphysical healing, there is little doubt about the connection between body, mind and spirit. Doctors routinely tell patients to keep spirits high while supporting visits from family and friends, understanding that anything that makes a patient feel better mentally and emotionally, aids healing. Depression, on the other hand, tends to slow healing. Metaphysical healing takes this principle to a very fundamental level, in very specific ways. According to those who believe in it, certain common negative thinking habits affect particular areas of the body. For example, worry about money issues tend to manifest as lower back problems, as the back represents support. A believer in metaphysical healing who was experiencing soreness in his lower back would examine his thought process to see if he had been over-anxious about money issues of late. Once the negative thinking pattern was identified and replaced with a new habitual positive pattern, the backaches, if caused by the old negative pattern, should subside. The idea behind this type of healing is that the individual is his or her own healer, responsible for creating both health and illness. When an individual falls ill, the believer in metaphysical health does not think it was by chance, but by mental patterns that can be identified and replaced. The type and point of origin of the ailment gives a clue where to look in the thinking patterns. As a MetaPhysician, I have experience and training on how to help you identify for yourself where your belief system and your habit patterns that were programmed into you originate and how they have served you to this point. When they no longer serve you, they create the basis for mal-function and an individual will experience dis-ease and ill-health. According to this belief, the most compromising emotions to health are longstanding guilt, resentment, and anger. The biggest healers are self-love, self-acceptance, and self-worth. Self-reflection is not something that comes easy to most. Therefore, having an experienced practitioner who is well versed in mental and emotional holding patterns, spiritual imbalances, in addition to the physical and chemical causes of disease will help the individual come back into balance as a Triune being: Body, Mind and Spirit. How Do We Address Our Health Issues? So what happens when our ability to create our desired outcome develops or is experienced as a health concern? What is the Ultimate Source of this condition, imbalance or dysfunction? What is the source of Dis-Ease? There are many philosophies being practiced to promote healing, all of which have merit. These consist Primarily of the following 2 Philosophies: Definition of allopathic: relating to or being a system of medicine that aims to combat disease by using remedies (such as drugs or surgery) which produce effects that are different from or incompatible with those of the disease being treated. Traditional Allopathic Philosophy subscribes that the mainstream medical use of pharmacologically active agents or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathophysiologic processes of diseases or conditions. Non-Allopathic Therapies (Non-Conventional Therapies): refers to a broad range of procedures or treatments that are not commonly used in allopathic medicine; this includes those referred to as complementary or alternative. [Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)](non-allopathicphilosophy.asp) There certainly are other philosophies associated with helping a body to heal and maintain balance, including and not limited to massage, Reiki, physical therapy, light therapy and sound therapy among others. And all of these modalities focus on the primary effect of the imbalances and diseases we experience, which manifest at the physical level. And you will note that within the principles of each Non-Allopathic or Alternative philosophy, there are different focuses on the effects as experienced by the individual and some focus on the underlying cause, as it pertains to the physical. So, as you can see, there are several methods of care a person can employ are many, some of which look at the body, mind AND spirit and some only address the body and mind. And, from a Western Philosophy, we are less inclined to think of helping our spirit/soul and feeling there aren't things we would need to do related to a spiritual/soul imbalance. And that philosophy is beginning to change; hence why we are offering Metaphysical Healing. Our goal by offering this form of care, having experienced all of these forms of healing, is to enhance the balancing within each person we support through their process. And as Triune-Beings, it is important for all of us to restore balance to our Triune-self. What Are The Tools We Use for Metaphysical Healing? We look at the body from 7 different perspectives in supporting the body as a whole. Through each of these perspectives, we employ several different tools and techniques, many of which overlap, in an effort to bring the highest level of balance in the shortest amount of time. These include as many as 30 different techniques that have been blended together to support the individual to restore balance on all 7 different perspectives. This allows the individual to learn about the process of discovering their imbalances, the relationships associated with each imbalance and the understanding of what the source of the dysfunction is, while learning how to remove the underlying cause, thus returning the individual back to balance and harmony. And once there, how to maintain that level of balance, while helping others achieve that same type of balance for themselves. And all of it is based on the Law of One. The Law of One is the comprehension that all things are made of intelligent energy and are a part of the All-One. The Law of One is a Sacred Science of the mechanics of Christ Consciousness and are the Natural Laws governing our Universal Creation. All-One is the recognition that Eternal Truth is Eternal Love and Eternal Love is the organic consciousness of Infinite Creator, or God. Eternal Love consciousness embodied in a form is Unity intelligence, and simultaneously recognized as, the Inner Light of Christos. Unity consciousness is at One with God and Unity consciousness ignites the Inner Light of Christos. The Inner Light of Christos, when actualized in form, is the embodiment of an Eternal God Human. Practice Unity Consciousness and One is directly reflecting the image of God's Love, and is eternally protected. Be At One with All, as One is All with God. Every soul is taking the same journey, but each soul has evolved at a different level. The teachings of the Law of One describe the spiritual laws that govern our spiritual evolution for each dimension. It is a single philosophical system of World Humanism, which merges cosmology, science, Human Rights and spiritualism. Simply put, the Law of One is the Universal Truth that All Is One. It is the Truth taught by Christ when he proclaimed, \"Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\" We are all direct expressions of the One Source God Source. The Law of One is an energetic reality as well as a creational covenant with the Founder Races. (The Family Entity of RA, the Melchizedek Ur's, The Aurora Host Races) The Law of One is practiced by the Advanced Races that promote Self-Responsibility and accountability in our Universal Time Matrix through the comprehension of the energetic interconnection that exists between all living things. The Law of One expresses and acknowledges the interconnection, value and interdependence of the spirit and Consciousness that animates all things. This is the path to God-Sovereign-Free or GSF \"I am God. I am Sovereign. I am Free.\" There are 4 Fundamental Questions we all would choose to answer at some point on our spiritual journey/the journey of the Soul. Who am I? Where am I? Why am I where I am? What do I intend to do about that? A summary of All 4 Fundamental Questions can be stated as, Why am I in the space? Am I here to serve a spiritual agenda, both for myself in terms of how I show up, as well as for the people I am interacting with, AND, how might that look? Consider, \"I am here for a reason that transcends the physicality of the moment.\" This statement drives directly to the question, What is the purpose of life itself? And what is the purpose of this moment, interior to the larger agenda? If you have any questions, feel free to contact Dr. Huntoon directly at 845-561-2225. He looks forward to serving you.
