Tulane University Health Scie nces Center is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Ed ucation (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians. Designation Tulane University Health Sciences Center de signates this live activity for a maximum of 20 AMA PRA Category 1 Credits . Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity. Tulane University Health Sciences Center a nd the Southern Regional Meeting present this activity for educational purposes only and do not endorse any product, content of presentation or exhibit. Participants are expect ed to utilize their own expertis e and judgment while engaged in the practice of medicine. The c ontent of the presentations is pr ovided solely by presenters who have been selected because of their recognized expertise. Overview The Southern Regional Meeting provides th e platform and forum for collaborative interdisciplinary research and clinical applicatio ns. Physicians and healthcare professionals will examine the most recent research findings in the medicine to determine and inform future research projects based on the analysis of th e emerging research as well as to determine applications for clinical practice. The pro cess of submission, presenting, defending and being open to collaborative interaction among peers is a very important part of training in academic medicine. Statement of Need Physicians and clinical researchers need to increa se their competency in developing strategies in providing patient care improvements. Investigat ors require a supportive forum for presenting their research. Senior investig ators need to increase their co mpetence in identifying mentees and increase their performance in mentoring junior investigators through th e process of designing research that is relevant to understanding di sease mechanisms and improved patient care. Goal The purpose of the Southern Regional Meetings are to foster resear ch among senior and young investigators and provide a forum in which this research can be successfully submitted, discussed, debated and improved with respectful interactions with both peers and mentors. The Southern Regional Meetings bring together researchers, clinicia ns and students to review the current research and its impact on the future of medical care. Educational Objectives After participating in this educat ional activity, the partic ipant should be better able to effectively: Discuss new developments in pathophysio logy of human disease with colleagues. 8 Identify the trends in the developing guideline s and evidence-based state of the art in the specialties which may affect practice management and patient treatment decisions. Identify new areas of investigation which will inform research and improve patient care. Discuss the future development possi ble from current research trends. Assess research trends as they relate to the mentoring process and coll aboration with colleagues and junior investigators. Predicted Outcomes Predicted Changes in Practice as a result of this activity may include the improved ability to: Conduct a research assessment to determine if any of the strategies and trends could be extended and/or improved by further resear ch and/or collabora tive projects. Determine which strategies are appropriate fo r incorporation into clinical practice. Engage in the mentoring pr ocess for young investigators. Identify a possible collaborator (mentor or mentee) for research advancement.

More importantly, it's a major channel by which our patients and families receive and consume information. In this workshop, participants will learn about various social media platforms and how they can be used to increase their professional social media presence. We will disc uss the most popular social media platforms and how they can be used for advocacy. We will exam ine how physicians have integrated social media into their continuous professional deve lopment using blogs, podcasts and other social media platforms. We will also explore common professionalism pitfalls and how to avoid these. 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM MICRO TO MACRO TEACHING IN TH E BUSY CLINICAL SETTING Kim B. Hoang, Baylor College of Medicine - Th e Children's Hospital of San Antonio Sarah F. Denniston, Baylor College of Medi cine and The Children's Hospital of San Antonio Adam D. Wolfe, Baylor College of Medi cine and The Children's Hospital of San Antonio Residency programs across the country incorporat e different forms of Re sident as Teachers curriculum. However, with a resident's busy wo rkday and the current dut y hours restrictions, it can be overwhelming for residents to find time to effectively teach. This workshop will teach participants how to educate lear ners (e.g., senior resi dents and fellows) to use different teaching techniques in specific settings and time constraints while still being able to balance their clinical duties with teaching responsibil ities. We will focus on three different teaching scenarios including bedside teaching, morni ng report, and a one hour didactic . Specific teaching strategy resources will be provided during th e workshop that can be brought ba ck to home institutions to teach learners how to be effective teachers in different clinical and didactic settings ______________________________________________________________________________ 78 CARDIOVASCULAR CLUB II SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2017 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM Frenchman I - Second Floor Daniel Villarreal, Presiding 11:00 KARL T.
