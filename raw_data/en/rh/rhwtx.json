FOREWORD I first met Robbins in 1969. Although the arc of a life's journey is always clearer in retrospect, the seeds for this book were evident in her worldview even then. She has made a career of living at the boundary between the known and the unknown, starting with her move overseas and immersion in another culture as a teenager. She then spent two decades researching cross-cultural adaptation and training others to engage more effectively with these unknowns. She went on to a successful career as a management consultant in international development. Twenty-five years ago, confronted with healing challenges of her own and in our family, she went beyond the improvement of communications across the known world to communications in the spiritual realm. She keeps braiding new threads with the old, as you will see from her chapter on global healing where she has continued to integrate her international and outward-looking perspective into her spiritual work. She describes herself as an ordinary mystic. I have always understood ordinary in this context to mean she is grounded in daily life - in ordinary time. In most other respects she is anything but ordinary. She is, however, eternally practical, even in her approach to calling forth spiritual healing. She takes an empirical approach and constantly tests her methods, reads the research, and collects feedback from her clients. She is a fan of things that work and the healing protocols she shares in this book are seasoned with years of experience helping clients. Her prose is rich and we are rewarded with deeper nuances when we take the time to meditate on the meaning. She clearly does not expect anyone to absorb the book in one reading. Indeed, a major reason she finally sat down to write it was to provide her colleagues and clients a reference to all the learnings that have shaped her journey so these lessons and techniques can be shared more broadly. In this book, she sets out specific and practical methods for us to clear the fears and imbalances that keep us from embracing our whole selves. She has refined these methods after years of working with clients and deep meditation. She has gathered this wisdom into a Six-Step Spiritual Healing Protocol. One of things I admire most about Robbins is her courage. This is not to say that she is fearless, but that she faces her fears over and over, clears them from her field, and moves beyond them. I have come to appreciate that this is a rare form of courage indeed. One of my favorite bits of wisdom that she shared with me early in her journey is the idea that we get as many chances as we need in this life to clear whatever we have come here to clear. It was only later I came to understand that depending on whether we have the courage to face our fears, the repeating nature of these opportunities may be the good news or may be the bad news. As her partner on the journey and one of the primary beneficiaries of Robbins' evolving understanding of spiritual healing, I am deeply pleased to see this book come to fruition. It's time that a broader community of seekers experiences the transformational power of what she has learned. In our relationship I am the tender of the hearth where the flame is sometimes low but radiant among the shadows. Robbins is the one who lights the lantern and holds it up and out into the darkness. The flame is bright and the darkness does not overcome it. May her book be a lantern for you in the darkness and may the sacred flame burn brightly for you and in you. Giles Hopkins CHAPTER ONE Introduction I AM AN ORDINARY MYSTIC. My life has been squarely set in the ebb and flow of human life and at the same time, I have pursued years of meditation and spiritual work with the Divine Realm. Because of this dual existence, I have chosen to stay in this world rather than to withdraw to a convent or a mountaintop. In this book I share how I continue to expand my work with The Divine Oneness in the midst of my daily life. I first began writing and teaching about spiritual healing in 1995. However I was called to spiritual topics as early as 1956. As my healing experiences grew, I felt a call to share the processes revealed to me in Silence. These processes can help us clear our unhealed energies and address the imbalances they create in our bodies and energy fields. I have worked with a range of imbalances manifesting as chronic pain, failed relationships, addiction, depression, grief, boredom, blocked arteries, apathy, migraines, anger, self-hate, anxiety, mental disabilities, insomnia, feeling unsafe, irritations, tension, infections, dislike of self, cancer, obesity, and others. All human imbalances can be traced back to blocked emotional, mental, spiritual, and self-protective energies. Further, these blocked energies cause imbalances in our societies, institutions, governments, economies, religions, natural environment as well as our bodies. For millennia, we have come to earth in bodies and imagined that what we saw was all there was. In fact, what we are seeing, experiencing, and feeling in body is only a small part of who we really are and an even smaller part of All That Is. The vastness of All That Is extends beyond our physical in-body sensing capabilities. We have to become very still and quiet to sense what is beyond our own bodies, feelings, thoughts, and experiences. We need to listen to our inner selves, our own deep knowing, in order to hear beyond our ears, to see beyond our eyes, and to know beyond our tangible experiences. As we become quiet and peaceful, we learn to experience Divine Presence wherever we are. Before consciously seeking Divine Presence, we may have had experiences with the Divine. The conscious seeking of connection with the Divine Presence means we can connect whenever we want to, not just when the conditions line up perfectly. The longer we consciously seek this relationship and stay on an intentional spiritual path, the more doorways open to Divine Energy. Our major religions typically teach about God, Divine Presence, The Oneness, or All That Is. However, every person needs personal experiences with the Divine to develop trust and confidence in All That Is. Religions provide general pathways to connection with Divine energy. Every religion endeavors to point in the general direction of Wholeness/God. Individual inner exploration and seeking though provides a lasting, deeply satisfying personal relationship with the Divine. Some people need just one experience in their life to open the channels with the Divine. Others need regular, consistent experiences with the Divine to really know that Divine energy exists within and all around them. Mystics spend the core of our lives consciously seeking a relationship with God. We spend months and years pursuing our human relationship with The Great Oneness. At some point, we begin to understand how anyone can do this efficiently and successfully. My experience has been a journey of increasing awe, amazing revelation, and powerful transformation. I do not recall wishing to be a mystic when I was growing up. Indeed I probably had no idea of what a mystic was. Even now, I do not for the most part fit the stereotypes of a mystic. I am married, have two children and a daughter-in-law, live in an extended family household and have worked all my adult life in the ordinary flow of daily life. In spite of this outward pattern of my life, my inward journey has been that of a mystic. I love all that is revealed about eternal truths, Divine power, infinite love and unbounded knowing. For many years, I could simply never get enough quality time with all things Divine. I was most fortunate to have spent seven years in intentional Silence, five to eight hours daily, before going about my daily work, greeting my family and sharing our lives together. Though those patterns of intense seeking have altered over the years, the profound Presence of God is the most central characteristic of my life. This relationship continues to inform and transform my life every single day. This book has been created in partnership with Divine Beings and their shared wisdom. I had been working with Divine Beings as my partners for many years before undertaking this book. We first worked together as I did my personal inner work of clearing away old feeling and thoughts that no longer served me. Then we worked in partnership to help others do their inner work. Now we have continued in partnership to write about how this spiritual healing process brings wholeness in body, mind, and spirit. This book is about how to intentionally grow an intensely personal relationship with Divine Presence to bring you balance, health, joy, and peace through expanding your own deep well of love. USING THIS BOOK There are numerous ways to use this book. You can read straight through the next sections that deal with motivations to meditate, stories about healing, insights about how to expand consciousness, and ways to get ready to consciously connect with the Greater Whole/God/All That Is. Perhaps though, you have already passed through these topics on your own journey. You might be interested in trying out the healing protocols or casting out negative spirits or learning about how to stop carrying other people's pain or sorrow. Use the Table of Contents as a guide to find where you want to begin. You can also use this book as a teaching guide for yourself. You can learn to clear your blocked energies and command them out even before reading about the journeys and insights shared here. If that is your calling, go for it. I would suggest you begin with Chapter Seven with the Six-Step Spiritual Healing Protocol. This chapter will get you started. It also has an extensive section of frequently asked questions and answers. When you have some experience with the Six-Step Protocol and other healing approaches, you might return to read about personal insights other seekers have received through their journeys to inner peace and balance. In other words, this could be a reference book for you. Look at the Table of Contents and go where you feel you are led to start. You may be someone who is motivated by exploring things you have never heard about. If so, begin at the end of this book in either Chapter Eleven, Advanced Healing Interventions, or Chapter Fourteen, Global Healing. You might then work backwards to pick up needed information if you want to explore specific healing steps for yourself. Alternatively, you might be seeking support for healing work you are already doing. Chapter Eight, Working with Divine Healing Entities, may be your perfect place to begin this book. In that section, you will be introduced to amazing groups of Divine Beings each with specialties and talents who are committed to supporting human beings during our journeys here. Eventually though, do consider calling in healing for yourself. Every time you clear blocked energy, your consciousness rises. This is the amazing truth about inner healing and clearing. Every time you clear away old anger, fear or resentment, your consciousness rises. In other words, you get closer to Divine Presence. I used to calibrate my own consciousness using a hypothetic scale of 1-1000 with 1 being the lowest consciousness possible in human body and 1000 being the highest consciousness possible for humans. David R. Hawkins, MD, further explains this technique in Power vs. Force.\u00b9 I calibrated this for myself in order to come to the absolute knowing that every time I cast out blocked energies, my consciousness rose. That was a huge motivator for me. I was a most skeptical ordinary mystic who lived in the show me realm for years. If you know how to use kinesiology, you may delight in testing your own level of consciousness as you begin this process. Whether you measure your consciousness level or not, as you clear blocked energies, your consciousness rises. It is impossible to slide back into a lower level of consciousness once a higher level is attained. Even when faced with persistent, disturbing imbalances, which seem intractable, you can't slide back in overall consciousness. Once you have moved to a specific level of knowing you can't mess up and lose the level of consciousness you have reached. At times, you may feel you are back to the beginning or that you are deeply stuck. However, a sufficient determination to clear old stuck energies again and again, until they are really gone, is the path forward. Every moment you invest in working on your own issues, brings a greater conscious knowing of your eternal connection with Divine Presence/All That Is. This brings lasting peace to you individually and to us collectively. It is worth every ounce of effort you put into spiritual healing for yourself and for our planet. Peruse the Table of Contents and dip into parts of the book until you find your interest piqued. Begin there. Then choose something else that appeals to you. You can also read this book straight through as written. Anyway you proceed, you will receive that which is meant for you. THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BOOK I have chosen to capitalize all references to Divine Energy. That includes the following references to God, All That Is, Divine Source, Spirit, Divine Grace, Perfected Love, Great Oneness, Yahweh, Unified Field, Allah, Elohim, Great Spirit, Sacred Space, Quantum Space, etc. I also capitalize all references to types of Divine Beings including Angels, Archangels, Divine Light Workers, Ascended Masters, Divine Healing Entities of Highest Light, Cosmic Light Beings of the Universe, Nature Intelligences, Devas, etc. The capitalization indicates that the energy we are speaking about is Divine. This energy can be called by many names all over the world. Regardless of the specific terms used and by whom, the principles of interaction for healing with all Divine Energies are exactly the same. The different terms used for Divine Energy and Beings are intended to be inclusive for all people. The ways shared here to effectively connect and work with Divine Presence for healing apply to all Divine Beings and all Divine Source energy. Use whatever terms work for you and substitute your own terms where those you use are not specifically named. The principles of connection and communication, healing and rebalancing specified in this book apply to all human and Divine Energy regardless of what we name it. All the cases used in this book are derived from personal experiences I have had with individuals or groups. All names and identifying characteristics have been changed to protect the personal history of these people or groups. Further, there are times when a composite case has been formed from different individuals working with the same issue. In the few cases when a person might even suspect a case could be theirs, their permission has been granted to use the example as written even though their names and circumstances have been changed. All that is shared here has come from personal inner work and from working with others along their journeys unless specifically footnoted. AUTHENTIC PRAYER AND MEDITATION This book is about authentic prayer, powerful beyond all limits. The most powerful, authentic prayer has to be based on the universal spiritual principles of Love and Wholeness. Every human being is made in the image of Divine Love. Additionally, our eternal souls are Divine Energy in human form, having a human experience. You are here to learn, forgive, and heal from past hurts, traumas, and bad choices made in times while being in body. You are here to celebrate the joy of all life. God is within and you are always able to connect with that Divine Knowing, if you persistently seek this connection in your life with all your focus, energy, and determination. At your very core or spirit, you are made of the same flame as the Great I AM/God/ All That Is. You are made in the image of All That Is. As a Divine "}
