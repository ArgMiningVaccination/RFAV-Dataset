Summarize this article for a 10 years old Alternative medicine is any practice that aims to achieve the healing effects of [medicine](/en/Medicine) despite lacking [biological plausibility](/en/Biological_plausibility), [testability](/en/Testability), [repeatability](/en/Repeatability) or evidence Unlike [modern medicine](/en/Medicine), which employs the [scientific method](/en/Scientific_method) to test plausible therapies by way of [responsible and ethical](/en/Guidelines_for_human_subject_research) [clinical trials](/en/Clinical_trial), producing repeatable [evidence](/en/Evidence) of either effect or of no effect, alternative therapies reside outside of medical science [[n 1]](#cite_note-Harrisonquote-1) [[n 2]](#cite_note-WebMD2014quote-2) and do not originate from using the scientific method, but instead rely on [testimonials](/en/Testimonial), [anecdotes](/en/Anecdote), [religion](/en/Religion), tradition, reasoning](/en/Fallacy), [propaganda](/en/Propaganda), [fraud](/en/Fraud), or other unscientific sources. Frequently used terms for relevant practices are [New Age](/en/New_Age) medicine, [pseudo-medicine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pseudo-medicine), unorthodox medicine, holistic medicine, fringe medicine, and unconventional medicine, with little distinction from [quackery](/en/Quackery). Some alternative practices are based on theories that contradict the established science of how the human body works; others resort to the [supernatural](/en/Supernatural) or [superstitious](/en/Superstition) to explain their effect or lack thereof. In others, the practice has plausibility but lacks a positive [risk-benefit](/en/Risk-benefit_ratio) outcome probability. Research into alternative therapies often fails to follow proper research protocols (such as [placebo](/en/Placebo)-controlled trials, [blind experiments](/en/Blinded_experiment) and calculation of [prior probability](/en/Prior_probability)), providing invalid results. History has shown that if a method is proven to work, it eventually ceases to be alternative and becomes mainstream medicine. Much of the perceived effect of an alternative practice arises from a belief that it will be effective (the [placebo effect](/en/Placebo_effect)), or from the treated condition resolving on its own ( [the natural course of disease](/en/Regression_toward_the_mean)). This is further exacerbated by the tendency to turn to alternative therapies upon the failure of medicine, at which point the condition will be at its worst and most likely to spontaneously improve. In the absence of this bias, especially for diseases that are not expected to get better by themselves such as [cancer](/en/Cancer) or [HIV infection](/en/HIV/AIDS), multiple studies have shown significantly worse outcomes if patients turn to alternative therapies. While this may be because these patients avoid effective treatment, some alternative therapies are actively harmful (e.g. [cyanide poisoning](/en/Cyanide_poisoning) from [amygdalin](/en/Amygdalin), or the intentional ingestion of [hydrogen peroxide](/en/Hydrogen_peroxide)) or actively interfere with effective treatments. The alternative medicine sector is a highly profitable industry with a strong lobby, [[1]](#cite_note-ConsumerHealth9th-3) and faces far less regulation over the use and marketing of unproven treatments. Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and [holistic medicine](/en/Holism) attempt to combine alternative practices with those of mainstream medicine. [Traditional medicine](/en/Traditional_medicine) practices become \"alternative\" when used outside their original settings and without proper scientific explanation and evidence. Alternative methods are often marketed as more \" [natural](/en/Appeal_to_nature)\" or \" [holistic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/holistic)\" than methods offered by medical science, that is sometimes derogatorily called \" [Big Pharma](/en/Big_Pharma_conspiracy_theories)\" by supporters of alternative medicine. Billions of dollars have been spent studying alternative medicine, with few or no positive results and many methods "}
