Individual vaccines are assumed to have no other effect than protection against the targeted pathogen, but vaccines also have nonspecific and interactive effects, the outcomes of which can be beneficial or harmful. To date, no controlled trials and very few observational studies have determined the impact of vaccination schedules on overall health. The balance of the risks and benefits from mass vaccination therefore remains uncertain. Recent studies worryingly suggest links between multiple vaccinations and increased risks of diverse multisystem health problems, including allergies, infections, and neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we propose that, in susceptible persons, multiple vaccinations activate the retinoid cascade and trigger apoptotic hepatitis, leading to cholestatic liver dysfunction, in which stored vitamin A compounds (retinyl esters and retinoic acid) enter the circulation in toxic concentrations; this induces endogenous forms of hypervitaminosis A, with the severity of adverse outcomes being directly proportional to the concentration of circulating retinoids. In very low concentrations, vitamin A and its major metabolite retinoic acid contribute to immune function and to the process of immunization, whereas excess vitamin A increases the risk of adverse events, including common \"side-effects\" as well as chronic adverse outcomes. The increasing rates of allergy, ear infections, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in countries with high rates of vaccination could be related to mass vaccination and to its impact on liver function and vitamin A metabolism, collectively representing endogenous manifestations of hypervitaminosis A. Further studies of health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are urgently needed, to increase understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of vaccine injury, to identify the risk factors and screen for vaccine injury, to inform public health policy on potential hazards related to vaccination schedules, and to optimize the safety and benefits of vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-11-12", "cleaned_text": "Multiple Vaccinations and the Enigma of Vaccine Injury [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040676](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040676) [Vaccination and Public Health: Optimizing Vaccine Uptake through the Application of Social and Behavioral Science Theory, Principles, and Current Status of Vaccines [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00676)]. The discovery in 1962 of the first human cell strain used to produce licensed human virus vaccines (WI-38) is also credited with saving 10.3 million lives [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00676)]. The primary benefit of vaccination\u2014disease prevention\u2014is considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century [ [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00676)]. Vaccines for preventing other global scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and for the current pandemic of COVID-19, remain high priorities for development [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00676), [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00676)]. [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00676)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00676)]. This represents a three-fold increase in vaccines compared to the schedule in 1983 [ [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00676)]. To reduce the number of required injections, many combination vaccines have been developed [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00676)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00676)]. The different nonspecific outcomes depend partly on the order of vaccine administration, on whether the vaccines are live or inactivated, and on concomitant supplementation with vitamin A [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00676)]. The existence of these nonspecific and interactive effects challenges current understanding of the mechanism of action of vaccines and how they affect the immune system [ [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00676), [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00676)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00676)], suggesting that such events are much more common than are officially recorded. Awards for compensation do not imply that vaccines caused the alleged injuries. Most awards result from a negotiated settlement between the parties in which it is concluded that the outcome and the circumstances match those of previous cases, as set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00676)]. The data for such cases derive from reports to the Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS), filed voluntarily by physicians or parents. The Table includes a list of vaccines and the \"injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths\" claimed to have resulted from the administration of such vaccines. For deciding eligibility for compensation under the Program, the Table also defines the allowed periods of time during which the first symptoms or manifestations had to have occurred after vaccine administration. For instance, the Table includes encephalopathy as a vaccine injury, defining it as a change in mental or neurologic status first manifested during the applicable time period and that persists for at least 6 months from the date of vaccination. Another tracking system for vaccine adverse effects, the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), is a collaboration between the CDC and nine healthcare organizations [ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00676)]. As vaccinations are a covered benefit of the VSD health plans, and vaccine coverage rates are higher than national coverage estimates, this highly vaccinated population has limited numbers of unvaccinated children for comparison purposes [ [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00676)]. 2. Growing Safety Concerns [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00676), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00676), [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00676)]. The long-term effects and safety of vaccine ingredients such as adjuvants and preservatives, particularly aluminum-based adjuvants, are also being increasingly questioned [ [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00676), [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00676)]. Likewise, little is known about the safety of vaccines against diseases that can be lethal for individuals but have a lesser impact on population health, such as the group B meningococcus vaccine [ [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00676)]. Research on understanding the biological mechanisms underlying vaccine injury remains limited, and there is no accepted mechanism by which vaccines can induce disorders such as autism [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00676)]. [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00676)]. Today, the USA schedule comprises 11 antigens, and those in some European countries comprise nine on average. This decline in the number of antigens is shown in [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00676-t001). [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00676)]; and whether vaccines could be contributing to the unexplained increases in the rates of allergy, asthma, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) [ [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00676), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00676), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00676), [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00676)]. The balance of the risks and benefits from the receipt of the recommended vaccination schedule therefore remains uncertain. [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00676), [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00676)]. The aims were to compare health outcomes and exposures to determine if any association found between vaccination and NDDs remained significant after controlling for other significant factors. The survey targeted homeschooling mothers in the states of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oregon. The mothers were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire on their 6- to 12-year-old biological children regarding pregnancy-related exposures, birth history, vaccinations, physician-diagnosed illnesses, medications, and the use of health services. NDDs were defined as having one or more of the following: A physician diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or a learning disability. A sample of 666 children was obtained, of which 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. The vaccinated were significantly less likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis; they were, however, significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with: - Allergic rhinitis (Odds 1.7, 7.9). - In a study based on 38,801 reports to VAERS, a linear relationship was observed between the number of vaccine doses administered at one time and the rate of hospitalization and death in infants after receiving vaccinations. The hospitalization rate for vaccine injury increased from 11% for two doses to 23.5% for eight doses (r2 = 0.91). The case-fatality rate increased significantly from 3.6% for 1-4 doses to 5.4% for those receiving 5-8 doses [ [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00676)]. - The USA has the highest Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) among 33 other nations; it also has the highest number of required doses of vaccines for infants among these nations. An examination of the immunization schedules of these 34 countries showed a strong correlation between IMRs and the number of routinely administered doses of vaccines (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.0001) [ [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00676)]. - In a study comparing health outcomes among vaccinated and unvaccinated US children born between 2005 and 2015, based on medical records from three medical practices, vaccination before age 1 was significantly associated with developmental delays (OR: 2.18; 95% 2.13) [ [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00676)]. - A study examined the association between the proportion of children receiving the recommended vaccines by age 2 in each state and the prevalence of autism or speech disorders [ [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00676)]. After controlling for family income and ethnicity, the proportion of children receiving the recommended vaccinations was directly related to the prevalence of autism and of speech disorders. A 1% increase in the vaccination rate in each state was associated with an additional 680 children having either outcome. [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00676)]. Potential risk factors included exposure to several neurotoxins and the anticholinergic drug pyridostigmine bromide (PB), which was routinely taken as prophylaxis against the nerve agent soman. No association was found between deployment to the war zone and specific health effects, or between specific exposures during deployment and health effects related to GWI. This was true whether the veterans were from the US, the UK, Canada, Australia, or Denmark [ [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00676)]. \"Stress\" and related psychiatric etiologies were ruled out [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00676)]. Veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf War also appear to be at increased risk of chronic illness in later life, particularly from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart attacks, diabetes, strokes, arthritis, and chronic bronchitis [ [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00676)]. [41](#B41-vaccines-08-00676)] noted that nearly all Gulf War veterans reported getting at least one vaccine for deployment, 70% received over five vaccines, and 30% received over 10 vaccines [ [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00676)]. Several studies have linked GWI to the receipt of multiple vaccines: - A survey of over 4000 British Gulf War male veterans reported that \"vaccination against biological warfare and multiple routine vaccinations were associated with GWI in the Gulf War cohort.\" [ [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00676)]. - Among 1548 Kansas GW veterans and controls (non-GW), the rate of GWI among vaccinated GW veterans was 11 times higher than among non-GW veterans who did not receive vaccines. Vaccinated non-GW veterans had significantly higher rates of chronic pain, neurological, and gastrointestinal problems, and nearly four-fold higher odds of GWI than non-GW veterans who did not receive vaccines. It was concluded that vaccines \"were a contributing factor to the excess morbidity among Gulf War veterans\" [ [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00676)]. - A follow-up, medical record-based study of British GW veterans 6-8 years after deployment reported that receipt of multiple vaccinations was associated with five-fold increased odds of GWI [ [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00676)]. - A study of nearly 8000 personnel with the UK forces in the Gulf War reported that the number of vaccinations received was directly associated with higher scores for skin and musculoskeletal complaints [ [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00676)]. - A study of outcomes among 1456 Australian GW veterans and a control group of veterans who were not deployed (n = 1588) found that the number of symptoms reported in the past month by GW veterans was associated with vaccinations in a dose-dependent manner. Those with the highest number of symptoms had at least 10 vaccinations [ [47](#B47-vaccines-08-00676)]. [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00676)]. Veterans with GWI are reported to have increased liver enzymes and increased clinical diagnoses of liver disease, including a 7.5-fold increased odds of obstructive liver disease compared to veterans without multisystem illness [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00676)]. 3. Unifying Hypothesis on the Pathogenesis of Vaccine Injury [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00676)]. Apoptosis has been suggested as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the adverse effects of vA poisoning, including birth defects [ [51](#B51-vaccines-08-00676)]. These observations led us to propose that exposure to multiple vaccinations, possibly with additional chemical insults of a liver-damaging nature, plausibly explains GWI and its observed chronicity [ [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00676)]. Based on this hypothesis, the suggested pathogenesis is a chemically induced impaired liver function involving activation of the retinoid cascade in the liver. This inhibits the secretion of retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), thereby lowering serum retinol concentrations, but simultaneously increases the accumulation and expression of retinoids in the liver, leading to apoptotic hepatocellular damage and the entry of retinyl esters and retinoic acid into the circulation in toxic concentrations. The result is an endogenous chronic form of hypervitaminosis A. [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00676-f001)). [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00676)]. In a mouse model of allergic dermatitis, the expression of Interleukin-4 (IL-4) was increased in inflamed skin, demonstrating an altered immune response. Gene expression analysis showed alterations in cutaneous retinoid metabolism and retinoid-mediated signaling. Retinoic acid levels and synthesis were increased, as shown by the elevated expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenases [ [53](#B53-vaccines-08-00676)]. These findings suggest that increased Retinoic Acid Receptor- (RAR)-mediated signaling in allergen-induced dermatitis may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of allergic skin diseases. As noted in our review on GWI [ [41](#B41-vaccines-08-00676)], mast cells are increased in patients with atopic dermatitis and express high levels of retinoic acid receptor-alpha. Retinoic acid (RA) also interferes with the proliferation of skin mast cells and promotes their degranulation, supporting the concept that RA has a pro-allergic and pro-inflammatory-maintaining function in skin mast cells. [54](#B54-vaccines-08-00676)]. Other research has found that the therapeutic use of 13-cis-RA (isotretinoin) is associated with the onset of depression, psychosis, and suicide [ [55](#B55-vaccines-08-00676)], and both depression and cognitive disturbances in 1% to 11% of patients with acne [ [56](#B56-vaccines-08-00676)]. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of acute vA poisoning include drowsiness, irritability, severe headaches, nausea, and various forms of impulsive and irrational behavior [ [57](#B57-vaccines-08-00676)]. [58](#B58-vaccines-08-00676)] includes the suggestion that an abnormality in the interplay between retinoic acid and sex hormones may cause ASD [ [59](#B59-vaccines-08-00676)], and that RA and related signaling pathways could provide a target for the treatment of ASD. Studies are awaited on vA concentration profiles in children with NDDs. [60](#B60-vaccines-08-00676)]. Chronic digestive symptoms, along with neuropsychological dysfunction, were reported by veterans returning from the 1990-1991 Gulf War [ [61](#B61-vaccines-08-00676)]. Retinoids are linked to a wide range of adverse and often severe gastrointestinal effects [ [62](#B62-vaccines-08-00676)]. [63](#B63-vaccines-08-00676)]. Severe headaches (pseudotumor cerebri) and skeletal pain are common manifestations of hypervitaminosis A [ [64](#B64-vaccines-08-00676)]. [65](#B65-vaccines-08-00676)]. DTaP vaccination is linked to soreness or swelling at the site of injection, with a fever, feeling tired, a loss of appetite, and occasional vomiting; more serious reactions include seizures, continuous crying or a high fever (over 105 \u00b0F), limb swelling, and, very rarely, long-term seizures, coma, encephalopathy, permanent brain damage, severe hypersensitivity reactions, or death [ [66](#B66-vaccines-08-00676)]. Symptoms of severe fatigue and other signs of chronic hypervitaminosis A can appear 2-3 months and even years after excessive vA exposure through dietary intake, supplementation, or endogenous sources [ [67](#B67-vaccines-08-00676)]. Treatment with synthetic retinoids can also cause fever and general fatigue, dyspnea, and respiratory distress, in some cases requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation [ [68](#B68-vaccines-08-00676)]. 4. Vitamin A and Immune Function [69](#B69-vaccines-08-00676), [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00676)]. Appropriate immune responses depend on dendritic cells synthesizing RA from gut-associated lymphoid tissues. RA is critical for generating immunoglobulin A-secreting B cells, the development of immune tolerance, and Foxp3 regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) cells [ [71](#B71-vaccines-08-00676)]. RA also plays a role in the differentiation and survival of Th17 cells, which produce IL-17, IL-21, and 1L-22 and enhance bacterial and fungal infection control [ [72](#B72-vaccines-08-00676)] as well as T cell-dependent antibody responses [ [73](#B73-vaccines-08-00676)]. Low RA promotes T-helper (Th1) cells, whereas higher concentrations promote Th2 cells [ [74](#B74-vaccines-08-00676)]. vA and RA are also important in immunization, which involves collaboration between antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells [ [70](#B70-vaccines-08-00676), [75](#B75-vaccines-08-00676)]. [76](#B76-vaccines-08-00676), [77](#B77-vaccines-08-00676)] is mainly attributed to maternal antibodies. It could also be explained by the fact that vA concentrations in the liver are low in infancy, especially in the first 6 months of life [ [78](#B78-vaccines-08-00676)]. [79](#B79-vaccines-08-00676)]. In mice, the antibody titers produced after immunization with tetanus toxoid (TT), a known T cell-dependent antigen, were increased when RA was administered orally at the time of first immunization, and increased even further after the second immunization, several weeks later [ [80](#B80-vaccines-08-00676)]. These observations are relevant to understanding the role of vA in the humoral antibody response to immunization, the hallmark of successful vaccination, and in understanding adverse responses to vaccines. Oral vA supplementation significantly enhances anti-TT antibody responses, with a greater effect when combined with RA, suggesting that vA augments immune responses [ [81](#B81-vaccines-08-00676)]. Indeed, RA could serve as an effective mucosal adjuvant in vaccines [ [82](#B82-vaccines-08-00676)] and, under conditions of sufficiency or excess, can be pro-inflammatory and potentially harmful. For instance, in an experimental model of gluten-related enteropathy (a mouse model of celiac disease), RA produced inflammatory cytokines that reduced the capacity of mucosal dendritic cells to promote Treg cell production and led to exaggerated responses to dietary glutens [ [83](#B83-vaccines-08-00676)]. Reports also link pharmacologic retinoid treatment to severe intestinal inflammation [ [84](#B84-vaccines-08-00676)]. 4.1. Vaccination and Disease Pathogenesis [85](#B85-vaccines-08-00676)]. The hepatitis B vaccine also altered the expression of 144 genes in the mouse liver within 1 day of vaccination, some of which were related to inflammation and metabolism [ [86](#B86-vaccines-08-00676)]. Among children receiving the hepatitis B vaccination, according to findings from the 1993 National Health Interview Survey, the age-adjusted odds ratio for liver problems was 2.35 compared with unvaccinated controls [ [87](#B87-vaccines-08-00676)]. 4.2. Susceptibility to Vaccine Injury [88](#B88-vaccines-08-00676)], as shown by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the activation of caspases. Aluminum salts may also increase RA concentrations and expression, since some of their effects, e.g., dendritic cell activation and the stimulation of uric acid production, are those of RA itself [ [89](#B89-vaccines-08-00676)]. Based on this model, retinoid-induced liver damage related to multiple vaccinations leads to a transient form of cholestatic liver dysfunction in which stored retinoids enter the circulation, causing a broad range of adverse effects as manifestations of vA toxicity. Bile normally drains from the liver through the gall bladder and common bile duct into the duodenum. However, when regurgitated into the circulation, bile may be particularly hazardous, as it contains four-fold higher concentrations of retinol than serum and other extrahepatic tissues [ [90](#B90-vaccines-08-00676)]. [91](#B91-vaccines-08-00676)] and are often reported following vaccination [ [92](#B92-vaccines-08-00676), [93](#B93-vaccines-08-00676), [94](#B94-vaccines-08-00676)]. Features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also resemble those of acute and chronic hypervitaminosis A. These features of ASD include the following: [105](#B105-vaccines-08-00676), [106](#B106-vaccines-08-00676), [107](#B107-vaccines-08-00676)]; mitochondrial dysfunction [ [108](#B108-vaccines-08-00676)]; inflammatory bowel disease [ [84](#B84-vaccines-08-00676)]; and bone disorders [ [109](#B109-vaccines-08-00676)]. Susceptibility to vaccine injury and resulting chronic illnesses may be due in part to previous exposure to retinoids, including vA supplementation itself. For instance, children who received vitamin A with the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine were at greater risk of death than children who received vA alone or received nothing [ [110](#B110-vaccines-08-00676)]. 5. Conclusions [111](#B111-vaccines-08-00676)]. The WHO declaration assumes that vaccine schedules are sufficiently safe to be required for school and daycare attendance, and that vaccine-hesitant parents are either uninformed or misguided. However, the growing number of vaccines administered at the same time or close together has increased the complexity of assessing vaccine safety [ [112](#B112-vaccines-08-00676)]. Vaccines have nonspecific and interactive effects, the outcomes of which can be either beneficial or harmful, and the balance of long-term risks and benefits from mass vaccination remains uncertain. Recent studies also worryingly suggest links between the receipt of multiple vaccinations and increased risks of diverse multisystem health problems in children and adults. In the present state of knowledge it would therefore be premature to suggest that mandatory vaccination would be \"ethically justified\", as if it were analogous to ethically justified mandatory seat belt use in motor [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00676), [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00676), [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00676), [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00676), [114](#B114-vaccines-08-00676), [115](#B115-vaccines-08-00676), [116](#B116-vaccines-08-00676)] in high rates of vaccination suggest that these epidemics could be related to mass vaccination and represent endogenous manifestations of hypervitaminosis A. Tests of the hypothesis could include case-control studies of children and adults with these conditions and are expected to show that \"cases\" with ostensibly different conditions have had greater exposure to vaccinations and show evidence of liver dysfunction and of vitamin A toxicity compared to controls. In a recent paper, we proposed a new hypothesis for understanding rubella virus infection, congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), and the link to autism [ [117](#B117-vaccines-08-00676)]: that rubella infection occurring early in pregnancy, which is strongly associated with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), is due to maternal liver dysfunction and exposure of the fetus to excess vA. It was further suggested that post-natal influences of a liver-damaging nature, possibly including multiple vaccinations, can induce CRS-like features as a function of vA toxicity, but without the associated dysmorphogenesis.
