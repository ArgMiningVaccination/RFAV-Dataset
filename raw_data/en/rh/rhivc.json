Some people find complementary therapies help with their symptoms. There isn't a lot of evidence to say how well they work, so it's best to speak to your doctor or nurse about what therapies could work for you. Here we talk about the different therapies you can have and how to access them.] On this page: What are complementary therapies? Complementary therapies aren't designed to replace your medical care - they don't treat or cure health conditions. Complementary therapies are treatments you can have on top of your regular medical care. There is some evidence that they are effective, but not a lot. They may be helpful in treating symptoms like pain, stress and anxiety. Speak to your doctor or nurse before you have complementary therapy. Some complementary therapies might not be safe for you, depending on your condition and any treatment you're having. Accessing complementary therapy There are different ways to access complementary therapy. Complementary therapy on the NHS Some complementary therapies are free on the NHS, but it's not common. In most cases, the NHS won't offer you complementary therapy. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what's available in your area. Complementary therapy at a hospice Your local hospice or a local support group may offer free or reduced cost therapies. Each Marie Curie Hospice offers a range of complementary therapies. Some complementary therapy sessions are also open to carers. During coronavirus (covid-19), there might be fewer complementary therapy sessions on offer at Marie Curie Hospices. [Read more about what we offer at our hospices.](/help/hospice-care) Private complementary therapy You can also pay to get complementary therapy from a private therapist. Private therapists can be expensive, so it's worth checking the cost first. Checking a therapist is qualified For most medical treatments, healthcare professionals have to be registered to make sure they are qualified and practise to a certain standard. For most complementary therapies, professionals don't have to be registered in the same way. However, many complementary therapists sign up to a voluntary register to prove they are qualified and are practising to a certain standard. If you'd like to check whether a complementary therapist is registered, search for them on: [the British Acupuncture Council](https://www.acupuncture.org.uk/) [the Complementary & Natural Healthcare [the Federation of Holistic Therapists](https://www.fht.org.uk/) [the Professional Standards Authority.](https://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/check-practitioners) It's also important to tell the complementary therapist about your medical condition and any treatments you've had or are having. They can make sure the therapy is suitable for you. Types of complementary therapies [](#collapse03b23762-e2b4-4e84-9551-d350659049da-multiple) Acupuncture Acupuncture is an old Chinese practice in which needles are inserted into different places in your body. The aim is to stimulate the nerves under your skin and in your muscles. The needles are very thin and don't go in very deep, so you may feel a slight tingle or nothing at all. There are two main types of acupuncture based on different beliefs about how it works: - Western medical acupuncture is based on the belief that the needles stimulate nerves, which can have positive effects on the body. - Traditional acupuncture is based on the belief that energy flows through the body along channels. This energy is known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\"). Practitioners believe that the needles clear blocked energy and this improves your health. People use acupuncture to help with symptoms such as migraines, tiredness, pain and feeling sick. Acupuncture is sometimes provided through GPs although most people pay privately. The British Acupuncture Council has a list of qualified acupuncturists that have been approved by the Professional Standards Authority. [](#collapse45b42c93-3b5e-48da-8e8f-28b8f4684160-multiple) Acupressure Acupressure is similar to acupuncture an ancient Chinese practice which involves stimulating specific points on the body. Like acupuncture, it focuses on the belief that energy (Qi) flows through the body along channels. Practitioners believe that if the flow of energy in the body is disrupted, this can affect your health. Acupressure doesn't use needles. Instead, practitioners apply gentle pressure to your body using their fingers or an acupressure band. [](#collapsec0aaf80f-ce05-4f17-b326-e15c4278a13f-multiple) Aromatherapy Aromatherapy involves using essential oils made from plants. Each essential oil has its own properties that are thought to have health benefits. Essential oils in aromatherapy can be used in different ways: - You can inhale them, by putting them in a diffuser or by putting a few drops on a tissue. - They can be massaged directly onto your body. Some people may find aromatherapy reduces their stress levels and helps them to relax. However, there isn't lots of scientific evidence to prove aromatherapy can help with these. If you're considering having aromatherapy, speak to the doctor or the healthcare team looking after you. Tell the aromatherapist if you have any allergies. [](#collapse743e9be2-1033-4173-a436-e8d23c110987-multiple) Hypnotherapy Hypnotherapy aims to put you into a state of deep relaxation. The feeling it gives is similar to the calm, secure feeling that we often have as we drift off to sleep or as we slowly wake in the morning. The therapist will discuss with you why you want to have hypnotherapy and what methods they might use beforehand. It's important to make sure that your hypnotherapist is properly trained and that you trust them.

The aim is to reduce tension and pain, improve circulation, and help you relax. Some studies have found that massage therapy can reduce pain, anxiety and depression in people with cancer. Some people find massage helps them relax and cope with symptoms better. [](#collapse7aa8aa99-c093-4864-ae37-bf18cb4a4e13-multiple) Reflexology Reflexology involves massaging the feet and sometimes hands. It's based on the belief that every area of your body is linked with a corresponding area on your foot. Reflexologists believe that by applying gentle pressure to an area of the foot, it may have a positive effect on part of your body. They also believe that the hand is linked with other parts of the body in a similar way. It's usually done while you are sitting or lying down. Only very gentle pressure is applied. Some people find that reflexology helps them relax and feel better. [](#collapse8aa3f8a1-10b7-4265-9bb9-bb21650f75c8-multiple) Reiki Reiki is a Japanese term which means universal energy. Reiki practitioners believe that energy flows through the body and Reiki is a way of channelling this energy through their hands. When you have Reiki, the practitioner places their hands either on or just above certain points of your body and moves them around. The aim is to move and balance energy around your body and get rid of any energy \"blocks\". You don't have to get undressed and you can sit or lie down for this therapy. Some people say Reiki helps them to relax and improves their wellbeing. [](#collapse05fe85fe-f66d-42a8-a209-fcde7ee7e267-multiple) Shiatsu massage The word Shiatsu means finger pressure in Japanese. The practitioner applies gentle pressure to specific points on your body. Like acupressure, shiatsu aims to balance the levels of energy in your body. Some people find it helps to reduce stress, pain, and improve their wellbeing. Shiatsu therapists may use their hands, elbows and sometimes feet to apply comfortable pressure. It's given when you're fully clothed. Alternative therapy Some people choose an alternative therapy instead of conventional medical treatment. Alternative therapies are different from complementary therapies. They are given instead of conventional treatment, not alongside it. Sometimes the same therapy can be used as complementary therapy and alternative therapy. Some types of alternative therapy may not be completely safe and could cause harmful side effects. Most alternative therapies are not tested in the same way that conventional treatments are. Be very cautious of alternative therapists or dietary supplements that claim that they can cure your illness. Qualified therapists are unlikely to claim that their therapy will cure your illness. They should always encourage you to discuss any therapies with your doctor. Remember to speak to your doctor or nurse before you have any complementary or alternative therapy, herbal medicines or dietary supplements, and tell your therapist about your health condition and treatment. Your doctor can give you advice about whether a particular therapy, herbal medicine or dietary supplement will have health benefits for you.
