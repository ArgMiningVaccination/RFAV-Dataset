Through this segmentation, the management team has been able to deploy resources in key markets to redirect focus and enhance the quality of growth whilst optimizing its production and distribution processes which are expected to maximize operational efficiency. The Company intends to continue to expand within the MEA region and expects to enter selected additional markets in the coming years, as it believes additional regions around the world would appreciate the presence of a high-quality pharmaceutical champion. The Company will continue to expand within sizable countries where its portfolio can add value to the healthcare community. In the near to the medium term the expansion markets will be focused on the Middle East and Africa regions. Furthermore, the Company aims to adopt a carefully selective approach towards products and target markets. The identified key markets across its geographic clusters will form the basis of its commercial focus going forward, attracting increased time, effort and resources in these markets in order to ensure that the substantial commercial opportunities that are available to the Company are captured to their fullest extent possible. The Company will also treat these markets as a cornerstone for its standout products, compounding the growth opportunities by driving its best performing products in its best performing markets, whilst leveraging the strength of its local sales forces. y Investing in multiple opportunities for portfolio expansion via R&D in both existing and new therapeutic areas A critical component of the Company's strategy is to contribute to achieve national and regional self-sufficiency through optimizing new product launches and venturing into new therapeutic areas. Optimization of new product launches will be achieved through reducing the time-to-market through efficient R&D, governance and decision making. Coupled with this, identifying and capitalizing on growth opportunities in new therapeutic areas will be done through rigorous investing in research and development with diligent portfolio management and well-grounded market research to aid in decision making on promising therapeutic areas. This strategy is reflected in a recent case study, whereby the Company recognized the prevalence of diabetes in the region as a potentially strong therapeutic area for it to enter. To capture market share within this therapeutic area, the Company is developing a range of high-quality diabetes management products, with expected launches into the market between 2022G and 2024G. y Expand in tender opportunities regionally The Company will continue to grow its presence in the KSA public tender market, capitalizing on tender system reform and government support for championing high quality providers of essential products from within the Kingdom via two national-led strategies, Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP). Having already found success in the space by securing an important 2-year tender in 2020G, the Company will build on this success and utilize its position as a leading KSA pharmaceutical manufacturer to become a key strategic supplier to the Kingdom's public healthcare system through reducing the cost of manufacturing and procurement. In order to ensure the opportunities for government tender business are fully captured, the Company intends to establish a dedicated team to increasing participation in public tender contracts in all key markets such as KSA, the Gulf, Iraq, and Egypt across its product range.www.jamjoompharma.comxxTable of Contents y Drive operational effectiveness and enhance governance The Company plans to continue to build on introducing operational efficiencies in manufacturing to drive cost reduction, minimization of waste, implementation of efficient inventory management solutions, registration of alternate suppliers and improvement in local content scores. The Company expects that these actions will help to enhance collaboration and cohesive working by the manufacturing and commercial teams as well as refine the production and reallocation of resources. As a result, the Company will be able to increase both, volumes and margins, for key products through improved cost efficiency and economies of scale. In addition, the Company plans to expand its manufacturing footprint via the commissioning of the Egypt facility to serve the North African markets which supports its strategy of selectively expanding market presence. In addition, the company will continue to implement its ongoing digital transformation. Alongside the installation of technologically advanced manufacturing equipment, the Company is modernizing its facilities, systems and processes with best-in-class software and technology. This will ensure that the company is well equipped to deliver on its planned growth trajectory and is able to scale its monitoring, compliance, reporting, control and communications commensurately. Finally, the Company will also continue to maintain its strict financial discipline and preserve the strength of its balance sheet to pursue strategic objectives, through a governance model that reflects best practices and international standards of transparency and efficiency. y Developing, nurturing and retaining talent The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry demands specialized skillsets in all areas of human resources. The Company's strategy for human capital is to enhance its exceptional talent base through: - attracting the best talent locally & globally; - investment in development programs offered by the Company to its employees to enrich their skillset through the Jamjoom Pharma Academy (for more information on the Jamjoom Pharma Academy please refer to Section 4.14.1 (\"Jamjoom Pharma Academy\") of this Prospectus); and - instill succession planning to align with global best practices. - Continuing in the support of female employment and Saudization, by building on the current 60% female employee base in the factory team. Through this strategy, the Company aims to formulate a solid connection between the tasks of its employees and the achievement of the Company's Vision and Mission. www.jamjoompharma.comxxiTable of Contents Market Overview y Growing need for medical security and self-sufficiency in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector has led to increasing investments across the region With the pandemic and oil price shock serving as a reset for the various Governments thriving on oil-based revenue, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and United Arab Emirates (UAE) (core markets covered in the market study) are looking at improving non-oil revenue sources through economic diversification to promote investments in achieving food and medical security besides expanding several industries for local manufacturing, logistics and transportation. In an effort to reduce dependency on imports and to achieve self-sufficiency, countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt are actively promoting investments in local manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and to improve contribution to the GDP . As a result, the pharmaceutical medicines market for all the four countries together is expected to register a strong CAGR growth of 5.4% from SAR78.1 billion (or US$ 20.8 billion) in 2021G to SAR101.6 billion (or US$27.1 billion) in 2026G. Saudi Arabia currently imports a majority of its local consumption from USA, Europe, China and India. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 aims to achieve 40% of total pharmaceutical product consumption to come from local production. The Kingdom has been actively facilitating technology and research-driven partnerships with global manufacturers such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and a MoU with GlaxoSmithKline. This, combined with portfolio expansion by existing local manufacturers, resulted in the contribution of local products to the overall pharmaceutical market, growing from 30% in 2018G to 36% in 2021G. This has encouraged companies like Jamjoom pharmaceuticals to actively capitalize the push for localization in expanding their portfolio in both existing and new product lines. Serving over 400 public hospitals and primary healthcare centers, the National Company for the Unified Procurement of Medicines, Devices and Medical Supplies (NUPCO), is an entity dedicated for procurement and supply of medicines and medical devices for public owned hospitals in the Kingdom. This has helped formalize the institutional sales and standardize the collection process. Institutional sales has a significant contribution and reflects the growth of the overall pharmaceutical market in the forecast period, 2021G-2026G. Altogether, the total market for medicines in the Kingdom is expected to grow by a strong 5.4% to reach SAR 39.6 billion (or US$10.6 billion). Among other core markets, rising accessibility to pharmaceuticals across the population is likely to result in Egypts' pharmaceutical market reaching SAR31.5 billion (or US$10.6 billion) growing strongly at a CAGR of 5.2% since 2021G. Egypt is also characterized by a strong spread of local companies in many categories. Despite the challenges faced by the country, such as increased reliance on imports of raw materials and currency depreciation, among others, the government strongly encourages investment in domestic production of pharmaceuticals in order to increase citizens' access to affordable health care. Pharmaceutical products of local companies are estimated to contribute about 56% of the overall pharmaceutical market. New investments and setting up of factories by companies like Merck, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals, Abbott and Pfizer in Egypt is likely to make the country one of the biggest pharmaceutical hubs in MENA region. Specifically, companies like Jamjoom pharmaceuticals are expanding their manufacturing footprint with a new facility being commissioned this year in Cairo for expansion into Egypt and North African markets. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals is also actively investing in research and development to deepen its remit across existing categories while expanding into newer therapeutic categories like diabetes treatment, cardiovascular and central nervous system treatment products. Besides Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Iraq is expected to grow the fastest at a CAGR of 5.9% to reach SAR9.2 billion (or US$2.5 billion) driven by the Government's push to increase investments and accessibility. UAE, on the other hand, thrives mainly on imports but is a well matured market growing at a steady 5.6% to reach SAR21.3 billion (or US$5.7 billion). Both Iraq an UAE are far from reaching self-sufficiency in this sector. y Focus on improving health infrastructure, mandatory insurance policies and private sector participation are the key catalysts for the growth of healthcare and hence, the pharmaceutical industry COVID-19 served as a catalyst for change in the healthcare landscape across all markets. Governments across Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iraq re-evaluated their priorities and expansionary plans to focus on the more pressing issues including policy enhancements, infrastructure improvements and digital innovation in the sector. With over 500 hospitals and 75,000 beds, Saudi Arabia's public expenditure on healthcare grew to an estimated SAR 190.9billion (or US$50 billion) to expand access to high-quality infrastructure. This, combined with the mandatory health insurance for all private sector employees and their families is encouraging the growth in consumer expenditure on health products and medical services, growing at an optimistic 5.2% to reach SAR 27.1billion (or US$7.2billion). The decline in birth rates and the rise in life expectancy is likely to lead to an increase in aging rates, with the average life expectancy increasing from 29.9 (2019G) to 32.9 (2026G) and less than 34.4 by 2030G. This is further evidenced by the population aged above 41 years expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.7% to reach 16.95 million people by 2026G. This demographic combination, along with the high prevalence of diabetes (16.1% in 2021G), obesity (40.4% in 2021G) and hypertension (24.6%), is likely to spur demand for this class of pharmaceuticals regardless of external shocks in the world market. On the other hand, the Egyptian government plans to double the number of hospital beds from 15 beds per 10,000 people in 2016 to 30 beds per 10,000 people in 2030G, while current estimates indicate that the rate is 21 beds per 10,000 people, and it will expand the umbrella of the health coverage system. Comprehensive coverage to include all its citizens during the next ten years after the introduction of about 4.5 million people to the system starting from July 2022G. Despite a considerably young population, high prevalence of lifestyle diseases like diabetes (17.5% in 2021G), obesity (34.5% in 2021G) and hypertension (25.2% www.jamjoompharma.comxxiiTable of Contents in 2021G) is likely to drive consumer expenditure on health goods and medical devices by a CAGR of 12.7% to reach SAR 244.9 billion (or US$65.3 billion) by 2026G. Leveraging a strong fiscal budget allocation for healthcare, the Government planned to work closely with the private sector to launch 122 hospitals, 35 medical centers, 17 psychiatric hospitals and 8 outpatient centers. Expansion of access to healthcare is expected to drive demand for the pharmaceutical sector in the country. However, UAE is strengthening its healthcare infrastructure by leveraging information technology in expanding telemedicine and digital medicine. It is also encouraging private sector participation to explore investment areas to enhance quality of healthcare and expand medical tourism. In Iraq, the primary focus remains to expand healthcare access and insurance coverage (currently at 3% of the population) while decentralizing the healthcare system by increasing hospital capacity, private sector participation and training for healthcare service providers. These are likely to drive consumer expenditure on healthcare in Iraq compared to Saudi Arabia and other core markets like UAE and Egypt. y Growing awareness post the year of the pandemic, 2020G, combined with reopening of clinics and hospitals is fueling the growth of ophthalmic products Increased screen time during COVID-19 and the rise in the number of eye diseases like cataract, glaucoma, macular degeneration has led to an increase in demand for ophthalmic drugs across the key markets covered in the research namely, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and UAE. Arid climate conditions including blowing dust have been instrumental in causing recurring dry and irritable eye symptoms in the region. However, the eye products category across the four markets combined witnessed a 3% decline in 2020G due to closures during the pandemic period. The category then rebounded strongly in 2021G as ophthalmologists and physicians started their activities again with personal consultations and surgeries, which resulted in a growth in the demand for prescription preparations. This resulted in a cumulative growth rate of 16% in the four markets combined to reach 1.8 billion Saudi riyals (or 0.48 billion US dollars) in the four markets. Increased awareness of standard eye care amid increased screen viewing times for adults and children alike is expected to drive growth in this category. Throughout the forecast period (2021G-2026G), albeit from a small base compared to other categories, all four markets are cumulatively expected to register a growth of 10.4% with Egypt, KSA and Iraq expected to lead the growth at 13.5%, 8.9% and 6.1% respectively. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals leads Saudi Arabia's Ophthalmology market with a market share of 20.6% in a category sized at SAR0.73 billion (or US$0.19billion). Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals is the only local player to offer the entire selection of both prescription and non-prescription ophthalmology products for the treatment of dry eyes, conjunctivitis and other ocular infections. Led by its flagship and best-selling non-prescription brand HyFresh that contributes to over 40% of the category's revenue, other leading prescription products in the market include Olopat, Loxtra and Xolamol. The Company is expected to maintain its stronghold with 13% of the new product pipeline planned for ophthalmology and a dedicated sterile manufacturing facility scheduled to open in Jeddah in 2022G. Among other core markets, Jamjoom pharmaceuticals is ranked third in Egypt with a share of 11.1% in a market estimated at SAR 0.45 billion (or US$0.12 billion) backed by a strong prescription portfolio and is the market leader in Iraq with a share of 18.8% in a market estimated at SAR 0.23 billion (or US$0.06 billion). Across both these markets and in the UAE where Jamjoom pharmaceuticals is placed in the top 10, strong sales force, marketing the products with key opinion leaders and reliable and consistent supplies differentiate Jamjoom pharmaceuticals from the other players. y Growing importance of skin health and hygiene coupled with rising disposable income is likely to drive demand for prescription dermatology products Dermatology was one of the few categories that remained largely unaffected by the pandemic. Demand for dermatology products continued to grow in line with supply levels as manufacturers and importers expanded their channels to include e-commerce and in-home delivery throughout the pandemic. The overall category across the key markets including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and UAE, grew by 5.9% to reach SAR4.8 billion (or US$1.3 billion) in 2021G. Dermatology treatment is increasingly becoming a supplementary treatment supporting skin related issues coming as a result of rising prevalence of other ailments such as diabetes, obesity, etc. Growing importance of skin health and hygiene, personal grooming and proactive prevention from skin infections is likely to drive a consistent growth of just over 8.7% to reach SAR7.4 billion (or US$2.0 billion). Medical products for the treatment of acne, scars, wounds and fungal infections are gaining traction. High barriers to entry for the medicinal dermatology products have enabled only certain companies to capture a significant share of the market. In addition to growing awareness of skin health and hygiene across markets, Saudi Arabia's plans to increase the share of female employment from 19.2% in 2020G to 35.0% in 2035G, is likely to result in higher disposable income with increased spending on skin care. This is likely to support consumer expenditure in this category since insurance acceptance for dermatology treatments continues to be limited. Jamjoom pharmaceuticals, ranked second with a market share of 6.7% in 2021G, specializes largely in production of topical corticosteroids used to treat eczema and psoriasis. With a dedicated business division for dermatology, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals presents a wide range of 15 products including anti-acne solutions, emollients and wound healing agents to support growth in Saudi Arabia. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals is the only player across all competitors to have a presence across all four key markets led mainly by their anti-inflammatory product, Elica-M used for treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, followed by anti-bacterial cream, Fusibact and Acretin used in treating acne vulgaris. With a dedicated sales force to educate physicians and key opinion leaders, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals aims to expand further across markets leveraging its strong portfolio of 15 products in the category.www.jamjoompharma.comxxiiiTable of Contents y Renewed interest in preventive health and government support for local manufacturers makes nutraceuticals a high potential segment across all the markets Young adults typically aged between 19 to 40 years, which form a majority of the population across all four markets are becoming increasingly health conscious especially after COVID-19, thereby resulting in a significant growth in demand for nutraceuticals including both vitamins and dietary supplements. Driven by this strong uptake, the four markets, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and UAE cumulatively registered a strong CAGR of 15.1% between 2019G-21G to reach SAR5.2 billion (or US$1.4 billion) in 2021G. Since the category thrives majorly on over-the counter non-prescription products, nutraceuticals are an intensely competitive category characterised by aggressive marketing and promotions. Younger consumers are drawing to this category in an effort to avoid or reduce the impact of lifestyle diseases. These include Vitamin C enhancement for general immunity, Vitamin D supplements to address Vitamin D deficiency, hormonal treatment for better reproductive health, multi-vitamins for improving stamina and general health, among others. Strong market opportunity for nutraceuticals resulted in increasing local production of this category particularly in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. This has encouraged companies like Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals in Saudi Arabia and Nehrdou International in Egypt to invest in manufacturing of these products to reduce dependency on global brands sold by GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer, Vitabiotics, among others. In Saudi Arabia, Jamjoom pharmaceuticals was the first local manufacturer to enter and develop this category. The Company had a share of 5% and ranked third in the market sized at SAR1.7 billion (or US$0.45 billion) and is soon growing to become the market leader in the category as of mid-2022G. Aligned with the global trends, Jamjoom pharmaceuticals has invested in timely research and development to launch JP Vitamin D3 and Prima D3 as soft gels in 2015G and 2019G respectively, when the market only provided liquid products. This was further expanded to now provide a full suite of Vitamin D products that helped the company emerge as the market leader in Vitamin D subcategory and achieve a growth of 19% CAGR for its nutraceuticals portfolio for the period, 2017G-21G. Leveraging their brand through Omega-3 and Vitamin D3 and the soft-gel manufacturing facility, the Company launched Ashwaq entering the stress management category in 2021G, and Melatonin 5mg to treat sleep disorders. With 16% of its product pipeline estimated for new products in Nutraceuticals, the company holds a strong position to become a leader in the cosmetics market in the Kingdom, while expanding its reach to other markets. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals also aims to leverage its strong portfolio of over 40 brands to strategically penetrate other core markets including Egypt, Iraq and UAE to become a leading nutraceuticals brand in the region. y Growing proliferation of generics results in a mature but fragmented environment for diverse generics across major markets The market for general medicines in all the four countries consolidated is mature and grew by a meagre 2.9% CAGR during the period, 2019G-21G to reach SAR26.0 billion (or US$6.9 billion). With an increasing pressure for local production and introduction of generics, there are multiple products available for each sub-category across all the four markets. This resulted in a fragmented market landscape across the four markets with the top 5 players together not contributing more than 50% of the overall pharmaceutical market in any country. Driven by increasing prevalence of chronic and lifestyle diseases and a strong penetration of non-prescription products, general medicine, as a category, is expected to continue growing steadily at a CAGR of 2.4% to reach SAR29.2 billion (or US$7.8 billion) by 2026G. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals has a strong portfolio of 15 products across various applications such as anti-histamines, analgesics, anti-virals and muscle relaxants. In Saudi Arabia, as one of the leading local manufacturers of general medicine, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals reported a market share of 2.1% in the category sized at SAR10 billion (or US$2.7 billion) with over 70% of the revenues coming from prescription products. Prima D3 a Vitamin D3 prescription supplement, Azi-Once - a broad spectrum antibiotic and Relaxon - an analgesic, are the best-selling products both in Saudi Arabia and in other core markets. Jamjoom pharmaceuticals aims to expand its penetration in this category with 7% of its planned product pipeline from general medicines. y Rise in penetration of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, etc are increasingly requiring supplementary treatment with gastrointestinal drugs Gastrointestinal drugs recorded a CAGR of 9.5% to reach SAR5.3 billion (or US$1.4 billion) in 2021G driven by a combination of unhealthy eating habits that ensued during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and by patients with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, obesity, ulcer and heart-related issues. The category is expected to grow at a rate of 7.3% from 2021G to reach SAR7.6 billion (or US$2 billion) by 2026G. New product launches specifically in acid neutralizers and proton pump inhibitors alongside rising side effects of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, etc, and rising geriatric population which is susceptible to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ulcerative colitis are likely to drivee growth of gastrointestinal products. While global players like AstraZeneca Group Plc and Acino Pharma Ag have a strong presence across most of these markets, there is a growing focus by the Governments to increase the role of local and regional players like Julphar Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries and Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals who have established a stronghold in the region by working with a large network of medical representatives to create a positive perception among key opinion leaders in the industry. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals ranked 4th in the category sized SAR1.8 billion (US$0.5 billion) led mainly by anti-emetic products that prevent nausea namely Zoron and Dompy. Launched in 2019G, Zoron got established as a go-to-product for anti-emetics both through retail and institutional sales. This helped the company secure an order with NUPCO for Zoron in 2020G. This is also followed by acid-regulating Aciloc which helps in reducing indigestion. With price reductions implemented by SFDA, the company registered strong volume sales showing the quality of Aciloc in Saudi Arabia. The company aims to leverage the success of these products and planned new products contributing to 13% of the planned pipeline, to penetrate its other core markets including Egypt, Iraq and UAE in the forecast period.www.jamjoompharma.comxxivTable of Contents y Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals are adopting a holistic strategy to expand across categories and regions The company currently has a portfolio of over 100 brands sold in various capacities across 36 countries in the Middle East African region.

Risk Factors Prospective Subscribers should carefully consider the following risk factors, along with the other information contained in this Prospectus, prior to making an investment decision with respect to the Offer Shares. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that the Company currently believes may affect it and any investment in the Offer Shares. However, the risks listed below do not necessarily constitute all risks affecting the Company or associated with an investment in the Offer Shares. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that the Directors currently are not aware of or that the Directors currently believe are immaterial. The occurrence of any such risks and uncertainties may materially or adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects. As a result of such risks, the price of the Shares may decline, the Company's ability to pay dividends may be impaired, and investors may lose all, or part of, their investment. The Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects may be materially or adversely affected, and the Company may not be able to pay dividends, the price of Shares may decline, and investors may lose all, or part of, their investment, if any of the risks referred to below or any other risks not identified by Directors, or that are not material at the present time are realized or become material. As a result of these risks and other factors that may affect the Company's business, the expected events and circumstances in the future that have been presented in this Prospectus may not happen in the way expected by the Company or the Directors, or they may not happen at all. Consequently, investors should consider all future statements contained in this Prospectus in light of this interpretation and not rely on these statements without verifying them (for more information, please refer to the Section( \"Important Notice\") on page i of this Prospectus). Moreover, the Board of Directors confirm that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no other material risks as at the date of this Prospectus - other than as disclosed in this Section - that may affect investors' decisions to invest in the Offer Shares. All prospective investors willing to subscribe to the Offer Shares should conduct an assessment of the risks related to the Company's Offer Shares and the Offering in general and the economic and regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Investment in the Offer Shares is only suitable for investors who are capable of evaluating the investment risks and merits, and who have sufficient resources to bear any loss which might result from such investment. Prospective Investors who have doubts about which actions to take should seek the advice of a financial advisor duly licensed by the CMA regarding investing in the Offer Shares. The risks stated below are not arranged in order of importance or expected impact on the Company. Other risks unknown to the Company may also occur, or risks which the Company considers immaterial at the present time may have the same effects or consequences mentioned in this Prospectus. Accordingly, the risks described in this Section or in any other section of this Prospectus may not: (a) include all risks that might affect the Company or its operations, activities, assets, or the markets in which it operates, or (b) include all of the risks relating to investment in the Offer Shares. 2.1 Risks Related to the Company's Operations 2.1.1 Risks relating to the Company's supply chain The Company's ability to develop and produce approved pharmaceutical products depends on its ability to procure APIs and other raw materials required for the production process and special packaging materials from sources approved by the SFDA and other competent regulatory authorities, including those in the countries where the Company's products are sold. While the Company uses a variety of raw materials to manufacture its products, APIs remain the most important component. The global pharmaceutical business is characterized by a limited number of certain API suppliers; accordingly, it is not uncommon for APIs to be supplied by either a single supplier, or a limited number of suppliers. Whilst the Company endeavours to maintain more than one qualified supplier for most of its products, this is not always possible. A significant portion of the Company's raw materials come from a relatively small number of suppliers. As at Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, the Company's top 10 Key Suppliers (in terms of purchase value) for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G represented 28.2%, 27.8%, 42.0% and 32.4% of the Company's total purchase volume, respectively. If any suppliers were to terminate or fail to renew its supply agreement with the Company, or renew it on less favorable terms for the Company, the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects could be adversely and negatively affected. The Company uses a variety of methods to ensure it can regulate the supply of APIs it needs for production, including careful selection of, and building long-term mutually beneficial relationships with, the API suppliers and the use of exclusive supply contracts, partnerships. Notwithstanding these efforts, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain adequate levels of API supplies in the future. The Company's API suppliers are subject to regular inspections by competent, regulatory authorities. Whenever the Company is required to switch to a different supplier (e.g. because a supplier is found to be in breach of the applicable regulations, terminates its contract with the Company or otherwise), any such new supplier must be approved by the competent regulatory authority. Whilst the Company aims to have more than one API supplier in respect of the key products, the procedure for approving a new API supplier is lengthy and, in certain cases, may take approximately twelve (12) months. In addition, in some cases, the Company may deal with suppliers only indirectly www.jamjoompharma.com7Table of Contents through agents, which may make it difficult to continue to source such materials in the event that such agents cease to do business, or decline to continue a business relationship with the Company. In addition, the Company has not entered into supply agreements with two of its Key Suppliers, as it only purchases raw materials from them based on purchase orders and invoices. Therefore, it may be difficult for the Company to ensure the continuity of the business with these suppliers as the Company's business may be adversely impacted in the event that any of these Key Suppliers terminated their business with the Company in the future or reduced the quantity of the materials supplied to the Company as a result of the lack of available supply of any product or a change in the supplier's strategy or for any other reason. Any of these factors may, lead to disruption of the Company's supply of active pharmaceuticals ingredients and other raw materials, which may lead to a decrease in the Company's sales and its inability to launch new products in the market, and consequently a decrease in the Company's revenues and market share. The COVID-19 pandemic and responses to curtail the pandemic have disrupted global supply chains, including the Company's supply chain. These disruptions included reductions in the availability of raw materials caused by reduced supplier output from COVID-19 related shutdowns, which resulted in a large increase in backlogs of orders with ensuing logistical bottlenecks, as well as cost increases in raw materials and finished products at the supplier level and increases in logistics costs. This has resulted in lengthier sourcing periods for APIs and significant increases in costs of raw materials and shipping for the Company. In addition, the Company imports APIs or other raw materials, that are subject to customs and other government clearance and duties and regulation by their countries of origin. The Company currently enjoys certain customs exemptions, but there is no guarantee that such exemptions will not be canceled in the future. Furthermore, the government may impose additional customs and duties on the Company in the future. Accordingly, any imported shipment of APIs or other raw materials may be affected by factors beyond the Company's control and that are difficult to predict, such as the imposition of new or different duties or customs on the Company or political instability and currency fluctuations. In addition, it is possible that the prices of APIs may fluctuate sharply over time. Should any of the risks described above materialize, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.2 Risks related to concentration of sales among a limited number of distributors A significant portion of the Company's sales have historically been made to a relatively small number of distributors, who in turn sell the Company's products to pharmacies, customers, hospitals and governmental agencies. In the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G, and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, 68.1%, 81.1%, 80.7%, and 78.4%, respectively, of the Company's total sales were made to its top 5 distributors, and 37.3%, 43.5%, 37.2%, and 38.9%, respectively, of total sales in those periods were made to a single distributor, JMS, which is a related party (see Section 2.1.18 (\"Risks related to the Company's Related Party Transactions\" of this Prospectus). If Jamjoom Medicine Store, or if any of the Company's other significant distributors in its key markets (or any sub-agents of such distributors) encounters financial or other difficulties, it may decrease the amount of business that such distributors do with the Company, and the Company may be unable to collect the amounts that these distributors owe it on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, the concentration of wholesale distributors through mergers and acquisitions may also result in such distributors gaining additional purchasing leverage, which may increase pricing pressure on the Company's products. Such credit concentration risks and pricing pressure would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.3 Risks related to the Company's strategy The Company's future performance depends on its ability to implement its strategy as highlighted in page xxiii, xxiv and xxv (\"The Company's Strategy\") of this Prospectus. Under its current strategy and as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company's strategy includes selective expansion to achieve growth in its key markets, strengthening its presence in the local market, expanding its product portfolio through its R&D efforts in existing and new therapeutic segments, effective operational leadership, strong governance, and talent development, nurturing, and retention. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in implementing its expansion strategy in jurisdictions outside of Saudi Arabia. In particular, any international expansion of the Company's operations will depend on several factors, including the Company's ability to expand into and operate successfully in new jurisdictions, in respect of which the Company may not be familiar enough with the business cultures, local laws, regulations or customs. The successful implementation of the Company's plans will also depend on several other factors including, most importantly, the following: y the Company's ability to successfully expand its existing preparation portfolio as well as expanding into new preparation segments that successfully meet demand while enhancing revenue and profitability; y the competition that the Company faces from incumbent and new players in its existing and new product segments; y the Company's ability to seamlessly adapt and cater to evolving trends in the pharmaceutical industry, new marketing strategies, and new business models; y the Company's ability to maintain its relationships with local and international key suppliers and distributors and its ability to negotiate and reach acceptable terms; y the Company's ability to successfully identify and subsequently integrate any newly acquired businesses from future acquisitions while preserving the Company's operations and culture; www.jamjoompharma.com8Table of Contents y the Company's ability to hire, train and retain skilled personnel and employees; y the effectiveness of the Company and its marketing and sales campaigns; y the availability of sufficient financing (including through the Company's existing cash resources) on acceptable terms; y the Company's ability to monitor new operations, control costs and maintain effective quality and service control; y government restrictions, including movement of goods, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other causes, that may disrupt the Company's ability to import raw materials and export and distribute its products in its key markets; y introduction of additional government custom duties on raw materials or supplies imported by the Company; and y unfavorable economic, regulatory (including potential regulatory restrictions on products relevant to the Company), and market conditions, which are outside of the Company's control. As a result of the above factors, the Company's revenues may not grow at the same rate as in the past, or the Company may incur costs without benefiting from the expected revenues of expansion plans. Accordingly, the Company's results of operations may be negatively affected if any of these factors occurs. There can be no assurance that the Company's product expansion strategy will be profitable or will achieve its projected investment returns. Furthermore, the Company's business has become increasingly complex in terms of both type and scale. Any future expansion may increase the complexity of its operations and place a significant strain on its managerial, operational, financial and human resources. The Company's current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support its future operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively manage its growth or to implement all these systems, procedures and control measures successfully. If the Company is unable to manage its growth effectively, its business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. Any of these factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.4 Risks related to the impact of increasing costs and operating expenses on the Company's business The Company's operating expenses could increase as a result of a number of factors (for more information about the Company's financial and operational performance, see Section 6 (\"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Operating Results\") of this Prospectus), particularly increases in the wholesale cost of raw material and products ordered from suppliers and labor costs. Raw materials and consumables costs comprised 36.0%, 34.8%, 27.0% and 29.7% for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G, and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. Whereas salaries and employee-related costs (excluding such costs charged to cost of revenue) comprised 12.9%, 15.0%, 17.9%, and 16.3%, of the Company's revenue for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G, and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. Prolonged periods of cost inflation may also have a negative impact on the Company's profit margins and earnings to the extent such cost increases are not translated into increase in prices. Many of the countries from which the Company sources its raw materials, including Saudi Arabia, like many other jurisdictions and economic regions, are experiencing an acceleration and increase in inflation, which has resulted in significant increases in costs of raw materials and shipping for the Company. In addition, the price of fuel and utilities and labor cost have increased in recent years. In addition, any further increase in Saudization of the Company's workforce requirements may lead to an increase in the Company's operational expenditure (for more information, see Section 2.2.6 (\"Risks related to Saudization, non-Saudi employees, and other Labor Law requirements\") of this Prospectus). The Company's operating expenses and costs amounted to 33.9%, 33.9%, 39.3%, and 37.8% of the Company's total revenues for the financial years ended 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. Any increases in the Company's operating expenses and costs will also reduce its cash flow, profit margin and funds available to operate the Company's business and for future expansion. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.5 Risks associated with permits, licenses and approvals necessary for the Company's business The Company is required to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory permits, licenses and approvals from relevant government authorities in each country in which it operates for its business operations and activities. In Saudi Arabia, these permits, licenses and approvals include, but are not limited to, commercial registration certificates for the Company issued by the MoC, industrial and operational licenses issued by Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (Modon), civil defense permits, membership certificates with the relevant chambers of commerce, trademark registration certificates, Saudization and General organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) certificates in each case relating to the business operations of the Company. In addition, as a pharmaceutical manufacturer in Saudi Arabia the Company is required to obtain various licenses issued by and registrations made with the SFDA including product licenses and a pharmaceutical products factory license. For further information, see Section 12.5 (\"Governmental Approvals, Licenses and Certificates\") of this Prospectus. In addition, the Company is subject to ongoing reviews and assessments by the SFDA. In Egypt, these licenses and approvals include factory and manufacturing licenses issued by the Industrial Development Authority and Egyptian Drug Authority, respectively. In order to operate a new branch, the Company must obtain various permits, licenses, certificates and other approvals from the relevant authorities. These include, commercial registration certificates, MOMRAH licenses and civil defense permits. Each approval is dependent on the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company could encounter problems in obtaining government approvals or fulfilling the www.jamjoompharma.com9Table of Contents conditions required for obtaining these approvals, or it may not be able to comply with new laws, regulations or policies that may come into effect from time to time with respect to the pharmaceutical products (medicine) sector in general or the particular processes with respect to the granting of approvals. The Company has obtained the required Commercial Registration certificates for four (4) of its branches. However, as at the date of this Prospectus, the Company has not obtained the commercial registration certificates for six (6) branches which are located in Khobar, Khamis Mushait, Al Ehsaa, Jizan, Al Madinah Al Munawarah and Makkah. For more details about the Commercial Registration certificates of the Company's branches, please refer to Table 12.3 (\"Details of Commercial Registration Certificates Obtained by the Company and its Subsidiaries\") of this Prospectus. Additionally, the Company did not obtain the MoMRAH licenses for any of its branches. For further details on the MoMRAH licenses obtained by the Company and its branches, please refer to Table 12.8 (\"Details of municipality licenses obtained by the Company's branches*\") of the Prospectus. Moreover, the Company has also not obtained the civil defense permits for any of its branches. For more details about the civil defense permits of the Company and its branches, please refer to Table 12.9 (\"Details of civil defence permits obtained by the Company's branches*\") of this Prospectus. Notably, the Company obtained registration certificates for its top 20 pharmaceutical products (medicine) (in terms of revenues for FY21G), except for one (1) expired product certificate. As the Company is in the process of renewing the registration certificate of one of such products with the SFDA, for more information about the top 20 products in terms in terms of revenue for the financial year 2021G, please see table 12.12 (\"Details of the SFDA Registration Certificates for the Company's Key Products\") of Section 12.5 (\"Governmental Approvals, Licenses and Certificates\") of this Prospectus. Most of the Company's existing licenses are subject to conditions under which they might be suspended or terminated if the Company fails to fulfil and abide by the underlying conditions. Moreover, when seeking to renew or amend the scope of a license, there is no guarantee that the concerned authority will renew or amend the license or that, if it does renew the license, no conditions will be imposed which would adversely affect the Company's performance. If the Company does not obtain, or is otherwise unable to renew, a license necessary for its operations in Saudi Arabia, or if any of its licenses expires or is suspended, or renewed under unfavorable conditions to the Company, or if the Company is unable to obtain additional licenses required in the future, the Company will be required to cease carrying on its business totally or partially or will be subject to fines issued by the relevant Saudi governmental authorities, including fines up to SAR 100,000 from the MOH, SAR 30,000 from the civil defense or SAR 5,000 from MOMRAH for each infringing location. Additionally, the Company may be subject to sanctions issued by the SFDA and by the National Center for Environmental Compliance, if it does not obtain an environmental license or permit, including fines up to SAR 20 million, or the suspension of the license or permit for a period not exceeding six months for each infringing location, or the cancellation of such license or permit. Similarly, failures to obtain or renew required licenses in Egypt or other relevant markets, or the expiry or suspension of existing licenses in other markets, may result in fines or suspensions of operations. This would interrupt or delay the Company's operations and cause the Company to incur additional costs, and would adversely and materially affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects. 2.1.6 Risks related to the regulatory requirements imposed by the SFDA and other regulators The Company is subject to comprehensive regulations, adhering to such provisions involves high costs, which evolve with time. These regulations, govern the approval, manufacturing, labelling, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products (medicine) in Saudi Arabia and other countries where the Company operates or sells its products. The Company conducts its business in the Middle East, Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States, each of which regulates differently the development, registration, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, processing, formulation, packaging, labelling, storage, marketing, record-keeping, post-launch monitoring, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of the Company's products. The regulations across these regions are fragmented and vary by country. In Saudi Arabia, the SFDA is the authority responsible for regulating, overseeing and controlling drugs, medical devices, food products, and cosmetics, imported or locally manufactured in Saudi Arabia. The Pharmaceutical and Herbal Establishments and Preparations Law, issued by Royal Decree no. M/108 dated 22/08/1440H and its implementing regulations govern the activities related to the manufacturing, storage and pricing of pharmaceutical products (drugs) and require that pharmaceutical manufacturers maintain a scientific office which is responsible for ensuring the compliance of the Company's products and marketing activities with SFDA regulations. The SFDA and regulatory bodies in the other jurisdictions where the Company operates rigorously monitor and enforce compliance by pharmaceutical companies with the relevant regulations. The Company's manufacturing operations in Saudi Arabia are subject to periodic inspections by the SFDA. Plant inspections are conducted to determine whether the methods used by the Company in, and facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of pharmaceutical products (medicine) conform to, and are operated and administered in conformity with, the relevant current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and other applicable regulations. Following these inspections, the relevant regulator may issue notices listing conditions that the inspectors believe may violate current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) or other applicable regulations, and warning letters that could cause the Company to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. In line with the SFDA's regulations, two of the Company's products, Zydac and Rabizol, have already been withdrawn from the markets in which they operate in (for more information about the Company's product recalls, please see Section 2.1.7 (\"Risks related to quality, adverse publicity or product recalls affecting the Company's products\") of this Prospectus. Should it fail to observe the SFDA's standards or the laws and regulations governing drugs pricing and storage, the Company could be subject to penalties, including a maximum fine of SAR 500,000, or the cancellation of the license granted thereto, both of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com10Table of Contents In addition, the Company is subject to a variety of anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations in the jurisdictions where it operates. Any violations of the relevant regulations by the Company's employees could seriously damage the Company's reputation and result in the Company's licenses and permits being revoked or suspended, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.7 Risks related to quality, adverse publicity or product recalls affecting the Company's products There can be no assurance that the Company's products will not become subject to previously unknown safety or efficacy concerns or unknown side effects. While the Company's products are subject to comprehensive clinical trials and rigorous statistical analysis during the development process prior to approval, there are limitations with regard to the design of such trials, including the limited number of patients enrolled in such trials, the limited time used to measure the efficacy of the product and the limited ability to perform long-term monitoring. In the event that such unanticipated side effects are discovered, the Company may be required to add descriptions of the side effects as \"precautions\" to the packaging of the Company's products, recall and terminate sales of products or conduct costly post-launch clinical studies. Furthermore, concerns of potential side effects could arise among consumers or medical professionals, and such concerns, whether justified or not, would have an adverse effect on sales of the Company's products and reputation. Concerns regarding the safety or efficacy of products manufactured or stored at the Company's facilities or the safety and quality of the Company's supply chain could cause the Company's customers to avoid purchasing certain products from the Company, or to seek alternative sources, even if the basis for the concern is outside of the Company's control. Adverse publicity about these concerns, whether or not ultimately based on factual assertions, and whether or not involving products sold by the Company, would discourage customers from buying the Company's products, which would harm the Company's reputation and have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects. In addition, the Company's operational controls and employee training may not be effective in product tampering and other product-related safety and shelf-life issues that may affect its operations. In addition, the products that the Company distributes may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if they are alleged to cause injury or illness or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to be in violation of governmental regulations. For example, in 2018G/2019G, there was a global recall of Ranitidine, an API used in the Company's Zydac product, which necessitated the Company's recall of Zydac at that time. Additionally, pursuant to an SFDA-issued decision, the Company had to withdraw its Rabizol product from the market in 2021G due to the lack of bioequivalence between such product and the reference drug. The Company may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that it considers do not meet its quality standards, whether for taste, appearance, or otherwise, in order to protect its brand and reputation. If there is any future product withdrawal that could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to the Company's reputation, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects may be materially adversely affected. Incidents related to the safety and quality of the products or ingredients displayed in the products may occur in the future, which may result in product liability claims, product recalls, negative publicity or fines, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.8 Risks related to product liability claims The Company may be subject to substantial product liability damages claims, settlements and awards for injuries allegedly caused by the use of its products, particularly given the widespread impact that prescription drugs may have on the health of large patient populations. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or their outcome, may be costly, may divert management's attention, and may adversely affect the Company's reputation and demand for the Company's products. Adverse publicity relating to the safety of a product or of other competing products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Litigation in certain jurisdictions is inherently unpredictable and can result in unexpectedly high awards of damages. The Company, in line with customary industry practices in the countries in which it does business, does not carry product liability insurance, and so would be unable to rely on insurance claims to offset losses resulting from an unfavorable outcome to a product liability claim. Substantial product liability claims that result in court decisions against the Company or in the settlement of proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, particularly where such circumstances are not covered by insurance. 2.1.9 Risks related to the failure of customers and other independent third parties to accept the Company's products The Company's ability to market its products successfully depends, in part, on the acceptance of products by independent third parties, including wholesalers, distributors, physicians, hospitals, medical centers, pharmacies, government institutions and other retailers, as well as end users of the Company's products. The Company relies to a significant extent on the strength of its brands and reputation and its acceptance by the third party agents and distributors, especially for the sale of its products in its markets outside Saudi Arabia. Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity campaigns concerning any of the Company's products or brands, or the brands of its in-licensed products, would have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians, managed care providers, pharmacies and other retailers and end users.www.jamjoompharma.com11Table of Contents In addition to the strength of its brand and reputation, acceptance of any of the Company's products among the medical community depends upon a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Company's control, including: y acceptance by payers, physicians, pharmacists and end-customers of each product as a safe and effective treatment; y the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments or alternative products for the same treatment, including numerous generic drug products that may have a lower price than the Company's products; y the safety and efficacy of the product; y the product's perceived advantages and disadvantages relative to competing products or treatments; and y the prevalence and severity of side effects. If the Company's products are approved by the regulatory authorities but do not achieve acceptance by independent third parties, the Company may be unable to generate any revenues ( or an adequate level of revenues) from these products to make them profitable. If the Company's products fail to maintain significant market acceptance, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.10 Risks related to the uncertainties associated with research and development for new pharmaceutical products The Company's ability to continue to grow its business depends significantly on the success of its research and development activities related to new products, both through the Company's in-house resources and through collaboration with third parties. For example, the Company is currently developing products for additional therapeutic segments such as anti-diabetics, which are very important in the markets in which the Company operates. However, research and development programs for new products by pharmaceutical companies are expensive and involve intensive preclinical testing and clinical trials in connection with a highly complex and lengthy regulatory approval process. The research and development process for a new pharmaceutical product can take three years or more from discovery to commercial launch. During each stage of the approval process and post-approval life cycle of the Company's products, there is a substantial risk that it will encounter serious obstacles including but not limited to the following: y unfavorable results from preclinical testing of a new compound; y difficulty enrolling patients in clinical trials, or delays or clinical trial holds at clinical trial sites; y delays in completing formulation and other testing and work necessary to support an application for regulatory approval; y adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns; y difficulty or delays in obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where the Company proposes to market such products, which could lead to loss of sales, loss of previous research and development expenditures and other sunk costs as well as the incurrence of additional costs; y the imposition of limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed, which could in turn restrict the Company's potential market for the drug; y difficulty in obtaining reimbursement at satisfactory rates for the Company's approved products from governments and insurers; y failure to enter into or implement successful alliances for the development and/or commercialization of products; y inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely or cost-efficient manner; y ongoing regulatory review of products and the Company as manufacturer following regulatory approval for and commercialization of a product, which could result in the discovery of previously unknown problems with the product or manufacturing process and lead to the imposition of restrictions or recalls, including withdrawal of the product from the market; and y the degree of market acceptance of any approved product candidate by the medical community, including physicians, healthcare professionals and patients, will depend on a number of factors, including relative convenience and ease of administration, the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects, availability of alternative treatments, pricing and the Company's sales and marketing strategy. As a result of the foregoing or other factors, the Company may decide to abandon the development of potential pipeline products in which the Company has invested significant resources, even where the product is in the late stages of development. Moreover, there can also be no assurance that the Company will be successful in bringing attractive new products to market. For example, there is no assurance that the Company's pipeline compounds will receive regulatory approval, become commercially successful or achieve satisfactory rates of reimbursement. As a result, the Company may be unable to earn returns on investments that it originally anticipated or at all, or may be forced to revise the Company's research and development strategy, and the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that new regulations raise the costs of obtaining and maintaining product authorizations, or limit the economic value of a new product to its originator, the Company's profitability and growth prospects could be diminished. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com12Table of Contents 2.1.11 Risks related to the complexity of manufacturing the Company's products The Company strives to deliver high quality pharmaceutical products to its customers. The manufacture of the Company's products is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirements governing their manufacture. The Company relies on complex machinery and information technology systems to support its manufacturing processes, as well as internal and external communications with respect to supplies, quality control and distribution. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials and environmental factors. If the problems are severe, the Company may be forced to temporarily suspend all or part of its production until the problems are rectified. Any such suspension is likely to result in increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to perform existing contracts, time spent investigating the cause, remedial costs and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. In addition, where problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, the Company may be forced to recall the product from the market. In certain cases, the Company may face product liability claims and incur respective costs. (For more details, please refer to Section 2.1.8 (Risks related to product liability claims\") of this Prospectus). The manufacture of the Company's products and product candidates is very demanding. Successful manufacturing of these types of products requires precise manufacturing process controls, raw materials that conform to very tight tolerances for specific characteristics and equipment that operates consistently within narrow performance ranges. Manufacturing complexities and testing requirements for such products increase the overall difficulty of manufacturing them and resolving manufacturing problems that the Company may encounter. The facilities used to manufacture the Company's products are subject to periodical inspections by the SFDA and other relevant regulatory authorities to assess compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. (For more details, please refer to Section 2.1.6 (\"Risks related to the regulatory requirements imposed by the SFDA and other regulators\") of this Prospectus). If the Company cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to the Company's specifications and the strict requirements of the relevant regulatory authorities, the Company will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for the Company's manufacturing facilities. If a regulatory authority does not approve a facility for the manufacture of the Company's products or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, or if the SFDA determines that any manufacturing facilities are not in compliance with cGMPs or other SFDA regulations, the Company may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities. The occurrence or suspected occurrence of production not in line with the Company's specifications or regulatory requirements can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases product recalls and enforcement action, with consequential damage to the Company's reputation and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause manufacturing delays, substantial expense, lost sales and the delay of new product launches. Any of the risks described above would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.12 Operational risks and unexpected interruptions to the Company's business The Company's success depends significantly on the continuous and smooth operation of its manufacturing facilities. The operation of the Company's manufacturing facilities is prone to a number of risks, including physical damage to buildings, power failures, disruption of medical equipment and devices, failure of information systems, mechanical failures, the possibility of work stoppages, criminal incidents, civil unrest, natural disasters, fires, operational errors, changes in governmental planning for the land underlying these facilities, or any disruption or delay in the ports or various shipping services in general. The occurrence of any of these or similar incidents would cause a significant disruption to the Company's business, which would affect adversely and materially the Company's business, results of operation, financial position, and prospects. Furthermore, the leases for the land on which the Company's manufacturing facilities are built could be challenged by third parties or government authorities, which may cause interruptions to the Company's business operations. In the event that its use of leased properties is successfully challenged, the Company may be subject to fines and forced to relocate the affected operations to alternate locations. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to maintain its existing leases or renew them on terms that are similar to those currently in force. The sites for the Sterile Facility in Jeddah and Jamjoom Pharma Academy are each subject to separate leases with the Saudi Industrial Property Authority, and the site of the Jeddah Main Facility in Jeddah is subject to three leases with the Saudi Industrial Property Authority. Each of these leases has a different duration, ranging from 13 to 20 years, and all of these leases are vital for the Company's ability to continue using its sites. If the Company is unable to renew such leases or otherwise such leases were terminated (for instance, if their validity were to be challenged), there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to find suitable replacement sites on terms acceptable to it on a timely basis, or at all, or that it would not be subject to material liability resulting from third parties' challenges on the Company's use of such properties. If there were significant interruptions of operations at one or more of manufacturing facilities, the Company's revenues and profitability will be affected, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com13Table of Contents 2.1.13 Risks related to cross border sales of products in foreign countries A significant portion of sales of the Company's pharmaceutical products (medicine) sales are outside of Saudi Arabia. As part of its business strategy and growth plan, the Company may plan to expand further its sales of products into more countries in Africa and other emerging markets, which will result in an increase in cross border sales and purchases. Cross border operations are subject to risks, including but not limited to: y inadequate protection of intellectual property; y currency exchange rate fluctuations or imposition of foreign exchange controls; y difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, regulations and treaties, some of which are subject to change; y legal uncertainties regarding, and timing delays associated with, customs procedures, tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other trade barriers; y differing local product preferences and product requirements; y increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts; y risk of loss at sea or other delays in the delivery of products caused by transportation problems; and y differing tax regimes. Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect the Company's operating results. Furthermore, economic sanctions and restrictions on exports and other transfers of goods have been implemented by the United States and the European Union in relation to certain countries in which the Company or its subsidiaries do business, including but not limited to Libya, Sudan and Syria. The United States and the European Union have also enacted sanctions that prohibit transactions by US or EU persons and entities involving certain specially designated individuals and entities from sanctioned countries or participating in sanctioned activities including, but not limited to, terrorism and drug trafficking. In addition, the United States, the European Union and certain other countries have recently implemented measures against Russia in connection with the continuing turmoil in Ukraine. These regulations and their enforcement could potentially affect the Company's sales in the affected countries and force it to change or abandon its growth plans. In addition, failure to comply with such regulations could result in significant fines, as well as reputational damage. Any of the foregoing would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.14 Risks related to Government restrictions on pricing Pharmaceutical products (medicine) are subject to price controls or pressures and other restrictions in Saudi Arabia. The SFDA intervenes directly in setting prices of pharmaceutical products (medicine), and has periodically changed the list of regulated reference prices and margins in the past. For example, in 2021G, the SFDA mandated reductions in the price of certain products, including some manufactured by the Company, following a review of global API prices and a market analysis relating to products classified as lifesaving or critical drugs. The decrease in sales of the Company's products, which prices have been revised as a result of the SFDA's request, amounted to SAR 781,000 between the financial years 2019G and 2020G and SAR 19.7 million Saudi Riyals between the financial years 2020G and 2021G. In addition, in some markets major purchasers of pharmaceutical products (whether government agencies, state-run enterprises such as the National Company for the Unified Procurement of Medicines, Devices and Medical Supplies in Saudi Arabia (\"NUPCO\"), or private healthcare providers) have the economic power to exert substantial pressure on prices or the terms of access to product formularies, and increases in sales to these entities may result in lower profit margins for the Company. The average time of the period starting from delivering the products to government customers (the various products related to the sales made to NUPCO up to collecting the debit balances is 8 months in the Six Month Period Ending on 30 June 2022G. It should be noted that the revenues generated from NUPCO accounted for 2.1%, 2.6%, 2.4% and 3.0% of the total revenues during the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. The Company's gross profit margin generated from NUPCO for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, represented 47.1%, 51.9%, 23.6%, and 25.9%, respectively. The profit margin generated from the National Company for NUPCO is less than the Company's total profit margin, as the profit margin related to the National Unified Purchase Company (NUPCO) reached 25.9% against 65.8% in general for the Six Month period Ended 30 June 2022G. The growth in the number of patients covered through large managed-care institutions may also increase pricing pressure on the Company's products. Changes to government reimbursement policies could also reduce the funding that healthcare service providers have available for diagnostic and pharmaceutical product expenditures, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company's sales and profit margins. The Company cannot predict whether existing controls will increase or new controls (or other restrictions or reforms) will be introduced that will reduce the Company's margins or adversely affect its ability to introduce new products profitably. Changes in the healthcare market would also force the Company to alter its approach to selling, marketing, distributing and servicing the Company's customer base. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com14Table of Contents 2.1.15 Risks related to patent infringement actions The Company could become involved in patent infringement actions by third parties and may have to defend against charges that the Company's products infringed patents or the proprietary rights of third parties. If the Company infringes the intellectual property rights of others, the Company could lose its right to develop, manufacture or sell products, including its generic products, or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Patent infringement claims may also result in the Company having to redesign, alter or delay the launch of new products, which would have a negative effect on the Company's revenue and profitability. In addition, the outcomes of patent infringement actions are uncertain and such infringement actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Any of these factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.16 Risks related to protecting certain trademarks on which the Company relies The Company has registered thirty-nine (39) trademarks relating to its top 20 products by sales revenue in 2021G in Saudi Arabia and other markets in which it sells its products. The Company's business relies on these trademarks, details of which are set out in Section 12.11.1 (\"Trademarks\") of this Prospectus. Notably, the Company has not registered trademarks for a number of its products, including four of its top 20 products by sales revenue in 2021G. Additionally, the Company has not renewed the expired registration certificates for seven (7) of its top 20 products by sales revenue in 2021G. In the event the Company is unable to register or renew its trademark certificates, or in the event a third party objected to the registration of a trademark, this would affect the Company's operations, financial condition and results of operation. The competitive position of the Company depends on its ability to continue using such trademarks and to protect its rights related to such trademarks against any illegal use of such trademarks by third parties. In the event the intellectual property rights related to the Company's trademarks are infringed, including as a result of unauthorized use or a failure to protect such rights by the competent authorities in accordance with the regulations of the relevant countries, it may face costly litigation and the diversion of technical and management personnel. Furthermore, the outcome of a dispute may require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. Any of the above would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.17 Risks related to maintaining the reputation of the \"Jamjoom Pharma\" brand The Company's success depends in part on its ability to maintain the image and reputation of the Jamjoom Pharma brand. Quality, health and safety issues, actual or perceived, are likely to damage the reputation of the Jamjoom Pharma brand, which could cause consumers to switch to competitors, resulting in a loss of customers and a decline in the Company's market share and revenues. The reputation of the Company's brand could be adversely affected as a result of any act by the Company in breach of quality, health, and safety standards imposed by regulatory authorities (for more details, please refer to Section 2.1.6 (\"Risks related to the regulatory requirements imposed by the SFDA and other regulators\") of this Prospectus). The Jamjoom Pharma brand may also be materially and adversely affected by factors beyond the Company's control, including lawsuits, regulatory investigations, fines and penalties against the Company, or otherwise relating to the products or services available on the Company's platform, or improper or illegal conduct by the Company's employees, suppliers, third-party merchants and other business partners, that is not authorized by the Company. Furthermore, adverse publicity campaigns (whether accurate or not) relating to activities by the Company's Board, Shareholders, Management, Related Parties, suppliers, employees, contractors or agents (such as quality control issues or non-compliance with laws and regulations) will tarnish the reputation of the Jamjoom Pharma brand. With the increase in the use of social media, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for the Company to effectively respond. In addition, counterfeit versions of the Company's products have appeared in some of the Company's markets, such as Egypt, and although the Company takes measures to protect its trademarks and brands, there can be no guarantee that it will be successful in stopping the circulation of counterfeit products, which may also damage the reputation of the Jamjoom Pharma brand. Any damage to the Company's brand names or reputation as a result of these or other factors may cause its products and services to be perceived unfavorably by consumers, third-party merchants, regulators, medical professionals and other business partners, which as a result would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.18 Risks related to the Company's Related Party Transactions The Company maintains ongoing and close business relationships with several Related Parties. In particular, the Company entered into contracts with Related Parties, including contracts for the distribution of the Company's products in Saudi Arabia, the supply of packaging materials and the provision of various services. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Company has eight current transactions with Related Parties, all of which were approved in the Extraordinary General Assembly meeting dated 18/12/1443H (corresponding to 17/07/2022G). The total value of transactions with Jamjoom Medicine Store (a branch of Abdullatif Mohammed Salah Jamjoom and Brothers Company) for the sale of products, allocation of commission, provision of logistic services, and payment of expenses amounted to SAR 369.7 million, SAR 463.3 million, SAR 392.0 million and SAR 275.9 million for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. The total value of sales made through Jamjoom Medicine Store amounted to SAR 272.6 million, SAR 350.2 million, SAR 273.9 million and SAR 187.4 million for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six-Month Period Ended 30 June www.jamjoompharma.com15Table of Contents 2022G, respectively. Additionally, these sales represented 37.3%, 43.5%, 37.2% and 38.9% of the Company's total sales the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six-Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. For further details, please refer to Section 2.1.2 (\"Risks related to concentration of sales among a limited number of distributors\") of this Prospectus. The Company entered into a distribution agreement with Jamjoom Medicine Store for a term of three Gregorian years starting from 7 August 2022G (automatically renewable for similar periods unless terminated by the Company or Jamjoom Medicine Store subject to not less than a six-month period written notice). Payment is made within 90 days from the date of receipt of the invoice by the Company. For further details on the distribution agreement entered into with Jamjoom Medicine Store, please refer to Section 12.6.1 (\"Key Distribution Agreements\") of this Prospectus. Jamjoom Medicine Store is a branch of Abdullatif Mohammed Salah Jamjoom and Brothers Company in which Yousuf Mohammed Salah Jamjoom, Mohammed Yousuf Mohammed Salah Jamjoom, Ahmed Yousuf Mohammed Mahmoud Mohammed Salah Jamjoom and Alaa Yousuf Mohammed Jamjoom. of Walid 5.83%, Mahmoud 2.92% in Abdullatif Mohammed Salah Jamjoom and Brothers Company. The total value of transactions with Tegan Al Fateh Factory Co. Ltd. (Jamjoom for printing and packaging) for the supply of packaging materials amounted to SAR 10.3 million, SAR 14.2 million, SAR 18.4 million, and SAR 8.9 million for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. There are a number of Related Party transactions that have not been subject to official contracts which are conducted on a purchase order basis. These undocumented related party transactions represent 2.7%, 0.8%, 1.9% and 1.1% of the total amount of transactions with related parties for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. The total value of transactions will all Related Parties amounted to SAR 395.6 million, SAR 487.9 million, SAR 427.4 million and SAR 289.0 million for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. For a summary of the Company's transactions with Related Parties, see Section 12.8 (\"Related Party Transactions\") of this Prospectus. As of the date of this Prospectus, all Related Party Transactions were on arm's length terms. However, the Company's agreement with Jamjoom Medicine Store (a branch of Abdullatif Mohammed Salah Jamjoom and Brothers Company) previously contained certain terms relating to commissions and payment terms which, in the Company's view, did not reflect arm's length terms and accordingly the Company has addressed this through an amendment to the terms of agreement. Accordingly, the members of the Board of Directors confirm following the amendment to the agreement made on 7 August 2022G, the agreement does not include any preferential terms and is considered to be on an arm's length terms. (for a summary of this agreement, see Section 12.8 \"Related Party Transactions\") of this Prospectus. To the extent that the Company enters into contracts with any Related Parties which are not on arm's-length terms and/or in the event such transactions grant undue benefits to Related Parties of the Company, this could negatively affect the Company's costs and revenues which would, in turn, adversely and materially affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to renew its contracts with such Related Parties when expired. If any such Related Parties do not renew the agreements entered into with the Company, or renew these agreements but under conditions that are not in line with the Company's objectives, this would adversely affect the Company's business. Under Article 71 of the Companies Law, those related party agreements, in which any Director is deemed to have an interest, will need to be approved by the General Assembly. It is also required that any Director and/or Shareholder of the Company, who is deemed to have an interest (such as a shareholder who has a representative Director on the Board), cannot participate in the approval process for such Related Party Transaction(s). If the contracts with Related Parties are not renewed when expired, the Board or General Assembly do not agree to renew these contracts, or otherwise the Related Parties do not agree to renew them under the current terms or under terms that are commercially viable to the Company, then the Company might not be able to enter into other contracts on the same terms or on terms favorable thereto. Any of these factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.19 Risks related to the outbreak of infectious diseases or other serious public health concerns, including the continuing global spread of COVID-19 The outbreak of an infectious disease, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), H1N1, SARS and, most recently, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the Middle East will have a materially negative impact on the Saudi economy and business operations of the Company. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, the Saudi Government implemented a range of precautionary containment measures in response to the outbreak, including travel restrictions or mandatory quarantine measures on international travelers and on residents within cities, regions or provinces of certain countries, and measures intended to protect supplies of pharmaceuticals within the country as a national security issue, including a six month prohibition on the export of pharmaceuticals in the first half of 2020G. These measures directly affected the Company's business. The six month prohibition on pharmaceutical exports in early 2020G resulted in a loss of business in the Company's international markets, as many of the Company's customers in those markets found other suppliers during the period that the Company was unable to ship its products from the manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia to those markets. In addition, COVID-19 related supply chain interruptions and bottlenecks have resulted in lengthier sourcing periods for APIs and significant increases in costs of raw materials and shipping for the Company. The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in an increase of costs incurred in procuring personal protective equipment used in the Company, such as masks, gloves, sanitizers and other relevant measures. The www.jamjoompharma.com16Table of Contents procurement cost of masks, sterilizers and gloves amounted to SAR 595,000 and SAR 218,000 in the financial years 2020G and 2021G, respectively. For further information, please refer to subsection 6.4.1 (\"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business\") under Section 6 (\"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Operating Results\") of this Prospectus). The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in other effects such as the grant of free interest loans to employees during the COVID-19 period, increase in the cost of transportation/logistics due to the supply chain challenges, decrease in the promotional and marketing activities during the COVID-19 period attributable to the mandated lockdowns and other restrictions imposed by the government, decrease in travel and communication expenses attributable to the decrease in employee travel on the back of the restrictions imposed by the government, delays in ongoing construction projects mainly attributable to the temporary closure of sites during the lockdown period as well as delay in receiving construction materials. In the event that there was a further increase in the spread of COVID-19, it is difficult to estimate the potential impact that this might have on the economy of the Company's key markets and the business operations of the Company, and could make the Company vulnerable to risks of business interruption. In addition, the supply of certain international raw materials and other products purchased by the Company, or the ability of the Company to export its products to other markets, could be suspended, delayed or otherwise adversely affected. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any containment measures (such as those outlined above) would be effective in stopping or curtailing future outbreaks in Saudi Arabia or the Company's other key markets. Moreover, it is likely that any containment measures (such as those outlined above) will have a material and adverse effect on the Saudi economy and investor and business confidence to an extent difficult to predict. This would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.20 Risks related to the Company's reliance on its senior Management and key personnel The Company's success depends upon the continued service and performance of its senior Management and other key personnel, as well as its ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future. The Company devoted considerable efforts to the development of its senior Management team, all but two of which have been appointed over the past two years. The Company relies on a number of key individuals in its senior Management team, who have valuable experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector and who have made substantial contributions to the development of the Company's operations and expansion. Competition for senior Management and key employees in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector is intense, and the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to retain its personnel or attract new, suitably qualified personnel, or that key personnel, including those recently appointed, will not leave the Company to engage in businesses similar to or competing with the Company's business. The Company may need to invest significant financial and human resources to attract and retain new senior Management members and/ or employees. The loss of the services of members of the Company's senior Management or key employees could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of its strategic objectives, divert Management's attention to seeking certain qualified replacements or adversely affect its ability to manage its business effectively. Each member of senior Management, as well as key employees, may resign at any time. If the Company loses the ability to hire and retain key senior Management and employees with high levels of skills in appropriate domains, this would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects. 2.1.21 Risks related to the Company's implementation of a newly adopted corporate governance manual The Board approved a corporate governance manual on 01/03/1444H (corresponding to 27/09/2022G), which includes rules and procedures related to corporate governance derived from the Corporate Governance Regulations issued by the CMA. The Company's success in properly implementing the corporate governance rules and procedures will depend on the extent of the comprehension and understanding of these rules as well as the proper execution of such rules and procedures by the Board, its committees and Senior Executives, especially with regards to the formation of the Board and its committees, independence requirements, as well as rules related to conflict of interests and Related Party Transactions. Article 23 of the Corporate Governance Regulations also requires the adoption of a written and detailed policy, defining the powers delegated to the executive management, and a table clarifying such powers. On 20/03/1444H (corresponding to 16/01/2022G), the Board of Directors approved the authority tables governing the specialization and delegation of powers and authorities between the Board and the Senior Executives. Failure to comply with the governance rules, especially the mandatory rules derived from the Corporate Governance Regulations issued by the CMA, would subject the Company to regulatory penalties. The Company's Extraordinary General Assembly approved the charters of the Board committees on 18/12/1443H (corresponding to 17/07/2022G), which were approved by the Board on 01/03/1444H (corresponding to 27/09/2022G). On 11/01/1444H (corresponding to 09/08/2022G), the General Assembly appointed the Audit Committee, which consisted of three (3) members, including one (1) non-executive and independent member and two (2) members from outside the Board. The Board of Directors formed the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. For further details, please see Section 5.2 (\"Company and Board Committees\") of this Prospectus. Failure by members of these committees to perform their duties and adopt a work approach that ensures protection of the interest of the Company and its Shareholders may affect corporate governance compliance, the continuous disclosure requirements, and the Board's ability to monitor the Company's business through these committees. Any future inability of such committee members and independent members to carry out the tasks assigned thereto and follow a work methodology that ensures the protection of the interests of the Company and the Shareholders may affect the implementation of Governance Regulations and the efficiency of the Company's Board of Directors control over the management of its business through www.jamjoompharma.com17Table of Contents such committees. This may expose the Company to potential non-compliance with continuous disclosures after listing requirements on the one hand, and to operational, administrative and financial risks on the other hand. Any of these factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.22 Risks related to Management's lack of experience in managing a publicly listed company The Senior Executives have limited or no experience in managing a public listed joint-stock company in Saudi Arabia and complying with the laws and regulations pertaining to such companies. In particular, the internal and/or external training that the Senior Executives will receive in managing a Saudi Arabian publicly listed company, coupled with the regulatory oversight and reporting obligations imposed on public companies, will require substantial attention from the Senior Executives, which may divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of the Company. Non-compliance in a timely manner with the regulations and disclosure requirements imposed on listed companies will expose the Company to regulatory sanctions and fines. The imposition of fines on the Company would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.23 Risks related to the adequacy of insurance coverage The Company maintains insurance policies covering all risk property, theft of cash amounts, electronic equipment and data processing, goods in transit, marine open cargo, motor and group medical expenses insurance (for more information about insurance policies maintained by the Company, please refer to Section 12.10 (\"Insurance\") of this Prospectus. There is no guarantee that these insurance policies will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances, or that the limit of insurance coverage will be sufficient in all events to pay for the claims relating to the insured risks. The Company might not be able to successfully substantiate its claim with regard to a certain liability or loss according to the insurance policies in effect because of the exclusions or conditions of insurance coverage, or if the Company has not met certain insurance criteria in respect of a particular claim. This could cause the Company to be liable for paying for accident related losses. Future events might occur for which the Company might not have adequate insurance coverage to cover all potential losses, or might not be insured against it at all, such as risks resulting from acts of aggression, political risks, war and sabotage. In addition, the Company's present insurance policies contain coverage exclusions or limitations. The current insurance policies might also be unavailable in the future. Accordingly, the losses and liabilities resulting from entirely uninsured or insufficiently insured risks could significantly increase the Company's costs, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial position and share price, and would also have a material adverse effect on Subscribers' anticipated returns, or result in the loss of all or a portion of their investment in the Company. 2.1.24 Risks related to interruptions in the Company's information systems The Company's operations, including research, development, manufacturing, accounting, storage and delivery, are highly dependent on its information technology systems. The Company depends on these systems to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of a high number of inventory items to and from the Company's facilities and to manage the accurate accounting and payment to and from suppliers and customers. External and internal risks, such as malware, code anomalies, attempts to penetrate the Company's networks, unavailability of required updates or modifications, data leakage and human error all pose a direct threat to the Company's services and data. The Company's networks may also be subject to interruption due to unforeseen \"force majeure\" events or power outages. These types of adverse events could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Company and customer information is compromised due to a data loss by the Company or a trusted third party. Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further upgrades to the Company's IT systems and networks, and data or system protection measures, whether due to expansion, upgrades, new technology, new laws and regulations, or otherwise, could be significant. In addition, the Company's IT systems need regular upgrading to accommodate expansion of the Company's business and maintain the efficiency of its operations. If the Company faces a breakdown in its systems, it could experience significant business and operational delays across its businesses. In particular, any breakdown in the Company's IT systems could result in disruptions of the Company's research, development, manufacturing, accounting and billing processes. The Company's facilities and systems, or those of third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism or sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, loss or corruption of data or programming or human errors or other similar events. Because such attacks are increasing in sophistication and change frequently in nature, the Company and its third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these attacks or implement adequate preventative measures, and any compromise of the Company's systems, or those of its third-party service providers, may not be discovered and remediated promptly, which could result in a loss of data. A security breach, act of cyber terrorism or sabotage, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, loss or corruption of data or programming or human error made by the Company's employees may lead to a breach of consumers, employees' and customers' data privacy and security. Any such breach may result in a divulgence of such data to third parties against the will of all affected parties, which could undermine the privacy of such parties and result in reputational harm to the Company. In addition, this could adversely affect the Company's performance due to judicial proceedings or claims initiated against the Company in case it defaulted in preserving the safety and confidentiality of data and in ensuring compliance with the relevant controls on disclosing data in an accurate and timely manner via the appropriate channels. Any such breach or other similar event may also lead to a change of current and potential customer behavior in a way that would impact the Company's ability to retain current customers or attract new customers, which would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, internal operations (e.g. logistics, inventory and management), results of operation, and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com18Table of Contents Any disruption to the internet or the Company's IT systems and/or technology infrastructure, including those impacting the Company's computer systems, or the occurrence of any of the aforementioned risks, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.25 Risks related to litigation involving the Company The Company, its Directors or officers may become involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions with parties including suppliers, employees, competitors, regulatory authorities, consumers or owners of lands leased to the Company for its operations. Any unfavorable outcome in any litigation or regulatory proceedings involving the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, these proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that the Company devote substantial resources to defend against these claims, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.26 Risks related to Zakat From its formation until the financial year 2021G, the Company and its subsidiary filed their Zakat declarations on a consolidated basis and paid related liabilities when due. The Company obtained the final Zakat assessments from ZATCA for the date of its formation to 2018G, and obtained as well the final Zakat certifications for the years 2019G, 2020G, and 2021G. Apart from the abovementioned Zakat assessments, ZATCA has not issued the Company any Zakat assessments for the years 2019G to 2021G, which are currently still under review. ZATCA could revisit any previous year, up to five (5) years in the past, in case it has not issued a Zakat assessment for the year revisited, and may challenge the declarations submitted, pursuant to the Implementing Regulations for Collecting Zakat Amounts promulgated by Ministerial Resolution No. 2217 dated 07/07/1440H (corresponding to 14/03/2019G), which could entail requiring the Company to pay additional Zakat amounts to cover any additional Zakat liabilities. Therefore, any additional Zakat liabilities uncovered in ZATCA's assessment of the Company's Zakat dues would adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects. Additionally, in accordance with accounting laws, the Company has set aside a Zakat provision to cover in Zakat assessments issued by ZATCA. This provision has been set aside in accordance with ZATCA's laws and directives, and amounted to SAR 17.1 million, SAR 20.4 million, SAR 18.7 million and SAR 11.1 million as at the financial years ended 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. If the Zakat provision is not sufficient to meet any additional Zakat liabilities that may be imposed by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority, that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.27 Risks related to the potential misconduct of its third-party agents The Company relies extensively on third-party distributors and other agents for the marketing and distribution of its products in certain markets. Some of these third parties are small scale entities and do not have internal compliance resources. In some emerging growth markets, specific regulations regarding the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products (medicines) either do not exist or are still being developed, which may result in legal uncertainty and the inconsistent application of existing laws and regulations. In addition, corruption is commonplace in a number of these countries. If the Company fails in its efforts to screen third-party agents and detect cases of potential misconduct, the Company could be held responsible for the non-compliance by these third parties with applicable laws and regulations, which would adversely affect the Company's reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.1.28 Risks related to the Company's current financing arrangements The Company has entered into a loan agreement with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (\"SIDF\") dated 04/09/2022G for an amount of SAR 113,500,000 (the \"SIDF Facility for the year 2022G\"). The SIDF Facility for the year 2022G contains provisions that restrict the Company's ability to make changes in its ownership or control structure. As such, on 29/03/1444H (corresponding to 25/10/2022G), the Company obtained the non-objection of the SIDF to proceed with the procedures to submit the application to the CMA and the relevant authorities for the conversion of the Company to a public joint stock company, complete the legal procedures, obtain the necessary approvals and satisfy the requirements of listing and offering the shares. It should be noted that the SIDF Facility for the year 2022G provides that the Company undertakes to submit a mortgage over the assets, buildings, machinery and equipment related to the financed project in the event any amounts are withdrawn from the facility. In addition, the SIDF Facility for the year 2022G provides that the Company undertakes to submit a promissory note and any additional securities as requested from SIDF from time to time. As of the date of this Prospectus, no amounts have been withdrawn from the facility and as such no mortgage has been provided over buildings, assets, machinery and equipment of the Company. Accordingly, in the event of a breach of the provision of any of the aforementioned securities for the purpose of the SIDF Facility for the year 2022G and the terms of this facility, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund shall have the right to implement on the assets, which could negatively affect the Company's business, financial position, results of operations and future prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com19Table of Contents 2.1.29 Risks related to Bank Guarantees provided on the Company's behalf by the Shareholders The Company's obligation under the Facility of the SIDF Facility for the year 2022G are secured by a personal guarantee provided by each of Yousuf Mohammed Salah Jamjoom (for 100% of the facility amount), Walid Yousuf Mohammed Jamjoom (for 6.5% of the facility amount), Mohammad Yousuf Mohammed Jamjoom (6.5% of the facility amount), Ahmed Yousuf Mohammed Jamjoom (6.5% of the facility amount) and Mahmoud Yousuf Mohammed Jamjoom (8% of the facility amount), which collectively reached a total of SAR 113,500,0000. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (\"SIDF\") did not waive the personal guarantees provided by these shareholders. If, after the Offering, the Company is unable to cancel the guarantees provided by these shareholders, then they will remain in force and the breaches related to the shareholders will continue to apply. In the event that any or all of the Guarantors withdraw or do not renew its guarantees (when requested by the SIDF), or if such guarantees become invalid for any reason, and the SIDF does not agree to allow the Company to provide alternative guarantees (such as mortgaging assets or other guarantees banks typically accept from listed joint-stock companies in lieu of the shareholders' guarantees)this may be construed by the SIDF as a breach by the Company under the SIDF Facility for the year 2022G, which may result in demanding immediate repayment of the amounts owing. In such a case, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient alternative sources of financing to repay these debts. Any of these factors would have an adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial position and prospects. 2.1.30 Risks related to the Company's Land Title The Company acquired a land in Egypt to build the Egypt Main Facility, however, it does not currently hold a title deed to the land. The Company is in the process of applying for the title deed. As of 30 June 2022G, the total costs of establishing the Egypt Main Facility amounted to SAR 183.8 million, which have been fully financed in cash by the Company (for further information on the Egypt Main Facility, please refer to Section 4.9.3.2.4 (\"Egypt Main Facility\") of this Prospectus). The Company's right to transfer its interest in the land or the building for such land may be limited as a result of the absence of formal title deed. Accordingly, any failure in obtaining a formal title deed would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects (for further information on the properties owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, please refer to Section 12.7 (\"Properties owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries\") of this Prospectus). 2.1.31 Risks related to the Conversion of the loan extended to the Company's Egyptian Subsidiary into a subordinated instrument In the fourth quarter of 2022G, the Company converted the loan that it had previously extended to its Subsidiary in Egypt (Al Jamjoom for Pharmaceutical Industries) into a \"Subordinated Perpetual Instrument\" , as the full amount of the outstanding loan will be converted into an investment in equity repayable at a future date determined at the discretion of the Subsidiary. As a result of the conversion, future exchange gains or losses on this financial instrument will be recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (which were previously recorded in the Statement of Profit or Loss). Furthermore, the Egyptian Pound further devalued in October 2022G and January 2023G, which is likely to result in further currency-exchange-related losses for the last quarter of 2022G and may result in additional currency-exchange-related losses in 2023G (for further details on the conversion of the loan, please see Sub Section 6.8.2.5 (\"Shareholders' equity\") of this Prospectus; and for further details on the risks related to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates, please see Section 2.2.3 (\"Financial risks related to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates\") of this Prospectus). In the event the Company's Subsidiary in Egypt (Al Jamjoom for Pharmaceutical Industries) undergoes liquidation, bankruptcy or any other similar insolvency proceeding, as a result of the conversion of the loan to a subordinated instrument, the Company's ability to recover the amount due under the loan will be hindered as it will be subordinated to the dues of the Subsidiary's creditors (such as debt, payables, and claims) which will be settled in priority to the Company's loan, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2 Risks Relating to the Market, Industry and Regulatory Environment 2.2.1 The impact of political and economic risks on the Company's operations The majority of the Company's operations are located in Saudi Arabia, and the Company's financial performance is therefore dependent on the prevailing economic and political conditions in Saudi Arabia and on global economic conditions that affect Saudi Arabia's economy. The oil sector still constitutes a large share of the GDP of Saudi Arabia. Fluctuations in oil prices may occur, and adversely affect the economy of Saudi Arabia. Economic growth in Saudi Arabia has also slowed in recent years. Saudi Arabia is also facing the challenge of relatively high levels of population growth. All such conditions will have an adverse effect on the Saudi Arabian economy, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations, or prospects. Fluctuations in economic factors, such as the availability of credit for consumers, interest rate levels, unemployment rates, salary levels and tax rates, cost of water and electricity consumption, partial or full removal of subsidies provided by the Saudi Arabian government for certain materials, may also affect consumer spending and demand for products offered by the Company. If the Company is unable to respond to market changes, the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects would be negatively and materially affected. www.jamjoompharma.com20Table of Contents In addition, many countries in the Middle East suffer from political or security instability at the present time. There can be no assurance that the negative diplomatic relations with, or economic and political conditions in, those countries or other countries will not have a negative impact on the economy, foreign direct investment or financial markets in Saudi Arabia in general, and on the Company's business, results of operation, financial position and prospects. Any unexpected major changes in the political, economic or legal environment in Saudi Arabia, other countries in the Middle East, and/ or the countries from which the Company sources its products, which include without limitation normal market fluctuations, recession, insolvency, weakness in employment levels, technological shifts and other such developments. In addition, significant changes in tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations between Saudi Arabia and other countries or any changes in their local policies, such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, any negative sentiments towards Saudi Arabia in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in Saudi Arabia's trade regulations, would result in significant increases in the Company's costs, restrict the Company's access to suppliers and depress economic activity. The occurrence of any of the above factors would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.2 Risks related to the increasing competition in the industry which the Company operates The pharmaceutical sector in Saudi Arabia is highly competitive, and the Company expects such competition to increase and intensify in the future. The Company faces competition from other domestic and international pharmaceutical manufacturers. These companies may have greater financial, technical, research and development, marketing, distribution, retail and other resources than the Company. They may also have longer operating experience, a larger customer base or broader and deeper market coverage. As a result, the Company's competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or evolving opportunities, technologies, standards or user requirements than the Company and may have the ability to initiate or withstand significant regulatory changes and industry evolvement. Furthermore, as the Company expands into other markets, it will face competition from new competitors, domestic or foreign, who may also enter markets where the Company currently operates or will operate. The Company competes with other pharmaceutical manufacturers in Saudi Arabia and other key markets, based, among other things, on the following elements: (1) prices of certain products, particularly those in the consumer health segment; (2) the degree of brand recognition for the quality products; (3) reputation and quality of the brands and products offered; and (4) ability to understand and respond to customers' demands in a timely manner. Some of the Company's competitors may possess financial, managerial, logistical and human resources exceeding those possessed by the Company. Moreover, a number of different competitive factors would also have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including, among other things: y research capabilities to develop and commercialize pipeline products; y expansion of product portfolios, include through acquisitions and licensing arrangements; y the success of clinical trials which prove the advantage of competing products compared to the Company's products; y entry by new competitors into the Company's current and future markets and increased competition from other international and local players, including other wholesalers; y two or more competitors merging or forming strong alliances so as to offer additional high quality products and services at lower cost; y utilizing innovative sales and marketing methods by the Company's competitors; y the Company's ability to compete in pricing on government tenders; and y securing agreements with suppliers or distributors on which the Company relies. Any significant increase in competition may have a material adverse effect on the Company's revenue and profitability as well as on its business and prospects. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continually distinguish its products and services from those of its competitors, preserve and improve its relationships with various participants in the healthcare value chain, or increase or even maintain its existing market share. The Company may lose market share, and its financial condition and results of operations may deteriorate significantly if it fails to compete effectively. The occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.3 Financial risks related to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates The Company imports certain products and raw material from suppliers outside Saudi Arabia in foreign currency (primarily in EUR), and exports finished products from its manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia to its markets abroad. The Company's imported purchases represented 72.0%, 72.3%, 79.5%, and 68.3% of the total gross purchases for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. Exported products represented 42.9%, 33.1%, 36.6%, and 32.7% of the Company's total sales for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, respectively. In addition, as a result of the Company's loan to its subsidiary in Egypt (Al Jamjoom for Pharmaceutical Industries), the Company recorded in its financial statements currency-exchange-related losses amounting to SAR 33.0 million during the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G which is primarily due to the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound during the same period (for further details, please see Sub Section (\"Net financing Cost\") 6.8.1 (\"Consolidated income statements\") of this Prospectus. The Egyptian Pound was further devaluated in October 2022G and January 2023G, which is likely to result in further currency-exchange-related losses for the last quarter of 2022G and may result in additional currency-exchange-related losses in 2023G. Such losses could potentially be material and may impact the profitability of the Company in www.jamjoompharma.com21Table of Contents 2022G and 2023G. If the Company is unable to pass on any increases in operating costs caused by the deflation of the Saudi Riyal or the Egyptian Pound to customers through higher prices, or if this in turn would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.4 Risk related to the Competition Law The Competition Law promulgated by Royal Decree No. M/75, dated 29/06/1440H (corresponding to 06/03/2019G) and its implementing regulations issued by the General Authority for Competition pursuant to Resolution No. 337, dated 25/01/1441H (corresponding to 24/09/2019G) prohibit practices with anti-competitive objectives or effects, including practices such as fixing prices of goods, service fees, or terms of purchase and sale. In this context, certain non-exclusive distributor agreements in the Kingdom include provisions (e.g. distributor's obligation to purchase the products exclusively from the Company and restricting the distributor from selling the Company's products outside the Kingdom) which may be found not to be in conformity with the Competition Law. By virtue of decision No. 261 issued by the Board of GAC, the GAC opened an investigation against several companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector and conducted an inspection at the Company's head office on 08/03/1444H (corresponding to 04/10/2022G) (for further information, please refer to Section 12.12 (\"Litigation\") of this Prospectus). Should the GAC decide to conduct a targeted investigation into the Company as a result of the inspection, or otherwise in general conclude that the Company is in breach of the applicable Competition Laws, it may impose on the Company a fine of up to 10% of the total annual sales value which is the subject of the violation or no more than ten million (SAR 10,000,000) Saudi riyals where it proves impossible to estimate such value. Moreover, the GAC may, at its discretion, impose a fine of up to three times the revenues made as a result of the breach and order the (partial or full) suspension of the Company's activities temporarily or permanently in case of repeated breach. The occurrence of any of the above risks would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.5 Risks related to changes in laws and government policies in the Company's key markets The Company is subject to a range of laws and regulations in the markets in which it operates, which in many cases are applied by governmental authorities in accordance with government policy or directives. Please refer to Section 2.1.6 (\"Risks related to the regulatory requirements imposed by the SFDA and other regulators\") of this Prospectus. Demand for the Company's products and its business may be materially and adversely affected by changes in laws, regulations, government policy and administrative directives, or the interpretation thereof, in the Company's key markets, including in particular those with application to the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors in in those markets. A number of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its operations are relatively new, and the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations may involve uncertainty. There can be no assurance of favorable or unfavorable future changes in laws and regulations and/or governmental policy with respect to the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, including the promulgation of new laws, changes in existing laws or their interpretation or enforcement. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the legal protection available to the Company and the Shareholders. The pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, in particular (including the regulations that affect the production and sale of pharmaceutical products) is strictly regulated. The Company's manufacturing facilities are regulated by various bodies, including the MoH and the SFDA in Saudi Arabia, and are subject to extensive regulation relating, among other things, to: y pricing and labelling of products; y manufacturing standards; y conduct of operations; y storage requirements; y addition of facilities and services; y qualifications of medical and support personnel; y confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with health-related information and medical records; and y the handling and disposal of medical and pharmaceutical waste. In addition, in certain circumstances, the Company may be required by governmental or regulatory authorities to produce specific products, as was the case in 2020G, when the Saudi Government as a national security measure required pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce antiviral, anti-influenza and immune-boosting products to treat the symptoms of COVID-19 in order to build domestic stockpiles of key pharmaceuticals or for other public policy reasons. Such requirements may force the Company to divert its production capacity away from more profitable products, which could have a negative impact on the Company's business and results of operations. The Company is unable to anticipate changes in the regulatory environment and therefore could be subject to fines and sanctions, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com22Table of Contents 2.2.6 Risks related to Saudization, non-Saudi employees, and other Labor Law requirements The Saudization and Nitaqat programs were adopted pursuant to the Ministerial Resolution no. 4040 dated 12/10/1432H (corresponding to 10/09/2011G), with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development beginning the implementation of the Nitaqat program to encourage institutions to employ Saudi nationals. Compliance with Saudization requirements is a local regulatory requirement necessitating that all companies carrying out business in Saudi Arabia, including the Company, employ and maintain a certain ratio of Saudi personnel among their staff. The ratio of Saudi workers varies on the basis of a Company's activities and the professions specifically targeted with Saudization resolutions. As at the date of this Prospectus, the Company has been classified based on its various entities, with its manufacturing entity classified under the platinum category (with Saudization Rate of 45.7%), which means that it complies with the current Saudization requirements, and will be able to secure work visas and transfer sponsorship. The Company has obtained the relevant Saudization certificates from the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development to this effect. On 08/06/1441H (corresponding to 03/02/2020G), the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development issued Ministerial Resolution no. 109044 to nationalize 30% of various pharmaceutical profession positions by 01/12/1442H (corresponding to 11/07/2021G). The penalties imposed on companies violating this resolution include a fine of SAR 20,000 for each employee in violation thereof (provided that the employer has more than 51 employees). Additionally, the SFDA issued a circular dated 04/09/2018G to nationalize 100% of the positions of professionals operating in the field of promotion and advertisement of pharmaceutical and herbal preparations by the end of June 2021G. Those not complying with this requirement, including employees practicing such profession and entities, agents and scientific offices, will be subject to a number penalties. Furthermore, Article 10 of the Law of the Pharmaceutical and Herbal Establishments and Preparations stipulates that only a full-time, licensed, Saudi pharmacist may practice promotion and advertisement of pharmaceutical and herbal preparations. Several penalties may be imposed for violations of the Law of the Pharmaceutical and Herbal Establishments and Preparations, including a fine of no more than SAR 5 million, temporary shutdown of the relevant establishment for a period not exceeding 180 days, or the revocation of applicable licenses. Accordingly, the Company implemented plans to achieve the required Saudization rates, provide the required personnel, and employ the required number of Saudi or non-Saudi employees to achieve its objective. The Company reviews the Saudization and employment rates on a monthly basis to identify the initiatives required to achieve the employment plans, the required Saudization Rates, and any future amendments to the Saudization Rates. In general, under the Saudi Labor Law, foreign employees are only permitted to work for the corporate entity which sponsors them in Saudi Arabia or through the Ajeer program. The Company employs a number of non-Saudi employees who are sponsored by third party recruiting companies and other Related Parties. The fees for transferring employees from one company to another are between SAR 2,000 and SAR 6,000 (depending on the number of times an employee has transferred their sponsorship in the past). For further information on the employees, please refer to Section 4.14 (\"Employees\") of this Prospectus. The risks related to the requirements applicable to non-Saudi employees include facing fines or penalties, such as suspension of MHRSD recruitment systems or services in the event of violating laws pertaining to Iqama, transfer of sponsorship, Ajeer notices, secondment, and residency professions, which would adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. The penalties for entities seconding foreign employees under their own sponsorship to another entity without an Ajeer notice include, for a first-time violating entity, a fine of SAR 25,000 for each employee working in violation of the law, and these fines increase in case of repeated violations. In addition, under the Saudi Labor Law, each foreign employee must carry out the job function stated on his/her Iqama. The penalties for entities hiring employees whose actual job function does not correspond with the job function appearing on their Iqama include, for a first-time violating entity, a fine of SAR 10,000 for each employee working in violation of the law, and these penalties increase in case of repeated violations. The Company may not be able to fulfil current or amended Saudization or other Labor Law requirements in the future or that the minimum wage required to be paid by the Company will not increase. In case of non-compliance with the requirements pertaining to Saudization or non-Saudi employees, the Company could face sanctions by governmental authorities. In addition, the Company may be unable to provide the required workforce or recruit the required number of Saudi nationals and/or foreign workers without incurring additional costs, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For further details, please refer to Section 4.15 (\"Saudization Strategy\") of this Prospectus. 2.2.7 Risks related to changes in import and export laws and regulations The Company imports into Saudi Arabia raw materials and packaging materials required for the manufacture of its products, and the Company exports finished products from its manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia to its markets abroad. Therefore, the import/export laws in Saudi Arabia, the export laws in jurisdictions from which the Company or its suppliers import the materials that the Company uses in its operations, and the import laws of the countries in which the Company sells products manufactured elsewhere can all have a significant effect on the Company's business. The imposition of legal requirements or new regulations, such as the Saudi Government's recent decision to increase customs tariffs to 20%, anti-dumping duties or customs tariffs and other measures, whether adopted by countries or by regional trade blocs, it is possible that will affect the prices of raw materials and other products imported by the Company, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial position and prospects. Furthermore, the six month prohibition on pharmaceutical exports in 2020G imposed by the Saudi Government to protect supplies of pharmaceuticals within the country as a national security issue resulted in a loss of business in the Company's international markets (For further details, please refer to Section 2.1.19 (\"Risks related to the outbreak of infectious diseases or other serious public health www.jamjoompharma.com23Table of Contents concerns, including the continuing global spread of COVID-19\") of this Prospectus). In addition, if importation regulations become more restrictive towards the materials that the Company purchases from vendors or certain sanctions or embargos are imposed on these jurisdictions or the Company's key markets by the United Nations, other supranational organizations or other governments, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.8 Risks related to the imposition of additional fees or new taxes The Company is currently subject to Zakat, VAT, and withholding tax (given that some of the Company's transactions are with foreign parties not registered in KSA). However, the government may impose other fees or additional taxes on companies in the future. In the event that new taxes or fees are imposed on companies, other than the current ones, this may adversely and materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For example, any potential future VAT increase may reduce the level of demand for the Company's products or affect its profitability, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.9 Risks related to changes in the calculation of Zakat and income tax The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority issued Circular No. (6768/16/1438) dated 05/03/1438H (corresponding to 05/12/2016G), which obliges Saudi listed companies to calculate income and Zakat on the basis of shareholder nationality and the ratio of actual ownership between Saudi and Gulf citizens and others as stated in the \"Tadawulaty\" system at the end of the year. Prior to the issuance of said circular, listed companies were generally subject to the payment of Zakat or tax on the basis of the ownership held by their founders in accordance with their bylaws, and the impact of listed shares was not taken into account in determining the Zakat base. This circular was to come into effect in 31 December 2016G and the subsequent years. However, the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority issued Letter No. (12097/16/1438) dated 19/04/1438H (corresponding to 17/01/2017G), which postponed the implementation of said circular until the financial year 2017G and subsequent years. Until the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority issues directives regarding the mechanisms and procedures for implementing this circular, the implementation thereof, including final requirements that must be met, are still under study, as are the rules imposing income tax on all non-Gulf residents who are shareholders in Saudi listed companies subject to withholding tax on dividends paid to non-resident shareholders, regardless of their nationalities. In the event that the financial impact of this circular, if applied, is significant, or if the Company incurs additional costs to take the necessary steps to ensure compliance therewith, such occurrences would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.2.10 Risks related to VAT The Company has submitted all its VAT declarations since its registration (since January 2018G until the date of this Prospectus), all by the statuary deadlines. The Company also paid all liabilities owed to the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority by the statuary deadlines. The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority has provided confirmation of acceptance for all the VAT returns filed since inception up until the month of September 2022G.. In accordance with the Tax/Zakat regulations currently applicable in KSA, if the Tax/Zakat returns are filed within the statutory deadline, the statute of limitation is five (5) years from filing the declaration. The Company could make errors when implementing the regulatory requirements, which would lead to facing penalties imposed by the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority in accordance with the Value-Added Tax Law. Should that occur, it would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 2.3 Risks Related to the Offer Shares 2.3.1 Risks related to actual control by Substantial Shareholders on the interests of the Company and other Shareholders Following completion of the Offering, the current Shareholders will collectively hold (directly or indirectly) 70% of the issued Shares. The Substantial Shareholders will therefore be able to influence all matters and decisions requiring the approval of the Shareholders including the election of the Directors, approval of contracts, important Company activities, distribution of dividends and amendments which might be made to the Company's share capital and Bylaws. The interests of the Substantial Shareholders may differ from those of the Company's other Shareholders, and the Substantial Shareholders may prevent the Company from making certain decisions or taking certain actions that would protect the interests of the Company's other Shareholders. This may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or distribution of dividends and discourage bids for the Shares, which may adversely affect the value of the Shares. Such powers might be used in a manner which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com24Table of Contents 2.3.2 Risks related to the absence of a prior market for the Shares There has been no previous public market for offering or trading the Shares, and there can be no assurance that an active and liquid market for the Shares will develop or be sustained after the Offering. If an active and liquid market is not developed or maintained, the trading price of the Shares, which would adversely and materially affect Subscribers' anticipated returns, or result in the loss of all or a portion of their investment in the Company. 2.3.3 Risks related to future sales and offers Sales of large numbers of the Shares on the market after the completion of the Offering, or the perception that those sales will occur, will adversely affect the market price of the Shares. Upon the successful completion of the Offering, the Substantial Shareholders will be subject to a lockup period of six months during which they may not dispose of any Shares that they own. The sale of a substantial number of Shares by any of the Substantial Shareholders following their six-month lock-up period will have an adverse effect on the market for the Shares, and may result in a lower market price. The Company does not currently intend to issue additional Shares after the end of the Offering. If the Company decides to raise additional capital by issuing new Shares, the newly issued Shares may cause the value of the Shares to drop. The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors would have a material adverse effect on Subscribers' anticipated returns, or result in the loss of all or a portion of their investment in the Company. 2.3.4 Risks related to fluctuation in the market price of the Shares The Offer Price has been determined based upon several factors, including the past performance of the Company, the forecasts for the Company's business, the industry in which it operates, the markets in which it competes and an assessment of the Company's management, operations and financial results. The Offer Price may not be equal to the price at which the Shares will be traded following completion of the Offering and investors may not be able to resell the Offer Shares at the Offer Price or above, or may not be able to sell them at all. The stock market in general experiences from time to time extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of the Shares, which could cause a decline in the value of the Shares, with price volatility being worse if the trading volume of the Shares is low. The price of Shares may be negatively affected by various factors, including the Company's performance and results of anticipated operations, departures of key personnel, changes in earnings estimates or forecasts, changes in the business strategy, market conditions in its industry, the general situation of the Saudi Arabian economy, changes in laws and regulations, terrorist acts, acts of war, natural disasters and other calamities and stock market price fluctuations. The realization of any of these risks or other factors would have a material adverse effect on Subscribers' anticipated returns, or result in the loss of all or a portion of their investment in the Company. 2.3.5 Risks relating to the Company's ability to distribute dividends Future distribution of dividends will depend on several factors including, among other things, future earnings, financial conditions, cash flows, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and distributable reserves of the Company. In addition to other factors, the Company may not be able to pay dividends, and the Directors may not recommend and the Shareholders may not approve the payment of dividends. Additionally, the Company may be restricted by the terms of financing and facilities agreements executed with financing entities which some of them require their written approval prior making dividend payments to Shareholders. The Company may incur expenses or liabilities that would reduce or eliminate the cash available for distribution of dividends. If the Company does not pay dividends on the Shares, Shareholders may not receive any return on investment in the Shares unless they sell the Shares at a price higher than the price at the time of purchase, which would have a material adverse effect on Subscribers' anticipated returns. For further details, please refer to Section 7 (\"Dividend Distribution Policy\") of this Prospectus. 2.3.6 Risks related to the failure of publishing research or the publishing of unfavorable research about the Company Following the listing of Company shares, the company common stocks listed will be influenced by the research and reports that research analysts publish about the Company or the industry. If one or more of the analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to regularly publish reports on the Company, the latter could lose visibility on Tadawul, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if Company operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, one or more of the analysts who cover the Issuer may change their recommendations regarding the Company, and its stock price could decline.www.jamjoompharma.com25Table of Contents 3.

During 2016-2020G the Government's fiscal consolidation efforts, implementation of economic reforms to increase private sector participation and rising crude oil prices all contributed to the economy growing at a CAGR of 1.2%. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and a drop in oil prices halted economic development in the Kingdom in 2020G, particularly in labour-intensive sectors such as construction, retail and hospitality. Fiscal reforms, including a US$32 billion stimulus to support businesses with delayed tax payments, Government levy and fee exemptions, among several others, helped to indirectly mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and oil price shocks on both inflation and household income. Oil price increases, economic diversification plans to attract more tourists and privatisation of state-owned assets, such as utility companies and transportation hubs, partly supported a strong rebound in real GDP annual growth of 3.2% for the period, 2020G-21. The Kingdom registered a strong annual real GDP growth of 9.9% in Q1 2022G, the highest since 2011G, driven mainly by a steep growth of 20.3% in oil activities complemented by 3.7% from non-oil activities. Manufacturing sector excluding petroleum refining posted a strong annual growth of 4.1% driven mainly by exports which grew at 22.1% compared to Q1'2021G serving as a strong impetus for the pharmaceutical sector in the Kingdom. The Kingdom expects to cross 70 million visitors by the end of 2022G, up from 62 million in 2021G. The Kingdom has been actively promoting tourist destinations including the Seasons in Riyadh, Jeddah, Eastern Province and Taif Seasons which showcases what the country and the culture offers through a series of events, exhibitions, concerts and games. This is further fueled by the Kingdom allowing 1 million visitors this year to the Hajj and Umrah Pilgrimage, the highest after allowing only 60,000 vaccinated citizens in 2021G. The Kingdom aims to complement the tourism sector by increasing access to high-quality lodging, foodservice, healthcare and pharmaceuticals across the country. In 2021G, the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development launched a program called \"Developer Nitaqat\" , which aims to increase local citizens' participation in the private sector labour market. Initiatives like this, combined with the increased participation of women in the workforce, are expected to reduce the unemployment rate from 6.5% in 2021G to 5.5% in 2026G. Inflation rose to 3.4% in 2020G following a VAT increase from 5% to 15% and global supply chain bottlenecks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It has since been in decline as the effects of the VAT increase faded resulting in an inflation of 3.1% in 2021G. However, despite the upward pressure resulting from the war in Ukraine, which increased the cost of staples and other non-oil products, caps on gasoline prices and subsidies on wheat combined with falling rents which constitute almost 20% of the Consumer Price Index basket, is expected to contain the inflation at an average 2.5% for 2022G. The Kingdom is a net importer of essential goods, medicines, and other consumables, which all saw price increases. This saw a wide spectrum of economic sectors, from services like tourism to food and energy manufacturers, stockpiling inventory of both essential and intermediate products. However, as supply chains bottlenecks ease and Government keeps inflation under control through fiscal measures, inflation is expected to fall to 2.0% by 2026G. Rising health awareness evidenced during the pandemic partially resulted in consumers stocking up on medication, as well as other essentials, like sanitisers and masks. Higher levels of inflation influenced some consumers, specifically those in the low- to middle-income groups, to opt for affordable alternatives, such as general medicines for cough, cold and flu, and select nutraceuticals, such as vitamin C. The pandemic also triggered the expansion of pharmaceutical products, including rising sales of non-prescription products sold over the counter at pharmacies and increasingly through online channels. This was evident with key pharmacy retailers such as Al Nahdi reporting a 149% increase in online sales in 2020G, compared to 2019G. One of the key performance indicators as part of the Kingdom's National Transformation Program (NTP), was to ensure that 95.2% of all essential medicines are available in the local market by 2021G, up from 90.8% in 2015. However, the Government confirmed it had achieved a penetration of 96.0% availability across the local market by 2021G. Similarly, one of the core initiatives of the country's National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP) is to provide adequate access to medical and food security. As part of the NIDLP , the Local Content and Procurement Authority aims to achieve 40% of local content across the pharmaceutical products value chain to not only make the Kingdom self-sufficient, but also to tap into the large GCC markets. Private healthcare expenditure increased from 25% of the overall healthcare budget in 2017G to 30% in 2020G. Some of the Government's top priorities include improving healthcare policies, infrastructure and driving digital innovation in healthcare. NEOM, the country's flagship smart city is investing in digitizing healthcare using artificial intelligence adopting a proactive prevention approach for its citizens based in NEOM.www.jamjoompharma.com27Table of Contents Table (3.1): Key Macroeconomic Indicators, Saudi Arabia - 2019G-2022G Real GDP annual Growth % 0.3 (4.1) 3.2 7.6 2.7 - - GDP per capita SAR 88,626 84.5 85.2 - - Inflation rate % (2.1) 3.4 3.1 2.5 2.0 - - Government Revenue SAR bn 927 779 962 1,228 - 1.9% - Government Revenue - Taxes SAR bn 220 226 303 416 - 17.4% - Government Revenue - Other SAR bn 707 553 659 812 - (3.5%) - Disposable Passport, United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) The Kingdom's population declined by a CAGR of 1.2% over 2019-2021 to stand at 33.2 million in 2021. Saudi nationals accounted for 21.7 million in 2021, representing 65.4% of the country's total population, up from 62.1% in 2019, with the remaining 34.6% made up of expats. While 67% of the population fall under the age of 35, the population aged 65 and above is projected to increase more rapidly, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2021 and 2026, compared to a CAGR of 1.2% for the overall population. Those aged 65 and older are expected to account for 5.1% of the total population by 2026, up from 3.6% in 2019. In addition to higher rates of obesity and prevalence of diabetes among the general population, the ageing of the population is a major factor driving increased consumer spend on health care. The Kingdom has one of the highest prevalence of lifestyle diseases in the world, with nearly 16% of the population over the age of 20 suffering from diabetes and 40% from obesity in 2021. Focusing on high-risk groups, a national prevention program has been implemented to screen for diabetes and address modifiable risk factors at the community level. With a rapidly ageing population, chronic healthcare is anticipated to be in greater demand, particularly for cardiovascular diseases, Bronchial Asthma, Alzheimer's, Dementia, Parkinson's, and Multiple Sclerosis. Growth of other pharmaceutical categories, such as nutraceuticals, is being fuelled by a greater understanding of the importance of disease prevention and health maintenance. It is anticipated that these factors, along with the continued growth of key demographics in the Kingdom, will continue to support rising consumer spending on healthcare and medical goods. From 2021 to 2026, consumer spending on health goods and medical services is projected to increase at a CAGR of 5.2%, from SAR21.0 billion in 2021 to SAR27.1 billion in 2026 (Refer to Table 3 Key Healthcare Indicators, Saudi Arabia - 2019G-2022G and 2026G).

The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA), in the Kingdom is the main regulatory body responsible for regulating the safety and supply of drugs and medical devices besides other essentials such as food, pesticides, cosmetics and animal feed. including in commercial and Government hospitals and health centres as well as food products in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, the National Unified Procurement Company for Medical Supplies is responsible for centralising procurement of medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and other supplies, distribution and logistics of both locally produced and imported pharmaceuticals across all public healthcare facilities in the country. The Saudi Government's Vision 2030 aims to improve the Kingdom's healthcare infrastructure by providing adequate access, equitable geographical distribution, and the provision of e-health services and digital solutions. The Ministry of Health has developed a five-year e-health strategy and road map, aiming to connect healthcare providers at all levels of care, measure healthcare delivery performance and transform it to world-class standards, in partnership with other Government agencies to improve vital digital services. One important objective was the adoption of the National Platform for Health Information Exchange, which aims to integrate clinical standards and enable standard coding sets to unify 70% of all digital records and improve the performance and productivity of software used in the diagnosis procedures throughout the healthcare system. Furthermore, the Government is currently investing an estimated US$3.4 billion in two phases to facilitate local production of vaccines and insulin, establish local plasma collection centres while expanding into immunological and cancer treatment technologies. This is part of the Government's overarching objective to achieve medical security. As a part of Vision 2030, in March 2021, the General Secretariat of the Council of Cooperative Health Insurance mandated all employers in the private sector to provide insurance coverage for their employees and all members of their families. Currently, 29 licensed insurers are operating in the Kingdom providing benefits to over 9.5 million people as of Q2 2021, which includes Saudi nationals and expats. As a result, the Saudi healthcare sector has faced a period of regulatory changes. One of the most significant aspects is the Government's announcement that over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription drugs, such as Ibuprofen and Paracetamol, will also be sold through grocery retailers while previously, these medicines were sold only through pharmacies in line with the Health Care Law. During the historic period, 2019-2021, the Kingdom's self-sufficiency and national security prompted the Government, as part of the Vision 2030 transformation program, to tighten restrictions on imported products, while setting goals and initiating programs to grow the penetration of local products in the Kingdom. The outbreak of COVID-19 prompted the SFDA to expedite registrations, which accelerated the development and launch of new medical products.

Pharmaceutical product growth over the review period is attributed to positive macroeconomic drivers such as population expansion, an ageing population, rising levels of noncommunicable diseases and strong Government funding to expand public healthcare. Value sales of several pharmaceutical products in the Kingdom benefitted from rising consumer awareness of maintaining a healthy and responsive immune system as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Kingdom is heavily reliant on pharmaceutical imports, with a majority of its products still coming in from the US, Europe, China and India. One of the core objectives of Vision 2030 is a Government push towards pharmaceutical security, which aims to increase local production to account for at least 40% of total pharmaceutical product consumption. In line with localising the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and their active pharmaceutical ingredients, the government is also encouraging technology and research-driven partnerships by global manufacturers such as AstraZeneca and Pfizer while signing an MoU with GlaxoSmithKline for local manufacturing and technological transfer. This resulted in the contribution of locally produced pharmaceutical end-products rising from 30% in 2018G to an estimated 36% of all drugs consumed as of 2021G. With the Kingdom leading the production of pharmaceutical products in the GCC region, 21.2% of total local production is estimated to have been exported to neighbouring countries in 2020. www.jamjoompharma.com29Table of Contents The overall pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% to reach SAR39.6 billion (or US$10.6 billion) by 2026. In addition to macro-economic drivers, core categories like dermatology and gastrointestinal system are likely to post a strong CAGR of over 10% in the forecast period as both categories are currently driven by innovative products, presenting a strong opportunity for the expansion of local generics. Sedentary lifestyles owing to extreme climates and high foodservice consumption has resulted in high prevalence of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases besides weather related ailments such as asthma and allergies. As a result, diabetic and asthma-related treatments are expected to gain significantly in the Kingdom. Local companies like Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals are foreseeing this strong potential and actively investing in developing local diabetic portfolio, which currently contributes to 31% of the Company's new product pipeline between 2022G and 2024G. The five pharmaceutical categories covered in this report\u2014Ophthalmology, Dermatology, General Medicines, Gastrointestinal products and Nutraceuticals\u2014grew by 2.9% annually from 2019 to 2021, reaching SAR16.7 billion (or US$4.5 billion) in 2021 from SAR15.8 billion (or US$4.2 billion) in 2019,. Total sales of the five pharmaceutical categories covered in the scope are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to reach SAR20.9 billion (or US$5.6 billion) by 2026, supported by strong macroeconomic conditions, high Government expenditure, increased coverage of mandatory health insurance and the growing push for localisation, which is resulting in more affordable medicines across the core categories. Rising disposable incomes and evolving lifestyles, combined with consumers becoming more health conscious are expected to drive over the counter products more than prescription products across all categories. The pharmaceutical supply chain involves medicine manufacturers and importers that sell products to national distributors, which, in turn, distribute the products to hospitals, pharmacies and other retailers. The majority of pharmaceutical sales in the Kingdom are conducted through large national distributors, such as Tamer Group, Cigalah Group, SITCO and Al Naghi Brothers, which provide extensive distribution networks and last-mile reach through supply agreements with the country's main hospitals and pharmacies. These distributors work closely with physicians to determine the relevance of a product for a certain ailment, estimate the potential of a product / molecule in the market, understand the competitive landscape and connect with key opinion leaders for consideration of the product in various formularies of hospitals and across pharmacies in retail. As a result, pharmaceutical distributors have a significant role in partnerships and decision making for new product launches.

Growth was driven by an ageing population, rising disposable incomes and changing consumer lifestyles in the country. Despite a decline of 1.5% in 2020, owing to closure of clinics during the pandemic, ophthalmology products rebounded as normalcy gradually returned, posting strong growth of 13.3% in 2021. Sales of ophthalmic products are predicted to register a CAGR of 8.9% to reach SAR1.12 billion (or US$0.30 billion) by 2026. Rising investments, with several multinational companies establishing a base in the Kingdom, combined with increased urbanisation and growth in the ageing population, are expected to be the key drivers for growth over the forecast period. Most consumers depend on ophthalmologists and medical professionals for product recommendations, with prescription products subsidised by health insurance policies. The category is mainly driven by prescription products, which include an antibiotic agent and corticosteroids. Non-prescription products sold over the counter is the major segment in the ophthalmology category, that includes products mainly for dry eyes such as Refresh or antihistamine, or any other drop solution that doesn't contain an antibiotic. Rising demand for elective (such as LASIK for eye vision correction) and non-elective (cataract, glaucoma treatment, etc.) surgeries as a preventive measure has seen rising demand for affordable post-surgery medication. This has served as key driver for growth of ophthalmology products for local manufacturers like Jamjoom pharmaceuticals. The ophthalmology market in the Kingdom is highly consolidated with the top five companies accounting for 58.3% of total value sales in 2021. The collaboration between pharmaceutical companies and ophthalmologists played a critical role in the expansion of the market for prescription ophthalmology medicines, as companies invested in dedicated business development executives to promote the therapeutic benefits of their products. Local manufacturer, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals, led the market with a 20.6% market share in 2021. Also, among the other top five players were, Alcon Laboratories Inc by Alkamal Import Office Co with a share of 15.4%, AbbVie Inc with 11.9%, Bayer AG with 5.7% and Bausch Health with 4.7%. The strong position of these five companies is underpinned by their relationship with leading chained pharmacy retailers such as Al Nahdi and Al Dawaa, which recommend these brands to consumers seeking advice from pharmacists on eye products both with and without prescriptions. The growing popularity of telemedicine services and consumers searching pharmacy websites for information and non-prescription products to purchase online wherever applicable. Although in-person consultations are back, this trend of online accessibility to validate products and, if applicable, purchase online, is likely to gradually gain momentum over the forecast period. www.jamjoompharma.com30Table of Contents Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' strong leading position can be attributed to it being the only local player to offer an extensive selection of ophthalmology pharmaceuticals, including both prescription (with added antibiotics) and non-prescription products. The flagship and best-selling brand in this category, contributing to over 40% of the category's revenues, is HyFresh, an ophthalmic drop-based solution that is used to treat dry eye symptoms. Among prescription products, the largest contributors include Olopat, Loxtra and Xolamol. The Company's active marketing efforts through a dedicated sales force, coupled with the Ministry of Health's push to encourage medical professionals and local pharmacy retailers to recommend locally produced pharmaceuticals, is likely to serve as a key growth driver for the Company's products over the 2021-2026 period. Strong sales enabled the Company to invest in further research and development, with an estimated 13% of its planned investment directed to ophthalmology products in the country.

This was mainly driven by the increase in disposable incomes that allowed for more expenditure on overall skin health and dermatology products, population growth and a rising number of women in the workforce. As a result of these drivers, dermatology pharmaceuticals are expected to witness a CAGR of 10.2% over 2021- 2026 to reach SAR3.9 billion (or US$1.1 billion) in the latter year. Overall penetration of prescription medicines in dermatology is high, estimated at over 70% of the market in 2021, with anti-fungal, antibiotic and corticosteroid agents constituting the largest product segments. Rising penetration of diabetes has seen increased vulnerability for fungal infections thereby resulting in several consumers taking preventive action. By contrast, demand for over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription products with antihistamines, mild corticosteroids, medicated softening creams, etc. saw growing traction as people opted for self-medication and higher at-home delivery of dermatology products from brick-and-mortar pharmacy retailers due to rising convenience. Limited coverage of dermatology products through several health insurance streams also led to people opting for competitively priced options of both prescription and non-prescription products across all channels. Imported products accounted for a large proportion of dermatology pharmaceutical products sales, although local player penetration was relatively higher than in other categories, such as ophthalmology. The dermatology market in the Kingdom is highly fragmented, with over 80 players operating in the space and the top five companies accounting for only 28.9% of the total category sales. As of 2021, the market for dermatology products in the Kingdom was led by local player Avalon Pharma Pvt Ltd (distributed by Middle East Pharmaceutical Industries Co Ltd) with an estimated 7.9% market share driven by constant innovation and powerful promotions through traditional outlets and social media. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals ranked a close second with a share of 6.7%. Other leading players included AbbVie Inc, Bayer AG and LEO Pharma A/S. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals specialises in the production of generic therapeutic treatments, particularly topical corticosteroids, which are used to treat eczema and psoriasis, among others. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' commitment to quality and innovation has enabled the Company to be present with a wide range of 15 dermatology treatment brands, such as anti-acne solutions, emollients and wound-healing agents. The Company's strategic focus on establishing specialised business divisions by product category with specialised staff offering continuous educational engagement with physicians supported the category's growth.www.jamjoompharma.com31Table of Contents Table (3.7): Dermatology Market Overview, Saudi 2.4 2.7 3.9 9.5% 10.2% % Contribution to Total Pharmaceutical market% 7.4 7.9 7.9 8.4 9.8 - - Source: Euromonitor calculations based on primary and secondary research Table (3.8): Dermatology Competitive Landscape, Saudi Arabia - 2021G Competitor / Player Unit Market Share Rank Avalon Pharma Pvt Ltd (Middle East Pharmaceutical Industries Co Ltd MECP) % 7.9 1 Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals % 6.7 2 AbbVie Inc % 6.3 3 Bayer AG % 4.1 4 LEO Pharma A/S % 3.9 5 Others % 71.1 - Source: Euromonitor calculations based on primary and secondary research 3.2.3.3 General Medicines The market for general medicines in the Kingdom decreased by a CAGR of 1.0% over 2019-2021 to stand at SAR10.1 billion (or US$2.7 billion). This resulted in a decline in the category's contribution to the overall pharmaceutical market from 38% in 2019 to 33% in 2021. Supply chain disruption caused during the COVID-19 pandemic had a domino effect on this category including timely sourcing of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), the key raw material in manufacturing medicines. This resulted in the Ministry of Health expanding its initiatives to localize pharmaceutical manufacturing lin Saudi Arabia. Government restrictions on opening hours and curfews in the retail channel during the pandemic saw growth in demand for over- the-counter medication, most notably generics, purchased either through on-call or online to be delivered at the doorstep. This led to an increase in the number of new manufacturers and brands entering the market, resulting in a fragmented competitive landscape as consumers became aware of their superior value compared to more expensive leading brands. In response, major pharmacy-stocked topical analgesics/pain killer brands conducted aggressive in-store and online promotional campaigns to increase sales during the review period. The timely approval to sell select general medicines at grocery retailers , including forecourt retailers, served as another impetus to fuel growth in general medicines sales. The products that were made available include analgesics, medical combinations to help muscle pain, cold relief, hand sanitisers and lozenges. Strong protective measures by governing authorities, a large contribution of sales through the institutional channel and pharmaceutical regulatory approvals, all contributed to the strong presence of local manufacturers in general medicines, where they account for almost half of total sector sales,. SPIMACO (Saudi Pharmaceutical Industries & Medical Appliances Corporation) led this category with an estimated 14.4% market share in 2021, followed by GlaxoSmithKline Plc with 10%, Tabuk Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Co with 9%, Al Hikma Pharmaceuticals Industries Co with 6% and Avalon Pharma Pvt Ltd with 3%. SPIMACO's national leadership is supported by its extensive portfolio of well-known brands, which include Fevadol and Sapofen. The company's key competitive advantages are its strong reputation for paediatric therapeutic treatments, notable international alliances and agreements with regulatory bodies to supply the private and public healthcare sectors with prescribed general medicines, as well as a nationwide distribution network for over-the-counter (non-prescription) varieties. In 2021, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals, one of the top local producers of general medicines in the Kingdom, reported a market share of 2.1%, with over 70% of the category's revenues stemming from prescription products. The Company's modest market share in this therapeutic area was the result of repricing items such as Fast-Flam (for treatment of painful post-traumatic inflammatory conditions). . High penetration and increasing sales of over-the-counter (non-prescription) products in the market thus, resulted in a marginal decline of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' sales in this category. The Company increased Prima D3 sales by a CAGR of 73% between 2019 and 2021, contributing to the overall general medicine sector. Acknowledging the Company's positioning in premium generics and the intense competition in mass generic products, the Company's mass products, including Levozal and Voltic, reported a marginal decline over 2019-2021. However, Voltic, an adult diclofenac used in treatment of pain and musculoskeletal disorders has shown strong recovery in 2022. The Company currently offers a total of 15 brands across a variety of sub-categories including antihistamines, analgesics, anti-virals and muscle relaxants. In line with this strategic direction, the Company introduced five new products for the prescription and over-the-counter (non-prescription) markets across a wide range of general applications. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals aims to strengthen its position by www.jamjoompharma.com32Table of Contents expanding its product portfolio in this category in line with the Government's Vision to achieve pharmaceutical security and holistic health and wellness, with 7% of planned products in the pipeline for 2022 pertaining to this category.

As a result, the contribution of gastrointestinal products to total pharmaceutical product sales increased from 5.2% in 2019 to 5.9% in 2021. The category saw consistent growth during the pandemic as movement restrictions and a year-long work-from-home routine led to a decline in physical activity and higher food consumption resulting in increased demand for gastrointestinal products. Most gastrointestinal products are used regularly by patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, ulcer and heart issues. A high prevalence of obesity and diabetes among Saudi consumers increased interest and awareness regarding the significance of healthy eating habits and lifestyle modifications to maintain a healthy body weight and body mass index (BMI). Value sales of gastrointestinal products are expected to reach SAR2.8 billion (or US$0.75 billion) by 2026. Growth in disposable incomes, as well as the return to normalcy in terms of socializing both indoor and outdoor has led to more opportunities for dining out, either through outings to foodservice outlets, take-away, and food deliveries. This return to old habits has affected the previous shift towards healthier eating habits adopted during lockdown. The market for digestive remedies in the Kingdom is characterised by limited coverage of these products by public healthcare or mandatory health insurance programs, which only prescribe gastrointestinal treatments for chronic diseases thus resulting in a significant share of over-the-counter (non-prescription) products. Several brands including Ranitidine Nadine, Ranacid, Ranid, Ranimax were withdrawn from the market based on SFDA's regulatory alignment with the global direction to suspend medicines with H2 blockers. This also further pushed the market towards over-the-counter medication during the review period, 2019-21. AstraZeneca Group Plc leads the category with an estimated market share of 8.5%, followed by Tabuk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co with 8.1%, Acino with 7.0%, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals with 5.5% and Riyadh Pharma Medical & Cosmetic Products Co Ltd with 4.4%. Combined, the top five players accounted for 34% of the gastrointestinal treatment sales in 2021, reflecting the highly fragmented nature of the category. Local manufacturers (Tabuk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals and Pharma Medical & Cosmetic Products Co Ltd) hold three of the top five places. Tabuk, the second-ranked player and largest local manufacturer, has an extensive product portfolio of gastrointestinal treatments and a strong specialisation in manufacturing generic formulas of popular patented brands, such as Nexium. The majority of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' portfolio in the gastrointestinal category consists of over-the-counter (non-prescription) products, with only a few prescription products. In a market driven by price-competitive products, despite having a limited affordable product portfolio, the Company's relatively lower performance in value terms was compensated for by strong volume sales of its affordable product range in this category. Examples include a cumulative decrease of (-34.3%) in value sales of its flagship brand Aciloc (used to treat gastric reflux), due to a price reduction by the SFDA, and the Company's decision to cease production of its Zydac over-the-counter (non-prescription) brand in 2019 following SFDA's regulations on H2 blockers. www.jamjoompharma.com33Table of Contents However, sales of prescribed gastrointestinal treatment in the Company's portfolio rose at a CAGR of 14.2% for the review period (2019-21), increasing its contribution to Company sales from 56% to 80% during the period, indicating Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' strong competitive advantage in prescription sales,. Premium prescription brands, Zoron (for treating nausea and vomiting), Dompy (for motion sickness and vomiting) and Meva (for irritable bowel syndrome), reported the most dynamic growth, with a combined growth rate of 28.9% over 2019-2021 and increasing its contribution share from 38% to 68% of total sales of gastrointestinal treatments, bolstering the Company's strong reputation as a producer of premium generics in the prescription space.

Rising consumer awareness of health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic was the primary growth driver. Subcategories such as diabetic care and vitamins performed strongly, particularly driven by vitamin C due to the general perception that it boosts the immune system and hence, reduces the symptoms of COVID-19. Together, these medicines accounted for a combined share of 35% of total nutraceutical sales in 2021. Higher demand for dietary supplements and vitamins, which were actively promoted by pharmacies, and the availability of these products through e-commerce channels served as a significant driver for the introduction of new brands, while existing players expanded their product lines. This trend led to an increase in the proportion of non-prescription nutraceuticals to 95%, relative to prescription nutraceuticals. Demand for vitamins and dietary supplements increases during Hajj and Umrah seasons as visitors take preventive measures to boost immunity and avoid contracting or the spread of virus and diseases. Total nutraceuticals sales are projected to reach SAR2.5 billion (or US$0.65 billion) by 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 6.8%. Additional investment by leading pharmacy retailers to increase the revenue contribution of less regulated over-the-counter (non-prescription) categories, is expected to continue benefitting OTC over prescription products resulting in premiumisation of the overall pharmaceutical market. SFDA continues to have sole responsibility to ensure the health and safety of new nutraceuticals products entering the market, while also establishing mandatory prices to ensure affordability over the forecast period. The competitive landscape for nutraceutical products is the most fragmented among the categories in scope. High entry barriers coupled with strong demand growth, created an opportunity leveraged by several new players entering the market between 2019 and 2021. With growing demand for one-a-day multivitamins, several players either offered large pack sizes offering value for money or actively sold Buy-one, Get-one bundle offers to promote preventive health. These factors, combined with rising disposable incomes, resulted in the growth among imported manufacturers who are estimated to account for approximately 85% of category sales,. Four of the top five nutraceuticals players in the Kingdom were multinationals in 2021, including Bayer AG with a share of 6.5%, Vitabiotics Ltd with 5.0%, Procter & Gamble with 4.9% and GlaxoSmithKline Plc with 4.5%. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals was the only local player in the top five, ranking third with a share of 5.0% in 2021. The Company reported a CAGR of 30.4% over 2019-2021, well above the market average of 13.4%, as it capitalised on well-established soft gel manufacturing facility and strong local know-how to strengthen its position by offering a variety of almost 40 brands encompassing Omega-3, vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements. The Company's premium vitamin brands, Omega, and Vit-D3, which accounted for 36.1% of the Company's www.jamjoompharma.com34Table of Contents nutraceuticals sales, experienced strong demand, by growing at CAGRs of 43.1% and 46.4%, respectively, over 2019-2021. Leveraging the company's established soft-gel manufacturing facility, the Company is actively expanding the variants offered in its existing portfolio such as the introduction of Omega 3 1000mg launched in 2021 following while also entering new sub-categories such as stress management through Ashwaq in 2021, Melatonin 5 mg (higher than the market standard offering of 3mg per capsule) among several other products in line with global health trends. As one of the frontrunners among local players in the market, Jamjoom pharmaceuticals is actively expanding its product portfolio among nutraceuticals with an estimated 16% of the overall product pipeline attributed to Nutraceuticals category.

High inflation, expected to reach 11.6% in 2022, coupled with the continued EGP devaluation are likely to subdue total GDP growth over the forecast period, with an anticipated CAGR of 11.5% over 2021-2026. Attracting FDI and increasing the participation of the private sector are seen as other major pillars driving economic growth and partially reducing the impact of rising inflation in the country. In May 2022, the Government announced a plan to double the private sector's share of the economy, from 30% in 2021 to 65% over the next three years. Within the pharmaceutical industry, the private sector is already starting to see multiple investments from across the region, including Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund and ADQ's acquisition of 100% of Bausch Health. Such increased participation from the private sector is likely to drive expansion of operations, availability of medicinal reach to the country's population and the development of new products.

Young people aged 0-18 years make up the majority of the population, accounting for 46.3% of the total in 2021. However, while only comprising 5.5% of the population, those aged 65 and above saw the most dynamic growth, up by a CAGR of 3.1% over 2019-2021. Lack of adequate access to healthcare solutions and consultations has resulted in child malnutrition emerging as one of the most pressing health issues in Egypt. According to the Global Nutrition Report, the prevalence of overweight children younger than five years was 15.7% in 2021. This suggests that the adolescent population may be a significant contributor to healthcare expenditure due to anticipated high incidences of obesity in the country. In 2021, 16.5% of the population over 20 years of age, is likely to be affected by diabetes, while 39.7% of the population over 20 years is likely to be impacted by obesity, making diabetes and obesity two of the most pressing health concerns in Egypt.

The Ministry of Health is the overarching body that regulates all healthcare-related activities, including central laboratories, health centres, effective management of health-related crises and training of relevant personnel. The Egypt Drug Authority, an entity within the Ministry of Health, regulates the safety and quality of medicines and pharmaceutical products. The General Authority for Healthcare is in charge of regulating healthcare service providers and supervising how healthcare is delivered to patients. The General Authority for Health Accreditation and Control supervises healthcare service providers' compliance with national and international standards, monitors transparency and set standards for the quality of healthcare. Lastly, the General Authority for Universal Health Insurance is in charge of both the financing and management of the Universal Health Insurance program. One of the key gamechangers in expansion of access to healthcare is Universal Health Insurance coverage, launched by the Government in phases from September 2019. As part of Phase 1, the Government has onboarded 4.5 million citizens as of July 2022 and aims to ensure complete coverage of all citizens by 2032. As part of the 2020-21 budget, the Ministry of Finance announced a 6.6% increase in funds allocated to the development of the healthcare sector to reach SAR65.4 billion (or US$17.4 billion) in 2021. Within that budget, the Ministry of Health is undertaking an ambitious plan of improving reach to existing medical facilities and using smart cities as a hub for new sophisticated healthcare facilities. Under Egypt's Vision 2030, the Government aims to construct smart cities across the country. Fourteen are currently under construction, with four being 95% complete, and another 17 are in pipeline. Vision 2030 also outlines plans to increase the number of hospital beds from 15 per 10,000 population in 2016 to 30 per 10,000 by 2030. In 2021, the number of beds had already climbed to 21 per 10,000, demonstrating the country's progress towards the 2030 goal. In fiscal year 2021, the Government announced a plan to launch 122 hospitals, 35 medical centres, 17 psychiatric hospitals, and eight \"same-day\" outpatient surgery centres, as well as an allocation of SAR1 billion (or US$0.26 billion) for emergency services and intensive care units.www.jamjoompharma.com36Table of Contents Table (3.17): Key Healthcare Indicators, Egypt - 2019G - 2022G and Indicator Unit 2019 - - 9.1% - 98.7 117.0 135.0 155.7 244.9 health goods & medical services% of overall consumer expenditure9.7 9.6 9.8 9.9 9.9 - - Consumer expenditure on health goods & medical servicesSAR per capita 1,006.5 - Prevalence of diabetes in population% of Adult population17.2 17.4 17.5 17.7 18.3 - - of obesity% of Adult population33.3 33.9 34.5 35.0 36.8 - - Prevalence of hypertension% of Adult population25.4 25.3 25.2 - - - - Source: Euromonitor estimates from Ministry of Health, Euromonitor's Economies and Consumers database 3.3.1.2 Iraq Iraq's GDP declined by a CAGR of 8.1% during 2019-2021 to reach SAR744 billion (or US$198.4 billion) in 2021. Political instability and a lack of established processes among Government entities resulted in low investment sentiment until 2020. The only incentive to invest in Iraq was the low corporate tax rate of 15.0%. Ironically, insufficient tax revenues prevented the Government from implementing much-needed infrastructure upgrades to support the healthcare sector, which partially created a window of opportunity for foreign investments to enter the country. While oil attracts the majority of foreign direct investment, other sectors, such as hydrocarbons, construction and public works, and cement production, also attracted investment from international companies like GE, Total Energies and Siemens. The country's per capita disposable income stood at SAR12,083 in 2021 after declining by a CAGR of 3.6% over 2019-2021. During the oil crisis, the Government's fiscal deficit increased, and new measures were adopted that led to tightening of subsidies and transfers. However, despite the slowdown in disposable incomes, increased awareness around maintaining a healthy immune system improved sales of consumer health products. This uptick was challenged by high inflation, which rose to 6.1% in 2021, up from 0.6% in 2020. The Government's National Investment Commission initiative plans to provide incentives to both national and foreign investors in the form of tax breaks, simplified paperwork and allowances for leasing land. Apart from the capital city of Baghdad, there is a lack of hospitals in other regions, which provides a significant opportunity for private investors. One example is the Seema Hospital project, a new 161-bed hospital that is being built in Erbil, in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. The International Finance Corporation is investing US$26 million in the hospital to address gaps in the country's health infrastructure. Similarly, funding of nearly SAR55.6 million (or US$14.8 million) from Kuwait's Fund for Reconstruction of areas affected by terrorist operations in Iraq helped in the completion of 18 projects in the healthcare sector in 2021-2022, focusing on rehabilitation, rebuilding, and equipping hospitals, health centres and laboratories in the governorates of Anbar, Mosul, Salah al-Din, Diyala and Babil. With the easing of COVID-19 lockdowns and stabilising oil prices, Iraq is on the path to economic recovery. GDP is expected to register a strong CAGR of 5.1% over the forecast period to reach SAR955 billion (or US$254.7 billion). Overall consumer expenditure is also expected to grow, at a CAGR of 7.4% over 2021-2026, to reach SAR454.7 billion (or US$121.3 billion), on the back of economic and political stability, steady demographic growth and progress towards the reconstruction of infrastructure and supply chains.

Iraq has a relatively young population with 47.6% aged between 0-18 years in 2021. Despite this young demographic split, which creates demand for child-specific pharmaceutical products such as analgesics and indigestion, malnutrition remains a major area of concern in Iraq, especially among low-income households. The Nutrition Research Institute has implemented intensive training courses and workshops focused on partially offsetting conditions like anaemia in women, low birth weight and neonatal care to reduce malnutrition levels among children. In addition to malnutrition among children, Iraq also reported around 40% of women and 26.5% of men aged over 18 in 2021 suffer from obesity.

However, this is anticipated to change in the future as private insurance companies are evaluating means to coordinate with public and private health facilities to offer health insurance policies with maximum coverage. Start-ups like Tabib Baghdad, Teami, Medchar and Pharx are focused on delivering continuum of care, electronic health records, telemedicine and app-based doctor appointments in their bid to transform Iraq's healthcare ecosystem and ensure last-mile availability of healthcare to all citizens. The Ministry of Health is working to decentralise the healthcare system in coordination with governorates and Primary Health Centres. The aim is to integrate reporting and data collection into a modern system that prioritises disease prevention and supervision. Other regulatory bodies include the Directorate of Health, Directorate of Technical Affairs and the United Iraqi Medical Society for Relief and Development. A National Action Plan for Health Security was developed in March 2020, based on the Joint External Evaluation. Nine areas in the JEE were used as a guideline to identify indicators to bring Iraq's national health system up to International Health Regulation standards in the coming five years. Planned activities to support this outcome include capacity building in hospitals, training for primary and secondary healthcare providers, facilitating increased participation of stabilisation partners, such as the UNDP , and funding and training on Risk Management and International Health Regulations.www.jamjoompharma.com38Table of Contents Table (3.20): Key Healthcare Indicators, Iraq - 2019G - 2022G and Indicator Unit 2019 2020 2021 2022 2026CAGR 2019-21CAGR 2021-26 Consumer expenditure on health goods servicesSAR bn 15.9 13.5 15.3 17.9 22.2 (1.9%) 7.7% Consumer expenditure on health goods & services% of overall consumer expenditure4.8% 4.8% 4.8% 4.8% 4.8% - - Consumer expenditure on per capita 403.4 335.5 372.1 425.6 70.7 70.9 71.0 71.6 - - Prevalence of diabetes in population% of Adult population8.8 8.9 9.0 9.1 9.5 - - Prevalence of obesity% of Adult population29.2 29.8 30.3 32.2 32.6 - - Source: Euromonitor estimates from Ministry of Health, Euromonitor's Economies and Consumers database 3.3.1.3 UAE The UAE's Total GDP reached SAR1,575.1 billion (or US$420 billion) in 2021, after a CAGR decline of 0.2% over the 2019-2021 period mainly due to the dual shock of the pandemic resulting in lower tourism and the significantly high oil prices. The easing of restrictions and stable global oil prices saw the UAE economy rebound in 2021, with further growth forecast for 2022 and beyond. The post-pandemic recovery was partially driven by private investments, infrastructure developments and a continued strong focus on tourism. Expo 2020 acted as a further catalyst supporting the expansion of both the tourism and hospitality sectors. The UAE has signed Free Trade Agreements with several countries to enhance its position as a global trade hub and major destination for investments. The country was the world's 15th largest recipient of foreign direct investment in West Asia, Middle East and North Africa in 2020. As part of the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030 and Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, the Government aims to boost local manufacturing across sectors including creating a pharmaceutical hub. These initiatives are likely to reduce dependence on imports, optimise prices and ensure consistent supply in the country. The Government aims to collaborate with public and private hospitals to evaluate and accredit them in line with international standards to enhance and showcase the quality of medical services and personnel. Based on stringent processes established across several facilities, UAE ranked 22nd in the world index of healthcare innovation, with 221 healthcare facilities, including hospitals and medical centres, that identify, measure and share best practices in healthcare quality. The UAE's economic prospects over 2021-2026 indicate that GDP will grow by a 6.5% CAGR to reach SAR2,162 billion by 2026. Economic growth will mostly be driven by foreign investments, urbanisation and medical tourism as the Government continues to emphasise private sector development to strengthen economic resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce its reliance on the hydrocarbon industry.

In the UAE, the Department of Health works closely with investors to attract high-quality investments into the country, as the UAE Federal Law on Foreign Direct Investment, grants foreign investors 100% ownership in private healthcare facilities such as general and specialised hospitals. The UAE aims to develop an optimal healthcare system by ensuring that public and private hospitals are accredited according to clear national and international quality standards, thereby addressing Vision 2030's medical tourism target. The Ministry of Finance approved a 2022-2026 federal budget that increased the funds allocated to the healthcare sector by 3.5% to SAR4.9 billion (or US$1.3 billion) over 2021 funding. The UAE provides a wide range of Government-funded schemes and a private healthcare sector with state-of-the-art healthcare services. Health insurance policies are an essential part of healthcare services as they cover the costs related to medical treatments. Health insurance coverage varies between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and is different for the expats. The Abu Dhabi Government provides full medical coverage for all UAE nationals living in Abu Dhabi through the Thiqa card. The Health Insurance Law of Dubai ensures residents have a level of health insurance coverage that meets or exceeds the minimum benefits determined by the Dubai Health Authority. Employers cover health insurance for expats, with coverage dependent on salary range and type of policy.

The five core categories in scope (ophthalmology, dermatology, general medicine, gastrointestinal products and nutraceuticals) accounted for 59% of overall market value. A growing population, expanding accessibility of healthcare to a wider population, expansion capabilities of key local manufacturers via investments in R&D (e.g. Minapharm Pharmaceuticals) and a rise in number of both private and public hospitals are key drivers behind strong demand for pharmaceutical products. By 2026, the total pharmaceutical market is anticipated to reach SAR31.5 billion (or US$10.6 billion) after having grown at a CAGR of 5.2%. The five pharmaceutical categories covered in this report\u2014Ophthalmology, Dermatology, General Medicines, Gastrointestinal products and Nutraceuticals \u2014 together grew by 14.3% annually from 2019 to 2021, reaching SAR14.7 billion (or US$3.8 billion) in 2021, up from SAR11.1 billion (or US$2.9 billion) in 2019. Total sales of the five pharmaceutical categories covered in the scope are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% to reach SAR18.9 billion (or US$5 billion) by 2026, supported by strong demographic split, expanding insurance coverage and healthcare services access to consumers along with strong public and private investments including increasing local production and reducing reliance on imports. This includes initiatives to enable local vaccine supply, investments in medical research and providing affordable and effective drugs to Egyptian citizens. Gypto Pharma, a medicine city that opened in 2021, is set to manufacture and produce vitamins, generics and innovative medicines (active chemical or combination of active substances not previously approved). It will also serve as a hub for the export of medical products to neighbouring countries in the region. The Egyptian pharmaceutical market is primarily over-the-counter (non-prescription) and generic-driven, economies of scale, partnerships with distributors, and the local production of drugs. Key distributors in Egypt include the United Company of Pharmacists, Ibn Sina Pharma, Multipharm, Pharma Overseas and Soficopharm. The main challenge in the pharmaceutical value chain is the high dependency on imports of raw materials (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients) and some finished products. Adding to this, the 2022 devaluation of the local currency resulted in higher costs and lower profit margins for local manufacturers. Prices of pharmaceuticals approved by the Egypt Drug Authority do not necessarily follow increases in manufacturing costs, which can lead to the withdrawal of products from the market if they are no longer profitable. The Egypt Drug Authority was established in 2019 as the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population's pharmaceutical regulatory body. It is responsible for the regulation of registration and the administration and control of medical preparations and supplies in addition to developing and implementing policies and regulations to ensure access to pharmaceutical products that are safe and effective. It consists of three sub-organisations, one of which is the Central Administration for Pharmaceutical Affairs, which imposes pricing regulations on pharmaceuticals, with price increases determined by ministerial decree. If the item is imported, prices are based on those in reference countries. Similar to Saudi Arabia, if the product is produced locally, the Egypt Drugs Authority negotiates profit margins with the manufacturer to balance profit against end-consumer price. There is, however, no pricing structure till date for dietary supplements. As part of the ongoing healthcare restructuring, the Egyptian Authority for Unified Procurement was established in 2019 under Egypt's Vision 2030. Its role, similar to NUPCO in Saudi Arabia, is to develop procurement policies, strengthen the country's strategic medical stockpile in the event of exceptional situations, establish annual inventory and collection systems and develop a system for the assessment of medical technology in coordination with requesting parties.

This was mainly because consumer spending on medicines and healthcare was limited to essentials only due to economic instability and the pandemic. A focus on wellness and the need for a strong immune system among young adults resulted in nutraceuticals registering a CAGR of 21.7% over 2019-2021, making it the fastest growing pharmaceutical category. Most pharmaceutical products in Iraq are imported from neighbouring countries, such as Iran, Jordan and Turkey. However, the Government aims to implement policies to encourage local manufacturers to expand their product portfolio. The speed of drug approvals in Iraq is improving, with timelines typically ranging between six months and two years, depending on whether the product is reviewed through the normal or accelerated route. The Government decided to increase access to medicines used for the treatment of chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes and autoimmune diseases through biosimilars. In response, a new committee and supporting guidelines for the approval of biosimilars was released. www.jamjoompharma.com41Table of Contents Government initiatives to increase local production to support affordable pharmaceutical access to the growing population are expected to drive the market for pharmaceuticals, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% to reach SAR9.2 billion (or US$2.45billion). The increasing prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases is attracting multiple foreign manufacturers like Novartis, Merck and Novo Nordisk to invest in these two areas. In line with this, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals is also planning to expand its portfolio between 2022 and 2024, by launching a series of new products in the diabetic portfolio. However, the market for the five categories (ophthalmology, dermatology, gastrointestinal, general medicine and nutraceuticals) is expected to constitute 61% of the overall pharmaceutical market by value in 2026 reaching SAR5.6 billion (or US$1.49 billion). The Ministry of Health purchases large volumes of drugs directly from manufacturers, via The State Company for Marketing Drugs and Medical Appliance (also known as 'Kimadia'). It then distributes them to public hospitals and primary healthcare centres, through the respective governorate's directorates of health. As these drug purchases do not cover all public hospitals and primary healthcare centres' needs, public hospitals and directorates of health procure additional drugs, from either scientific institutions, distributors or large pharmacies (also known as Madkhars), depending on quantity and availability. There are currently about 120-140 Madkhars in Iraq, which trade large volumes of pharmaceutical drugs valued at SAR0.9 million (or US$250,000) per month. The Directorate of Technical Affairs is in charge of approving medicines/vaccines, issuing marketing authorisations, regulatory inspections, controlling the release of medicines and pharmacovigilance. The National Committee for Drugs Selection is responsible for selecting medicines and vaccines for the national essential medicines list and comprehensive medicines list. The Registration Department of the Directorate of Technical Affairs is responsible for the registration (marketing authorisation) of pharmaceutical companies and medicinal products for both the private and public sectors. Despite well-structured organisations, the country still lacks local investments, thus relies heavily on imported medicines to cater to local consumption.

The five pharmaceutical categories covered in this report \u2014 Ophthalmology, Dermatology, General Medicines, Gastrointestinal products and Nutraceuticals - grew at a CAGR of 2.0% up from SAR7.4 billion (or US$1.9billion) in 2019 to reach SAR7.7 billion (or US$2.1 billion) in 2021. Pharmaceutical product growth over the review period is attributed to positive macroeconomic drivers, such as increasing income levels, greater consumer exposure, expanding investments across the country and one of the fastest COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in the world. Most pharmaceutical drugs in the country are imported and prescription drugs account for a larger share of sales than over-the-counter (non-prescription) medicines. This is mainly backed by the mandatory health insurance policy, which provides all insured members with prescription drugs and other therapeutic agents with little or no co-payment. Prescription drugs are far costlier than OTC products mainly due to high research and development costs and expenses incurred by pharmaceutical companies in introducing the drug to the market. Going forward, however, UAE aims to decrease its dependence on imports and optimise prices by investing heavily in the research of development of pharmaceutical and therapeutic products to start manufacturing within the country. This is further evidenced by Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company's (ADQ) strategic acquisition of branded generic manufacturer, Pharmax Pharmaceuticals, and its investment in India's largest biotech company, Biocon, with an aim to acquire know-how and establish a conducive environment to produce biosimilars in the country. The overall pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% to reach SAR21.3 billion (or US$5.7 billion) by 2026. Total sales of the five pharmaceutical categories covered in the report are expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.5% to reach SAR9.2 billion (or US$2.5 billion) by 2026, supported by strategic initiatives focusing mainly on increasing production of pharmaceutical drugs locally as well as the mandatory health insurance policy. The market is also expected to be driven by innovation across a plethora of categories including central nervous system, analgesics and anti-Parkinson drugs, among others. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are expected to remain highly prevalent in the region, with companies introducing medications aimed at lowering cholesterol and heartburn as well as expanding the portfolio of diabetes medicines. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals has already taken a significant leap in the area of gastrointestinal drugs sees cardiovascular as the next potential area to tap into. Nutraceuticals is also expected to influence the overall demand for pharmaceuticals. Driven the success of consumer health products like JP Vitamin D3 and Prima D3 in KSA, the Company is now planning to expand its portfolio and distribute these products in the UAE soon.www.jamjoompharma.com42Table of Contents Sales of pharmaceuticals stagnated during 2019-20. This was mainly due to the expat population moving out of the country during the pandemic owing to subdued non-oil sector growth, particularly in sectors like construction, hospitality and other service sectors that employ a lot of low-skilled workers. Hospitals prioritised COVID-19 treatment over other elective procedures and people stayed indoors as many workplaces shifted to work-from-home arrangements. These factors resulted in lower consumer expenditure on health and medical products.

During COVID-19 lockdowns, working from home, distance learning and hybrid lifestyles resulted in heightened screen exposure. As a result, demand for products that treat screen-related eye disorders such dryness, irritation, burning, hypersensitivity to light and ocular discomfort increased. Pollution in Tier-1 cities, such as Cairo and Alexandria, due to a predominantly dusty climate and the burning of waste in residential areas, also contributed to growth in ophthalmology sales, which grew by a CAGR of 13.1% over 2019-2021. These factors are also likely to ensure a sustained CAGR of 5.1% over the 2021-2026 period, to reach SAR0.58 billion (or US$0.16 billion) by the latter year. Prescription drugs for specific eye conditions constitute the majority of the market, as consumers lack confidence in over-the-counter (non-prescription) medication. However, although classified as prescription drugs, in Egypt, pharmacists play an important role in recommending ophthalmology products, as consumers find it easier and more affordable to seek advice in pharmacies than from a doctor. Local production dominates the Egyptian ophthalmology treatment market, while more specialised products are imported. The Ophthalmology market in Egypt is relatively consolidated, with the top five players accounting for 73.4% of sales in 2021. Alcon Laboratories was the market leaders with a share of 28.9%. It mainly provides over-the-counter (non-prescription) solutions, such as Systane and Tears Naturale, to alleviate dry eye symptoms. Orchidia ranked second with a share of 17.4%. It focuses mainly on affordable medication for glaucoma patients and raising awareness of glaucoma. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals is the third largest ophthalmology company with a share of 11.4% in 2021.The Company's product portfolio is led by HyFresh and HyFresh Gel for symptomatic relief of dry-eye syndrome, followed by Tymer for treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Other popular products include Optidex-T, which has Tobramycin as its active ingredient and is an antibiotic, and Fluca for allergic conjunctivitis and vernal Kerato-Conjunctivitis. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' Xolamol, a generic prescription product that treats elevated intraocular pressure in patients has seen strong traction in recent years. Product promotion, continuous education of healthcare professionals and marketing campaigns were the key factors influencing the competitive position of key market players.

This was primarily due to the departure of key players, a shift in business toward generics and product shortages across the category. The ophthalmology category is projected to increase at a CAGR of 7% between 2021 and 2026, to reach SAR0.3 billion (or US$86.1 million) in 2026. Increased awareness of eye diseases and Government plans to open more eye health centres in Iraq will be the main growth drivers. Most ophthalmic drugs in Iraq are imported. Local production is limited to 2-3 players who have minimal market shares. Medication for glaucoma and other eye infections accounted for most ophthalmic prescriptions. Due to lack of awareness about eye care, people mostly sought advice from doctors resulting in higher consumption of prescription medicines as compared to over-the-counter products. The share of over-the-counter ophthalmology sales is small and mostly focused on eye drops for hydration and treatment of allergies. The market for ophthalmology is highly fragmented, with more than 50 players present in the market. The top five players are all multinational corporations with a well-established presence in the Iraqi market. International players offer a range of ophthalmology-related products to treat bacterial infections and dry eye caused by Iraq's pollution and poor hygiene as well as advanced pharmaceutical and innovative products to treat glaucoma. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals leads the category with a share of 18.8%, well ahead of Alcon Laboratories, Allergan and Cooper, each with shares of around 5%. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals' key strengths are continuous availability and strong relationships with key opinion leaders. Reliability of supply gave medical professionals and pharmacists confidence in recommending their brands, which include a vast array of pharmaceutical products to treat a variety of eye health conditions. Xolamol and Optidex-T emerged as the best-selling ophthalmology prescription medicines, while HyFresh was the best-selling OTC product. Together, these brands contributed to more than half of the company's sales in this category.

A combination of work-from-home and increasingly screen-based lifestyles (the UAE has a very high smartphone penetration rate), saw the UAE's ophthalmology market expand as more people complained of ophthalmic disorders. Refractive difficulties and other conditions that impair vision are driving demand for eye drops among adult and elderly populations. Thus, consumer spending per capita on ophthalmic drugs rose from SAR37 (or US$10) in 2019 to SAR42 (or US$11.2) in 2021. Similar to other markets, over-the-counter (non-prescription) products are limited to eye lubricants used for hydration to treat dryness, redness, itchiness, etc. Most people prefer to consult a specialist for diagnosis. Led by a mixed population of Arab and Asian expats, people are wary of negative side effects from OTC self-medication. As a result, prescription ophthalmic medications are expected to grow faster than OTC drugs. The rise in patients with glaucoma and cataracts as well as other retinal illnesses is influencing the growth of prescription drugs. The ophthalmic drugs market in the UAE is anticipated to grow in line with the rising prevalence of glaucoma and conjunctivitis alongside other concerns such as diabetic macular oedema and Cytomegalovirus retinitis. The country's ageing population will also aid market expansion. Diabetes and its associated disorders are common in the elderly population. Thus, the market for ophthalmic drugs is expected to witness a CAGR of 7.7% over 2022-2026 to reach SAR0.561 billion (or US$0.15 billion) in the latter year. Alcon Laboratories Inc is the market leader in ophthalmic drugs with a value share of 28.8% in 2021. It produces a wide range of over- the-counter (non-prescription) eye drops and ophthalmic drugs ocular allergy/inflammation. Bausch Health ranked second with a share of 13.9% and focuses on OTC eye care products like eye washes, allergy relief and eye vitamins. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals ranked a distant sixth with an estimated 1.2% share of the ophthalmic drugs market in the UAE. Popular Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals products include HyFresh, which contributed one-third of the Company's category sales, Optidex-T and Olopat. eye drops. HyFresh, the Company's only over-the-counter drug, is used to relieve eye discomfort and irritation. Xolamol drops are used to treat pressure inside the eye, while Tymer and Optidex-T treat bacterial eye infections.

Dermatology products in Egypt are mainly driven by local manufacturers in an intensely competitive and price-sensitive market. This, coupled with trends among consumers to get treatment as soon as they have skin issues, were the key market drivers. The category is split equally between over-the-counter (non-prescription) and prescription drugs. Strong competition persists from beauty and personal care products, with manufacturers launching innovative moisturisers and bath products that address dermatological concerns. However, higher skin sensitivity and the desire to prevent potential aggravation of infections is likely to drive dermatology sales in Egypt over the forecast period, with an expected CAGR of 7.9% to reach SAR1.4 billion (or US$0.37 billion) by 2026. Minapharm, Macro, GlaxoSmithKline, Nile and Julphar emerged as the top five players in the category, with shares of 10.4%, 8.6%, 7.5%, 5.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in 2021. A combined share of less than 36% of category sales suggests a relatively fragmented market. Price-sensitivity is the key reason behind the dominance of local players, such as Minapharm, Macro, Nile and Julphar, as consumers perceive very few differences between imported and local brands in products addressing wound healing, scar healing, eczema and dermatitis. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals, with a share of 1.3%, ranked 21st in the dermatology market. Elica-M is the Company's the best-selling dermatology product, which is used to treat Candida skin infections. Acretin Cream, used for symptomatic acne vulgaris, along with SelibetTM Ointment and Lamifen are other key products contributing to category sales in Egypt. Price continues to be the factor limiting sales growth.

Sales of dermatological products recovered marginally in 2021 and are expected to reach pre-pandemic levels between 2022-2023. Prior to the pandemic, which resulted in a brief decline of the category, sales of dermatological products were bolstered by population growth, urbanisation and hygiene problems caused by water and other infrastructure issues. Most dermatological products in Iraq are imported. Due in part to local manufacturers' emphasis on producing lower-cost, higher-volume products, production facilities are generally not equipped to support production of dermatology products. The Government, however, is seeking to invest in local manufacturers, adjusting tendering to favour local players and providing greater opportunities to enhance their capacity, generate more business and strengthen their market position. In 2021, the market was expected to be split equally between over-the-counter (non-prescription) and prescription products, reflecting the fact that consumers consult pharmacists as frequently as dermatologists. The category is projected to increase at a CAGR of 6.9% to www.jamjoompharma.com46Table of Contents reach SAR0.46 billion (or US$0.12 billion) by 2026.

The dermatology market in Iraq is highly fragmented with the top five players accounting for just 28.6% of category sales in 2021. Samarra and Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals were the top two players, with shares of 9.3 and 7.0%, respectively, closely followed by Ajanta Pharmaceuticals with 5.5%. All the leading players are multinational corporations with a well-established presence in the Iraqi market. The top five international players offer prescription products that combat the most common skin conditions, such as acne and fungal infections, and target the country's low hygiene habits that often result in eczema and psoriasis. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals offers a broad range of both non-prescription and prescription products. Support and collaboration with physicians underpin the company's strong position in the market, as does a reliable supply of products. In addition to Elica-M, the Company's best-selling premium product, the brand portfolio includes mass-market topical creams, such as Acretin, Fusibact and Promax targeting price-sensitive consumers. A wide portfolio of treatments for a range of skin conditions will support continued growth for the Company.

Demand for dermatological preparations rose due to increased demand for early diagnosis of skin diseases to prevent the spread of infections. Many people suffer from eczema, mild psoriasis and other skin allergies, which led to increased sales of prescription dermatology products. The share of prescription drugs is improving as health insurance coverage expands in the UAE. As a result, consumers proactively seek the advice of professionals who recommend the right products available to address skin issues. The majority of products are still imported, however, local manufacturers, such as Julphar Gulf pharmaceuticals, are gaining popularity as they produce more-affordable products with the same level of efficacy. Although over-the-counter (non-prescription) products started gaining momentum based on pharmacist recommendations, the rising number of consumers suffering from skin infections or disorders, such as scars, acne and dermatitis is likely to spur continued growth in the forecast period, with an expected CAGR of 6.3% to reach SAR1.6 billion (or US$0.42 billion) by 2026. The market for dermatological products is highly fragmented with the top five players accounting for 42.3% of category sales. The increase in the demand for dermatological treatments resulted in a number of companies investing in research and development of different classes of dermatological drugs. There was also a growing push by the Government to encourage local companies to manufacture dermatological products, with efforts also being made to collaborate and establish partnerships with foreign players. AbbVie is the market leader followed by Galderma, with value shares of 12.9% and 8.6%, respectively, in 2021. AbbVie's products treat psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and chronic inflammatory diseases. Galderma, a Swiss multinational, manufactures and distributes a portfolio of premium prescription and non-prescription dermatological brands such as Cetaphil (used for skin hydration and moisturising) and Aklief (mainly used for the treatment of acne). Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals ranked 12th in the Dermatology category with a 1.9% value share. About 38% of its sales come from Elica-M, an effective treatment for inflammatory and pruritic skin conditions, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Another key product, Fusibact, is used in the treatment of bacterial skin infections such as impetigo and infected dermatitis. The Company's products are preferred by women as they are affordable while offering the same quality as global counterparts.www.jamjoompharma.com47Table of Contents Table (3.37): Dermatology Market Size, UAE -2019-2022 2021-26 Dermatology Market 0.99 1.16 1.23 1.58 6.9% 6.3% % Contribution to the overall pharmaceuticals market % 7.3 7.0 7.2 7.3 7.4 - - Source: Euromonitor calculations based on primary and secondary research Table (3.38): Dermatology Competitive Landscape, UAE - 2021 Competitor / Player Unit Market Share Rank AbbVie Inc % 12.9 1 Galderma % 8.6 2 LEO Pharma A/S % 7.6 3 Johnson & Johnson % 6.7 4 Bayer AG % 6.5 5 Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals % 1.9 12 Others % 55.8 - Source: Euromonitor calculations based on primary and secondary research 3.3.5 General Medicine 3.3.5.1 Egypt The general medicine category reached a value of SAR8.6 billion (US$2.3 billion) in 2021, to account for 35.2% of Egypt's overall pharmaceutical market in 2021. A CAGR of 12.6% over 2019-2021 was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to stockpiling of general medication such as analgesics, antipyretics, antibiotics and antihistamines. This resulted in greater demand for prescription medicine, which was observed to be marginally higher compared to over-the-counter (non-prescription) products. In general, Egyptians prefer to consult a pharmacist rather than a doctor because this allows them to avoid consultation fees and eliminates the need to wait for appointments. In Egypt, most medicines are available over the counter without a prescription, with the exception of certain narcotics. This means that pharmacists frequently fulfil the role of a general practitioner or family physician in other countries. The market for general medicines is mostly generic driven, with limited patented drugs. Locally manufactured brands account for a majority share of the market, with global brands accounting for the remainder. Egypt's growing population and increasing access to healthcare is likely to be a major driver of analgesics sales. Furthermore, unlike over-the-counter (non-prescription) categories, such as cough, cold, and allergy medications, there is no seasonality in analgesic demand patterns. Growing access to healthcare across districts in Egypt is likely to drive the general medicine category to reach SAR10.2 billion (or US$2.7 billion) growing at the lowest CAGR of 3.3% compared to other categories for the forecast period 2021-2026. The general medicine category in Egypt is highly fragments with the top five players accounting for just 34.3% of category sales in 2021. GlaxoSmithKline was the market leader with a share of 10.6%, followed by Pharco Pharmaceuticals with 7.7%, EIPICO with 5.1% and Novartis with 4.7%. GlaxoSmithKline has the financial resources to invest in a wide variety of general medicine products and promotional materials. Other leading players were primarily local brands that offer a vast selection of generic products at competitive prices. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals ranked 21st with a market share of less than 0.1% in 2021. With a limited portfolio, The Company's best-selling product, Azi-Once, contributed to more than 60% of general medicine sales. Azi-Once comes in capsule form for adults and suspension liquid of various antibiotic concentrations for children. Relaxon, a pain relief and mobility medicine that targets muscles was introduced to Egypt in 2020 and saw significant traction in the market. The Company leveraged its versatility by introducing the product in various forms, also providing a variant for children.www.jamjoompharma.com48Table of Contents Table (3.39): General Medicine Market Size, Egypt - 2019-2022 and 2026 Indicator Unit 2019 2020 2021 2022 2026CAGR 2019-21CAGR 2021-26 General Medicine Market Size SAR bn 6.8 7.4 8.6 8.6 10.2 12.6% 3.3% % Contribution of the overall pharmaceuticals market % 35.8 34.6 35.1 35.0 32.4 - - Source: Euromonitor calculations based on primary and secondary research Table (3.40): General Medicine Competitive Landscape, Egypt - 2021 Competitor / Player Unit Market Share Rank GlaxoSmithKline Plc % 10.6 1 Pharco Pharmaceuticals % 7.7 2 Egyptian International Pharmaceutical Industries Co Sae (EIPICO) % 6.2 3 Amoun Pharmaceutical Industry Co % 5.1 4 Novartis AG % 4.7 5 Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals % 0.1 21 Others % 65.6 - Source: Euromonitor calculations based on primary and secondary research 3.3.5.2 Iraq The market for general medicines in Iraq was valued at SAR2.5 billion (or US$0.66 billion) in 2021, after registering a CAGR decline of 3.9% over 2019-21. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government failed to provide adequate treatment for the population, with hospitals and health clinics being overwhelmed. There is a general lack of awareness and knowledge about generic drugs, with most Iraqi nationals relying solely on doctors' prescriptions. This, coupled with a lack of financial stability, resulted in consumers preferring traditional medicine or cheaper alternatives. In 2021, the category saw a marginal recovery on the back of a stabilising economy and rising health awareness on account of COVID-19. The market for general medicines is mainly driven by generics, such as Acetaminophen in analgesics, as well as other commonly used cough, cold and allergy remedies. Currently, the majority of general medicines are imported. The Government is supporting local manufacturers like Sama Alfayhaa and Samarra to increase local production of generics. Regional manufacturers are expected to increase their focus on analgesics, with much of the manufacturing output of Paracetamol being acquired by the Government for use in public hospitals. There is also rising demand for diclofenac as many doctors prescribe diclofenac for a variety of aches and pains. These drivers are expected to grow the market for general medicines by a CAGR of 5.2% over 2022-2026 to reach SAR3.2 billion (or US$0.86 billion) in the latter year. Acino Pharma was the market leader in 2021, with a value share of 6.9%, supported by popular pain relief products, such as Oxycodone and Hydromorphone, which are controlled medications of narcotics. Pharma International Jordan ranked second with a 5.7% share, followed by Al Hikma Pharmaceutical Industries with 5.3%. Al Hikma established a scientific office in Erbil with a dedicated sales team of more than 100 representatives. The remainder of the market is highly fragmented. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals held a 0.6% market share of general medicine with sales of SAR4.1 million in 2021. The Company's best-selling products include Azi-Once (an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections of the respiratory tract, ear, nose, throat and lungs) and Relaxon (pain relief), which together contributed to 88% of the company's category revenues.

Growth was flat as general medicines is a mature category in the UAE. Analgesics /anaesthetics is the largest category within general medicine and benefits from the wide variety of products on offer as well as promotions both in store and online. Nearly two-thirds of general medicines are estimated to be sold as non-prescription/over-the-counter medicines. The lower cost of non-prescription medicines, coupled with a rising preference for self-medication and the need to avoid consultations for prescription medicines, served as a key growth driver for sales of over-the-counter products. In 2021, the easing of the pandemic saw residents resuming both indoor and outdoor activities, which is likely to support further demand for topical analgesics/anaesthetics. The category is also expected to continue to expand with new players entering the market providing niche offerings and targeting specific demographics. Population growth, attractive visa and investment schemes and an upbeat employment scenario are expected to support market growth, with sales of general medicine expected to grow by a CAGR of 2.0% over the forecast period to reach SAR5.3 billion (or US$1.4 billion) by 2026. The majority of general medicine products are imported. Consumers in the UAE prefer branded products as they are perceived to be of higher quality and have established a sense of trust with consumers. Popular medicines for fever, inflammation and treating pain like Panadol, Voltaren and Ibuprofen are imported while others, like Adol and Neomol, are locally manufactured. The top five players held a combined share of 29.0% in value terms in 2021, indicating a fragmented market. The leading players were GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Julphar Gulf Pharmaceuticals with value shares of 12.6%, 5.9% and 4.1%, respectively, in 2021. Despite being led by globally established brands, in August 2019, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer combined their consumer healthcare businesses in a joint venture. Their portfolio now includes popular products like Voltaren, Panadol and Advil, in addition to brand extensions in the paediatrics space. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals reported a market share of less than 0.1% in 2021. It was mostly focused on producing drugs used for pain relief and common bacterial infections. Similar to other markets, Azi-Once and Relaxon were the main contributors to category revenue. Other prominent medicines included Ciproxin, which is used to treat bacterial infections, and Fastflam, which is used to treat muscle ache, back pain and joint pain.

Gastrointestinal problems, autoimmune diseases, hyperacidity, gastrointestinal ulcers and unhealthy lifestyles are driving growth in this category. Obesity (prevalence of 16.5% in 2021), smoking (estimated at 30.6% of the adult population in Egypt as of 2021 and seasonal food consumption, particularly during the Holy month of Ramadan, represent other key growth drivers. In Egypt, most gastrointestinal medicines are prescribed, accounting for a majority share of category sales due to the need for medical assessment and stronger specialised drugs. Local manufacturing dominates the category, with most of the drugs produced in Egypt. Growing investments in this category and the introduction of new generics and innovative products are likely to drive category growth to reach SAR2.9 billion (or US$0.78 billion) by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 8.3% over the forecast period, 2021-2026. The market for gastrointestinal products is highly fragmented with around 75 established players estimated to be generating category revenues of at least SAR1 million (or US$0.27 million) per annum. This meant that the top five players held a combined share of just 36% of category sales in 2021. Local players, Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Amoun Pharmaceutical Industry and Aug Pharma led the market with value shares of 8.5%, 8.4% and 8.3%, respectively, in 2021, while Acino Pharma was the only international player in the top five, with a share of 6.7%. Local players offer products of comparable quality to imported brands at significantly lower prices. Pharco Pharmaceuticals' most popular gastrointestinal remedies include Fawar antacid and Rani H2 blocker. Amoun Pharmaceutical Industry has a diverse portfolio led by Emetrex, a treatment for nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal bleeding. AstraZeneca's Nexium and Losec, which treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, are also popular among Egyptian customers. Portfolio diversification and innovation within the gastrointestinal category may be critical for local manufacturers to further strengthen their market position. In 2021, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals was not present in the gastrointestinal system category. The Company is in the process of opening a manufacturing plant in Egypt (by end of 2022) to secure easier access to the market. The Company is looking to leverage this to expand into the gastrointestinal system category.

The high prevalence of obesity and increased consumption of foods with high amounts of fat combined with sedentary lifestyles resulted in a higher number of people having gastrointestinal problems and heartburn. While the volume of medicines sold in the market increased, the market witnessed a decline in value terms. The lack of economic stability during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in people spending less and shifting to alternatives like traditional medicines and lower-priced counterfeit drugs coming in from neighbouring markets. With the country expected to see greater stability and economic improvements projected for the next few years, it is likely that disposable incomes will increase. The rising frequency of eating out, lack of access to hygienic water and limited exercise is likely to drive demand for gastrointestinal products. Some consumers may also choose to shift to well-known imported brands when the economic situation improves, as they are perceived to be more effective. Thus, the market for gastrointestinal products is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% over 2021-2026 to reach SAR0.86 billion (or US$0.23 billion). While part of the population relies on doctors' prescriptions, others prefer pharmacists' advice and opt for medication over the counter, which can be either prescription or non-prescription drugs. Most gastrointestinal products are imported, while local companies like Pioneer Co are aiming to increase their share of the market. Leading players in the category were AstraZeneca, Ajanta Pharma and Julphar Gulf Pharmaceuticals with value shares of 12.0%, 7.3% and 5.4%, respectively, in 2021. Fourth and fifth ranked Pioneer Co Pharmaceutical Industries and Samaraa Pharmaceuticals are local players. Pioneer Co Pharmaceutical Industries aggressively markets its products targeting gastrointestinal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome. In a fragmented market, several global players are introducing new products and adopting different go-to-market strategies to penetrate this category. With several players recording similar sales, the market is dynamic in terms of product ranking, efficacy and availability. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals held a 1.5% share in 2021, ranking 13th in the market. This position was mainly driven by three products: Rabezole, used in the treatment of gastrointestinal reflux disease, Dompy used to relieve nausea and vomiting, and Meva capsules, for irritable bowel syndrome. The Company aims to leverage the success of these products, particularly Dompy, to expand distribution in Iraq as well.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated healthy living trends, which resulted in muted growth for gastrointestinal drugs. People chose to make nutritional changes to their diet, reduced the frequency of eating out and decreased consumption of fatty foods. There was also an increase in consumption of probiotic and nutritional foods as well as at-home exercise equipment. Over-the-counter (non-prescription) treatments for the gastrointestinal tract are available and are used to treat nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea and flatulence. The high adoption of non-prescription medications is due to their easy affordability and accessibility. R&D activities, such as drug innovation, and high demand for self-medication are the key factors driving growth in the over the counter (non-prescription) gastrointestinal drugs category. The market has limited penetration by multinational pharmaceutical companies as well as a few manufacturers from the Middle East, such as Julphar Gulf Pharmaceuticals, Oman Pharmaceutical Products Co and Dar-Al-Dawa. As categories like gastrointestinal and cardiovascular drugs are highly priced, local manufacturers are targeting these segments to give access to lower-priced products. However, perceived side effects associated with the drugs hamper growth. Over 2021-2026, the market for gastrointestinal drugs is expected to decline by a CAGR 0.5% to stand at SAR0.99 billion by the end of the period. The market is fragmented with intense competition from established players with legacy products as well as new players. Acino Pharma and AstraZeneca ranked first and second, with value shares of 13.4% and 12.6% respectively in 2021. Acino-DSR capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat acid reflux and peptic ulcers due to indigestion, heartburn, stomach pain and irritation while Nexium tablets, an over-the-counter medication from AstraZeneca, are popular among consumers for similar functionality. Julphar Gulf Pharmaceuticals, which ranks third with a 9.0% share, stands out as the only local manufacturer in the top five. Similar to other markets, ease of registration for OTC gastrointestinal products provides room for several players to enter the market. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals recorded a value share of 0.4% in Fixit. Dompy, used to treat indigestion, nausea and vomiting, was the Company's most popular gastrointestinal product, contributing to almost 60% of its category sales. Meanwhile, Zoron, the Company's most recent launch in the category, in 2019, has seen strong acceptance across markets and is used for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in gastroenteritis.

Consumers looking to strengthen their immune systems in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic were the key drivers of growth in the nutraceuticals category. The Egypt Drug Authority's more permissive approach to regulation to include a broader range of products, is expected to drive this category over the forecast period. No regulation on the number of nutraceuticals in a pharmaceutical box, helped simplify market penetration, which, in turn, increased growth in vitamins and dietary supplements. More than half of the nutraceuticals sold in Egypt are manufactured locally to cater to the highly price-sensitive market. Local producer, Nerhadou International, led the nutraceuticals category with a share of 10.1% in 2021, with popular products such as Ferrotron, Octatron, and Calcitron. GlaxoSmithKline ranked second with a share of 9.0%, followed by Pharco Pharmaceuticals with 8.2%, Amoun Pharmaceutical Industry with 4.0% and Eva Pharma with 2.5%. Due to steep price hikes following the devaluation of the Egyptian pound in March 2022 and the economic effects of COVID-19, the popularity of imported dietary supplements is expected to wane in favour of local alternatives. Imported products are becoming expensive even for higher-income consumers. However, rising demand for nutraceuticals as a preventive medicine will lead to growing acceptance of the quality of local products. A CAGR of 8.7% is forecast for the 2021-2026 period to reach a value of SAR3.8 billion (or US$1 billion) by 2026. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals was not present in the nutraceuticals category. Establishment of a planned manufacturing facility in Egypt is likely to provide Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals with the visibility and opportunity to penetrate the nutraceuticals market in Egypt.

Many consumers started taking vitamins and nutritional supplements to strengthen their immune systems due to concerns over COVID-19. As such, demand for products like vitamin C, vitamin B and multivitamins increased significantly. Brands are actively engaging and promoting their products through social media while doctors have started recommending vitamins, calcium tablets and other dietary supplements. As many low-income consumers suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, many obtain free vitamins and nutritional supplements through NGOs or from public healthcare facilities. Similar to other categories, as most products are imported, pricing and doctors recommendations are the most important factors when it comes to purchasing decisions. Hence, most manufacturers incentivise doctors to recommend their products to their patients. Manufacturers are moving away from traditional advertising and increasingly using social media as a cost-effective way to encourage people to try their brand. Doctors are increasingly recommending single vitamins and calcium supplements for micronutrient deficiencies as well as for improved fertility, which is a major concern among Iraqis. Pharmacies and para-pharmacies account for the largest share of vitamin and dietary supplement sales, while health food stores and supermarkets/hypermarkets are gaining share. OTC drugs account for the majority of nutraceutical sales. Rising disposable incomes and increasing consumer confidence are likely to benefit the category, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.2% to reach SAR0.8 billion (or US$0.2 billion) by 2026. Hansa-Pharm leads the category with its key product, Hansal Zinc. TSD ranks second followed by Sterling Pharmacy and Premier Health Products. Despite its premium prices, Sterling Pharmacy is well-respected due to the good reputation of its vitamin D3 and B Complex products. Due to daily consumption of multivitamins, middle-class consumers are typically price sensitive, creating opportunities for lower-priced brands like Beximco's Aristovit-M and ESB's BioActive T an advantage. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals doesn't currently have an established Nutraceuticals presence in Iraq.

Growing health awareness among young consumers and the need to reduce dependency on other pharmaceutical products in old age were key growth drivers in this category. Nutritional supplements are being positioned as a natural and healthy substitute to traditional and other pharmaceutical medications in the UAE. Tonics are popular among local consumers search for an alternative form of dietary supplements. Newer tonics promoted on social media platforms not only emphasise immune-boosting functionality but also claim detoxification and weight loss properties, which tend to appeal to the younger population. With the easing of the pandemic in 2021, consumers started to spend more time out of their homes, adding vitamins to their grocery baskets in supermarkets. The channel remains in a strong position and offers further potential to penetrate the category over the forecast period due to convenience, competitive prices and a wide range of OTC products. Government initiatives to promote health and wellness, and an increasing focus on pediatric nutrition also fuelled nutraceuticals growth in the UAE. Nutraceuticals for infant diets is a new trend that has gained traction in the UAE. Due to rapidly growing online distribution channels and efficient logistic support, companies have access to a much broader consumer base. This combined with an increasing working-class population, growth over 2021-2026, with an expected CAGR of 16.0% boosting sales to SAR0.76 billion by 2026.www.jamjoompharma.com55Table of Contents Vitabiotics was the market leader in nutraceuticals in the UAE with a value share of 20.4% in 2021. It established its presence across multiple e-commerce platforms with popular products such as Freglobin and osteocare chewable. They are designed to protect the body against organ degeneration and aid in the prevention of chronic diseases. Merck ranked second with a 10.3% value share followed by GlaxoSmithKline, also with 10.3%. In 2021, GlaxoSmithKline launched two new extensions to its Botanicals line of gummy and powder dietary supplements (Emergen-C Ashwagandha and Emergen-C Apple Cider Vinegar) to offer products that address key areas of wellness like immune support and stress reduction. With no stringent regulations in place to govern the release of new vitamins and dietary supplements, the UAE is estimated to have 50 well-established nutraceuticals players with an additional 70 players who have registered minor sales for this category. In this fragmented market, Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals has no presence in this category in the UAE. However, strong growth potential and low barriers to market entry present an opportunity for Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals.

More specifically, the Company is a leader in the main markets of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates where the Company operates and which provides the Company a solid position and the capacity to adapt and be sustainable. The Company's ability to achieve market leadership positions in these markets and therapeutic areas is founded in its broad portfolio of high quality and differentiated branded generic pharmaceutical and consumer health products in each therapeutic area, as well as the deep understanding of the demand dynamics of the MEA market that the Company has amassed from its longstanding experience and presence in these markets, which has helped it to become part of the top four (4) of the largest manufacturers in the Kingdom as of 2021G, (please refer to Section 3 (\"Industry and Market data\") for more information on the Company's competitive landscape).In addition, the Company ranked as the number two (2) manufacturer for total prescribed pharmaceutical products in Saudi Arabia for the years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and for Q1 and Q2 of 2022G 4. The markets the Company operates in are large, structurally attractive and growing. Attractive demographic conditions including an ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, and improving access to healthcare are amongst the key drivers spurring market growth. It is estimated by Euromonitor 5 that the overall KSA market size will grow from SAR 30.5 billion in 2021G to SAR 39.6 billion in 2026G implying a 5.4% CAGR over that period. Additionally, Euromonitor's assessment of key MEA markets growth points along with the attractive rates across Egypt, United Arab Emirates and Iraq imply that the markets will grow at 5.4%, 3.5% and 6.1% 2021G-2026G CAGRs respectively. Growth in each of these markets is also supported by social and macroeconomic trends including growing penetration of generic medicines and the inherent belief the Company has that its products tend to perform well due to customer preferences. Furthermore, there are strong government-led incentives and public investments to boost the local healthcare and manufacturing sectors as part of its Vision 2030 objectives to encourage higher private sector participation in the KSA economy. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a core focus as stipulated in the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program, with a target that 40% of all pharmaceuticals consumed in the country be produced domestically, an increase from approximately 30% today. This governmental support provides a strong tailwind for the Company as a leading domestic manufacturer, which will help it to capture additional market share in the coming years. In addition, the Company's market position benefits from naturally high barriers to entry, providing it with powerful competitive advantages in the markets the Company operates in including (but not limited to): 4 Source: IQVIA Saudi Arabia Medical Index (SAMI), Q2- 2022G. Note: SAMI covers the total prescription data for pharmaceutical products in the Private sector (Private Hospitals, Clinics, Polyclinics). 5 Euromonitor market report prepared in August 2022G. y The complex regulatory environment that the pharmaceuticals sector operates within requires both precise scientific expertise and significant understanding to ensure operations are conducted in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements as well as familiarity and experience in operating in its markets, particularly with regards to navigating the registrations and other approvals needed to offer the products in the markets. y There is a limited pool of personnel in the MEA region which possesses these critical skills and experience so the Company's leading market position allows it to both attract and retain staff, which would be challenging for a new market entrant to establish from scratch. y The substantial investment in facilities, processes, machinery and other infrastructure required to establish a high standard pharmaceutical manufacturing operation, including obtaining the necessary regulatory authorizations required, which would be challenging for new entrants to develop from scratch, strengthening the position of incumbent providers such as the Company. y As a leading and highly reputable pharmaceuticals manufacturer in the Kingdom, the Company has developed the skills, understanding, track record, reputation and knowhow to navigate the sometimes complex government tender frameworks as well as having the scale and capability to deliver the large volumes associated with these tenders at competitive prices. As a local manufacturer, the Company is also able to benefit from beneficial pricing frameworks offered to KSA manufacturers that international manufacturers cannot access. The Company's KSA location gives it an advantage over international competitors in this market as the KSA government continues to actively promote and support local production of critical healthcare products, in line with its Vision 2030 objectives. Finally, the Company's large-scale investment in developing an on-the-ground sales force presence over many years in several of the countries the Company operates in gives it a deep understanding of the nuances of market demand dynamics and an ability to respond with speed and agility. The Company is one of the few players that has a large established sales force operating in its markets and that is in large part due to the substantial investment required to develop one. 4.3.2 Proven R&D track-record with outstanding product development and substantial white space opportunities to tap into new therapeutic areas The Company's R&D capabilities are a key component of the successes that the Company has achieved since its foundation and its ability to develop and commercialize new and innovative products that are tailored to the demands of the markets it operates in is a critical differentiator from its competitors. The Company has a proven track-record of bringing high quality and differentiated products to its markets which has helped to drive absolute and market share growth. The Company has a large R&D team of over 90 scientists and PhD graduates, providing it with a unique pool of pharmaceutical talent in the region and has a demonstrable track record of successfully bringing products to market in all the regions it operates in, as evidenced by over 400 product approvals (across products and markets, including registration renewals) that the Company has received between www.jamjoompharma.com58Table of Contents 2019G and the date of this Prospectus. The Company's approved products have a bioequivalence success rate of 94%. Additionally, the team has experience in developing products across a wide range of different dosage forms including soft-gel, blow-fill seals, oral solid dosages, injectables, ointment and cream, and many others to directly expand the Company's portfolio offering. This expertise is applied to continuing to broaden the therapeutic areas covered by the Company portfolio, such as via the expansion into the Diabetes Care market, as well as to continue to expand the product range within existing therapeutic areas, thus helping to increase penetration and market share in these established market segments. The Company was successful in launching 17 new products in 2021G. Additionally, the Company has 72 new products in the pipeline, 64% of which have either been submitted for approval to the SFDA or are close to submission. In general, the new products are a material factor in the growth of the Company's business as they have contributed to 4%, 8% and 18% of the total revenues of the Company in the financial years 2019G, 2020G and 2021G, respectively. The R&D capability that the Company has built allows it to identify and develop products that are suitable to the market needs. For example, in 2015G and 2019G respectively the Company launched two consumer health products, \"JP Vitamin D3\" and \"Prima D3\" . The aim of these two products was to capitalize on favorable demographics identified which showed that 80% of the KSA adult population was suffering with some form of vitamin D deficiency and over 45% of the market was dominated by liquid products, which are less effective than solid-dose alternatives. As a result of these conditions, the Company created a formula for an alternative soft-gel product with a better absorption and stability rate to, then, launch a full suite of vitamin D products that gained popularity with the local market which, in turn, helped it to capture a 40% market share in this category by 2021G, with sales of SAR 35 million for the Consumer Health segment, a 19% CAGR 2017G-2021G. 4.3.3 Diversified portfolio offering with proven leading positions in key categories, benefitting from high brand awareness and sold through a targeted commercial footprint The Company's leading position in the MEA generics market is derived from its specialized portfolio of well-established and differentiated products across 8 therapeutic areas including ophthalmology, dermatology, consumer health, general medicine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, over-the-counter, and central nervous system, where its products are sold in 36 countries across the MEA region with over 100 brands registered in KSA alone since 2019G. The Company uses a strategic approach to focus on key therapeutic areas where it sees potential to yield improved results through cost optimization and operating efficiencies. This is done through co-positioning and co-promotion opportunities; enhanced corporate awareness and branding; better Key Opinion Leader (KOL) relationships and Rx opportunities. Owing to the firm's policy of seeking to produce high quality products to address gaps identified in the market, the Company has successfully grown its market share. In 2021G, the Company ranked as the number one (1) manufacturer (by value) for ophthalmology products and the number two (2) manufacturer (by value) for dermatology products in Saudi Arabia (calendar year 2021G only) 6 respectively - segments which are set to continue to exhibit strong growth over the coming years, according to Euromonitor analysis. Dermatology and ophthalmology represent approximately 50% of total revenues, as of 31 December 2021G. In ophthalmology, Euromonitor analysis indicates that the KSA ophthalmology market is expected to grow from SAR 0.7 billion in 2021G to SAR 1.1 billion in 2026, implying 8.9% CAGR over the period and the Company aims to continue to strengthen its position in the market with the launch of a dedicated ophthalmology sterile manufacturing plant in Jeddah expected in H2 2023G. In dermatology, Euromonitor analysis indicates that the KSA dermatology market is expected to grow from SAR 2.4 billion in 2021G to SAR 3.9 billion in 2026G, implying 10.3% CAGR over the same period and the Company plans to build on its success via continued educational partnerships with physicians coupled with a highly effective skin disease portfolio of 14 brands that account for 19% of total revenue, as of 31 December 2021G. In General Medicine, Euromonitor analysis indicates that the KSA market of the general medicine products is expected to grow from SAR 10 billion in 2021G to SAR 10.6 billion in 2026G, implying 1% CAGR over the same period. The Company offers a well-established range of products commanding a leadership position in multiple product categories through 15 trusted brands and plan to accelerate its growth in this segment through continued expansion of the product range in the coming years. The Company's broad and diversified product portfolio, which includes products from various selected therapeutic categories, enables the Company to cover all areas through its products in the market. The performance of each product is assessed individually, to ensure that the overall portfolio achieves the best commercial results before and after the products are offered in the market. The Company is ranked as the number four (4) manufacturer of gastrointestinal products (by value) in Saudi Arabia for the period starting from January 2022G to May 2022G (YTD May 2022G) 7 , and expects to continue capitalizing on this momentum through the ongoing success of popular products such as Dompy and Zoron. In Consumer Health, the Company's expansion into this segment since the opening of its state-of-the-art soft gel manufacturing facility, which was the first of its kind in the GCC region, has proven to be extremely successful and it now holds the number three ranking in the segment in KSA, producing an assortment of relevant products including Omega-3, vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements under 31 brands. 6 Source: IQVIA Saudi Arabia Pharmaceutical Index (SAPI), January 2022G.

The Company is one of the largest pharmaceutical exporters in KSA and its team of highly trained on-the-ground sales staff is comprised of 506 employees including 402 medical representatives focused on maximizing sales and brand awareness with local stakeholders. Its sales force efforts are concentrated in its key markets (KSA, Egypt, UAE and Iraq), though it has a direct sales & marketing presence in 8 countries with export sales with local partners in the remaining 28 countries it serves. This balanced approach allows the Company to develop deep local expertise and understanding of the regulatory requirements and demand dynamics of its most important markets whilst efficiently maintaining an export sales business in many additional markets and supporting its proven ability to successfully enter territories that have been overlooked by the Company's international competitors. The Company's established track record and reputation for quality and leadership across its chosen therapeutic areas, as well as the strength of its relationship with the SFDA and other regulatory bodies has been reflected in its inclusion in the prestigious Reyadah NCPP (National Companies Promotion Campaign) programme, a KSA governmental initiative to help major and promising companies within KSA expand internationally. 4.3.4 State of the art manufacturing and highly efficient operations The Company operates a modern manufacturing facility in Jeddah, KSA and is in the process of constructing an additional facility in Cairo, Egypt (expected to be opened during the second half of 2023G) and a sterile facility in Jeddah (expected to be opened during the second half 2023G). All facilities are fully fitted out with world-class machinery and equipment and when operational will give the Company a total combined production capacity of 190 million units per annum. By operating facilities in both KSA and Egypt, the Company stands to benefit from geographical diversification and better optimized supply chain processes across its 36 active countries. All 3 facilities are powered by advanced machinery and manufacturing lines from renowned blue-chip manufacturers such as Bosch, Getinge and Steris with broad and flexible production capabilities for a wide range of product forms including oral solid dosage, dermatology, ophthalmology, and sterile formulations spanning multiple therapeutic area segments, thus enabling it to become a leading generics manufacturer in the region through a comparatively lean and efficient local manufacturing footprint. The Company has invested SAR 362 million in constructing its manufacturing facilities Egypt Main and Jeddah Sterile as of 31 December 2021G. Through careful design and thoughtful kit-out of its plants, the Company is able to operate its current facilities to manufacture 100% of its products whilst incurring only modest maintenance capital expenditures amounting to 1.8% of revenue (as of 31 December 2021G), contributing to its strong free cash flow generation. Moreover, the Company ensures that its ISO-certified facilities are operated at all times in line with international best practices, as evidenced by the Company's history of zero manufacturing interruptions since inception and continuous compliance. The new facilities being constructed will provide the Company with several advantages. The substantial increase in manufacturing capacity will ensure that the Company has sufficient capacity to accommodate the significant increase in volumes expected over the coming years, including continuing expansion of the product range across all therapeutic areas and new entry into additional therapeutic areas. In addition, the Egypt Main Facility will act as a source of redundancy and flexibility for the current Jeddah plant and is intended to become the hub for production and distribution of the Company's entire product range across the African markets served by the Company. Furthermore, by locating the manufacturing facility in Egypt, the Company will become a local producer in that country too and will be able to benefit from regulatory incentives offered by the Egyptian government which currently prohibits international manufacturers from registering more than a fixed number of products in the country - once the Egypt Main Facility is operational this cap will be lifted and the Company will be able to offer its full range in Egypt and benefit from the additional sales resulting from this important growth market. The Jeddah Sterile facility has been planned in order to provide additional manufacturing capacity for the Company's sterile products, which are highly successful and experiencing particularly strong demand. 4.3.5 Compelling financial profile with robust and sustainable growth prospects Strong top-line performance over the years has been a key focus for the Company since its inception, driven by organic growth, portfolio expansion and expanding its geographic footprint in the long term. Moreover, the Company's revenue demonstrated high resilience throughout the Covid-19 period as revenues remained stable despite unprecedented local and global disruption including, but not limited to, supply chain issues, factory interruptions as a result of nationwide lockdowns, and macroeconomic volatility. This was supported in particular by the KSA government introducing requirements for businesses to hold enhanced inventory levels to ensure continuity of supply of critical products, including medicines for a minimum of 6 months. This contributed to an exceptional level of demand for the Company in 2020G as pharmacies built up their stock levels, followed by an unwinding period in 2021 after the minimum inventory requirement was relaxed and this de-stocking impact unwound through the sector. (Please refer to Section 6 (\"Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Operating Results\") of this Prospectus for further discussion on recent performance). Another key highlight in its financial performance is the Company's consistent and sustained high profitability, particularly in comparison to peers in the sector. The Company has achieved stable EBITDA margins of approximately between 29-34% over the last 3 years. In addition, the Company's ongoing COGS optimization plan, which seeks to reallocate manufacturing resources towards key brands, will help it to drive continued margin expansion as the most profitable products and regions are targeted for enhanced focus. Furthermore, the Company's margins are amongst the highest of any pharma manufacturer in the region and its operational excellence provides it with important commercial and strategic advantages when seeking new market opportunities and in customer and supplier negotiations in addition to providing superior profitability and returns for its shareholders. The Company has consistently delivered strong free cash flow throughout its history and this has become an important strength in the market place. To date the Company has pursued a highly disciplined capital policy and have developed the company without resorting www.jamjoompharma.com60Table of Contents to substantial debt financing. Furthermore, its balance sheet strength has provided it with enhanced optionality when appraising growth and investment opportunities and allows the Company to pursue its strategic objectives with speed and flexibility, whilst ensuring that its liquidity and balance sheet strength is not compromised. 4.3.6 Seasoned strategic leadership team The Company is led by a vastly experienced executive team with substantial experience that have held leadership positions at leading global pharmaceutical manufacturing companies including. The Company's leadership team adopts a hands-on approach where its reach extends throughout the whole organization as it guides and supports the firm's overall evolution across every department. (Please see Section 5 (\"Organizational structure and corporate governance\") for the management team's CV credentials of this Prospectus). 4.4 Company Strategies The Company's strategy is formed of the following 5 key pillars providing a framework for working towards realization of the Company's Vision and Mission. 4.4.1 Clearly defined 5 year strategy to become a leading MEA organization by 2026G via selective expansion to deliver growth in key markets and strengthen the Company's local presence The Company has developed a tailored and graduated strategy to accelerate and prioritize growth in targeted key markets, which have been identified as having the highest potential opportunity for the Company to expand its revenue base. Through this segmentation, the management team has been able to deploy resources in key markets to redirect focus and enhance the quality of growth whilst optimizing its production and distribution processes which are expected to maximize operational efficiency. The Company intends to continue to expand within the MEA region and expects to enter selected additional markets in the coming years, as it believes additional regions around the world would appreciate the presence of a high-quality pharmaceutical champion. The Company will continue to expand within sizable countries where its portfolio can add value to the healthcare community. In the near to the medium term the expansion markets will be focused on the Middle East and Africa regions. Furthermore, the Company aims to adopt a carefully selective approach towards products and target markets. The identified key markets across its geographic clusters will form the basis of its commercial focus going forward, attracting increased time, effort and resources in these markets in order to ensure that the substantial commercial opportunities that are available to the Company are captured to their fullest extent possible. The Company will also treat these markets as a cornerstone for its standout products, compounding the growth opportunities by driving its best performing products in its best performing markets, whilst leveraging the strength of its local sales forces. 4.4.2 Investing in multiple opportunities for portfolio expansion via R&D in both existing and new therapeutic areas A critical component of the Company's strategy is to contribute to achieve national and regional self-sufficiency through optimizing new product launches and venturing into new therapeutic areas. Optimization of new product launches will be achieved through reducing the time-to-market through efficient R&D, governance and decision making. Coupled with this, identifying and capitalizing on growth opportunities in new therapeutic areas will be done through rigorous investing in research and development with diligent portfolio management and well-grounded market research to aid in decision making on promising therapeutic areas. This strategy is reflected in a recent case study, whereby the Company recognized the prevalence of diabetes in the region as a potentially strong therapeutic area for it to enter. To capture market share within this therapeutic area, the Company is developing a range of high-quality diabetes management products, with expected launches into the market between 2022G and 2024G. 4.4.3 Expand in tender opportunities regionally The Company will continue to grow its presence in the KSA public tender market, capitalizing on tender system reform and government support for championing high quality providers of essential products from within the Kingdom via two national-led strategies, Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program (NTP). Having already found success in the space by securing an important 2-year tender in 2020G, the Company will build on this success and utilize its position as a leading KSA pharmaceutical manufacturer to become a key strategic supplier to the Kingdom's public healthcare system through reducing the cost of manufacturing and procurement. In order to ensure the opportunities for government tender business are fully captured, the Company intends to establish a dedicated team to increasing participation in public tender contracts in all key markets such as KSA, the Gulf, Iraq, and Egypt across its product range.www.jamjoompharma.com61Table of Contents 4.4.4 Drive operational effectiveness and enhance governance The Company plans to continue to build on introducing operational efficiencies in manufacturing to drive cost reduction, minimization of waste, implementation of efficient inventory management solutions, registration of alternate suppliers and improvement in local content scores. The Company expects that these actions will help to enhance collaboration and cohesive working by the manufacturing and commercial teams as well as refine the production and reallocation of resources. As a result, the Company will be able to increase both, volumes and margins, for key products through improved cost efficiency and economies of scale. In addition, the Company plans to expand its manufacturing footprint via the commissioning of the Egypt facility to serve the North African markets which supports its strategy of selectively expanding market presence. In addition, the company will continue to implement its ongoing digital transformation. Alongside the installation of technologically advanced manufacturing equipment, the Company is modernizing its facilities, systems and processes with best-in-class software and technology. This will ensure that the company is well equipped to deliver on its planned growth trajectory and is able to scale its monitoring, compliance, reporting, control and communications commensurately. Finally, the Company will also continue to maintain its strict financial discipline and preserve the strength of its balance sheet to pursue strategic objectives, through a governance model that reflects best practices and international standards of transparency and efficiency. 4.4.5 Developing, nurturing and retaining talent The pharmaceutical manufacturing industry demands specialized skillsets in all areas of human resources. The Company's strategy for human capital is to enhance its exceptional talent base through: y Attracting the best talent locally & globally; y Investment in development programs offered by the Company to its employees to enrich their skillset through the Jamjoom Pharma Academy (for more information on the Jamjoom Pharma Academy please refer to Section 4.14.1 (\"Jamjoom Pharma Academy\") of this Prospectus).; and y Instill succession planning to align with global best practices. y Continuing in the support of female employment and Saudization, by building on the current 60% female employee base in the factory team. Through this strategy, the Company aims to formulate a solid connection between the tasks of its employees and the achievement of the Company's Vision and Mission. 4.5 Key Developments of the Company since Establishment The Company has its roots in the various business enterprises of the Jamjoom family, which entered the Saudi pharmaceutical market in the 1960s with the distribution of imported pharmaceuticals from large international companies, becoming one of the top distributors in Saudi Arabia by the 1970s. In the 1990s, the Jamjoom family's enterprises began pharmaceutical manufacturing, establishing the Company as a branch and constructing a manufacturing facility in Jeddah, which commenced operations in 2000G with the manufacturing of branded generic drug products in the ophthalmic segment. Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory Company was converted from a branch of Abdullatif Mohammed Salah Jamjoom and Brothers Company into a limited liability company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and was subsequently converted to a closed joint stock company pursuant to ministerial resolution no. 202/S, dated 19/08/1435H (corresponding to 17/06/2014G) approving the publication of the Company's conversion into a joint-stock company.

The most significant raw material used in the manufacturing process are API, which comprised 74% of all raw material purchases in FY21G. Other key materials include excipients, EGC and coating materials, which comprised 22%, 3% and 2% respectively, of all raw material purchases in FY21G. The Company sources its API from suppliers around the world. The Company sources primary packaging materials such as bottles and foils primarily from suppliers in Europe. Secondary packaging such as cartons and leaflets are sourced locally within Saudi Arabia. 4.9.3.1.2 Supply Strategy With approximately API and raw materials costs representing approximately 11% of the Company's revenue in the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G, API sourcing from 95 suppliers represents one of the Company's largest cost components. The Company's top five suppliers of finished API products together supplied approximately 42% of the Company's total finished API requirements in FY21G. An important part of the Company's strategy is to source high quality API from reliable sources at competitive prices. The API sourcing function allows the Company to follow different raw material sourcing strategies for each of its different product lines whilst using aggregate volumes as a basis for increasing its negotiating power with suppliers. The Company uses a variety of methods to ensure it can regulate the supply of APIs it needs for production, including the use of exclusive supply contracts and partnerships. Approximately 90% of APIs used in the Company's products are imported, as there is only one API manufacturer in Saudi Arabia. The global pharmaceutical business is characterized by a limited number of certain API suppliers. This is particularly the case in respect of the supply of sterile products suppliers. Whilst the Company endeavors to maintain at least two qualified suppliers for most of its products, this is not always possible. For example, approximately 80% of active pharmaceutical products had a single API supplier during 2021G. Please refer to Section 2.1.1 (\"Risks relating to the Company's supply chain\") of this Prospectus. A key element of the Company's API sourcing strategy is, therefore, building strong long-term mutually beneficial relationships with API suppliers to ensure continuity and security of supply. To the extent alternative API suppliers are available, the Company aims to register the use of such suppliers with the appropriate authorities. By doing so, the Company aims to create an option to switch to an alternative supplier in case the main supplier becomes unavailable, thus reducing the risk of API supply disruption. Like other manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and other goods, the Company has in recent years experienced issues in its supply chain affected by COVID-19 and related challenges. These included reductions in the availability of raw materials caused by reduced supplier output from COVID-19 related shutdowns, which resulted in a large increase in backlogs of orders with ensuing logistical bottlenecks, as well as cost increases in raw materials and finished products at the supplier level and increases in logistics costs. This has resulted in lengthier sourcing periods for APIs and significant increases in costs of raw materials and shipping for the Company. The Company has worked to mitigate these challenges by expanding its supplier list and further developing its relationships with its existing suppliers.www.jamjoompharma.com73Table of Contents The Company maintains a certain amount of safety stock of raw materials necessary to manufacture certain of its key products at its facilities to cover at least 180 days' worth of its production requirements. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort and/or investment by the Company, the Company does not believe that the loss of any existing supplier would have a material adverse effect on its business. 4.9.3.1.3 Key Suppliers The Company's top 10 suppliers as of 30 June 2022G (in terms of purchase value) for the financial years 2019G, 2020G, 2021G and the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G represented 28.2%, 27.8%, 42.0% and 32.4% of the Company's total purchases, respectively.

The Group currently manufactures pharmaceutical products in \"finished dose form\" (\"FDF\"), which include solid, semi-solid, liquid and sterile pharmaceutical products (medicines). As of 30 June 2022G, the Company's three manufacturing facilities were serviced by 559 employees. The following is an overview of the Company's policy in relation to the methods used in the manufacturing of its products: y The manufacturing of solid dosage forms includes the use of approved raw materials that are transferred to processing rooms where sizing and blending occurs. The ingredients are milled into approximately similar sizes and then blended to become uniform doses. Some products are then granulated to prevent segregation of the powder mix. Granulation involves compacting the relevant products via a wet or dry process. The powder blends are either compressed into a tablet on a tablet press or filled into a capsule on an encapsulation machine. Each batch is tested to ensure it meets the relevant chemical release specifications and that no deviations from the validated manufacturing process have occurred before it is released into the market. y The manufacturing of sterile pharmaceutical products requires the use of clean rooms, bacteria retaining filters, dry or steam heat sterilization. Sterility assurance during manufacturing must be implemented and maintained throughout the production process. Each production line manufactures one product at a time, starting with ampoules or vials being washed and sterilized. The ampoules or vials are then filled with the product under aseptic controlled environmental conditions and subsequently sealed. Sterility of the manufactured products is ensured through tight monitoring and control of the manufacturing environment. The sealed containers undergo a full inspection to remove any cosmetic defects and ensure all containers are essentially free of visible particulate matter before the product is released for sale. y The Company's production lines rely on the latest medicine manufacturing technology \"automated compact lines\" , which is considered as one of the largest medicine manufacturing equipment in the world.

The academy was created to be a training institute to provide programs and certificates through collaboration and partnerships with top universities and training providers worldwide. The academy will serve the Company's employees and staff as well as other pharmaceutical manufacturers. 4.15 Saudization Strategy The Saudization Program \"Nitaqat\" was adopted by virtue of His Excellency the Minister of Labor's Decision No. 4040 dated 12/10/1432H (corresponding to 10/09/2011G), pursuant to Council of Ministers' Resolution No. 50 dated 21/5/1415H (corresponding to 27/10/1994G). The \"Nitaqat\" program was implemented on 12/10/1432H (corresponding to 10/09/2011G), with the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development beginning the implementation of the Nitaqat program to encourage institutions to employ Saudi citizens. Through the \"Nitaqat\" program, the performance of any Company is evaluated based on specific categories (classifications), namely the platinum category, the green category (subdivided, into low, middle and high) and the red category. Companies in the platinum or green categories are deemed to have met Saudization requirements and are therefore entitled to a number of benefits, such as: obtaining and renewing work visas or otherwise changing the occupations of its non-Saudi workers (except for professions exclusively reserved for Saudi nationals). Companies in the red category (due to their non-compliance with specific requirements), are deemed to have violated Saudization requirements and may be subject to certain punitive measures, such as limiting their ability to renew non-Saudi employees' work visas or completely prohibiting non-Saudi employees from obtaining or renewing work visas. The pharmaceutical sector requires unique skillsets across different career paths. The Company expects to play a key role in supporting and empowering local talent, in line with the Kingdom's Vision 2030 initiatives, including the implementation of the Saudization decisions issued by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development as the Company considers itself to be a pioneer in the Saudi pharmaceutical sector. The Company has developed a number of initiatives aimed at complying with the aforementioned decisions, which has resulted in the Company exceeding the Saudization rate in all departments, leading to the Company being classified under the Platinum Nitaqat category. Among these initiatives, the Company established Jamjoom Pharma Academy, the first academy to provide training programs to support the growing pharmaceutical sector in the region. This Academy is equipped with technologically advanced classrooms and laboratories enabling it to host more than 200 students at any one time. The Company's vision for the Academy is to arrange cooperation with recognized universities around the world to offer programs such as a Medical Representation Course, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Course, Regulatory Affairs Training and others.

The framework under the Corporate Governance Regulations regulates the various relationships between the Board, Executive Directors, shareholders and other stakeholders, by establishing rules and procedures to facilitate decision making processes with the objective of protecting the rights of shareholders and other stakeholders and promoting the values of credibility, fairness, competitiveness and transparency in the Company's conduct on the Exchange and in the business environment. These regulations, which entail the implementation of a clear and transparent disclosure process, ensure that the Board acts in the best interests of the Shareholders and presents a clear and fair view of the financial condition of the Company and the results of its operations. The Company's policy is to adopt high standards of corporate governance. The Corporate Governance Regulations shall apply to the Company from the date of Listing. The Company is currently complying with the majority of the Corporate Governance Regulations and will fully comply with the Corporate Governance Regulations from the date of Listing. The Company considers ongoing compliance with these regulations to be an important factor in its continued success. 5.6.2 Key Corporate Governance Requirements The key corporate governance requirements that the Company complies, and will comply, with are set out in the Corporate Governance Regulations. These cover the following broad areas: y General shareholder rights (Articles 4 to 9); y Rights relating to General Assembly Meetings (Articles 10 to 15); y The Board of Directors: formation, responsibilities, competencies, procedures and training (Articles 16 to 41); y Conflicts of interest (Articles 42 to 49); y Company committees (Articles 50 to 72); and y Internal controls, external auditors, company reports and policies, and various other matters (Articles 73 to 98).www.jamjoompharma.com115Table of Contents 5.6.3 Corporate Governance Manual and Internal Policies On 01/03/1444H (corresponding to 27/09/2022G), the Company's Board of Directors approved the revised Company's corporate governance law and regulations. The Company's Corporate Governance Manual includes the following internal policies and charters: y Board of Directors' policies(which includes the policies and procedures of the board of Directors); y Board of Directors' conflict of interest policy; y Internal control policies; y Risk management policies; y Reporting Policies; y Related Party Transaction Policies; y Dividend Distribution Policy; y Disclosure and Transparency Policies; y Remuneration policies; y Audit committee charter; y Nomination and Remuneration committee charter; y Executive committee charter. 5.6.4 Corporate Governance Compliance The Board of Directors declare that the Company is currently complying with the majority of the Corporate Governance Regulations and will fully comply with the Corporate Governance Regulations from the date of Listing. In particular, a majority of the Company's Board of Directors, which currently consists of nine (9) Directors, are non-executive members and amongst the Board members are three (3) independent Directors. In addition, the Shareholders adopted the cumulative voting method in relation to the appointment of Directors. This method of voting gives each Shareholder voting rights equivalent to the number of Shares he/she holds. Each Shareholder has the right to use all of his/her voting rights for one nominee or to divide their voting rights between his/her selected nominees without any duplication of votes. This method increases the chances of minority shareholders appointing their representatives to the Board by exercising their cumulative voting rights in favor of a single candidate. Pursuant to Article 101 of the Companies Law and Article 54 of the Corporate Governance Regulations, the Ordinary General Assembly of the Company formed the Audit Committee, consisting of three (3) non-executive members, on 18/12/1443H (corresponding to 17/07/2022G) and the Board of Directors formed the Nomination and Remuneration Committee on 11/01/1444H (corresponding to 09/08/2022G). The Company has also prepared its Committees charters and the Board charter (which includes the policies and procedures of the Board of Directors) and the remuneration policy, where the Ordinary General Assembly ratified them during its session held on 18/12/1443H (corresponding to 17/07/2022G) and were additionally approved by the Board during its session held on 01/03/1444H (corresponding to 27/09/2022G). Furthermore, the Company has put in place measures to comply with provisions that deal with conflicts of interest and competing interests (Articles 71, 72 and 73 of the Companies Law and Articles 44 and 46 of the Corporate Governance Regulations). The Company has obtained the approval of the General Assembly for transactions with Related Parties, as set out in Section 12.8 (\"Related Party Transactions\"). Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Regulations, each board member is prohibited from voting on a decision taken by the Board or the General Assembly with respect to transactions and contracts that are executed for the company's account, if he/she has a direct or indirect interest in those transactions or contracts (Article 44(b)(1)). The Companies Law sets out similar requirements to the effect that a director, without prior consent from the ordinary general assembly may not have any direct or indirect interest in transactions or contracts made for the account of the company. The director also has an obligation to inform the board of directors of any personal interest he may have in such transactions or contracts and may not participate in voting on resolutions to be adopted in this respect by the board of directors or shareholder assemblies.

These factors are based on the information currently available to management, and for more information on risk factors that are relevant to an understanding of the Group's current or future results of operations (for further details, please refer to Section 2 (\"Risk Factors\") and (\"Important Notice\") of this Prospectus). 6.4.1 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across various geographies globally, disrupting business and economic activities, and therefore has brought about uncertainties in the global economic environment. The fiscal and monetary authorities, both domestic and international, have announced various support measures across the globe to counter possible adverse implications. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, Governments in numerous countries have implemented lockdowns, travel restrictions and / or mandatory quarantine measures on international travelers and, in many cases, on residents within cities, regions or provinces of certain countries, including the countries in which the Group operates, namely the Kingdom, UAE, and other geographies. The COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed impact on the Group's operations commencing 2020G, these were mainly noted in the following: Revenue by market y Decline in export market sales which was mainly volume driven and attributable to the restrictions imposed on the export of medications and treatments by the relevant regulatory bodies and custom authorities. Export sales resumed in June 2020G with SFDA's approval required for each shipment. y Increase in local / KSA sales which was mainly driven by the increased sales of products within general medicine, gastrointestinal, and nutraceutical products due to stock build-up of local distributors and shift in customer demand (increased customer awareness of the benefits of nutraceuticals and supplements to combat infection and increase immunity). Revenue by product y The increase in general medicine, gastrointestinal, and nutraceuticals revenue. y Additional sales of SAR12m for Oselta (influenza neuraminidase inhibitors) over the FY19-20 period due to its efficacy to combat flu and fever during the COVID-19 period. Other impacts y Increase in costs related to personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves, sanitizers, and other COVID-19 related measures. Purchases for masks, sanitizers and gloves amounted to SAR 595k and SAR 218k in 2020G and 2021G, respectively. y The Company offered interest free loans to employees during the COVID-19 period. y Increase in the cost of transportation / logistics driven by supply chain challenges. y Decrease in the promotional and marketing activities during the COVID-19 period attributable to the mandated lockdowns and other restrictions imposed by the government. y Decrease in travel and communication expenses attributable to the decrease in employee travel on the back of the restrictions imposed by the government. y Delays in ongoing construction projects mainly attributable to the temporary closure of sites during the lockdown period as well as delay in receiving construction materials. 6.4.2 Risks relating to the Company's supply chain A significant portion of the Company's raw materials have come from a relatively small number of suppliers, with APIs purchased from two main alternating suppliers. Moreover, the Company's API suppliers are subject to regular inspections by regulatory authorities. If any of these suppliers were to terminate or fail to renew its supply agreement with the Company, or renew on less favorable terms for the Company, the Company's business, results of operations, financial position, and prospects would be adversely and negatively affected. Moreover, if the Company is required to switch to a different API supplier, any such new supplier must be approved by the appropriate regulatory authority. The COVID-19 pandemic and responses to curtail the pandemic have also disrupted global supply chains, including the Company's supply chain. These disruptions included reductions in the availability of raw materials caused by reduced supplier output from COVID-19 related shutdowns, which resulted in a large increase in backlogs of orders with ensuing logistical bottlenecks, as well as cost increases in raw www.jamjoompharma.com123Table of Contents materials and finished products at the supplier level and increases in logistics costs. This has resulted in lengthier sourcing periods for APIs and significant increases in costs of raw materials and shipping for the Company. 6.4.3 Risks related to concentration of sales among a limited number of distributors A significant portion of the Company's sales have historically been made to a relatively small number of distributors, who in turn sell the Company's products to pharmacies, customers, hospitals and governmental agencies. In the financial year ended 31 December 2021G and the six-month period ended 30 June 2022G, 81.3% and 88.4%, respectively, of the Company's total sales were made to its top 10 distributors, and 38.0% and 38.9%, respectively, of total sales in those periods were made to a single distributor, JMS, which is a related party. If JMS, or if any of the Company's other significant distributors in its key markets (or any sub-agents of such distributors) encounters financial or other difficulties, it may decrease the amount of business that such distributors do with the Company, and the Company may be unable to collect the amounts that these distributors owe it on a timely basis or at all. Such credit concentration risks as well as any pricing pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 6.4.4 Risks related to the impact of increasing costs and operating expenses on the Company's business The Company's operating expenses could increase as a result of a number of factors, particularly increases in the cost of raw materials and products ordered from suppliers and labor costs. Prolonged periods of cost inflation may also have a negative impact on the Company's profit margins and earnings to the extent such cost increases are not translated into increase in prices. In addition, the price of fuel and utilities have increased in recent years, and any further increase in Saudization of the Company's workforce requirements may lead to an increase in the Company's operational expenditure. 6.4.5 Financial risks related to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates The Company imports certain products and raw material from suppliers outside Saudi Arabia in foreign currency (primarily in EUR and Egyptian pounds), and exports finished products from its manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia to its markets abroad. Any depreciation of the Saudi Riyal against foreign currencies not pegged to the Saudi Riyal will lead to an increase in the Company's operating costs, and fluctuations in foreign currencies against the Saudi Riyal may have a negative impact on the Company's revenues. In addition, as a result of the Company's loan to its subsidiary in Egypt (Al Jamjoom for Pharmaceutical Industries), the Company recorded in its financial statements currency-exchange-related losses amounting to SAR 33.0 million during the Six Month Period Ended 30 June 2022G which is primarily due to the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound during the same period (for further details, please see Sub Section (\"Net financing Cost\") 6.8.1 (\"Consolidated income statements\") of this Prospectus. The Egyptian Pound was further devaluated in October 2022G and January 2023G, which is likely to result in further currency-exchange-related losses for the last quarter of 2022G and may result in additional currency-exchange-related losses in 2023G. Such losses could potentially be material and may impact the profitability of the Company in 2022G and 2023G. If the Company is unable to pass on any increases in operating costs caused by the deflation of the Saudi Riyal to customers through higher prices, this in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 6.4.6 Risks related to changes in import/export laws, regulations & Fees The Company imports into Saudi Arabia raw materials and packaging materials required for the manufacture of its products, and the Company exports finished products from its manufacturing facilities in Saudi Arabia to its markets abroad. The imposition of legal requirements or new regulations, such as the Saudi Government's recent decision to increase customs tariffs to 20%, anti-dumping duties or customs tariffs and other measures, whether adopted by countries or by regional trade blocs, it is possible that will affect the prices of raw materials and other products imported by the Company, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial position and prospects. 6.4.7 Risks related to changes in Zakat & VAT The Company is currently subject to Zakat, VAT, and withholding tax (given that some of the Company's transactions are with foreign parties not registered in KSA). However, the government may impose other fees or additional taxes on companies in the future. In the event that new taxes or fees are imposed on companies, other than the current ones, this may adversely and materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, any potential future VAT increase may reduce the level of demand for the Company's products or affect its profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, any additional costs to take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with any changes in Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority directives regarding the mechanisms and procedures for the calculation of Zakat and income tax as well as any additional exposures following those changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.www.jamjoompharma.com124Table of Contents 6.5 Summary of significant accounting policies 6.5.1 Basis of preparation 6.5.1.1 Statement of compliance The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements that are issued by Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). 6.5.1.2 Basis of measurement These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accrual basis of accounting, going concern concept and under the historical cost basis, except for defined benefit liability, which is measured at the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation. 6.5.1.3 Functional and presentation currency The accompanying consolidated financial statements is presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Group. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest Riyals, unless otherwise stated. 6.5.1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, is included in the following: y whether the Group exercises control over an investee. y Lease term: whether the Group is reasonably ascertain to exercise extension option Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below: Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\"). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss.Impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognized.www.jamjoompharma.com125Table of Contents Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortized cost is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behavior. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (\"ECL\") associated with its financial assets carried at amortize cost. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). The Group recognizes a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: y An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; y The time value of resources; and y Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Provision for inventory obsolescence The Group determines its provision for inventory obsolescence based upon historical experience, expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, current condition, and future expectations with respect to its consumption. Assumptions underlying the provision for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends, and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future sales and offerings. The estimate of the Group's provision for inventory obsolescence could materially change from period to period due to changes in the pattern of consumption and sale of pharmaceutical products. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The management determines the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering expected usage of the assets or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual value and useful lives annually and future depreciation charges are adjusted where management believes the useful lives differ from previous estimates. Change in accounting estimate In accordance with company policy it reviews the estimated useful lives and operational efficiency of proper, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual useful life of plant and machinery within property, plant and equipment was more than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the company's financial statements. As a result, with effect from January 1, 2021G, the company has changed its useful lives of some plant and machinery within property, plant and equipment to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The effect of these changes on current and projected depreciation expenditures, included in \"cost of sales\" , is Employee benefits - defined benefit obligation Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in the notes of the consolidated financial statements for valuation of present value of defined benefit obligations. Any changes in these assumptions in future years might affect gains and losses in those years. Going concern The Group's management has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. Measurement of fair values 'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.www.jamjoompharma.com126Table of Contents A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. Group's management has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements. Group's management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the evidence obtained from the third parties is assessed to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: y Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. y Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). y Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. 6.5.2 Significant accounting policies The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in the financial statements. 6.5.2.1 Basis of consolidation Business combinations Business combinations (except for entities under common control) are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instrument issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, and includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is classified as goodwill. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure non-controlling interests at its fair value, or at its proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Acquisitions from entity under common control Business combinations including entities or businesses under common control are measured and accounted for using book value. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts as transferred from the controlling company's books of accounts. The components of equity of the acquired entity are added to the same components within the Group equity and any gain/loss arising is recognized directly in equity. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to, variable return from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiary are consolidated in the financial statements from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Also, any unrealized gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.www.jamjoompharma.com127Table of Contents When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests (NCI) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Changes in a Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a change in control, is accounted as equity transaction and the carrying amounts of the non-controlling interests is adjusted against the fair value of the consideration paid and any difference is recognized directly in equity under \"Effect of transactions with non- controlling interests without change in control\" . Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments. Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the interest in subsidiary companies, not held by the Group which are measured at their proportionate share in the subsidiary's identifiable net assets. Transactions with non-controlling interest parties are treated as transactions with parties external to the Group. Changes in Group's interest in a subsidiary as a result of transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, i.e. as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid / received and the relevant share acquired / disposed of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals / acquisition of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. Investments in equity accounted investees Associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The Group's investment in associate is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of the investee is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.www.jamjoompharma.com128Table of Contents 6.5.2.2 Financial instruments Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortize cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. A financial asset is measured at amortize cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortize cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortize cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets. Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortized CostThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss. Debt investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. Equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. Financial Liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gain and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortize cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortize cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com129Table of Contents Derecognition Financial assets The management derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized. Financial liabilities The management derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The management also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss. Impairment of financial assets The management recognizes loss allowances for ECL on financial assets measured at amortize cost and contract assets. The management measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Under IFRS 9, loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases: y 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and y lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the management considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The management assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 730 days past due from government and 365 days past due from non-government parties. The management considers a financial asset to be in default when: y the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by the Company to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or y the financial asset is past due as per terms of agreement with customers. Measurement of ECL ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECL are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the management assesses whether financial assets carried at amortize cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.www.jamjoompharma.com130Table of Contents Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: y significant financial difficulty of the debtor; y a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 730 / 365 days past due; y the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise; y it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or y the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. Presentation of impairment Allowances for financial assets measured at amortize cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Impairment losses related to Trade receivables and contract assets, including contract assets and finance lease receivables, are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in OCI. 6.5.2.3 Impairment Non-financial assets The management assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the management estimates the assets' recoverable amount. An assets' recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Company's assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the management estimates the asset's or CGUs' recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. 6.5.2.4 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and borrowing costs on qualifying assets. When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within other income in the consolidated statement or profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of Property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life. Depreciable amount represents cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of individual items of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.www.jamjoompharma.com131Table of Contents The estimated useful lives of assets are as follow: Asset classification Years Buildings 33 Plant and machinery 4-20 Furniture and fixtures 10 Office equipment 6 Computers 4-8 Motor vehicles 4 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted prospectively if required. For impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment, please refer policy on impairment of non-financial assets note. Capital work-in-progress Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost less any recognized impairment loss. When the assets are ready for intended use, the capital work in progress is transferred to the appropriate property and equipment category and is accounted for in accordance with the Group's policies. Leases The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.www.jamjoompharma.com132Table of Contents 6.5.2.5 Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost. Subsequently, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income category consistent with the function. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. 6.5.2.6 Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realizable value comprises estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any additional production costs for completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks. 6.5.2.7 Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of past events, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probably that an outflow of economic benefit, will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 6.5.2.8 Employees' benefits Defined benefit plan Provision is made for amounts payable to employees under the Saudi Labor Law and employee contracts. This liability, which is unfunded, represents the amount payable to each employee on a going concern basis. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as amended by IAS 19. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, excluding amounts included in interest on the defined benefit liability are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of: y The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and y The date that the Company recognizes related restructuring costs Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the defined benefit liability. The management recognizes the following changes in the defined benefit obligation under 'cost of sales' , and 'general and administration expenses' in the statement of profit or loss: y Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements y interest expense or income Other long-term employee benefits The Company's obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value if the impact is material. Remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. www.jamjoompharma.com133Table of Contents Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related services are provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 6.5.2.9 Revenues The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15 and is given below: Step 1 - Identify the contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met; Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer; Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties; Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Step 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met: y The Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date; y The Group's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; y The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs. For performance obligations where none of the above conditions are met, revenue is recognized at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from sales is recognized upon delivery or shipment of products by which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and the Group has no effective control or continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership over the goods. Sales is recorded net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Variable consideration is estimated based on expected value method. Revenue is recorded net of trade discounts, volume rebates and deductibles. Consideration payable to a customer is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to the Group. If consideration payable to the customer is a payment for a distinct good or service from the customer, then the Group records such purchase of the good or service in the same way that it accounts for other purchases from suppliers. 6.5.2.10 Zakat and income tax The Company is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of Zakat and Tax Customs Authority (\"ZATCA\"). Foreign subsidiaries are subject to the relevant income tax regulations in their countries of domicile. Company's Zakat and its share in the foreign subsidiaries income tax are accrued and charged to the consolidated statement of income currently. Foreign income tax attributable to the foreign subsidiaries shareholders are charged to the minority shareholders in accompanying consolidated financial statements. Additional Zakat and foreign income tax liabilities, if any, related to prior years' assessments are accounted for in the period in which the final assessments are finalized. The Company withholds taxes on Transactions with non-resident parties. 6.5.2.11 Value added tax (VAT) Assets and expenses are recognized net of amount of VAT, except that when VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case, VAT is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position. 6.5.2.12 Borrowing and finance cost Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortized cost, while the difference between the cost (reduced for periodic payments) and redemption value is recognized in the statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. www.jamjoompharma.com134Table of Contents Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the relevant asset.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. The calculation of diluted EPS is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 6.5.2.18 Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortize cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortize cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognized in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale equity instruments, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, arising on acquisition, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the relevant proportion is reclassified to profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com135Table of Contents 6.5.2.19 Contingencies Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. An assessment is made at each reporting date to recognize contingent liabilities which are probable obligations arising from past events whose existence is confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly under the control of the Company. 6.5.3 New standards, amendments to standards and standards issued but not yet effective Following are the new standards and amendments to standards which are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2022G; the Company has not early adopted them in preparing these financial statements.

The increase in local KSA sales was partially offset by the decrease in export KSA sales from SAR262.5m in 2019G to SAR207.6m in 2020G (-SAR54.9m, -20.9%) which was mainly volume driven and attributable to the restrictions imposed on the export of medications and treatments by the relevant regulatory bodies and custom authorities from March 2020G to June 2020G in KSA. Other market sales resumed in June 2020G with SFDA's approval required for each shipment. Revenue subsequently decreased from SAR805.3m in 2020G to SAR735.7m in 2021G (-SAR69.6m, -8.6%) driven by a decrease in local KSA sales from SAR538.7m in 2020G to SAR466.1m in 2021G (-SAR72.6m, -13.5%) mainly driven by (i) low local KSA distributor / customer demand specifically in Q1 of 2021G due to sufficient inventory resulting from their 6-month stock build-up in 2020G (due to the SFDA requirement), (ii) the decrease in Oselta sales (-SAR22.6m) given the high sales of this product during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (iii) the price reduction by the SFDA for products such as Astatin and Aciloc. Cost of sales Cost of sales mainly related to costs in connection with consumption of raw materials and consumables (SAR148.5m, 56.9% of total cost of sales in FY21G), cost of employees (SAR65.9m, 25.3%), depreciation charges (SAR17.0m, travelling and communication (SAR621k, 0.2%), among others. We note that research and development expenses were classified under cost of sales in 2019G, and underneath gross profit as a separate line item in 2020G and 2021G. This was a main source of the decrease in cost of sales from SAR309.4m in 2019G to SAR292.0m in 2020G. Other cost of sales items increased over the same period: (i) raw material and consumables (+SAR7.3m) and (ii) supplies and consumables (+SAR605K) in line with the growth in activity/revenue. Cost of sales subsequently decreased from SAR292.0m in 2020G to SAR261.0m in 2021G mainly due to (i) the decrease in depreciation charges from SAR35.3m in 2020G to SAR17.0m in 2021G mainly due to the change in estimated useful lives made during 2021G, and (ii) the decrease in raw material and consumables cost from SAR156.9m in 2020G to SAR148.5m in 2021G in line with the decrease in activity / revenue.www.jamjoompharma.com139Table of Contents Selling and distribution expenses Selling and distribution expense mainly comprised salaries and employee related costs (38.2% in 2021G), distribution expenses (33.0%) and brand reminders, free samples and promotions (23.5%) among others. Selling and distribution expenses decreased from SAR213.9m in 2019G to SAR199.2m in 2020G mainly driven by the decrease in (i) promotional expenses (-SAR10.2m), and (ii) symposium expenses (-SAR4.1m) and travel & communication (-SAR2.4m) due to government restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 period; partially offset by an increase in free medical samples to hospitals and polyclinics (+SAR4.0m). Selling and distribution expenses increased from SAR199.2m in 2020G to SAR209.0m in 2021G mainly due to the increase in (i) promotional expenses (+SAR8.2m) due to resumption of on the ground promotional activities, (ii) basic salary (+SAR5.0m) mainly in line with the corresponding increase in headcount from 258 to 395 employees, (iii) freight (+SAR2.5m) due to an increase in rates and (iv) leave encashment (+SAR2.5m) as the Company began accruing for leave encashments in 2021G, partially offset by a decrease in distributors' commission (-SAR10.4m) in line with lower commissions to JMS driven by lower revenue generated during the same period. General and administration expenses General and administration expenses mainly comprised salaries and employee related costs (73.1% in FY21), depreciation (4.1%), travelling and communication (3.0%) among others. General and administration expenses increased from SAR34.0m in 2019G to SAR37.7m in 2020G mainly driven by an increase in salaries and employee related costs from SAR24.2m in 2019G to SAR27.2m in 2020G on the back of the (i) increase in headcount over the same period (from 72 to 77 employees) coupled with an (ii) increase in bonuses from SAR2.3m in 2019G to SAR4.9m in 2020G due to increase in the multiple of basic salaries used to calculate bonus payments as a result of the overachievements throughout the Company in 2020G. General and administration expenses further increased to SAR42.9m in 2021G mainly driven by an increase in headcount and hiring of top management personnel. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses mainly related to costs in connection with employee costs under the R&D department (55.7% in FY21) as well as exhibit batches manufacturing cost (10.3%), depreciation (6.8%), lab scale batches (4.5%), supplies and consumables (2.1%) among others. R&D expenses were part of cost of sales in 2019G and classified separately in 2020G and 2021G. Research and development expenses remained relatively stable at an average of SAR36.7m over the 2020G-2021G period with cost of exhibit batches increasing from nil in 2020G to SAR3.8m in 2021G, offset by (i) a drop in depreciation from SAR4.2m in 2020G to SAR2.5m in 2021G driven by the change in estimated useful lives conducted during the same period, and (ii) the slight decrease in employee costs from SAR21.5m in 2020G to SAR20.6m in 2021G mainly in line with the decrease in headcount from 109 to 105 employees over the same period. Other income, net Other income, net mainly included royalty income pertaining to JP licensed products (SAR4.1m), income from short term investments (SAR1.5m), loan administration income (SAR1.5m), offset by amortization of trademark (-SAR1.5m), impairment on loan receivable (-SAR1.0m) among other income and expenses in 2021G. Other income, net increased from SAR1.0m in 2019G to SAR4.6m in 2021G mainly driven by the increase in royalty income from nil in 2019G to SAR4.1m in 2021G due to the acquisition of the product licensing trademark for market authorization of some products in Algeria in 2020G. Share result of equity accounted investment Share result of equity accounted investment mainly related to share of loss on an associate in Algeria (Jamjoom Hupp Pharma LLC) given the company incurred general & administrative expenses but did not generate revenue. Share result of equity account investment amounted to SAR569k and SAR54k in 2020G and 2021G, respectively. Impairment loss on investment Impairment loss on investment related to the Company's impairment of its investment in Biothera Holding Company, which amounted to SAR1.0m in 2021G (SAR8.3m in 2020G) given that Biothera did not commence its operations and is currently in the research phase of the development of the product.www.jamjoompharma.com140Table of Contents Impairment loss on goodwill Impairment loss on goodwill related to the Company's full impairment (SAR2.1m) of the goodwill in its Egyptian company Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries. Finance (charges) / income, net Finance (charges) / income, net mainly related in 2021G to loan management fees for SIDF loan (-SAR2.3m), bank charges on local and foreign transfer (-SAR907k), and foreign currency gains (+SAR2.0m) on exports and imports. Finance income increased from SAR103k in 2019G to SAR1.8m in 2020G driven by (i) an increase in foreign currency gain from SAR3.2m in 2019G to SAR4.1m in 2020G, (ii) a decrease in SIDF loan management fee from SAR1.9m in 2019G to SAR1.3m in 2020G, and (iii) a decrease in bank charges from SAR1.2m in 2019G to SAR1.0m in 2020G. Finance income/(charges), net subsequently dropped from SAR1.8m to -SAR1.2m driven by (i) a decrease in foreign currency gain from SAR4.1m in 2020G to SAR2.0m in 2021G, and (ii) an increase in SIDF loan management fee from SAR1.3m in 2020G to SAR2.3m in 2021G, partially offset by a decrease in bank charges from SAR1.0m in 2020G to SAR907k in 2021G. Zakat and income tax Zakat and income tax increased from SAR18.7m in 2019G to SAR24.9m in 2020G in line with the growth in zakat base following the increase in activity; zakat and income tax subsequently decreased to SAR17.4m in 2021G with the drop in operations/revenue. Net profit Net profit increased from SAR156.9m in 2019G to SAR206.9m in 2020G as a result of the increase in gross profit from SAR422.4m in 2019G to SAR513.3m in 2020G in addition to the decrease in selling and distribution expenses from SAR213.9m in 2019G to SAR199.2m in 2020G. Net profit decreased from SAR206.9m in 2020G to SAR170.7m in 2021G as a result of the decrease in gross profit from SAR513.3m in 2020G to SAR474.7m in 2021G in addition to the increase in selling and distribution expenses from SAR199.2m in 2020G to SAR209.0m in 2021G. Re-measurement of Employees' benefits liability Re-measurement of Employees' benefits liability was calculated based on the actuarial study and varies from one year to another due to changes in discount rate, future salary growth rate, number of employees, retirement age, and mortality rate among other assumptions. Foreign operations - foreign currency translation differences Foreign operations - foreign currency translation differences related to changes in foreign exchange rates mainly to the entities / investments in Egypt and Algeria. 6.7.1.1 Consolidated revenue and gross profit by product category Table (6.7): Revenue by product category for the financial years ended 31 December 2019G, 2020G and 2021G SAR 31.1% of (2.3) Consumer 2.1 0.7 2.7 GIT 1.4 Total 100.0% Source: Management information for the financial years ended 31 December 2019G, 2020G and 2021G 1 Units sold are based on packs, which is the smallest unit of measurement sold to the end customer The Company's products are segmented into 8 therapeutic areas: Ophthalmic, Dermal, General medicine, Consumer health, GIT, OTC, CVD, and CNS with Ophthalmic, Dermal, and General medicine accounting for c. 66% of total revenue over the 2019G-2021G period. Please refer to Section 4 for further details. Ophthalmic Ophthalmic products are intended for application to the conjunctiva, the conjunctival sac, or the eyelids and include products such as eye drops, solutions, and suspensions. Ophthalmic products accounted for 31.1% of the Company's total net revenue in 2021G. Ophthalmic revenue decreased from SAR233.4m in 2019G to SAR219.8m in 2020G mainly driven by the decrease in volumes sold from 23.0m units in 2019G to 21.5m units in 2020G following the restrictions imposed on the export of products during the COVID-19 period for a period of 4 months (from March 2020G to June 2020G) by the SFDA and economic uncertainties in Sudan which were reflected in sales diminution both translated in a decline of SAR18.0m in non-KSA sales of ophthalmic products. Export sales resumed in June 2020G with SFDA's approval required for each shipment. Ophthalmic revenue increased from SAR219.8m in 2020G to SAR228.8m in 2021G mainly driven by the increase in volumes sold from 21.5m units in 2020G to 22.6m units in 2021G following the ease of restrictions imposed on the export of products during the COVID-19 period (SAR9.5m growth in non-KSA sales), in the same period KSA sales remained stable. Dermal Dermal products are intended to treat skin, hair, nails, and other cosmetic problems. Products include creams, gels, and ointments, having topical application. Dermal accounted for 19.0% of the Company's total net revenue in 2021G. Dermal revenue increased from SAR129.3m in 2019G to SAR142.0m in 2020G mainly driven by the increase in volumes sold from 13.5m units in 2019G to 14.7m units in 2020G following the increase in orders by local distributors and pharmacies (translating to SAR15.3m growth in KSA sales of dermal products) as a result of the requirement imposed by the SFDA to maintain 6 months of \"safety\" stock during the COVID-19 period. Main growth was recorded in the antiacne, skin whitening products and topical corticosteroid segments. Dermal revenue decreased marginally from SAR142.0m in 2020G to SAR140.0m in 2021G due to the decrease in volumes sold in KSA and the UAE for high-priced products, partially offset by new products launched in 2021G.www.jamjoompharma.com142Table of Contents General Medicine General Medicine products are used to treat musculoskeletal and rheumatic indications, vitamin deficiencies, asthma symptoms, allergies, bacterial and viral infections among others. Products are in the form of tablets, suspensions, and capsules. General medicine accounted for 16.1% of the Company's total net revenue in 2021G. General Medicine revenue increased from SAR134.2m in 2019G to SAR158.9m in 2020G mainly caused by the increase in volumes sold from 8.8m units in 2019G to 9.7m units in 2020G following the stock build-up by local distributors and pharmacies and customer preferences towards anti-viral, antibiotics and vitamin products during COVID-19 (translating to SAR31.8m growth in KSA sales). The most notable categories influenced positively in this period were muscle relaxants and antirheumatic products, antivirals, and Vitamin D3 deficiency products. General Medicine revenue subsequently decreased from SAR158.9m in 2020G to SAR118.4m in 2021G mainly due to unfavorable sales mix over the period. Consumer Health Consumer Health products consisted of nutraceuticals, vitamins and supplements, antioxidants, dietary supplements, herbal extracts which are intended to provide a health benefit or to supply various substances and ingredients, useful in the disease's prevention. Products are in the form of tablets, capsules, and soft gels. Consumer health products accounted for 9.9% of the Company's total net revenue in 2021G. Revenue increased from SAR52.4m in 2019G to SAR74.4m in 2020G mainly due to the increase in volumes sold from 2.3m units in 2019G to 3.2m units in 2020G as demand for vitamins and nutraceuticals increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, internal reorganization and change in the marketing approach was an important factor in growth of certain categories such as vitamins, Coenzyme CoQ10, coupled with the newly launched products in Omega 3 category. Revenue decreased from SAR74.4m in 2020G to SAR72.9m in 2021G driven by (i) quantities returned for a specific product in 2021G given that distributors were holding stock for COVID-19 in 2020G so excess / unsold stock were returned to the Company (-SAR8.2m), and (ii) increased marketing and promotional activities (including free goods and discounts) by competitors and stock shelving of similar low-priced products (such as cough syrup) (which reduced revenue of the Companies' product by SAR6.0m); partially offset by the introduction of the new sleeping aid product (melatonin) in 2021G (+SAR10.0m). GIT Gastrointestinal (\"GIT\") products are used to treat and prevent heartburn, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms caused by excess acid in the stomach.

Revenue increased from SAR72.2m in 2019G to SAR96.0m in 2020G mainly due to the increase in volumes sold from 4.7m units in 2019G to 5.9m units in 2020G given the stock build-up by KSA distributors and pharmacies and customer preferences towards anti-viral and anti-indigestion products during COVID-19 (SAR28.9m growth in KSA sales); partially offset by the decrease in non-KSA sales following the restrictions imposed on the export of products during the COVID-19 period (SAR5.0m decline in non-KSA sales). Revenue decreased from SAR96.0m in 2020G to SAR66.5m in 2021G mainly driven by the price reduction of an SFDA-regulated product (-SAR27.3m). OTC Over-the-counter (\"OTC\") products are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. OTC products are effective in infections of the respiratory tract (ex. pneumonia), urinary tract, ear, nasal sinus, throat, and erectile disfunction. Products are in the form of creams, tablets, ointments, soft gels and solutions. OTC products accounted for 7.2% of the Company's total net revenue in 2021G. Revenue increased from SAR50.1m in 2019G to SAR53.8m in 2020G mainly driven by the increase in volumes sold from 5.1m units in 2019G to 5.8m in 2020G due to (i) increased marketing activities in the KSA and enlisting products in many chain pharmacies and centres (SAR8.5m growth in KSA sales); partially offset by the decrease in non-KSA sales (-SAR4.8m). Revenue remained relatively stable between 2020G and 2021G, averaging SAR53.5m. CVD Cardiovascular (\"CVD\") products are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), prevent angina (heart-related chest pain), treat raised cholesterol levels in the body, and lower levels of total cholesterol, \"bad\" cholesterol.

The increase in local KSA market sales from SAR417.6m in 2019G to SAR538.7m in 2020G (+SAR121.1m, +29.0%) was mainly driven by (i) increased sales of products within general medicine, GIT, and consumer health (mainly nutraceuticals) products due to stock build-up of local KSA distributors and retail pharmacy chains as directed by the SFDA to maintain a 6-month \"safety\" stock during the COVID-19 period as well as the shift in customer demand, with increased customer awareness of the benefits of nutraceuticals and supplements to combat infection and increase immunity during the COVID-19 period and (ii) new product launches in 2020G. Local KSA market sales subsequently decreased to SAR466.1m on the back of lower orders in 2021G by distributors and direct customers attributable to the high level of orders made as part of the stock build-up during 2020G.

Export sales resumed in June 2020G with SFDA's approval required for each shipment. Export KSA revenue further decreased to SAR202.5m mainly due to: y The decrease in UAE sales from SAR51.7m in 2020G to SAR21.9m in 2021G due to high levels of orders made during 2020G attributable to the change in distributor; partially offset by y The increase in Iraq revenue from SAR51.5m in 2020G to SAR64.6m in 2021G as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, and the increase in Sudan revenue from SAR4.7m in 2020G to SAR15.6m in 2021G as the political situation stabilized in the country. Local Egypt revenue Revenue in local Egypt market increased from SAR51.7m in 2019G to SAR59.0m in 2020G as sales in Egypt were not affected by the restrictions imposed on exports given sales occurred from the already existing inventory.

The Saudi Exchange (formerly \"Tadawul\") was founded in 2001G as the successor to the Electronic Securities Information System. Trading in shares occurs on the \"Tadawul\" system through a fully integrated trading system covering the entire trading process from execution of the trade transaction through settlement thereof. Trading occurs on each Business Day of the week between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. from Sunday to Thursday, during which orders are executed. However, during other than those times, orders can be entered, amended or cancelled from 9:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. The said times are subject to change during the month of Ramadan or in other months, and they are announced by the Saudi Exchange Management. Transactions take place through the automatic matching of orders. Each valid order is accepted and generated according to the price level. In general, market orders (orders placed at best price) are executed first, followed by limit orders (orders place at a price limit), provided that if several orders are generated at the same price, they are executed according to the time of entry. The Saudi Exchange distributes a comprehensive range of information through various channels, including in particular the Saudi Exchange website (Tadawul) and the Saudi Exchange Information Link, which supplies trading data in real time to the information providers such as Reuters. Exchange transactions are settled on a T+2 basis, meaning that shares ownership transfer takes two working days after the trade transaction is executed. Companies are required to disclose all material decisions and information that are important for the investors via the Saudi Exchange. Surveillance and monitoring is the responsibility of the Saudi Exchange as the operator of the market to ensure fair trading and an orderly market. Securities Depository Center (Edaa) Securities Depository Center Company (Edaa) was established in 2016G, in accordance with the Saudi Companies Law issued by Royal Decree No. M/3 dated 28/01/1437H.

The establishment was based on CMA approval of Tadawul's Board of Directors request in relation to conversion of the Securities Depository Center into a joint-stock company in accordance with the Capital Market Law issued by Royal Decree No. M/30 dated 02/06/1424H. The activities of Edaa are to conduct businesses related to depositing, registering, transferring, settling and clearing securities, and recording any ownership restrictions on the deposited securities.

Independent Auditor's Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (\"the Company\") and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022, the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year th en ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards), that is endorsed in th e Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code's requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current pe riod. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.www.jamjoompharma.com274kpmg 2 Independent Auditor's Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (continued) Revenue recognition Refer to note 3( j) and note 2 3of the consolidated financial statements. Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit Revenue from sale of pharmaceutical and consumer health products for the year ended 31 December 2022 amounted to SR 916.6 million (2021: SR 735.6 million) . Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. We have identified revenue recognition as a key audit matter since significant auditor attention was devoted to it during the current year, and its correlation with the possible inherent risk that revenue may be intentionally overstated, resulting from the pressur e on local management to achieve performance and financial targets. The Group also focuses on revenue as a key performance measure, which could create an incentive for revenue to be recognised before the control has been transferred. We have specifically f ocused as to whether sales are valid, with higher risk in recording revenue for sales transactions where the revenue from the sold good has not been collected by the year end.Our key audit procedures in this area ,amongst others , included the following: We e valuated the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition accounting policy in accordance with applicable financial reportingstandards . We o btained an understanding of management's internal controls over the revenue recognition process and asses sed design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to such process. We p erformed testing of sales transactions on a sample basis to ensure that the related revenuesare recorded at the correct quantity and price whencontrol of goo ds has been transferred to the customer. We t ested on a sample basis, specific revenue transactions not collected by year end with supporting documentation to assess whether valid revenue has been recognized . We c onsidered the adequacy of the disclosures i n respect of revenues in accordance with the applicable financial reporting standards. Expected credit loss on trade receivables Refer to note 3( b)(vi)and note 11of the consolidated financial statements. Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit As at 31 December 2022, the gross carrying value of trade receivables amounted to SR 361.4 million (2021: SR 386.8 million) against which the Group has determined an Impairment loss allowance (expected credit loss) amounting to SR 9million (2021: 19.9 million) in accordance with the requirements applicable financial reporting framework . The Group has applied asimplified approach in measuring its expected credit loss. The loss allow ance is based on assumptions related to risk of default and expected loss rates. Based on Group's historical credit loss experience, current market conditions as well as forward looking macro -economic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settl e the receivables, t he Group uses judgement in making assumptions and selecting inputs to calculate expected credit loss .Our key audit procedures in this area, amongst others, included the following: We assessed the appropriateness of the Group's accoun ting policy for determining expected credit loss on trade receivables in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. We obtained an understanding of the procedures followed by the Group in establishing the expectedcredit loss including the model and assumptions used in developing the accounting estimate. We engaged our internal specialist to challenge the suitability of the expected credit loss model and assumption used in determination of the loss allowance by developing our own expectation based on our knowledge of the client, experience ofthe industry in which it operates and specifiedexternal data sources.www.jamjoompharma.com275kpmg 3 Independent Auditor's Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (continued) Expected credit loss on trade receivables (continued) Key audit matter How the matter was addressed in our audit We have considered this as a key audit matter due to the due to the significant judgment and key assumptions required in developing the accounting estimate.We considered the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of expected credit loss over trade receivables in accordance with the applicablefinancial reporting standards We tested the mathematical accuracy of the expected credit loss calculation. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA, the applicable req uirements of the Regulations for Companies, Company's By -Laws and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of acco unting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance, the Audit Committee, is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due t o fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in th e Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic deci sions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain pro fessional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain a udit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting amaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involvecollusion, forgery, intentional om issions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures thatare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opini on on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.www.jamjoompharma.com276kpmg 4 Independent Auditor's Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (continued) Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's abi lity to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in our auditor's reportto the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequat e, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of ourauditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as agoing concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlyingtransactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient ap propriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We areresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the gr oup audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficienci es in internal control that we identify during our audit of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (\"the Company\") and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") . We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied. From the matters comm unicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our aud itor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

REPORTING ENTITY (continued) The Board of Directors resolved to liquidate the Jamjoom Pharmaceutical Industry and Commerce Company Limited dated 20 May 2019G and the process of liquidation is in progress. The registered address of the Company is as follows:P .O. Box 6267,Jeddah-21442,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE a) Statement of compliance The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements that are issued by Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). b) Basis of measurement These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accrual basis of accounting, going concern concept and under the historical cost basis, except for employees' benefit, which are measured at the the present value of future obligation using the Projected Unit Credit Method, and investments at fair value through profit and loss, which are measured at fair values. Certain figures for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current year. Further details have been mentioned in note 35. c) Functional and presentation currency The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR) which is also the Company's functional and presentational currency. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. All amounts have been rounded off to the nearest Riyals, unless otherwise stated. d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.www.jamjoompharma.com283JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, is included in the following: y Consolidation: whether the Group exercises control over an investee (Note 3 (a)(i)). y Going concern: the Group's management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. y Allocation of common cost between sale of shares and listing of shares: the Group's management allocates the common cost between sale of shares and listing of shares in proportion to their respective directly attributable costs for the period in which these are incurred. Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below: i) Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\"). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.www.jamjoompharma.com284JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) ii) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (\"ECL\") associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: y An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; y The time value of resources; and y Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. iii) Provision for inventory obsolescence The Group determines its provision for inventory obsolescence based upon historical experience, expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, current condition, and future expectations with respect to its consumption. Assumptions underlying the provision for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends, and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future sales and offerings. The estimate of the Group's provision for inventory obsolescence could materially change from period to period due to changes in the pattern of consumption and sale of pharmaceutical products. iv) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The management determines the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering expected usage of the assets or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual value and useful lives annually and future depreciation charges are adjusted where management believes the useful lives differ from previous estimates. v) Employee benefits - defined benefit obligation Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 18 to these consolidated financial statements for valuation of present value of defined benefit obligations. Any changes in these assumptions in future years might affect gains and losses in those years.www.jamjoompharma.com285JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Measurement of fair values Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: y In the principal market for the asset or liability; or y In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the management assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: y Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. y Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). y Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. a) Basis of consolidation i) Business combinations Business combinations (except for entities under common control) are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instrument issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, and includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is classified as goodwill. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss. www.jamjoompharma.com286JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) i) Business combinations (continued) The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure non-controlling interests at its fair value, or at its proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Entities under common control Business combinations including entities or businesses under common control are measured and accounted for using book value. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts as transferred from the controlling company's books of accounts. The components of equity of the acquired entity are added to the same components within the Group equity and any gain/loss arising is recognized directly in equity. ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to, variable return from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiary are consolidated in the financial statements from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Changes in a Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a change in control, is accounted as equity transaction and the carrying amounts of the non-controlling interests is adjusted against the fair value of the consideration paid and any difference is recognized directly in equity under \"Effect of transactions with non- controlling interests without change in control\" . iii) Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments.www.jamjoompharma.com287JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) iv) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the interest in subsidiary companies, not held by the Group which are measured at their proportionate share in the subsidiary's identifiable net assets. Transactions with non-controlling interest parties are treated as transactions with parties external to the Group. Changes in Group's interest in a subsidiary as a result of transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, i.e. as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid / received and the relevant share acquired / disposed of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals / acquisition of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. v) Investments in equity accounted investees The Group's interest in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in joint ventures. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has the rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The Group's investment in joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in joint venture is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the joint venture. Any change in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of the investee is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the joint venture, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture. The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in joint venture. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Upon loss of joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in joint venture, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.www.jamjoompharma.com288JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency transactions gains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. b) Financial instruments i) Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. ii) Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity or FVTPL. The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.www.jamjoompharma.com289JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) ii) Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities (continued) On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets. Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortisedcostThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss. Debt investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. Equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. iii) Financial Liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gain and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com290JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) iv) Derecognition Financial assets The management derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The management derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The management also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. v) Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. vi) Impairment of financial assets The management recognises loss allowances for expected credit loss (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets. The management measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Under IFRS 9, loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases: y 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and y lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.www.jamjoompharma.com291JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) vi) Impairment of financial assets (continued) When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the management considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The management assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 730 days past due from government and 365 days past due from non-government parties. The management considers a financial asset to be in default when the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held). A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. Measurement of ECL ECLs are a probability -weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.In respect of trade receivables, the management applies a simplified approach in measuring the expected credit losses. Therefore, the management does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has identified the GDP of the country of sales/customers to be the most relevant factor, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in this factor. Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the management assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: y significant financial difficulty of the debtor; y a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 990 days past due; y the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise; y it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or y the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.www.jamjoompharma.com292JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) vi) Impairment of financial assets (continued) Presentation of allowance for ECL Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Financial assets are written off when there are no reasonable expectations of recovery. Where loans or receivables have been written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognized as income in the profit or loss. c) Impairment Non-financial assets The management assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the management estimates the assets' recoverable amount. An assets' recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Company's assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the management estimates the asset's or CGUs' recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com293JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and borrowing costs on qualifying assets. When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within other income in the consolidated statement or profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life. Depreciable amount represents cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of individual items of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follow: Years Buildings 33 Plant and machinery 4-20 Furniture and fixtures 10 Office equipment 6 Computer equipment 4-8 Motor vehicles 4 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted prospectively if required. For impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment, please refer policy on impairment of non-financial assets note 3(c).www.jamjoompharma.com294JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment (continued) Capital work-in-progress Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. When the assets are ready for intended use, the capital work in progress is transferred to the appropriate property, plant and equipment category and is accounted for in accordance with the Group's policies. e) Leases The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.www.jamjoompharma.com295JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) f) Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost. Subsequently, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the period in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as finite.Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives of 8-10 years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. g) Assets held for sale Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, are classified as held-for sale if it is highly probable that they will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets, or disposal groups, are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated first to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets, investment property or biological assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's other accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale or held-for distribution and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss. Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated, and any equity-accounted investee is no longer equity accounted. h) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realizable value comprises estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any additional production costs for completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.www.jamjoompharma.com296JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) i) Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions expected to be settled after 12 months of the reporting date are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. A provision for finished goods expiry is recognized when the underlying goods are sold, based on historical replacement data and a weighting of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contract is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent liabilities are based on the judgment of management / independent experts and are not recognized in these consolidated financial statements but disclosed in the notes to these consolidated financial statements. These are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted as appropriate. j) Employees' benefits Defined benefit plan The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in OCI. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then- net defined benefit liability (asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com297JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) j) Employees' benefits (continued) When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in consolidated statement of profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. Other long-term employee benefits The Group's obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value if the impact is material. Remeasurements are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognizes costs for a restructuring. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related services are provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. k) Revenues The Group mainly generates revenue from manufacturing and delivery of pharmaceutical products. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Group acts as the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods before transferring them to the customer. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery or shipment of products. The normal credit term is 30 to 90 days upon delivery. In determining the transaction price for the sale of products, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration, existence of a significant financing component, non-cash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any). If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.www.jamjoompharma.com298JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) k) Revenues (continued) The Group estimates the amount of variable consideration by using either of the following methods, depending on which method is expected to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled: a) The expected value\u2014the expected value is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts and is generally applied when the Group has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics. b) The most likely amount\u2014the most likely amount is the single most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (i.e. the single most likely outcome of the contract). The most likely amount is generally appropriate if the contract has only two possible outcomes. The Group applies the above methods consistently throughout the contract when estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration to which the Group will be entitled. In addition, the Group considers all the information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available and identifies a reasonable number of possible consideration amounts. Consideration payable to a customer includes cash amounts that the Group pays or expects to pay to the customers for the purchase of Group's goods. Consideration payable to a customer is treated as a reduction of the transaction price, unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good that the customer transfers to the Group. If consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction in the transaction price, then the Group recognises a reduction of revenue when (or as) the later of the following events occurs: (i) the Group recognises revenue for the transfer of the related goods to the customer and, (ii) the Group pays or promises to pay the consideration this promise is implied by the Group's customary business practices. The Group applies judgement in respect of the above. l) Zakat and income tax The Company is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of Zakat and Tax Customs Authority (\"ZATCA\"). Foreign subsidiaries are subject to the relevant income tax regulations in their countries of domicile. The Company's Zakat and its share in the foreign subsidiaries income tax are accrued and charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Additional Zakat and foreign income tax liabilities, if any, related to prior years' assessments are accounted for in the period in which the final assessments are finalized. The Group withholds taxes on transactions with non-resident parties. m) Value added tax (VAT) Assets and expenses are recognised net of amount of VAT, except that when VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case, VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position.www.jamjoompharma.com299JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) n) Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost, while the difference between the cost (reduced for periodic payments) and redemption value is recognized in the statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the relevant asset. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognized in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income using the effective interest method. o) Cash dividend The Group recognises a liability to make distribution to equity holders of the Parent Company when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Group. Distribution authorization is assessed in line with the Companies' By-laws, of which a distribution is authorised when approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. Interim dividends, if any, are recorded when approved by the Board of Directors. p) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. q) Operating expenses Costs of revenue represent all expenses directly attributable or incidental to the core operating activities of the Group including but not limited to raw materials and supplies, attributable employee-related costs, depreciation of property and equipment, etc. All other expenses are classified as general and administrative expenses, selling and distribution expenses and research and development expenses. Allocation of common expenses between costs of revenue, selling and distribution expense, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses where required, is made on a reasonable basis with regards to the nature and circumstances of the common expenses r) Trade date accounting of financial instruments Financial liabilities are initially recognised on trade date i.e. date on which the Group becomes party to the respective contractual provisions. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on the trade date, i.e. the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. s) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable costs, if any, and subsequently measured at amortised costs.www.jamjoompharma.com300JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) t) Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. The calculation of diluted EPS is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. u) Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group companies at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognised in profit or loss and presented within finance costs. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Saudi Arabian Riyal at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Saudi Arabian Riyal at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the translation reserve, except to the extent that the translation difference is allocated to NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of an associate or joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com301JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 4.

OPERATING SEGMENT The Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group's strategic business units. The strategic business units offer different products and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. The Group's Chairman, Group Chief Executive, and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) monitor the results of the Group's operations for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. They are collectively the chief operating decision makers (CODM) for the Group. For each of the strategic business units, the CODM reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments: y Pharmaceutical products - represents medicines or drugs and they are essential for the prevention and treatment of diseases, and protection of public health. y Consumer health products - represents the products sold directly to consumers. Unlike prescription drugs, selection and use of consumer health products does not require the oversight of a health care practitioner. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments. Segment results that are reported to CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. www.jamjoompharma.com323JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 33.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risks and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. Risk management framework Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management identifies and evaluates financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's operating units. The most important types of risk are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The executive management team is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. The team regularly meets and any changes and compliance issues are reported to the Board of Directors. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly by the executive management team to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees compliance by management with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit department. Internal audit department undertakes reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee. Financial instruments carried on the consolidated statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, due from related parties, investments, trade payable, due to related parties and retention payable. The particular recognition methods adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item. Financial asset and liability are offset and net amount reported in the consolidated financial statements, when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously.www.jamjoompharma.com325JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk. Interest rate risk Interest rate risks are the exposures to various risks associated with the effect of fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates on the Group's financial positions and cash flows. As at the reporting date, the Group is not exposed to any intertest risk as it does not have any interest-bearing financial instruments. Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates for its transactions principally in Saudi Riyals, US Dollars, Algerian Dinar, Egyptian Pound, Turkish Lira, UAE Dirham and Euros. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. The Group's other financial liabilities are exposed to currency translation risk. Currently, such exposures are mainly related to exchange rate movements between Saudi Riyals and Egyptian Pound. Since Saudi Riyals is pegged with US Dollars, the Group is not exposed to currency risk for the transactions denominated in US Dollars. The Group's management monitors such fluctuations and manages its effect on the consolidated financial statements accordingly. Exposure to currency risk The summary quantitative data about the Group's exposure to currency risk as reported to the management of the Group is as follows. 31 December 2022G US Dollars Euro Algerian Dinar Egyptian Pound Bahraini DinarUnited Arab Emirates Dirhams Trade receivables 14,024,115 565,358 -- -- 89,280 200,465 Prepayments and other current assets-- -- 649,612,303 -- -- -- Cash and cash equivalents 11,955,089 2,190,155 -- -- -- -- 25,979,204 2,755,513 89,280 (1,817,995)www.jamjoompharma.com326JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 34.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Currency risk (continued) Sensitivity analysis A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the Euros, US Dollars, Algerian Dinars, Egyptian Pounds, Bahraini Dinars and UAE Dirhams against all other currencies at year end would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected profit before Zakat and income tax by the amount shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. Strengthening Weakening 31 December 2022G Euro (55,770) 55,770 US Dollar (903,382) 903,382 Algerian Dirham 38,813 (38,813) Bahraini Dinar (8,096) 8,096 Price risk The risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The Group exposure to any price risk is not material. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The management also continuously monitors the credit exposure towards the customers and makes provision against those balances considered doubtful of recovery which is based on customer profile and payments history. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is as follows: 2022G 2021G Financial assets Trade receivables, gross 361,399,227 386,755,469 from related parties, gross 17,648,732 Bank balance 141,144,698 112,592,996 Total 525,308,570 555,124,490www.jamjoompharma.com328JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 34. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Credit risk (Continued) As at 31 December 2022G, four largest customers account approximately for 75% (31 December 2021G: 75%) of gross outstanding trade receivables. However, the Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to accounts receivable and concluded it to be low. At 31 December 2022G, the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by geographic region is as follows: 2022G 2021G Kingdom of 18,032,490 6,300,628 export markets 17,983,552 18,320,381 Total 361,399,227 386,755,469 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an enterprise will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell financial asset quickly at an amount close to its fair value. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring on a regular basis that sufficient funds are available through committed credit facilities to meet any future commitments. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Capital risk management The Group's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and to maintain a strong capital base to support the sustained development of its businesses. The Group manages its capital structure by monitoring return on net assets and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group also monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings including finance cost thereon, trade and other payables, less cash and bank balances. As at the reporting date, the Group does not have any interest-bearing loans and borrowing affecting its gearing ratio. Fair value of assets and liabilities Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. As at 31 December 2022G, the carrying values of the financial assets and financial liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. The following table shows the carrying amount and fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels and fair value hierarchy. It doesn't include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these condensed consolidate d interim financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review. Scope of review We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in s cope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might b e identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 3 0 June 2022 condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory and its subsidiaries are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' that is endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabi a.

OPERATING SEGMENTS The Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group's strategic business units. The strategic business units offer different products and are managed separately because they require different marketing strategies. The Group's Chairman, Group Chief Executive, and Group Chief Financial Officer (GCFO) monitor the results of the Group's operations for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. They are collectively the chief operating decision makers (CODM) for the Group. For each of the strategic business units, the CODM reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments: y Pharmaceutical Products - represents medicines or drugs and they are essential for the prevention and treatment of diseases, and protection of public health. y Consumer Health Products - represents the products sold directly to consumers. Unlike prescription drugs, selection and use of consumer health products does not require the oversight of a health care practitioner. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments. Segment results that are reported to CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment revenues, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the CODM. There are no inter segment revenue reported during the period.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT a) Accounting classification and fair values Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. When one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.www.jamjoompharma.com352JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the six-month period ended 30 June 2022G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals, unless otherwise stated) 18. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction. When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: y Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. y Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). y Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability falls into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest input level that is significant to the entire measurement. As the Group's financial instruments are compiled under the historical cost convention, except for investments, differences can arise between the book values and fair value estimates. Management believes that the fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values. The following table shows the carrying amount and fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels and fair value hierarchy. It doesn't include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Independent Auditors' Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (\"the Company\") and its subsidiar ies (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial posit ion of the Group as at 31 December 2021 , and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arab ia and other standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the professional code of conduct and ethics that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirement s. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS that are end orsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA, the applicable requirements of the Regulations for Companies, Company's By-Laws and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance, the Audit Committee, is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process. www.jamjoompharma.com356 kpmg 2 Independent Auditors' Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (continued) Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, an d to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain auditevidence that i s sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involvecollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresen tations or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures thatare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on theeffectiven ess of the Group's internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going conce rn basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events orconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If weconclude that a material un certainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evide nce obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the en tities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit of Jamj oom Pharmaceuticals Factory (\"the Company\") and its subsidiar ies (\"the Group\") .

REPORTING ENTITY (continued) On 22 December 2010, the Company established a subsidiary in Turkey, namely Jamjoom Pharmaceutical Industry and Commerce Company Limited (\"'JPIC'\"), with 99.5% shareholding. The remaining 0.5% of the shareholding is held by Mr. Mahmood Yousef Mohammed Salah Jamjoom for and on behalf of the Company. As such the Company owns 100% of the shareholding in JPIC. Therefore, JPIC has been treated as fully owned subsidiary in these consolidated financial statements. There has been no operation for the year ended 31 December 2021G. Further, the Board of Directors resolved to liquidate the company dated May 20, 2019G and the process of liquidation have been started. The Company established a subsidiary in Egypt, namely Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries, with 99.5% shareholding. The remaining 0.5% of the shareholding is held by Mr. Mahmood Yousef Mohammed Salah Jamjoom for and on behalf of the Company. As such the Company owns 100% of the shareholding. Therefore, Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries has been treated as fully owned subsidiary in these consolidated financial statements. The registered address of the Company is as follows:P .O. Box 6267,Jeddah-21442,Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION a) Statement of compliance The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements that are issued by Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). b) Basis of measurement These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accrual basis of accounting, going concern concept and under the historical cost basis, except for defined benefit liability, which is measured at the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as explained in note 3(h). c) Functional and presentation currency The accompanying consolidated financial statements is presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Group. All amounts have been rounded off to the nearest Riyals, unless otherwise stated.www.jamjoompharma.com363JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, is included in the following: y whether the Group exercises control over an investee (Note 3 (a)(i)). y Lease term: whether the Group is reasonably ascertain to exercise extension option (Note 16) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below: i) Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\"). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.Impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.www.jamjoompharma.com364JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) ii) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (\"ECL\") associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: y An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; y The time value of resources; and y Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. iii) Provision for inventory obsolescence The Group determines its provision for inventory obsolescence based upon historical experience, expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, current condition, and future expectations with respect to its consumption. Assumptions underlying the provision for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends, and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future sales and offerings. The estimate of the Group's provision for inventory obsolescence could materially change from period to period due to changes in the pattern of consumption and sale of pharmaceutical products. iv) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The management determines the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering expected usage of the assets or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual value and useful lives annually and future depreciation charges are adjusted where management believes the useful lives differ from previous estimates.www.jamjoompharma.com365JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) Change in accounting estimate In accordance with company policy it reviews the estimated useful lives and operational efficiency of proper, plant and equipment on an ongoing basis. This review indicated that the actual useful life of plant and machinery within property, plant and equipment was more than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the company's financial statements. As a result, with effect from January 1, 2021G, the company has changed its useful lives of some plant and machinery within property, plant and equipment to better reflect the estimated periods during which these assets will remain in service. The effect of these changes on current and projected depreciation expenditures, included in \"cost of sales\" , is Employee benefits - defined benefit obligation Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 18 to these consolidated financial statements for valuation of present value of defined benefit obligations. Any changes in these assumptions in future years might affect gains and losses in those years. vi) Going concern The Group's management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. Measurement of fair values 'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. Group's management has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements.www.jamjoompharma.com366JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Measurement of fair values (continued) Group's management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the evidence obtained from the third parties is assessed to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: y Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. y Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). y Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these financial statements. a) Basis of consolidation i) Business combinations Business combinations (except for entities under common control) are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instrument issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, and includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is classified as goodwill. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.www.jamjoompharma.com367JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) i) Business combinations (continued) The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure non-controlling interests at its fair value, or at its proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Acquisitions from entity under common control Business combinations including entities or businesses under common control are measured and accounted for using book value. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts as transferred from the controlling company's books of accounts. The components of equity of the acquired entity are added to the same components within the Group equity and any gain/loss arising is recognized directly in equity. ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to, variable return from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiary are consolidated in the financial statements from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Also, any unrealized gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests (NCI) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Changes in a Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a change in control, is accounted as equity transaction and the carrying amounts of the non-controlling interests is adjusted against the fair value of the consideration paid and any difference is recognized directly in equity under \"Effect of transactions with non- controlling interests without change in control\" .www.jamjoompharma.com368JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) iii) Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments. iv) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the interest in subsidiary companies, not held by the Group which are measured at their proportionate share in the subsidiary's identifiable net assets. Transactions with non-controlling interest parties are treated as transactions with parties external to the Group. Changes in Group's interest in a subsidiary as a result of transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, i.e. as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid / received and the relevant share acquired / disposed of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals / acquisition of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. v) Investments in equity accounted investees Associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The Group's investment in associate is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of the investee is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. www.jamjoompharma.com369JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) v) Investments in equity accounted investees (continued) After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. b) Financial instruments i) Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. ii) Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity or FVTPL. The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. www.jamjoompharma.com370JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets. Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortisedcostThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss. Debt investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. Equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com371JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) iii) Financial Liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gain and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held- for-trading, it is a derivative or designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. iv) Derecognition Financial assets The management derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. The Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The management derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The management also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. v) Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com372JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) vi) Impairment of financial assets The management recognises loss allowances for ECL on financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets. The management measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Under IFRS 9, loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases: y 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and y lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the management considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The management assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 730 days past due from government and 365 days past due from non-government parties. The management considers a financial asset to be in default when: y the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by the Company to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or y the financial asset is past due as per terms of agreement with customers. Measurement of ECL ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECL are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the management assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.www.jamjoompharma.com373JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: y significant financial difficulty of the debtor; y a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 730 / 365 days past due; y the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise; y it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or y the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. Presentation of impairment Allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Impairment losses related to Trade receivables and contract assets, including contract assets and finance lease receivables, are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI. c) Impairment Non-financial assets The management assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the management estimates the assets' recoverable amount. An assets' recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Company's assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the management estimates the asset's or CGUs' recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com374JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and borrowing costs on qualifying assets. When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within other income in the consolidated statement or profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of Property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life. Depreciable amount represents cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of individual items of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follow: Years Buildings 33 Plant and machinery 4-20 Furniture and fixtures 10 Office equipment 6 Computer equipment 4-8 Motor vehicles 4 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted prospectively if required. For impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment, please refer policy on impairment of non-financial assets note 3(c).www.jamjoompharma.com375JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment (continued) Capital work-in-progress Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. When the assets are ready for intended use, the capital work in progress is transferred to the appropriate property and equipment category and is accounted for in accordance with the Group's policies. Leases The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.www.jamjoompharma.com376JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) e) Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost. Subsequently, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income category consistent with the function. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. f) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realizable value comprises estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any additional production costs for completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks. g) Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of past events, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probably that an outflow of economic benefit, will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. h) Employees' benefits Defined benefit plan Provision is made for amounts payable to employees under the Saudi Labour Law and employee contracts. This liability, which is unfunded, represents the amount payable to each employee on a going concern basis. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as amended by IAS 19. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, excluding amounts included in interest on the defined benefit liability are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.www.jamjoompharma.com377JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) h) Employees' benefits (continued) Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of: y The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and y The date that the Company recognizes related restructuring costs Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the defined benefit liability. The management recognizes the following changes in the defined benefit obligation under 'cost of sales' , and 'general and administration expenses' in the statement of profit or loss: y Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements y interest expense or income Other long-term employee benefits The Company's obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value if the impact is material. Remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related services are provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. i) Revenues The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15 and is given below: Step 1 - Identify the contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met; Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer; Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties;www.jamjoompharma.com378JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) i) Revenues (continued) Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Step 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met: y The Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date; y The Group's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; y The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs. For performance obligations where none of the above conditions are met, revenue is recognised at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue from sales is recognized upon delivery or shipment of products by which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and the Group has no effective control or continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership over the goods. Sales is recorded net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Variable consideration is estimated based on expected value method. Revenue is recorded net of trade discounts, volume rebates and deductibles. Consideration payable to a customer is recognised as a reduction of the transaction price unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to the Group. If consideration payable to the customer is a payment for a distinct good or service from the customer, then the Group records such purchase of the good or service in the same way that it accounts for other purchases from suppliers. j) Zakat and income tax The Company is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of Zakat and Tax Customs Authority (\"ZATCA\"). Foreign subsidiaries are subject to the relevant income tax regulations in their countries of domicile. Company's Zakat and its share in the foreign subsidiaries income tax are accrued and charged to the consolidated statement of income currently. Foreign income tax attributable to the foreign subsidiaries shareholders are charged to the minority shareholders in accompanying consolidated financial statements. Additional Zakat and foreign income tax liabilities, if any, related to prior years' assessments are accounted for in the period in which the final assessments are finalized. The Company withholds taxes on Transactions with non-resident parties.www.jamjoompharma.com379JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) k) Value added tax (VAT) Assets and expenses are recognised net of amount of VAT, except that when VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case, VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position. l) Borrowing and finance cost Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost, while the difference between the cost (reduced for periodic payments) and redemption value is recognized in the statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the relevant asset. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognized in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income using the effective interest method. m) Dividends Dividends paid are recorded in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by shareholders of the Group. Dividends are recorded as liability in the year in which they are approved by the Board of Directors. n) Operating expenses Cost of sales represent all expenses directly attributable or incidental to the core operating activities of the Company including but not limited to raw materials and supplies, attributable employee-related costs, depreciation of property and equipment, etc. All other expenses are classified as general and administrative expenses, selling and distribution. Allocation of common expenses between cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, where required, is made on a reasonable basis with regards to the nature and circumstances of the common expenses o) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised on trade date i.e. date on which the Company becomes party to the respective contractual provisions. Financial liabilities include mark-up bearing borrowings and trade and other payables. The Company derecognises the financial liabilities when contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired. Financial liability other than at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method.www.jamjoompharma.com380JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) p) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable costs, if any, and subsequently measured at amortised costs. q) Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. The calculation of diluted EPS is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. r) Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale equity instruments, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, arising on acquisition, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the relevant proportion is reclassified to profit or loss.www.jamjoompharma.com381JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) s) Contingencies Contingent assets are not recognized in the financial statements but are disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. An assessment is made at each reporting date to recognize contingent liabilities which are probable obligations arising from past events whose existence is confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly under the control of the Company. 4.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value and cash flow interest rate risks and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. Risk management framework Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management identifies and evaluates financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's operating units. The most important types of risk are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The executive management team is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. The team regularly meets and any changes and compliance issues are reported to the Board of Directors. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly by the executive management team to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees compliance by management with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.www.jamjoompharma.com402JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Financial instruments carried on the consolidated statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, other receivables, SIDF loan, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other financial liabilities. The particular recognition methods adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item. Financial asset and liability is offset and net amount reported in the financial statements, when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk. Interest rate risk Interest rate risks are the exposures to various risks associated with the effect of fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates on the Group's financial positions and cash flows. The Group's interest rate risks arise mainly from its borrowings which are at floating rate of interest and are subject to re-pricing on a regular basis and for which the management closely monitors the changes in interest rates. The interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the Group is as follows: 31 December 2021G 31 December 2020G Variable rate instruments Financial liabilitiesBorrowings - SIDF loan -- 97,100,000 Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Change in 10 basis points in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have increased or decreased the equity and profit before zakat and income tax for the year by SR 0 (31 December 2020G: SR 9,710,000).www.jamjoompharma.com403JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates for its transactions principally in Saudi Riyals, US Dollars, Algerian Dinar, Egyptian Pound, Turkish Lira, UAE Dirham and Euros. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. The Group's other financial liabilities are exposed to currency translation risk. Currently, such exposures are mainly related to exchange rate movements between Saudi Riyals and Euros. Since Saudi Riyals is pegged with US Dollars, the Group is not exposed to currency risk for the transactions denominated in US Dollars. The Group's management monitors such fluctuations and manages its effect on the consolidated financial statements accordingly. Significant exchange rates applied during the year were as follows: Average rate Spot rate For the year ended 31 December For the year ended 31 December 2021G 2020G 2021G 2020G Foreign currency per Saudi analysis Every 1% increase or decrease in exchange rate with all other variables held constant will decrease or increase profit before Zakat and income tax for the year by SR 7,890 (31 December 2020G: SR 6,890). Price risk The risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The Group exposure to any price risk is not material. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The management also continuously monitors the credit exposure towards the customers and makes provision against those balances considered doubtful of recovery which is based on customer profile and payments history. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is as follows:www.jamjoompharma.com404JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 32.

As at 31 December 2021G, four largest customers account approximately for 75% (31 December 2020G: 85%) of gross outstanding trade receivables. However, the Company assessed the concentration of risk with respect to accounts receivable and concluded it to be low. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an enterprise will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell financial asset quickly at an amount close to its fair value. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring on a regular basis that sufficient funds are available through committed credit facilities to meet any future commitments. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. For this purpose, the Group has maintained credit lines with various commercial banks in order to meet its liquidity requirements. The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.www.jamjoompharma.com405JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 32.

Capital risk management The Group's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and to maintain a strong capital base to support the sustained development of its businesses. The Group manages its capital structure by monitoring return on net assets and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group also monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings including finance cost thereon, trade and other payables, less cash and bank balances. Capital signifies equity as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position plus net debt. The gearing ratio as at 31 December 2021G and 31 December 2020G is as follows:www.jamjoompharma.com406JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2021G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 32.

Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repacking): Level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are based on observable market data.

Independent Auditors' Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (\"the Company\") (and its subsidiar ies) (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, the consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial positi on of the Group as at 31 December 2020 , and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncemen ts issued by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the professional code of conduct and ethics that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fa ir presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA, the applicable requirements of the Regulations for Companies, Company's By-Laws and for such internal control as management det ermines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance, the Audit Committee , is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process. www.jamjoompharma.com409kpmg 2 Independent Auditors' Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (continued) Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material m isstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identif y and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal cont rol. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required t o draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our audit ors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the co nsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged wit h governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (\"the Com pany\") and its subsidiar ies (\"the Group\") .

BASIS OF PREPARATION a) Statement of compliance The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements that are issued by Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional Accountants (SOCPA). b) Basis of measurement These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accrual basis of accounting, going concern concept and under the historical cost basis, except for defined benefit liability, which is measured at the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as explained in note 4(g). c) Functional and presentation currency The accompanying consolidated financial statements is presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Group. All amounts have been rounded off to the nearest Riyals, unless otherwise stated.www.jamjoompharma.com417JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, is included in the following: y whether the Group exercises control over an investee (Note 4 (a)(i)). y Lease term: whether the Group's reasonably ascertain to exercise extension option (Note 16) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below: i) Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\"). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.Impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.www.jamjoompharma.com418JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) ii) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (\"ECL\") associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: y An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; y The time value of resources; and y Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. iii) Provision for inventory obsolescence The Group determines its provision for inventory obsolescence based upon historical experience, expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, current condition, and future expectations with respect to its consumption. Assumptions underlying the provision for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends, and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future sales and offerings. The estimate of the Group's provision for inventory obsolescence could materially change from period to period due to changes in the pattern of consumption and sale of pharmaceutical products. iv) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The management determines the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering expected usage of the assets or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual value and useful lives annually and future depreciation charges are adjusted where management believes the useful lives differ from previous estimates.www.jamjoompharma.com419JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) v) Employee benefits - defined benefit obligation Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 14 to these consolidated financial statements for valuation of present value of defined benefit obligations. Any changes in these assumptions in future years might affect gains and losses in those years. vi) Going concern The Group's management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. Measurement of fair values 'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. Group's management has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements. Group's management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the evidence obtained from the third parties is assessed to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: y Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. y Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). y Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).www.jamjoompharma.com420JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these financial statements. a) Basis of consolidation i) Business combinations Business combinations (except for entities under common control) are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instrument issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, and includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is classified as goodwill. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure non-controlling interests at its fair value, or at its proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. www.jamjoompharma.com421JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) i) Business combinations (continued) Acquisitions from entity under common control Business combinations including entities or businesses under common control are measured and accounted for using book value. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts as transferred from the controlling company's books of accounts. The components of equity of the acquired entity are added to the same components within the Group equity and any gain/loss arising is recognized directly in equity. ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to, variable return from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiary are consolidated in the financial statements from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Also, any unrealized gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests (NCI) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Changes in a Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a change in control, is accounted as equity transaction and the carrying amounts of the non-controlling interests is adjusted against the fair value of the consideration paid and any difference is recognized directly in equity under \"Effect of transactions with non- controlling interests without change in control\" . iii) Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments.www.jamjoompharma.com422JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) iv) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the interest in subsidiary companies, not held by the Group which are measured at their proportionate share in the subsidiary's identifiable net assets. Transactions with non-controlling interest parties are treated as transactions with parties external to the Group. Changes in Group's interest in a subsidiary as a result of transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, i.e. as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid / received and the relevant share acquired / disposed of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals / acquisition of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. v) Investments in equity accounted investees Associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The Group's investment in associate is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of the investee is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.www.jamjoompharma.com423JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. b) Financial instruments i) Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. ii) Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity or FVTPL. The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: y it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.www.jamjoompharma.com424JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The following accounting policies apply to the subsequent measurement of financial assets. Financial assets at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss. Financial assets at amortisedcostThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss. Debt investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. Equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss. iii) Financial Liabilities - Classification, subsequent measurement and gain and losses Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gain and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss. iv) Derecognition Financial assets The management derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.www.jamjoompharma.com425JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) The Company enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised. Financial liabilities The management derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The management also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. v) Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. vi) Impairment of financial assets The management recognises loss allowances for ECL on financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets. The management measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Under IFRS 9, loss allowances are measured on either of the following bases: y 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and y lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the management considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The management assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 730 days past due from government and 365 days past due from non-government parties.www.jamjoompharma.com426JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) The management considers a financial asset to be in default when: y the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Company in full, without recourse by the Company to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or y the financial asset is past due as per terms of agreement with customers. Measurement of ECL ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECL are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset. Credit-impaired financial assets At each reporting date, the management assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data: y significant financial difficulty of the debtor; y a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 730 / 365 days past due; y the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Company on terms that the Company would not consider otherwise; y it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or y the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties. Presentation of impairment Allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. Impairment losses related to Trade receivables and contract assets, including contract assets and finance lease receivables, are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognised in OCI. c) Impairment Non-financial assets The management assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the management estimates the assets' recoverable amount. An assets' recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or Company's assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. www.jamjoompharma.com427JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) c) Impairment (continued) In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the management estimates the asset's or CGUs' recoverable amount. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. d) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and borrowing costs on qualifying assets. When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within other income in the consolidated statement or profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of Property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life. Depreciable amount represents cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of individual items of property, plant www.jamjoompharma.com428JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment (continued) and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of assets is as follow: Years Buildings 33 Plant and machinery 4-10 Furniture and fixtures 10 Office equipment 6 Computer equipment 4-8 Motor vehicles 4 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted prospectively if required. For impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment, please refer policy on impairment of non-financial assets note 2(i). Capital work-in-progress Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. When the assets are ready for intended use, the capital work in progress is transferred to the appropriate property and equipment category and is accounted for in accordance with the Group's policies. Leases The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating a www.jamjoompharma.com429JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) d) Property, plant and equipment (continued) lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. e) Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost. Subsequently, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income category consistent with the function. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. f) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realizable value comprises estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any additional production costs for completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.www.jamjoompharma.com430JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) g) Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of past events, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probably that an outflow of economic benefit, will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. h) Employees' benefits Defined benefit plan Provision is made for amounts payable to employees under the Saudi Labour Law and employee contracts. This liability, which is unfunded, represents the amount payable to each employee on a going concern basis. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method as amended by IAS 19. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, excluding amounts included in interest on the defined benefit liability are recognized immediately in the statement of financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of: y The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and y The date that the Company recognizes related restructuring costs Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the defined benefit liability. The management recognizes the following changes in the defined benefit obligation under 'cost of sales' , and 'general and administration expenses' in the statement of profit or loss: y Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements y interest expense or income Other long-term employee benefits The Company's obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value if the impact is material. Remeasurements are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Company recognizes costs for a restructuring. www.jamjoompharma.com431JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) h) Employees' benefits (continued) Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related services are provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. i) Revenues The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15 and is given below: Step 1 - Identify the contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met; Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer; Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties; Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Step 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.The Group satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue over time, if one of the following criteria is met: y The Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date; y The Group's performance creates or enhances as asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; y The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs. For performance obligations where none of the above conditions are met, revenue is recognised at the point in time at which the performance obligation is satisfied.www.jamjoompharma.com432JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) i) Revenues (continued) Revenue from sales is recognized upon delivery or shipment of products by which the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer and the Group has no effective control or continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership over the goods. Sales is recorded net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates. Variable consideration is estimated based on expected value method. Revenue is recorded net of trade discounts, volume rebates and deductibles. Consideration payable to a customer is recognised as a reduction of the transaction price unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service that the customer transfers to the Group. If consideration payable to the customer is a payment for a distinct good or service from the customer, then the Group records such purchase of the good or service in the same way that it accounts for other purchases from suppliers. j) Zakat and income tax The Company is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of General Authority of Zakat and Income Tax (\"GAZT\"). Foreign subsidiaries are subject to the relevant income tax regulations in their countries of domicile. Company's Zakat and its share in the foreign subsidiaries income tax are accrued and charged to the consolidated statement of income currently. Foreign income tax attributable to the foreign subsidiaries shareholders are charged to the minority shareholders in accompanying consolidated financial statements. Additional Zakat and foreign income tax liabilities, if any, related to prior years' assessments are accounted for in the period in which the final assessments are finalized. The Company withholds taxes on Transactions with non-resident parties. k) Value added tax (VAT) Assets and expenses are recognised net of amount of VAT, except that when VAT incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case, VAT is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position. l) Borrowing and finance cost Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortized cost, while the difference between the cost (reduced for periodic payments) and redemption value is recognized in the statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the relevant asset. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognized in statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income using the effective interest method.www.jamjoompharma.com433JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) m) Dividends Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by shareholders of the Group. Interim dividends are recorded as liability in the year in which they are approved by the Board of Directors. n) Dividends Cost of sales represent all expenses directly attributable or incidental to the core operating activities of the Company including but not limited to: attributable employee-related costs, depreciation of property and equipment, etc. All other expenses are classified as general and administrative expenses. Allocation of common expenses between cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, where required, is made on a reasonable basis with regards to the nature and circumstances of the common expenses o) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised on trade date i.e. date on which the Company becomes party to the respective contractual provisions. Financial liabilities include mark-up bearing borrowings and trade and other payables. The Company derecognises the financial liabilities when contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired. Financial liability other than at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method. p) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable costs, if any, and subsequently measured at amortised costs. q) Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. The calculation of diluted EPS is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. www.jamjoompharma.com434JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) r) Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale equity instruments, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, arising on acquisition, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value and cash flow interest rate risks and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. Risk management framework Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management identifies and evaluates financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's operating units. The most important types of risk are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The executive management team is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. The team regularly meets and any changes and compliance issues are reported to the Board of Directors. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly by the executive management team to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees compliance by management with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.www.jamjoompharma.com455JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Financial instruments carried on the consolidated statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, other receivables, SIDF loan, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other financial liabilities. The particular recognition methods adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item. Financial asset and liability is offset and net amount reported in the financial statements, when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk. Interest rate risk Interest rate risks are the exposures to various risks associated with the effect of fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates on the Group's financial positions and cash flows. The Group's interest rate risks arise mainly from its borrowings which are at floating rate of interest and are subject to re-pricing on a regular basis and for which the management closely monitors the changes in interest rates. The interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the Group is as follows: 31 December 2020G 31 December 2019G Variable rate instruments Financial liabilitiesBorrowings - SIDF loan 97,100,000 34,900,000 Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Change in 10 basis points in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have increased or decreased the equity and profit before zakat and income tax for the year by SR 9,710,000 (31 December 2019G: SR 3,490,000). Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates for its transactions principally in Saudi Riyals, US Dollars, Algerian Dinar, Egyptian Pound, Turkish Lira, UAE Dirham and Euros. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. The Group's other financial liabilities are exposed to currency translation risk. Currently, such exposures are mainly related to exchange rate movements between Saudi Riyals and Euros. Since Saudi Riyals is pegged with US Dollars, the Group is not exposed to currency risk for the transactions denominated in US Dollars. www.jamjoompharma.com456JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) The Group's management monitors such fluctuations and manages its effect on the consolidated financial statements accordingly. Significant exchange rates applied during the year were as follows: Average rate Spot rate For the year ended 31 December For the year ended 31 December 2020G 2019G 2020G 2019G Foreign currency per Saudi analysis Every 1% increase or decrease in exchange rate with all other variables held constant will decrease or increase profit before Zakat and income tax for the year by SR 6,890 (31 December 2019G: SR 5,216). Price risk The risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The Group exposure to any price risk is not material. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The management also continuously monitors the credit exposure towards the customers and makes provision against those balances considered doubtful of recovery which is based on customer profile and payments history. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is as follows: 31 December 2020G 31 December 2019G Financial assets Trade receivables 435,894,110 430,672,054 Other receivables 10,237,040 11,532,291 Due Total 719,815,857 667,512,801www.jamjoompharma.com457JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Credit risk on receivable and bank balances is limited as: y Cash balances are held with banks with sound credit rating. y The Group does not a policy to obtain security / collaterals from its customers. As at 31 December 2020G, four largest customers account approximately for 75% (31 December 2019G: 85%) of gross outstanding trade receivables. However, the Company assessed the concentration of risk with respect to accounts receivable and concluded it to be low. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an enterprise will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell financial asset quickly at an amount close to its fair value. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring on a regular basis that sufficient funds are available through committed credit facilities to meet any future commitments. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. For this purpose, the Group has maintained credit lines with various commercial banks in order to meet its liquidity requirements. The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.

Capital risk management The Group's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and to maintain a strong capital base to support the sustained development of its businesses. The Group manages its capital structure by monitoring return on net assets and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group also monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings including finance cost thereon, trade and other payables, less cash and bank balances. Capital signifies equity as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position plus net debt. The gearing ratio as at 31 December 2020G and 31 December 2019G is as follows: 31 December 2020G 31 December 2019G Total liabilities 316,591,327 214,119,435 Cash and cash equivalents Net debt 81,045,496 33,548,069 Total equity 1,179,068,222 1,069,515,278 Net debt to adjusted equity ratio - % 7% 3%www.jamjoompharma.com459JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2020G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 29. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Fair value of assets and liabilities Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repacking): Level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are based on observable market data. Level 3: valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data. As at December 31, 2020G, the fair values of the Group's financial instruments are estimated to approximate their carrying values. 30. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS The outbreak of novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") since early 2020G and its spread across mainland China and then globally caused disruptions to businesses and economic activities including the KSA. The World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020G, with governments issuing strict regulations and guidance for its populations and companies. It necessitated the Company to re-assess its judgments and the key sources of estimation applied to the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020G. During the year, management has assessed the overall impact on the Company's operations and business aspects and considered factors like effects on supply chain and product demand. Based on this assessment, no significant adjustments were required in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020G. However, in view of the ongoing uncertainty, any future change in the assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and /or liabilities in future periods. As the situation is rapidly evolving with future uncertainties, management will continue to assess the impact based on prospective developments. 31.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial positi on of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabi a and other standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for Certified Public Accountants (SOCPA). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Sa udi Arabia. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the professional code of conduct and ethics that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA, the applicable req uirements of the Regulations for Companies, Company's By-Laws and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accou nting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance, the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process. www.jamjoompharma.com462kpmg 2 Independent Auditors' Report To the Shareholders of Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals Factory (continued) Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. 'Reasonable assurance' is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit condu cted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individuall y or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing that are endorsed i n the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or e rror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting amaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures thatareappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related di sclosures made by management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and,based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events orconditions that may cast signi ficant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, then we are required to draw attention in our auditors' reportto the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of ourauditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlyingtransactions and events in a manner that achieves fair pre sentation. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or businessactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We areresponsible for the direction, superv ision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

These consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of the operations of the Company and its following subsidiaries up to 31 December 2019G: Name Country of incorporation Principal activityEffective shareholding 2019G 2018G Al Jamjoom Pharma and distribution of pharmaceuticals100% 100% Jamjoom Pharmaceutical Industry and Commerce Company Limited (see below) TurkeyManufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals100% 100%www.jamjoompharma.com469JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 1. ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES (continued) On 22 December 2010, the Company established a subsidiary in Turkey, namely Jamjoom Pharmaceutical Industry and Commerce Company Limited (\"'JPIC'\"), with 99.5% shareholding. The remaining 0.5% of the shareholding is held by Mr. Mahmood Yousef Mohammed Salah Jamjoom for and on behalf of the Company. As such the Company owns 100% of the shareholding in JPIC. Therefore, JPIC has been treated as fully owned subsidiary in these consolidated financial statements. There has been no operation for the year ended 31 December 2019G. The Company established a subsidiary in Egypt, namely Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries, with 99.5% shareholding. The remaining 0.5% of the shareholding is held by Mr. Mahmood Yousef Mohammed Salah Jamjoom for and on behalf of the Company. As such the Company owns 100% of the shareholding. Therefore, Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries has been treated as fully owned subsidiary in these consolidated financial statements. 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION a) Statement of compliance The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other standards and pronouncements that are issued by Saudi Organization for Certified Public Accountants (SOCPA). b) Basis of measurement These consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accrual basis of accounting, going concern concept and under the historical cost basis, except for defined benefit liability, which is measured at the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as explained in note 4(g). c) Functional and presentation currency The accompanying consolidated financial statements is presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR) which is the functional and presentation currency of the Group. All amounts have been rounded off to the nearest Riyals, unless otherwise stated. d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively.www.jamjoompharma.com470JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) Judgments Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, is included in note 4 (a)(i) - whether the Group exercises control over an investee. Assumptions and estimation uncertainties Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are described below: i) Impairment of non-financial assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\"). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.Impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.www.jamjoompharma.com471JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) ii) Measurement of the expected credit loss allowance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses (\"ECL\") associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: y An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; y The time value of resources; and y Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. iii) Provision for inventory obsolescence The Group determines its provision for inventory obsolescence based upon historical experience, expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, current condition, and future expectations with respect to its consumption. Assumptions underlying the provision for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends, and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future sales and offerings. The estimate of the Group's provision for inventory obsolescence could materially change from period to period due to changes in the pattern of consumption and sale of pharmaceutical products. iv) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment The management determines the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for calculating depreciation. This estimate is determined after considering expected usage of the assets or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual value and useful lives annually and future depreciation charges are adjusted where management believes the useful lives differ from previous estimates.www.jamjoompharma.com472JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) Assumptions and estimation uncertainties (continued) v) Employee benefits - defined benefit obligation Certain actuarial assumptions have been adopted as disclosed in note 14 to these consolidated financial statements for valuation of present value of defined benefit obligations. Any changes in these assumptions in future years might affect gains and losses in those years. vi) Going concern The Group's management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that it has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the financial statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis. Measurement of fair values 'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. Group's management has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements. Group's management regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the evidence obtained from the third parties is assessed to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of IFRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: y Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. y Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). y Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).www.jamjoompharma.com473JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) d) Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued) If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. 3. CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Group has initially applied IFRS 16 \"Leases\" from 1 January 2019G. A number of other new standards or amendments are also effective from 1 January 2019G but they do not have a material effect on the Group's financial statements. Due to the transition methods chosen by the Group in applying these standards, comparative information throughout these financial statements has not been restated to reflect the requirements of the new standards. a) Leases The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. Right-of-use assets The Company recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment. Lease liabilities At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.www.jamjoompharma.com474JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 3. CHANGES IN SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Leases (continued) In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Except for the adoption of IFRS 16 as set out in note 3, the following significant accounting policies set out below are applied consistently by the Group in preparing these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as endorsed in KSA. a) Basis of consolidation i) Business combinations Business combinations (except for entities under common control) are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instrument issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, and includes costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is classified as goodwill. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities. The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure non-controlling interests at its fair value, or at its proportionate share of the recognized amount of the identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. www.jamjoompharma.com475JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) i) Business combinations (continued) Acquisitions from entity under common control Business combinations including entities or businesses under common control are measured and accounted for using book value. The assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at the carrying amounts as transferred from the controlling company's books of accounts. The components of equity of the acquired entity are added to the same components within the Group equity and any gain/loss arising is recognized directly in equity. ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to, variable return from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiary are consolidated in the financial statements from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses resulting from intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full. Also, any unrealized gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation. When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests (NCI) and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost. Changes in a Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in a change in control, is accounted as equity transaction and the carrying amounts of the non-controlling interests is adjusted against the fair value of the consideration paid and any difference is recognized directly in equity under \"Effect of transactions with non- controlling interests without change in control\" . iii) Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the Group's share in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments.www.jamjoompharma.com476JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) iv) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the interest in subsidiary companies, not held by the Group which are measured at their proportionate share in the subsidiary's identifiable net assets. Transactions with non-controlling interest parties are treated as transactions with parties external to the Group. Changes in Group's interest in a subsidiary as a result of transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, i.e. as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid / received and the relevant share acquired / disposed of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals / acquisition of non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. v) Investments in equity accounted investees Associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The Group's investment in associate is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of the investee is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the loss in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognizes any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.www.jamjoompharma.com477JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) a) Basis of consolidation (continued) vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. b) Financial instruments vii) Non-derivative financial assets The Group initially recognizes trade receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated. All other non-derivative financial assets are recognized initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability. The Group has the following non-derivative financial assets: Accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and investment as at amortised cost. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are initially recognized when they are originated. Accounts receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. Accounts receivable is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL (Fair value through profit and loss): y it is held with a business model whose objective is to held assets to collect contractual cash flows; and y its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. www.jamjoompharma.com478JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) b) Financial instruments (continued) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at banks in current accounts and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three month or less, if any, which are available to the Group without any restrictions. Overdraft is net off against cash and cash equivalents. i) Non-derivative financial liabilities Financial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value minus, in case of financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for financial liabilities at FVTPL which are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value of liabilities at FVTPL, along with any interest expense are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire. The Group has the following non-derivative financial liabilities: SIDF loan, trade payables and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities. ii) Impairment on non-financial assets An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in consolidated statement of profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. iii) Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.www.jamjoompharma.com479JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) c) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. Cost includes purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located, and borrowing costs on qualifying assets. When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized net within other income in the consolidated statement or profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of Property, plant and equipment are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Depreciation represents the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its estimated useful life. Depreciable amount represents cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of individual items of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of assets is as follow: Years Buildings 33 Plant and machinery 4-10 Furniture and fixtures 10 Office equipment 6 Computer equipment 4-8 Motor vehicles 4 Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and adjusted prospectively if required. For impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment, please refer policy on impairment of non-financial assets note 2(i).www.jamjoompharma.com480JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) c) Property, plant and equipment (continued) Capital work-in-progress Capital work-in-progress are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. When the assets are ready for intended use, the capital work in progress is transferred to the appropriate property and equipment category and is accounted for in accordance with the Group's policies. d) Intangible assets Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost. Subsequently, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income category consistent with the function. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the asset is derecognized. e) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realizable value comprises estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less any additional production costs for completion and appropriate selling and distribution costs. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks. f) Provisions A provision is recognized if, as a result of past events, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probably that an outflow of economic benefit, will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. www.jamjoompharma.com481JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) g) Employees' benefits Defined benefit plan The Group's obligation under employees' end of service benefit plan is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit plan and is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods and discounting that amount. The calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. Measurements of the defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income (OCI). The Group determines the net interest expense on the defined benefit liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then defined benefit liability, taking into account any changes in the defined benefit liability during the period as a result of benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in personnel expenses in consolidated statement of profit or loss. Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related services are provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus, if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. h) Revenues The Company recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in IFRS 15 and is given below: Step 1 - Identify the contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met; Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer; Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties; Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Step 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.www.jamjoompharma.com482JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on laws that have been enacted in the respective countries at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. k) Finance cost Finance costs comprise of financial charges on borrowings and unwinding of the discount on provisions that are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognized in consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income using the effective interest method. l) Dividends Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by shareholders of the Group.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) m) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised on trade date i.e. date on which the Company becomes party to the respective contractual provisions. Financial liabilities include mark-up bearing borrowings and trade and other payables. The Company derecognises the financial liabilities when contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expired. Financial liability other than at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value less any directly attributable transaction cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using effective interest rate method. n) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable costs, if any, and subsequently measured at amortised costs. o) Borrowings and borrowing costs Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortized cost, while the difference between the cost (reduced for periodic payments) and redemption value is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost of the relevant asset. p) Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. The calculation of diluted EPS is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. www.jamjoompharma.com484JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) q) Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the retranslation of available for sale equity instruments, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, arising on acquisition, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, are translated to Saudi Riyal at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in the translation is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. On the partial disposal of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportion of such cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interest. In any other partial disposal of a foreign operation, the relevant proportion is reclassified to profit or loss.485 www.jamjoompharma.comJAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 5.

During 2015, name of ECAN is changed to Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries (S.A.E). The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase consideration in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired, amounted to SR 4.74 million, and represents goodwill. The fair values of the identifiable assets of Al Jamjoom Pharma for Pharmaceutical Industries as at the date of acquisition were as follows: Fair value recognized on acquisition Net assets acquired: Cash and bank balances 46,443 Financial investments for trading 7,294 Due from related parties 1,602,264 Property, plant and equipment 25,273,841 Payables and other credit balances (100,275) Due to related parties (8,096) Deferred tax liability (4,568) Total identifiable net assets at fair value 26,816,903 Goodwill 4,737,792 Purchase consideration 31,554,695 The Group has reviewed the carrying amounts of goodwill to determine whether their carrying values exceeds the recoverable amounts. For the impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows based on 5 year management's approved plan, discounted to their present value using growth rates, pre-tax discount rates and terminal value percentages. At 31 December 2019G, there was headroom available between the recoverable amount and the carrying value of above CGU; therefore, no impairment loss was recognised.www.jamjoompharma.com489JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 7.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value and cash flow interest rate risks and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. Risk management framework Risk management is carried out by senior management under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management identifies and evaluates financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's operating units. The most important types of risk are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The executive management team is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. The team regularly meets and any changes and compliance issues are reported to the Board of Directors. Risk management systems are reviewed regularly by the executive management team to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. The audit committee oversees compliance by management with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. Financial instruments carried on the consolidated statement of financial position include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, other receivables, SIDF loan, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other financial liabilities. The particular recognition methods adopted are disclosed in the individual policy statements associated with each item. Financial asset and liability is offset and net amount reported in the financial statements, when the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intend either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and liability simultaneously. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk.www.jamjoompharma.com503JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Interest rate risk Interest rate risks are the exposures to various risks associated with the effect of fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates on the Group's financial positions and cash flows. The Group's interest rate risks arise mainly from its borrowings which are at floating rate of interest and are subject to re-pricing on a regular basis and for which the management closely monitors the changes in interest rates. The interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the Group is as follows: 31 December 2019G 31 December 2018G Variable rate instruments Financial liabilitiesBorrowings - SIDF loan 34,900,000 48,900,000 Sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Change in 10 basis points in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have increased or decreased the equity and profit before zakat and income tax for the year by SR 3,490,000 (31 December 2018G: SR 4,890,000). Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates for its transactions principally in Saudi Riyals, US Dollars, Algerian Dinar, Egyptian Pound, Turkish Lira, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, UAE Dirham and Euros. The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. The Group's other financial liabilities are exposed to currency translation risk. Currently, such exposures are mainly related to exchange rate movements between Saudi Riyals and Euros. Since Saudi Riyals is pegged with US Dollars, the Group is not exposed to currency risk for the transactions denominated in US Dollars. www.jamjoompharma.com504JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) The Group's management monitors such fluctuations and manages its effect on the consolidated financial statements accordingly. Significant exchange rates applied during the year were as follows: Average rate Spot rate For the year ended 31 December For the year ended 31 December 2019G 2018G 2019G 2018G Foreign currency per Every 1% increase or decrease in exchange rate with all other variables held constant will decrease or increase profit before Zakat and income tax for the year by SR 5,216 (31 December 2018G: SR 4,440). Price risk The risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices, whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual instrument or its issuer or factors affecting all instruments traded in the market. The Group exposure to any price risk is not material. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. The management also continuously monitors the credit exposure towards the customers and makes provision against those balances considered doubtful of recovery which is based on customer profile and payments history. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is as follows: 31 December 2019G 31 December 2018G Financial assets Trade receivables 409,967,242 368,880,919 Other receivables 11,532,291 12,009,043 Due from Bank balance 180,571,366 146,970,558 Total 603,369,338 534,595,577www.jamjoompharma.com505JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Credit risk on receivable and bank balances is limited as: y Cash balances are held with banks with sound credit rating. y The Group does not a policy to obtain security / collaterals from its customers. As at 31 December 2019G, four largest customers (31 December 2018G: four largest customers) account approximately for 85% (31 December 2018G: 84%) of gross outstanding trade receivables. However, the Company assessed the concentration of risk with respect to accounts receivable and concluded it to be low. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that an enterprise will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell financial asset quickly at an amount close to its fair value. Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring on a regular basis that sufficient funds are available through committed credit facilities to meet any future commitments. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. For this purpose, the Group has maintained credit lines with various commercial banks in order to meet its liquidity requirements. The following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements.

Capital risk management The Group's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and to maintain a strong capital base to support the sustained development of its businesses. The Group manages its capital structure by monitoring return on net assets and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group also monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings including finance cost thereon, trade and other payables, less cash and bank balances. Capital signifies equity as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position plus net debt. The gearing ratio as at 31 December 2019G and 31 December 2018G is as follows: 31 December 2019G 31 December 2018G Total liabilities 214,119,435 207,487,169 Cash and cash equivalents Net debt 33,548,069 60,467,392 Total equity 1,069,515,278 999,773,661 Net debt to adjusted equity ratio - % 3% 6%www.jamjoompharma.com507JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 27. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) Fair value of assets and liabilities Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk. Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repacking): Level 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are based on observable market data. Level 3: valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data. As at December 31, 2019G, the fair values of the Group's financial instruments are estimated to approximate their carrying values. 28. NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS TO STANDARDS AND STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE The new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective as at 31 December 2019G are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective. Following is a brief on the new IFRS and amendments to IFRS, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019G: Standards, interpretations and amendments adopted IFRS 16 - Leases IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model.www.jamjoompharma.com508JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 28. NEW STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS TO STANDARDS AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET EFFECTIV (continued) The Company adopted IFRS 16 using the simple modified method of adoption with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019G and therefore comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Under this method, the lease liability is measured based on the remaining lease payments discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of the date of initial application; and the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is an amount equal to the carrying amount of the lease liability on the date of initial application. Any prepayments, accruals or lease incentives relating to previous operating lease are adjusted against the right of use asset at the initial application date. The Company elected to use the transition practical expedient allowing the standard to be applied only to contracts that were previously identified as leases applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 at the date of initial application. The Company also elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option ('short-term leases'), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value ('low-value assets'). In addition, the Company has also used practical expedients to apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics and excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application. Reconciliation of lease liability At the date of initial application, the Company recognized right-of-use asset and lease liability of SR 2.7 million. The weighted average rate applied is 4.5%. The impact of adoption of IFRS as at January 1, 2019G is as follows: Minimum lease payments 3,890,502 Effect of discounting using the incremental borrowing rate (704,625) Liabilities recognized based on application of IFRS 16 3,185,877 Impact on comprehensive income During the year ended December 31, 2019G, due to the adoption of IFRS 16 - leases, the Company'srentals decreased by SAR 235,399, interest expense has increased by SAR 17,103, net profit has increased by SAR 235,399 and operating profit has increased by SAR 252,502.www.jamjoompharma.com509JAMJOOM PHARMACEUTICALS FACTORY (A Closed Saudi Joint Stock Company) NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At 31 December 2019G (Expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals) 28.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) across multiple geographies was confirmed in early 2020G, causing disruptions to businesses and economic activities. The Group considers this outbreak to be a non-adjusting post balance sheet event. At this early stage, the Group is in the process of assessing any potential impact. The management and those charged with governance will continue to monitor the situation and accordingly update all stakeholders as soon as more information is available. Changes in circumstances may require enhanced disclosures or recognition of adjustments in the consolidated financial statements of the Group in the financial year 2020G. 30. APPROVAL OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These consolidated financial statements were approved and authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 Shawwal 1441H, corresponding to 10 June 2020G.www.jamjoompharma.com @jamjoompharma Back to cover page "}
