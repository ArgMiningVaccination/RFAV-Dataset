The main difficulties in the treatment of onychomycosis refer to the duration of treatments and their side effects. Thus, it becomes relevant to look for new therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of such common diseases that are efficient without causing the undesirable side effects on the patient's body. In this way, the objective of this study was to develop an anthroposophical formula for the treatment of onychomycosis, based on Phosphorus and Formica rufa, from an extensive bibliographic survey on the functions of these components, evaluating within the principles of Anthroposophy. Considering the set of knowledge and practices on the use of these components, it was possible to arrive at a proposal therapy that can be effective for the treatment of onychomycosis. After an extensive review of several existing patents, it was observed that formulations containing Phosphorus and Formica rufa together have not been described in other studies. Subsequently, our research group published a patent of the anthroposophical formula using these two components, with the number BR1020180750755, which will be efficient to help the recovery of nails, and facilitate normal growth.", "sitename": "http://www.eurekaselect.com", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate or nail bed that leads to the gradual destruction of the nail.
