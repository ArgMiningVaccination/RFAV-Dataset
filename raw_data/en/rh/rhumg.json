It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and patient, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapies. The Defining Principles of Integrative Medicine - Patient and practitioner are partners in the healing process. - All factors that influence health, wellness, and disease are taken into consideration, including mind, spirit, and community, as well as the body. - Appropriate use of both conventional and alternative methods facilitates the body's innate healing response. - Effective interventions that are natural and less invasive should be used whenever possible. - Integrative medicine neither rejects conventional medicine nor accepts alternative therapies uncritically. - Good medicine is based in good science. It is inquiry-driven and open to new paradigms. - Alongside the concept of treatment, the broader concepts of health promotion and the prevention of illness are paramount. - Practitioners of integrative medicine should exemplify its principles and commit themselves to self-exploration and self-development.
