The new report covers research funded by t he member organisations of the MSFFG in a total of 192 research projects over the period 1999 to the end of 2004. During this time, the predominant areas of research hav e been the molecular biology of Salmonella , reflecting the availability of various Salmonella genome sequences and the pathogenicity of the bacterium and its inte raction with different hosts, again with a strong molecular component. Salmonella is the second most commonly laborat ory-confirmed caus e of food-borne infections in the UK, after Campylobacter . The majority of cases are sporadic incidents, but there are outbreaks affecting numbers of people. In particular these tend to be associated with the consumpti on of raw or inadequately cooked food, or cooked food cross-contaminated from raw food. Food-borne Salmonella primarily represents a public health issue not only because of the number of cases but also because of their severity. The associ ated mortality is low but significant. Many different serotypes of Salmonella have been identified, several of which are associated with food-borne illness in humans . In the UK, the vast majority of Salmonella cases are caused by S. Enteritidis and S.Typhimurium. The number of Salmonella research projects to the micr obiological safety of food in the UK supported by the me mber organisations of the MSFFG has exceeded the number relating to either Campylobacter or Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC) during the period of this report. Significant advances achieved through research During the period of the report, t he understanding of the pathogenicity of Salmonella has greatly advanced, in particular based on the molecular biology of the bacterium and comparative genomic studies making us e of the available genome sequences. Understanding of gene function and the identification of specific genes important in the process of invasion and colonisation has greatly developed, benefiting from the application of genomic tec hnologies such as DNA microarrays and gene knock-out mutant collections. There has also been progress in the understanding of the host genetics: this has been most notable with respect to poultry. The research effort to address the reduction and elimination of Salmonella from the human food-supply chain has been considerable. In particular, it has supported major activity to reduce the occurrence of poultry-associated salmonellosis, which has been very successful in recent years.MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 3Outstanding issues Although significant progress has been m ade in understanding many aspects of the molecular biology of the pathogenicity of Salmonella , there does appear to be a need to develop a coherent explanat ion events in the host animal when it is invaded by a wild-type Salmonella . There is a similar need to develop an understanding of the value of vaccines, the various vaccinatio n options and other potential interventions for farm animals, and how to move these forward. The overa ll conclusion is that the research effort into Salmonella is strong, addressing most areas, but that some gaps remain.MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 4LAY OVERVIEW This report provides an overview of recent research in the UK on Salmonella , an important cause of food poisoning. Salmonella is a very common group of bacte ria found throughout the environment including in farm animals, especially pou ltry and pigs, and capable of infecting humans. Food-borne Salmonella is the second most co mmonly reported cause of bacterial food poisoning in the UK, after Campylobacter . The illness is characterised by watery and sometimes bloody dia rrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Occasionally there can be complications such as septicaemia and septic arthritis and on rare occasions death, but these are uncommon, mostly affecting the elderly. Transmission of Salmonella to humans occurs by consumption of contaminated food, generally of animal origin, or from faecal material from an infected person or animal. Food-poisoning caused by Salmonella is particularly associated with meat, poultry and eggs. In addition, there have been some recent outbreaks associated with consumption of lettuce. Reasons for the large number of cases of food poisoning caused by Salmonella include the natural leve ls of occurrence of the bacterium in the gut of food-producing animals, the opportunities for cross- contamination during the poultry, meat and egg production processes (including organic and free-range) and the behaviour of ca terers and consumers. It should be noted that food handlers w ho observe good hygiene practices are very rarely responsible for initiating outbreaks. During recent years there has been a ma jor research effort in the UK, and internationally, relating to food-borne Salmonella and food poisoning, which is reflected in this report. This research has led to an increased understanding of the causes and control of Salmonella infections in humans, which in turn has been applied to the food industry and consumer pr actice. The overall effect has been a marked decrease in the number of cases of Salmonella food poisoning in humans in the last few years.MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 5TABLE OF CONTENTS OVERVI EW................................................................................................................2 LAY OVER VIEW ........................................................................................................4 INTRODUC TION........................................................................................................6 1.

BACKGROUND 1.1 The Microbiological Safety of F ood Funders Group (MSFFG) has previously published reports giving an overview of the research funded by member organisations of the MSFFG relating to Yersinia enterolitica5. As part of the ongoing process of considering research with all food-borne pat hogens supported by MSFFG members, the group has undertak en an update of its previous review of research on Salmonella published in 1999 . This updated report covers research undertaken since 1999. 1.2 This report gives an overview of research related to food-borne Salmonella undertaken in the UK and funded by mem bers of the MSFFG. It summarises active research in the period from 1999 to the end of 200 4 and seeks to set this in the context of ot her research and issues wit hin the UK and overseas. In addition, an assessment is made of those areas where further research might be needed. 1.3 Salmonella are ubiquitous Gram-negative bac teria found throughout the world in a very wide range of animals and env ironments. The bacteria are important human and animal pathogens as well as being carried without symptoms by many animals. Salmonella are one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the UK: only Campylobacter infections are reported more frequently6. The majority of recorded cases of Salmonella in the UK are sporadic although outbreaks occur within the general population and at institutions. The illness is generally associated with ingestion of contaminated food and symptoms are characterised by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, headache and fever. Complications include septicaemia or focal infection such as septic arthritis. 1.4 There is significant under-ascertai nment of food-borne gastro-intestinal infections. On this basis, a met hod has been developed to estimate more accurately the morbidity and mortality of disease due to various food-borne pathogens. Salmonella are estimated to cause ju st over 3% of food-borne infections in England and Wales (Adak et al (2002)) (See Appendix 1 ). Of these, approximately 0.3% of cases were fatal. This study, and that of Mead et al (1999) demonstrate that Salmonella account for more deaths that any other identified food-borne pathogens. It is estimat ed that of 1800 food-borne deaths due to known pathogens in the US, Salmonella were responsible for 31% (Mead et al (1999)) and amongs t the 480 deaths due to 2005 Salmonella report 7foodborne disease in 2000 in England and Wales, 25% were attributable to Salmonella (Appendix 1, Adak et al (2002)). 1.5 There are many different serotypes of Salmonella and more than 2460 have been characterised7. Of these, Salmonella Enteritidis is currently the most common serotype found associated wit h human salmonellosis in the UK (Figure 2). There was a significant increase in the reported number of Salmonella infections in the UK during t he 1980s, which was mainly due to an increase in the number of S. Enteritidis infections. The other common serotype of Salmonella of public health significance is Salmonella Typhimurium (until the mid-1980s the most frequently isolated serotype) and specific phage types of both S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. 1.6 Further significant serotypes of Salmonella which infect humans include Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi, which cause typhoid or typhoid- like fever. Infections with both pat hogens are almost exclusively acquired overseas, generally after consumption of heavily contaminated water, and few cases are reported in the UK. Gi ven concern about the increase in antimicrobial drug resistance amongst pathogens, it is also notable that several serotypes of Salmonella , including S. Typhimurium, Salmonella Virchow and Salmonella Hadar are often resistant to multiple antibiotics.

Typhimurium, NorthernIreland Data can be found in Appendix 2 Table 3 1.7 Farm animals, especially poultry and cattl e, represent an important reservoir of Salmonella . Many animals are carriers of the bacteria, showing no sign of infection. There is considerable oppor tunity for cross contamination between animals and introduction of the bacteria to the food-supply chain. During the last twenty years concerns about the increased occurrence of food-poisoning caused by Salmonella led to significant e ffort to determine how Salmonella are introduced to humans and how the food- supply chain may be managed so as to reduce the likelihood of this. Furt hermore, the planned changes in the rules relating to older cattle entering the human food-supply chain8 may have a significant effect on the pattern of occurrence of Salmonella and therefore of the incidence of infections in humans. 1.8 The focus of this report is on re search with the principal serotypes of Salmonella which are found in the food-suppl y chain within the UK and which cause food-borne, gastro-intestinal ill ness in humans. These are primarily Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium. However, there is reference within the repor t to other strains of Salmonella . Many of these can cause human illness, are us ed within the overall research effort into the 8 http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/meat/otmreview/ http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2004/041201a.htmMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 9organism, and data from su ch projects does contribute to the general understanding of the organism and it s relationship with its hosts. 2. NOMENCLATURE 2.1 When first identified, Salmonella were named according to the disease they caused or the animal from which they were isolated. This approach changed to naming antigenically distinct types after the geographical location at which a strain was first isolated. With time, and the relatively recent introduction of detailed DNA homology studies, t he identificati on and naming of Salmonella has become increasingly unclear, culmi nating in the simultaneous use of two different nomenclature systems9 (Tindall et al (2005)). Prior to this, the most commonly used system was that of Le Minor and Popoff (1987). A proposal for rationalising this situati on has been described (Tindall et al (2005)) which clarifies the relationship between the various subspecies and serovars ofrelevance to intestinal disease in humans and animals. 2.2 The nomenclature in the majority, if not all, of the projec ts addressed in this report follows that of Le Minor and Popo ff (1987), which divides the bacterial species Salmonella enterica into six subspecies: enterica, salamae, arizonae, diarizonae, houtenae and indica. In practice, most of the many serotypes of Salmonella which have been identified fall within the species Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica including serotypes originally referred to as , Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella paratyphi, and Salmonella typhi. These are now defined as, for example, Salmonella enterica subsp enterica serotype Typhi, which may be shortened to S. Typhi. This is the common practice and isused throughout this report. 3. M ETHODS 3.1 This report is based, as was the 1999 MSFFG Salmonella Report, on those projects which are funded by the member organisations of the MSFFG. At the time of writing this report, these we re the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), theBiotechnology and Biolog ical Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Department of Health (DH), the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland (DARD) , FSA Scotland, FSA Wales, FSA Northern Ireland, the Food Safety Pr otection Board (FSPB), the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural A ffairs Department (SEERAD) and the Scottish Executive Depart ment of Health (SEDH). 3.2 The MSFFG project database 10 was used to identify projects for inclusion in this report. The database was sear ched using the term \"Salmonella\", 9 http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/salmonellanom.html#approvedlists 10 The MSFFG maintains a database containing informat ion about research projects in the area of the microbiological safety of food that are funded by the members of t he MSFFG. Members of the Group provide the project information from t heir respective project record systems.MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 10identifying all projects which included t he term in the title, key words or any component of the text that was available for sear ching. Projects which were completed by 1st August 1999 were not included. A further search on the BBSRC Oasis database was also ca rried out, using the key word \"Salmonella\". Additional relevant projects identif ied through project reports accessed from the MSFFG database were al so checked. Overall, this gave a total of 161 distinct projects for inclusi on in this report: a full list of the projects is provided at Appendix 2. 3.3 Studentships have been omi tted from consideration. 3.4 Research funded by other agencies, including the Wellcome Trust, NHS Scotland, Health Protection Agency (H PA) and the Medical Research Council (MRC), as well as international research is not included within the body of the report. However, a summary of re search funded through these bodies is given in Section 4 below. 4. R ESEARCH FUNDED BY OTHER FUNDING BODIES Within the UK 4.1 The MRC has two projects found in their research database through searching on the term \"salmonella\". A similar search of the Wellcome Trust grants databases for the period 2000 to 2004 s howed seventeen projects: overall these were not related to food-borne Salmonella . 4.2 The research projects funded by t he Wellcome Trust include the sequencing of the genomes of six Salmonella serotypes by the Sanger Institute11. These are S. Enteriditis PT4, two different strains of S. Typhimurium (DT104 S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi and Salmonella gallinarum . This is an important and significant addition to the research effort with all Salmonella as the genome sequences underpin many aspects of research wit h the bacteria. Within Europe 4.3 The European Union supports research relating to Salmonella across similar areas to those addressed within the UK. The Cordis database includes at least 68 research projects relating to Salmonella of which at least 35 relate to Salmonella in food12. Within the USA 4.4 In the United Stat es, federal funding of Salmonella research relevant to food- borne illness is supported by the National Institutes for Health (NIH), the US Department of Agricultur e and the Food and Drug Admi nistration. The NIH currently has 180 projects recorded in its database which relate to 11 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Microbes/ 12 http://ica.cordis.lu/search/index.cfmMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 11Salmonella13. Not all of these are relev ant to food-borne illness although a significant number of the projects consider pathogenicity and the host- pathogen interaction. In addition, the US Government supports the Food Safety Research Information Office14. Its web site database includes 194 projects related to Salmonella , some of which are not funded within the US. 13 http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/ 14 http://www.nal.usda.gov/fsrio/index.htmMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 12MSFFG FUNDED PATHOGENIC SALMONELLA RESEARCH 1999 TO THE END OF 2004 5. D ETECTION , DIFFERENTIATION AND DIAGNOSIS 5.1 For any understanding of the relati onship between a bacterium and its host, there is a need to be able both to detec t the bacterium and to differentiate among types within the species. Methods for the detection and differentiation of Salmonella serotypes are well establis hed, with recognised techniques being used within the food industry and the research community. However, there is a constant need to ensure that the best tec hniques are available, and that best practice is followed. Ta king advantage of the various advances in the genomics and genetics of Salmonella , there is an important place for ongoing consideration of new approaches to both detection and differentiation, in particular usi ng molecular biology techniques. 5.2 It is also important to ensure that met hods are explored for the quantification, separation and recovery of Salmonella from foodstuffs. There is a possibility that, in the absence of such techni ques, the detection of the presence of Salmonella in food will be dependent on enric hment approaches which, whilst effective do not enable the quantification of the occurrence of the bacterium. In addition, there are some environments from which it is not easy to culture Salmonella directly, such as nutrient depleted samples. For these, separation techniques are needed that allow the detection of Salmonella after separation of the bacteria from other components of the samples. 5.3 Overview of current research Detection 5.3.1 There is considerable variation in the testing methods and procedures for isolating and detecting Salmonella (FSA ZB00023 ) in the poultry industry. For on-farm testing, research has identif ied boot swabs (of farm workers) and direct litter sampling or swabbing as t he most effective methods for detecting Salmonella and it suggested that improved swabbing methods should be used in abattoirs ( FSA B15003 ). There is similar research to investigate standardisation of sampling and analysis for bacteria in poultry abattoirs ( FSA M01017 ). In project FSPB 00-RESR-046, bulk tank milk filters were used to detect selected bacteria in raw milk at farm level. 5.3.2 One project has investigated t he use of pathogen-spec ific antibodies to separate different homogenate ( FSA FS1319) . The proposed bacterial trap was initially developed using Salmonella and Listeria . It was found that the method, using the Dynabead\u00ae system to support the antibodies, showed appr opriate levels of sensitivity for routine use. A version of this appr oach has been used in the development of an automated immunomagnetic s eparation ELISA (Duncanson et al (2003))15. 15 http://www.ehj-online.com/archive/2000/may2004/may3.htmlMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 135.3.3 Several projects have been f unded which address the detection of Salmonella within the food-supply chain. These have included the use of immunomagnetic nanoparticles to detect Salmonella without any need to isolate or culture the bacteria ( SEERAD UMA/001/95 ) and techniques dependent on molecular method has been succe ssfully developed for use with enrichment broths B09008 ) and and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)approaches have been used in identifying t he presence of antibiotic-resistant strains ( VM02105 ). 5.3.4 Work in project SEERAD urg/001/96 investigated whether it is possible to distinguish between viable and non-viable cells isol ated from food matrices. 5.3.5 The successful cultur e of isolated bacteria is essential for further characterisation and it is important that there is awareness of the usefulness of different culture m edia for the growth of Salmonella . It was found ( DANI 9642 ) that there was considerable vari ation in the growth of different Salmonella serotypes in commercial culture media, and that growth at 35\u00b0C was poor in every case. Differentiation 5.3.6 The differentiation of strains of any pathogenic bacterium is valuable for epidemiological studies. For practica l purposes, serotyping, antimicrobial sensitivity testing and phage typing, s upported by plasmid analysis and PFGE are often sufficient for analysis of human samples, the Kauffmann-White scheme being the established method for Salmonella16. However, the advances in molecular biology, includi ng the publication of various bacterial genome sequences suggest that it woul d be possible to develop rapid, efficient and accessible methods for r outinely analysing genomic diversity for Salmonella . Work through several research projects has investigated this including variety of different mo lecular typing techniques, combined with two electrophoretic techniques were compared ( OZ0311 ). Of the methods used, it was concl uded that amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) typing was an appropriate genotyping method, able to discriminate between different Salmonella serotypes and which could be developed to give sufficient reproduc ibility. Some reservations were expressed as to the im provements the methods offered over conventional serotyping, and the suggestion was made that microarray analysis couldprovide a more robust mechanism ( OZ0312 ). 16 http://www.hpa.org.uk/srmd/div_cdmssd_gpbu/salmonella.htmMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 145.4 Gaps in currently funded research 5.4.1 In the 1999 MSFFG Salmonella Report, it was noted that there was a need for work to determine whether molecula r methods could be used in order to support epidemiological studies. Some of these methods are now in use, but other molecular typing methods ar e becoming available and increased understanding of the genetics of the bacteri a is providing new insight into the relationships between the different Salmonella types. As a single method for identification of all strains of Salmonella is unlikely to be found there is a continuing need to explore possible new methods for differentiating the many Salmonella strains. This could include evaluating new technologies such as microarray typing. 5.4.2 A further issue i dentified in the 1999 MSFFG Salmonella Report was the need for appropriate improved, standardised and validated methods for sampling at the point of slaughter and for foods. Th is area is being extensively addressed. However, there is evidence that furt her work to develop robust, reliable and universal culture methods for Salmonella after isolation fr om food or animal samples would be valuable. 6. M ICROBIAL PHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS 6.1 The study of the genetics and physiology of Salmonella is aimed at understanding the function of genes and the interaction of the bacterium with its environment. Much of research of this type is aimed at understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis and virulence, and is covered in the relevant sections of this report. Projects that focus on fundament al aspects of the bacterium, or provide underpinning tool s for use by the research community are described in this section. 6.2 All the work on the genetics and physiology of Salmonella , and many of the studies of epidemiology and pathogenesis, have benefit ed from the increasing availability of the genome sequences of many species, serotypes and strains of Salmonella17. The genome sequences are enablin g the creation of sets of gene knock-out mutants and DNA microarra ys. These resources are enabling far more rapid progress in understandi ng of the genetics, physiology and general pathogenesis of the bacterium, to the general advancement of the field. 6.3 Overview of current research Survival in the environment 6.3.1 Stresses such as heat or acid treatment, as would be experienced by Salmonella in the food-supply chain, are likely to have an impact on the genetic properties of Salmonella populations. It was no ted that high levels of tolerance of acid, heat, air-drying and per oxide correlated with the presence of 17 http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/MicrobesMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 15a major stress response protein (RpoS ) whereas tolerance of UV light and growth characteristics at low temperatures did not ( FSA B01007 ). It was also found that in natural populat ions there was a loss of heat resistance in some strains due to a mutation in the RpoS gene. After subjecting the bacteria to heat cycling, both RpoS positive and negative subpopulations showed increased heat resistance. This did not a ffect the bacterial resistance to high pressure or salt concentration ( FSA B01009 ). S. Enteritidis was exposed to r epeated cycles of acid stress which led to an increased resistance to acid; the link between this and RpoS expression was to be investigated. Ot her genes are also involved in the stress response and the role of several of these in the extracytoplasmic stress response of Salmonella was studied ( BBSRC PRS12222 ). 6.3.2 Physical stresses such as high pressure or treatment with electric fields may cause significant memb rane damage as a primary mechanism of cell death. The interaction between cell memb rane damage achieved through these mechanisms and other relevant factors such as pH and osmotic stress was investigated in order to determine t he overall impact on cellular viability ( FSA FS1532 ). 6.3.3 A very specific and potentially problem atic response to stress is the formation of viable, non-culturable cells. Some work has been undertaken to investigate the infectivity of such cells form ed in response to nutritional stress ( BBSRC D06412 ). 6.3.4 The survival of several Salmonella serotypes in dry conditions found that S. Enteritidis phage types PT4, PT6 and S. Typhimurium DT104 were no better able to survive than other Salmonella serotypes. Survival was dependent on expression of RpoS an d intact lipopolysaccharide and Salmonella serotypes impaired in either one or both of these showed poor survival. Strains lacking SEF17, fl agella and the OmpF porin were their survival characteristics ( FSA B03012 ). Other research is investigating the effect of environmental change on the expression of genes involved in infection ( BBSRC 41208 ). 6.3.5 The mechanisms of the stress response have been explored at the genetic level. Projects have focussed on i dentifying genes and proteins which are induced during the bacterial response to stress such as entry into stationary phase ( BBSRC 4321208 ). Other projects have worked on genes and proteins known to be identified with the stress response in order to understand their function ( BBSRC of pr ojects have been undertaken to investigate Salmonella physiology and gene function. These have included the lux-S based quorum sensing system ( BBSRC D17313 ) which will have relevance to bacterial infectivity, and work on the role of iron ( BBSRC ) all of which are involved in bacterial response to oxygen-related stress. 6.3.7 The interaction between S. Typhimurium and amoeba has also been investigated with a view to under standing how the protozoa influence Salmonella growth and gene expression in a number of environments (BBSRC MMI09738/MMI09727, D18179 ). This is of relevance in determining aspects of the mechanisms of pathogenesis and survival of Salmonella . Similarly, the development of fermente r-based simulations of gut habitats will give information on the interacti on of gut commensal organisms with pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella (SEERAD RRI/504/95 ). 6.3.8 Understanding the growth of Salmonella within the intestinal tract of its host is important. Research includes det ermining the growth of several Salmonella serotypes in calves and pigs, includ ing an assessment of the impact of Salmonella pathogenicity island-2 (SPI-2) and the ( BBSRC 860 ). For poultry there is research to understand the energy generation r equirements of Salmonella serotypes which are able to colonise the alimentary tract of chick ens, including considering the impact of different breeding lines of the bi rds on the bacterial growth ( Defra OZ0320 ). 6.3.9 Two projects have l ooked at the growth of Salmonella in food. In one, it was found that the microstructure of food had a significant effect on the survival of a small fraction of bacterial food-bor ne pathogens, in particular where there are microscopic water-rich niches withi n the food matrix in which a small number of bacteria were able to survive ( FSA B01001 ). Research in project FSA B03015 considered the growth of S. Enteritidis and other Salmonella in eggs. It was found that a high concent ration of glucose present in the eggs and relatively low iron levels were link ed to high levels of bacterial growth. S. Enteritidis survived in albumen at hen body temperature, a property was not seen with other Salmonella strains that have previously been widespread. 6.4 Gaps in currently funded research 6.4.1 Currently there are m any research projects that are exploiting the genetics of Salmonella serotypes or are considering the interaction of the bacterium with its environment. There are no clear as pects of the genetics and physiology of the bacterium that are not covered to some extent by existing research. There is a continuing need for research comparing Salmonella with other enteric bacteria. A number of genetic and genomic tools have been developed in the last few years, in parti cular wide range of knock-out mutants. These should be available to the scient ific community through conventional mechanisms, generally from the orig inating researcher. In the funding of future projects, it will be valuable to ensure that these resources are fully exploited, thus avoiding duplication. 6.4.2 There is little research to addre ss the role of phage integration in the epidemiology, survival and pathogenicity of Salmonella . This is an area whichMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 17could benefit from additional work. 7. P ATHOGENESIS AND HOST RESPONSE 7.1.1 Salmonellosis in humans occurs when Salmonella penetrate from the gut lumen to the epithelium of the small intestine and then cause inflammation. In animals, disease can occur in a similar m anner. In addition, in more extreme cases in humans and animals the bacte ria can enter the blood stream and colonize other tissues such as the liver or ovaries. 7.1.2 The majority of resear ch into the pathogenicity of Salmonella and the host response to this is undertaken in anima ls, in particular poultry and other farm animals, as well as mouse models. The research provides the opportunity to explore control and intervention stra tegies, for example development of vaccines so as to reduce the level of bacterial carriage in poultry and other farm animals. The host-pathogen relati onship is an important component of the study of Salmonella pathogenesis. A notable feat ure of this research is the increasing use of host as well as bacterial genomic information andtechniques, in particular to explor e the host specificity of various Salmonella serotypes. 7.2 Overview of current research The molecular biology of Salmonella virulence 7.2.1 There is a significant research e ffort to apply molecular biology and genomics to the understanding of the virulence of Salmonella . Several projects consider the role of Salmonella outer membrane proteins (S ops). These proteins are involved in the induction of the host re sponse to infection by the pathogen. Projects have included those investigating the cellular response to individual Sops ( BBSRC D18830 ), the structure function and role of selected Sops including the host response ( BBSRC 0177, 0244 ), the function of Sop and pathogenicity-island-encode d proteins (Pips) within host cells and the induction of the initial inflammatory response ( BBSRC 0858 ), the response of ( BBSRC 1035, BBSRC 1116 ) and BBSRC BFP11326, Salmonella invasion-associated pr oteins (Sips) have also been identified as being involved in the virulence of the bacterium, and there are projects to det ermine the role of Sips with respect to Sops ( BBSRC 0219 ), and (BBSRC D07439 ). A further Salmonella surface protein of interest is ShdA: deletion of the gene results in reduced colonisation and the structure:function relationship of the protein is being invest igated, including ex amining the role of the protein in persistence of Salmonella in the host intestine ( BBSRC D20084 ). 7.2.3 Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) proteins are also associated with colonisation of the host gastro-intestinal tract. The infl uence hasMSFFG BBSRC 860 ) is being investigated. 7.2.4 Research is also being undertaken to investigate the role of the transcription factor SlyA of S. Typhimurium (BBSRC BFP11284 ), the Salmonella l u x S - based quorum sensing system ( BBSRC D17313 ) in Salmonella virulence and immunity. 7.2.5 There is research which consider s the commonality betw een structures of virulence factors in different species and serotypes of Salmonella and enteropathogens generally ( NMR techniques to the structure:function relationshi ps of the relevant proteins. Host specificity in pathogenesis 7.2.6 There are several re search projects exploring the relationship between virulent, infectious Salmonella and the affected host. These include projects to determine the molecular basis of Salmonella serotype host specificity (Defra OZ0319 ) and the functional differences in the ability of Salmonella strains to invade various enterocyte cell lines ( SEERAD SAC/136/97 ich are potentially chicke n-specific have been identified and it was also observ ed that the growth rate of S. choleraesuis in pigs is considerably lower than that of S. Typhimurium despite the former causing more severe systemic ly 150 genes have been found which are required for colonisation of the gastro-intestinal tracts of chickens or calves ( Defra VF0101 ). Amongst these genes are several possible new pathogenicity islands, at least three of which appear to encode genes required for colonisation of chicks only. Further characterisation of some of these genes has confirmed that they are involved in species-specific colonisation. The use of STM as a mechanism for identifying genes essential for colonisation is now being extended to pigs ( Defra VF0101 ). 7.2.8 Successful growth within the host is essential for a pathogen and is dependent on the rate of bacterial replication and the bacterial resistance to killing by the host. The growth of several different Salmonella serotypes in pigs and calves is being investigated in particular wit h a view to understanding the impact of pathogenicity island SPI-2 ( BBSRC S14753 ). The presence of this pathogenicity island has been found to influence overall growth of Salmonella in vivo. This research contributes to an understanding of the biological basis of strain and serotype:host specificity of Salmonella . So does research seeking to identify factors responsib le for host-specificity of selected Salmonella serotypes ( BBSRC 0302 ) and investigating the infection of cattle and pigs with a variety of different wild-type and mutant Salmonella serotypes (BBSRC 10274/0751 ) and research into the growth and metabolism of Salmonella serotypes capable of colonisi ng the alimentary tract 2005 Salmonella report 19Host:bacterial interactions 7.2.9 Developing an understanding of t he interaction between the bacterial pathogen and its host is an underlying factor driving much of the research covered in this report. However, t here are a number of projects which specifically aim to consider this re lationship and to explore its modulation. 7.2.10 Cytokines and other immune system m odulators are very important in a host animal's response to infection. For example, project BBSRC D13683 examined the phagocytic ce lls involved in locations of infection of Salmonella , considering in particular the activati on or down-regulation of a variety of cytokine and other immune system molecu les. A highly focussed approach is taken by projects BBSRC 0856 and BBSRC D14755 where the role of interferon gamma (IFN ) and IFN -producing cells are investigated. In both projects, host cell function and responses are a primary focus of the research. In contrast, research within BBSRC 4131887 focuses on a variety of aspects of gut immunology, in particular t he interaction between lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells in order to study host response to infection at a molecular level. 7.2.11 The role of protective cell m ediated immunity in the host response to Salmonella infection has been examined in mice. The particular focus was on the identification of proteins se creted by the bacteria which were recognised by antibodies and T cells ( BBSRC D11572 ). 7.2.12 The mechanism of Salmonella infection involves the in vasion of individual host cells by the bacteria, and two projects are using fluorescence tagged proteins to investigate bacterial:host interacti ons at a and cellular level (BBSRC 41208, BBSRC BBSB02266 ) 7.2.13 Mice are used as a model animal fo r investigating a variety of aspects of pathogen-host interaction. For example, the role of the lipid A domain of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is critical in causing death in mice infected by S. Typhimurium and research is being undertaken to develop further an understanding of how host macrophage res ponses are affected by the LPS (BBSRC D16845 ). It is suggested, and further research aimed to address this (BBSRC 9912336 ), that this may be in part due to interaction between the LPS and specific Toll-like receptors on the surface of mouse macrophages. The role of lipid A in inducing host response to S. Typhimurium infection of mice is also investigat ed, using a variety of mu tants with modified lipid A structures ( BBSRC D09660 and D09961 ). The switching-on of Salmonella genes during infection in mice is also being investigated ( BBSRC 41208 ). 7.2.14 The mouse typhoid inve stigate the role T-cells in Salmonella BBSRC D04785 ) and the function of IL12, both in terms of its influence over bacterial growth and in the development of protective T and B-cell memory ( BBSRC D09737 ). 7.2.15 Three projects focus on the imm une response seen in chickens following infection with both food-poisoning and potential vaccine serotypes ofMSFFG BFP11365, 11367 and 0245) . Further projects focus on the impact of particular Salmonella genes on the host immune response to infection. Consistent differences were observed in the duration and excretion of S. enterica from different in-bred lines of chickens. However, no differences in serum IgG levels were seen nor in two other genes associated withresistance to salmonellosis OZ0314 ). Similarly no clear relationship has been found between resistance to caecal carriage of Salmonella and expression of a va riety of other genes ( Defra OZ0320 ). Further work on these iss ues is also being undertaken in BBSRC 0753 . 7.2.16 In contrast, there ar e several projects examinin g the impact of chicken genes on the response of these hosts to Salmonella infection. Approaches include research into genes identified as conferring resistance to Salmonella infection (BBSRC 0237, 0239, 0243 and GAT09084 ). In addition, chicken gene microarrays have been constructed, as well as microarrays for S. Typhimurium, in order to compare gene expression profiles during adhesion and invasion of the host cells ( BBSRC 0829 ). 7.2.17 The response of different lines of chickens to infection by Salmonella spp was found to vary reproducibly. The va riation occurred in the mononuclear phagocyte system macrophages clearly implicated ( OZ0313 ). The cytokine response to invasion by diffe rent serotypes was also varied, with S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium inducing a significantly stronger IL-6 response than S. Gallinarum, which could provide an explanation for the greater invasiveness of the latter serotype ( Defra OZ0313 ). 7.2.18 Pigs from lines resistant and susceptible to salmonellosis have been investigated in order to identify genet ic loci known to be implicated in susceptibility in other animals ( BBSRC GAT09015 , 0238 ). The Salmonella induced intestinal inflammatory response in pigs is also being investigated, particularly considering host specif icity of the infective bacteria ( BBSRC D15635, 0923 ). Other research shows that Salmonella reside within lymph and that the interaction of Salmonella with the cells in the intestinal mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes influences the systemic spread of the bacteria (Defra OZ0315 ). 7.2.19 Completed research found that a possible mechanism of development of resistance to Salmonella in gnotobiotic pigs is the substantial infiltration of neutrophils by avirulent Salmonella species ( Defra OZ0313 ). This work has been extended within EU Framework IV project ( BBSRC 0246 ). 7.2.20 The interaction between in BBSRC 0396, 0755 and Defra OZ0315 , all of which projects focus on the host animal immune response to bacterial antigens, generally provided as live attenuated strains of Salmonella and the consequent expressi on of cytokines and other immune system modulators by t he cattle. Research within Defra OZ0318 also seeks to understand the role of host (cattl e) immunity, levels of excretion and persistence in relation to endemic and epidemic strains of Salmonella .MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 217.2.21 The interaction between Salmonella and human intestinal epithelium and immune system is crucial to virulenc e of the pathogen within humans, and is the subject of study within a number of projects including BBSRC 41387 and BBSB01901 . 7.3 Gaps in currently funded research 7.3.1 A wealth of scientific research into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of Salmonella has been supported in the last five years by the MSFFG member organisations, and there is extensive res earch supported internationally in the same field. The most urgent need is to develop a clear understanding of the mechanisms of Salmonella pathogenesis and host response as these relate to the real world as opposed to the laborat ory. There are a number of recent reviews considering the subject (f or example Hensel (2004), Rhen and Dorman (2005)) and further papers in pre ss. However, these do not address the pathogenesis of Salmonella or the host response as applied to practical and important everyday issues, includi ng the cause, process and occurrence of food poisoning in humans. 8. A NTIMICROBIAL DRUG RESISTANCE 8.1 The development and spread of antimicrobial resistanc e, in particular multi- drug resistance, is regar ded as a concern in the management of bacterial pathogens in general and Salmonella in particular. It is also of concern because of the general issue of increasi ng antibiotic resistance in many types of bacteria, and the potential for tr ansfer of the genes between bacterial species. As a reflection of the sca le of the issue, over half of the Salmonella isolates from a study of chicken carc asses for retail sale were found to be resistant to at least one antimicrobial drug and multiple drug resistance was found in 23% of the isolates ( FSA B18002 ). 8.2 Overview current research 8.2.1 A GyrA mutation assay was devel oped for rapid detection of quinolone antibiotic resistance, and has been used in a number of investigations of major outbreaks of quinolone-resistant S. Typhimurium ( FSA B10001 ). Work was also undertaken to develop met hods for detection of the ACSSpSuT18 resistance island leading to the identif ication of the resistance gene island in other S. types and Salmonella serotyopes methods are also being establis hed in order to further characterise resistant strains, and techniques such as MLST and PFGE are being used. Using PFGE it was found t hat 41 distinct pulsed fiel d profiles within a single multi-resistant strain of S. Typhimurium could be ident ified. This technique was the most powerful subtyping method among those investigated ( FSA B01013) , including DNA gyrase mutation 22to strains exhibiting resistance to quinolones. 8.2.2 There are a number of possible r outes for the spr ead of antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. Thes e include the on-farm animal management, and it was noted that there were higher levels of c ontamination of pigs with multiple resistant S. Typhimurium in continu The possibility of transferring antim icrobial resistance factors through the spreading of farm wastes is addressed in Defra OD2005, OD2008 . Transfer of antibiotic resistance was stored and spread manure ( Defra OD2005 ). There was, however, some evidence that animal manure, when applied to pasture in the summer, coul d provide a favourable environment for the exchange of genetic material betw een bacteria, and this might facilitate the spread of antimicrobial resistance ( Defra OD2008 ). 8.2.4 The use of antimic robial growth promoters in animal feed has been significantly curtailed by EU legislation19. However, there remains a need to understand how their use influences the development of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The evolutionary pressure on Salmonella in chickens under such circumstances is being investigated ( BBSRC 0772 ) and a generic model for investigating the development of antimicrobial resistance has been established ( Defra VM02105 ). There has been a particular focus on flouroquinolone antibiotics, against which the principal mechanism of resistance in Salmonella is mutations in the gyrA gene ( Defra OZ0502, VM02100 ). It was found that flouroquinol one resistance did develop in both pigs and chickens, and that the use of s pecific antibiotics coupled with specific disinfectants might accelerate the occu rrence of multiple antibiotic resistant mutants of Salmonella (Defra OD2004, VM02100 ). The mechanisms of resistance are also considered in Defra OZ0132 . 8.2.5 Given the change in farm practice aw ay from use of antimicrobial growth promoters, there is a need to determine what effect the wit hdrawal of these factors will have. This is being studied by investigating the persistence of antimicrobial resistance for up to 12 months after withdrawal of the feed additives from both pigs and chickens ( Defra VM0292 ). 8.2.6 Recent projects have been funded to investigate the us e of non-antibiotic antimicrobial agents ( Defra OD2010 ) and to determine concentrations of flouroquinolones which could be used with poultry and not lead to thedevelopment of antimicrobial resistance ( Defra VM02201 ). 8.3 Gaps in currently funded research 8.3.1 With the changes in on-farm practi ces and increased awaren ess of the risks of antimicrobial resistance, the focus of futu re research in this area could be the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial populations in response to changes in treatment and management regimes. Research on the 19 http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/ dat/2003/l_268/l_26820031018en00290043.pdfMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 23effectiveness of alternatives to antimicrobial agents may be also be appropriate, as may investigation of the spread of antimicrobial resistance in integrated poultry and pig br eeding and production networks. 8.3.2 The MSFFG intends to produce a re search overview paper on antimicrobial resistance in the future. 9. E PIDEMIOLOGY , REDUCTION AND ELIMINATION , RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT : RESEARCH SPECIFIC TO SALMONELLA IN POULTRY 9.1 In contrast with humans and other anima ls, there is the pot ential to eliminate Salmonella from UK-produced, intensivel y-housed poultry within the food industry. This is a reflection of t he importance of vertical transmission of Salmonella in poultry, coupled with the structure of the poultry and egg producing industry which is in effect a pyramid. The breeding of poultry for either meat or egg production is restrict ed to a small population of birds, which are Salmonella -free. The numbers of these bi rds is expanded through several stages (breeder, hatchery, layer or broiler flock) and then the products are moved on to the processor and thence to the retailer or caterer and finally to the consumer. Salmonella control measures can be implemented at each of the steps and processes involv ed. Thus it is conceivable that the bacterium could be eliminated at least from parts of the chicken production sector, but it is unlikely that this could be achieved across all the various different practices and scales of poultry farming operation within the UK. However, there has been considerable progress in this general area in the la st ten to fifteen years and substantial control of Salmonella within the poultry production sector is currently feasible. This is not yet t he case with cattle or pig production (See Section 10). 9.2 There has also been considerab le concern about the occurrence of Salmonella in eggs, leading to the FSA instigating its Poultry and Egg Research Programmes20. Again, research in th is area has led to greater understanding of the issues. 9.3 Overview of current research Epidemiology and occurrence 9.3.1 Work in Northern Ireland to determine the occurrence of Salmonella found that the bacterium could be isolated from 25% of egg-laying poultry flocks ( DARD 9904 ). There are no comparable data fo r Great Britain, but a Europe-wide study of the issue is nearing completi on and will give information on country- wide infection levels. 9.3.2 Research into the transmission of Salmonella between egg-laying poultry flocks ( Defra OZ0321 ) and ( FSA B03008 ) is being undertaken. The latte r project examined 8,400 poultry 20 http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/researc hinfo/foodborneillness/eggsresearch/b15reviewMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 24samples for Salmonella but did not find any on fa rms. Examination of the water delivery systems and drinking water for poultry did not find anySalmonella in the samples taken, al though significant levels of Campylobacter were observed ( FSA B03010 ). 9.3.3 The occurrence of Salmonella in chicken and other foods for retail sale has been investigated. An in itial project looked at the presence of Salmonella on retail chicken in England ( FSA B08008 ) and found Salmonella serotypes present on 25% of carcasses and on 19% of samples representing the inside and outside of the carc ass packaging (J\u00f8rgensen et al (2002)). In the later FSA national survey of retail chicken, it was found that t he overall level of frequency of contamination of re tail chicken in the UK with Salmonella was 5.7%. Significantly, fresh chicken samples showed a lower frequency ofcontamination (4.0%) than frozen (10. 4%). It was also noted that UK produced chicken showed a lower frequency of contamination with Salmonella (8.3%) than imported (13.6%), but this wa s due to the fact t hat the majority of the latter samples were frozen. Of the 30 different serotypes isolated, S. Typhimurium was the most frequent, accounting for 14% of the isolates, all but one from UK-produced chicken. Other serotypes isolated included S. Heidelberg , S. Infantis , S. Ohio and S. Thompson . 9.3.4 The occurrence of Salmonella in UK-produced eggs on retail sale has also been investigated ( FSA B18007 ). Samples of eggs were purchased throughout the United Ki ngdom and pooled samples of 6 eggs each were assessed for the presence of Salmonella on or in the eggs. It was found that 0.34% of the samples were contaminated with Salmonella . Although a direct comparison cannot be made with the pr evious study, which was held in 1995/6 in England only, by inference t here has been a three-fold reduction in the levels of Salmonella contamination since that survey, reflecting some of the measures introduced into the egg and poultry industry to control the occurrence of the pathogen. 9.3.5 The occurrence of Salmonella in egg-producer farms has been assessed (Defra OZ0317 ) and this study is now being extended OZ0321 ). S. Enteritidis was the principal seroty pe occurring on these farms, with other serotypes being uncommon (in contrast with broiler farms). The generalfindings included that prev alence was lower in farms which used vaccination, although not always; that cleaning and di sinfection measures were often insufficiently thorough to reduce contam ination; that there were pools of persistent carriage in flies and r odents; and that persistence of S. Enteritidis for many years was usual in problem cage flocks. However, barn and free- range flocks usually became Salmonella -free within 1-2 flock cycles. It was also noted that even vaccinated fl ocks produced some eggs which were contaminated (internally an d externally) and that a lo w level of contamination did spread from eggs to packaging equipment and hence to other eggs. It was demonstrated that wash ing of the eggs with ionised water did reduce surface contamination, whereas disinf ection of packaging plants did not. MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 25Reduction and elimination: vaccine development 9.3.6 There already exist a number of co mmercially available vaccines against S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium for use with poultry21 and their use is regarded as an additional measure to incr ease the resistance of birds to Salmonella and to reduce the levels of shedding of the bacteria. 9.3.7 Research on the mechani sms of immunity in chickens in response to live attenuated vaccines is addressed in BBSRC 245, 246. In addition, the mechanisms of immunity to both food-poisoning and potential vaccine serotypes of Salmonella in chickens are being examined with a view to developing improved live vaccines ( BBSRC BFP11365, BFP11367 ). Reduction and elimination in the food-supply chain 9.3.8 As poultry production is the perceived principal source of Salmonella in the food-supply chain, there is significant research effort to identify ways of reducing the levels of the bacteria at various stages of the supply chain. Critical examination of the process for rearing ch ickens for meat found that there was considerable variation in practices for sampling and testing ( FSA M01017 ) and monitoring and control the industry ( FSA ZB00023, ZB00034 ) and suggested that improved practices could be identified. Further work s howed that a critical point of contamination in broiler production was the feed mills ( FSA B03001 ) followed by the hatchery. Advice on management of the feed manufacture and the egg preparation in order to reduce the levels of Salmonella has been developed bas ed on results from these projects and used in the industry. 9.3.9 It was also found that systems for washing poultry transport crates were not adequate and improved methodologies, in cluding adequate disinfection by immersion, would be needed ( FSA ZB00033 ). 9.3.10 Levels of enteric bacteria on ra w poultry can be reduced by a number of treatments such as steam, hot water, rapid hot and cold air-drying and surface freezing ( FSA M01019 ) and commercial systems are being developed based on the cold-air drying approach. For st orage of carcasses, research showed that a mixture of S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium was not able to grow over a 15-day period on chicken held at temperatures at or below 6\u00b0C ( FSA B12004 ). 9.3.11 The production of eggs for sa le is also a route by which Salmonella can be introduced to humans. It has been found that washing eggs can lead to a reduction in bacterial levels, but only if appropriate methodologies are used (FSA B03017 ). The general conclusion was that egg washing is on balance not valuable. 21 Eg see http://www.intervet.co.uk/Species_Pages/Poultry/P oultry_Vaccines.asp?ldt=2&idxContentType=&from Cache=1&page=2MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 26Risk identification and management 9.3.12 Risk assessment models for Salmonella in poultry have been developed ( FSA B03006 ). Research is also being undertaken to develop improved approaches to risk assessment for food-borne pathogens including Salmonella in poultry ( BBSRC 0455 ). Analysis of research findings and information from leading UK poultry pr oducers led to the conclusion that effective controls for Salmonella risk management were in place within the industry, although not for Campylobacter (FSA B03005/6/7 ). 9.3.13 Eggs are generally seen as an important source of Salmonella infection for humans. Research f ound that the levels of Salmonella on the surface of eggs declined with time but that it was never possible to st ate that there were no Salmonella present ( FSA B03016 ). In addition, it wa s found that there was a relatively high transfer from t he shell to the egg contents and hands on breaking of the egg. 9.3.14 An evaluation of the US Salmonella Enteritidis risk a ssessment model has been undertaken ( FSA B01017 ). It was concluded that although the methodologies used in developing the m odel were appropriate, the model as it stood would not provide the most effe ctive analysis of UK egg production, sale and use. A simplified model, derived from the US one, did provide a starting point for the development of a model (s) for use in the UK. The FSPB has funded a project ( 03-RESR-005 ) to develop a risk assessment model for Salmonella in shell and processed eggs on the island of Ireland that will investigate the effect of vaccination on laying flocks. 9.3.15 Understanding the im pact and risks associated with consumer behaviour in relation to handling and cooking chick en meat and eggs as well as other kitchen practices, is important. It was found that a si gnificant number of consumers followed practices (such as how meat was stored, washing of boards and surfaces, use of cloths) that were likely to lead to spreading of bacteria within the kitchen ( FSA B02016 ). It was noted that Salmonella was not found in kitchen cloths, although ot her enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli were ( Salmonella was generally not detected in ch icken or on kitchen surfaces. It was also noted that there was little occurrence of Salmonella on the packaging materials of raw chicken nor on shelves where raw, packed chickens were kept within retail outlets . This was seen as indicating that cross-contamination from the packaging was not a sign ificant source of risk (FSA B03002 ). 9.3.16 The possible transfer of Salmonella from contaminated chicken carcasses in the kitchen was analysed ( FSA B02010 ). Although little contamination occurred, there were frequent hygiene e rrors which could lead to cross- contamination. The cook ing of chicken in both the domestic context and catering establishments was genera lly found to be adequate by standard industry tests ( FSA B01015 ) but the potential remained for cross- contamination in kitchens.MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 279.4 Gaps in currently funded research 9.4.1 The progress in understanding of Salmonella in poultry has been substantial in recent years, with a noticeable benefit in reduc ing the incidence of the bacterium within both the chicken meat and egg industries. There is however, less understanding of the same issues in other poultry meat production notably the turkey breeding and meat production industry. 9.4.2 There also remain the iss ues associated with persistence of S. Enteritidis in some farms and commercial cage laye r houses, which continues despite vaccination. There may be a need for furt her research on these problems, as well as on the transfer of Salmonella from feedmills, hatcheries and persistently infected farms. 9.4.3 A further area where some additional research could be beneficial is in developing a greater understandi ng of consumer practice. 10. E PIDEMIOLOGY , REDUCTION AND ELIMINATION , RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT : RESEARCH RELATING TO NON -POULTRY MEAT 10.1 Poultry meat and eggs are t he most important sources of Salmonella for the human food-supply chain, and therefore have been a ma jor focus of research in recent years. However, Salmonella can also be introduced to man from red meat, and research with farm animals other than poultry is therefore supported. 10.2 Overview of current research Epidemiology and occurrence 10.2.1 There are both endemic and epidemic strains of Salmonella . Understanding the relationship between these and thei r host organisms is important for development of control strategies for t he bacterium. Research to investigate and model endemic and epidemic Salmonella in pigs and cattle, as well as exploring herd immunity and excreti on differences in cattle, is being undertaken within project Defra OZ0318 . 10.2.2 It was found that in E ngland and Wales up to 25% of dairy herds were positive for Salmonella (generally with no clinical sympt oms), but that the proportion of herds carrying strains commonly a ssociated with human illness was low (Defra OZ0135 ). It was noted in this study that there appear ed to be a decline in antimicrobial drug resistant strains. In a similar study in pigs, a survey of 161 farms found that 70% were infected with Salmonella (Defra OZ0134 ) and that there was persist ence of multiple antibiotic resistance in S. Typhimurium for at least two years before a r eduction commenced in some farms due to reduced stocking levels. Both projects noted that interventions and control measures on farms were generally not successful as they were not applied sufficiently rigorously. Further work to estimate the occurrence of Salmonella in pig herds in the UK and to develop appropriate control strategies has beenMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 28started ( Defra OZ0316 ). A study of Salmonella in pigs for slaughter is also being undertaken. 10.2.3 Other on-farm epidem iological studies with Salmonella involve investigation of the transmission of food-borne pathogens fr om the farm to the abattoir ( Defra VF0201 ). 10.2.4 The occurrence of Salmonella on animals arriving at abattoirs and on carcasses has been investigated in a num ber of projects. It was found that Salmonella was not found on sheep carcasses, nor in bedding or lorry samples ( FSA M01011 ). In a study of meat plants, 2 out of 13 plants had lamb carcasses which tested positive for Salmonella , whilst 4 out of 17 and 4 out of 16 plants had cattle and pig carcasses respectively testing positive forSalmonella (FSA M01014 ). A similar result for pig carcasses contaminated with Salmonella (2 carcasses out of 10 examin ed) was found in a study which also investigated whether carcasse s could be treated so as to reduce contamination ( FSA M01002 ). This latter approach was found to be effective but it was noted ( Defra OZ0134 ) that subsequent handling of carcasses (in particular, evisceration) was likely to increase the contaminant level again. 10.2.5 In Northern Ireland, it was found that 6 out of 210 faecal samples from beef carcases taken at abattoirs contained Salmonella (DANI 9723 ). Work is also being carried out to determine the likely ex tent of contamin ation of raw milk with a variety of pathogens, including Salmonella (FSPB 00-RESR-046 ). 10.2.6 The levels of Salmonella in abattoir wastes were investigated, but (unexpectedly) none was detected ( FSA B05008 ). Reduction and elimination: vaccine development 10.2.7 A number of projects are seeking to develop, or contribute to the development of, potential vaccines for farm animals. This is on the basis that vaccinated animals would neither be carriers nor fall ill from Salmonella infections. The clear advantage would be a reduction in the load of Salmonella introduced into the food-supply chain and therefore reaching humans. Approaches have included evaluating the immune response of cattle to Salmonella antigens (BBSRC 0396, D11217 0755 ). The antigenic properties of around 100 identified proteins are being tested in mice to determine both the impact of host background and thepotential of antigens as vaccine components ( BBSRC D20030 ). Mouse models are being used to inve stigate the role of cell-mediated immunity in the effect of live Salmonella vaccines ( BBSRC D04785 ). 10.2.8 Other projects could lead to the creation of attenuated live Salmonella strains based on studies of genes for BBSRC 756 ). The SPI-2 gene has been identified as a po ssible locus that could be exploited in developing a live attenuated vaccine for large domestic animals ( Defra OZ0315 ).MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 29Reduction in the food supply chain: farms and farming practice 10.2.9 Reduction of the levels of Salmonella in the farm is regarded as important, and there is research to investigate fa rming practices which may affect the spread of human bacterial pathogens through farm animal populations. Studies include sheep farming, transport and marketing ( FSA M01015 ) and an investigation of the cons traints to uptake of bios ecurity measures with both cattle and sheep ( Defra ). 10.2.10 Specific issues which are being addr essed include the significance of organic waste FSA B05003, B17002, Defra WA0656, WA0804 ). It that the common agricultural practice of spreading manure onto farmland may be a contributor y factor in the occurrence of food- borne disease in the UK ( FSA B05003 ). Results from t he project are currently being used to support the writing of guidelines on manure management on farms. Research to consider the impact of adopting recommended approaches to manure management and pathogen control recognised that there were significant practical and cost implications, although it was possible to develop appropriate best prac tice for manure management ( Defra WA0656 ). 10.2.11 There is a need to be aw are of the occurrence of Salmonella in animal feeds and an evaluation of this source of infection is in progress ( Defra OZ0711 ). It may be possible to develop feeds whic h discourage the growth of bacterial pathogens ( BBSRC 15003104 ). 10.2.12 The cleanliness of cattl e at the point of slaughter is of importance, and the FSA has commissioned research to exam ine whether recent practices are beneficial or not ( FSA M01013 ). Output from this project is being used to assist farmers in development of best prac tice, as is output from research into the spread of Salmonella and other bacteria bet ween cattle in on-farm, abattoir and market environments ( FSA M01009 ). Risk identification and management 10.2.13 The risks associated with different components of on-farm practice have been studied in a number of res earch projects. Early wo rk to assess the risks to food of spreading organic farm and abatto ir waste found that significant additional research was required on pathogen decay rates in slurries and manures ( FSA B17002 ) and this her research projects (eg FSA B05003 ). The potential risks associat ed with the different routes by which pathogens may be transferred from the farm to the wider environment are assessed in Defra WA0804 , including consideration of the role of ground water and water supplies. 10.2.14 Analysis of the risks associated with pork production noted that there was possibly a greater risk of Salmonella contamination than was generally recognised ( FSA M01002 ).MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 3010.2.15 It was noted that a va riety of different techniques, generally traditional, were being used in the food industry fo r measuring contamination by Salmonella and other food-borne pathogens. In addition, there are significant barriers to the introduction of new and initially more expensive technologies which may be a future issue ( FSA B09005 ). 10.2.16 In tests to consider the effectiveness of cooking sausages contaminated with Salmonella , it was found that certain cooki ng methods, in particular those where the sausages were cooked over a hi gh heat for a relatively short period of time, were not sufficient to destroy the pathogen, despite the sausages appearing cooked ( FSA B02013 ). 10.3 Gaps in currently funded research 10.3.1 In the 1999 Salmonella report, it was noted that there was a need for more epidemiological data on Salmonella and salmonellosis in humans, including outbreaks. There is ongoing surveill ance, which is addressed by the Epidemiology of Foodborne Infections Group and the Surveillance Group for Diseases and Infections in Animals22. One aspect where there could be benefit from further research is the epidemiology of food-borne Salmonella in humans. 10.3.2 There may be a need for more re search to examine the patterns of occurrence of Salmonella in farm animals (includi ng the effect of the movement of live cattle and sheep for tr ade) in relation to infections and outbreaks in humans. There is a need to clarify whether the introduction of older beef to the food-supply chain will have an impact on the levels of food- borne pathogens, including Salmonella . Information from the United States indicates that cull cows are more likely to be infected with Salmonella than one- to two-year old catt le at slaughter, although it should be noted that feed and transport regimes in the US are signifi cantly different from those in the UK. It is also noted in several projects that there may be a significantly higher occurrence of Salmonella in farm animals than is being reported, and there may be benefit in research to deter mine whether this is the case. 10.3.3 With respect to the reduction and elimination of Salmonella from the farm and food-supply chain, many of the issues for further research identified in the 1999 Salmonella report have been addressed. Si gnificant research has been done towards offering best practice guidelines, for example the Zoonoses Action Plan (ZAP) that has been dev eloped for Quality Assured pig production23. Perhaps the principal area where further research would be beneficial is in the area of vaccinati on as a route to reducing levels of Salmonella in farm animals. There would al so be value in testing lymphoid tissue in pigs, particularly mesenteric lymph nodes, for Salmonella in both the study of the persistence of infection and also as a measure of risk for animals entering the abattoir. 22 http://www.defra.gov.uk/anim alh/diseases/control/sgdia/ 23 http://www.bpex.org/technical/zap/default.aspMSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 3110.3.4 In order to develop a suitable vaccine, it is necessary to test a variety of different approaches. Research is needed to determine whether the use of vaccines would be effective in reducing the levels of Salmonella in farm animals, and in turn whether there w ould be a reduction in the levels of Salmonella in the food-supply chain. Curr ent vaccines are not effective if Salmonella is already present on the fa rm, and better vaccines, as well as greater understanding of how best to use current vaccines, are needed to address this. Some knowledge of w hether the frequent use of vaccines in poultry and other farm animals would hav e a (possibly undesirable) effect on consumer practice could also be valuable. 10.3.5 Finally, there continues to be a need for surveillance and quantification of the occurrence of Salmonella in key stages of food production. 11. R EDUCTION AND ELIMINATION : RESEARCH RELEVANT TO FOOD PRODUCTION IN GENERAL Reduction in the food supply c hain: disinfectants and cleaning 11.1 In research on the occurrence and management of biofilm s it was concluded that approximately 28% of food contact surfaces and 58% of environmental surfaces (including floors) had high nu mbers of bacteria present, which was taken as evidence for t he presence of biofilms ( FSA B01016 ). The bacterial populations were found to include very few organisms associated with food- borne disease and no Salmonella , E. coli O157 or Campylobacter were isolated. Cleaning did not have a signific ant effect on the leve ls of bacteria, and there was some evidence from a prelimi nary study that biocide resistance could develop. 11.2 The prevention of the formation of biofilms was considered in project FSA B01006 . In this research the adherenc e of pathogens including S. Typhimurium to polymers which c ould have both a hy drated state and a collapsed hydrophobic state wa s investigated. It was concluded that at least some bacteria (for example L. monocytogenes ) were less able to colonise the polymers when in the hydrophobic state. This was seen as offering possibilities in the development of coatings for surf aces in the food industry which could reduce the adhesion of bacteria and subsequent formation of biofilms. 11.3 A limited amount of research has been undertaken to investigate the applicability of different di sinfectants and cleaning regimes on the reduction of the levels of Salmonella in the food supply chain. A wide range of disinfectant products has been found to be used in the food industry to co mbat food-borne pathogens ( Defra FS3206 ). However, novel approac hes are still required and one such route was the application of dry ic e pellets to various surfaces used in the industry ( FSA B02006 ). This was found to be effective at destroying S. Enteritidis amongst other pathogens on food grade surfaces, but when applied to meat and carcasses the treat ment caused extensive destruction of the tissues. MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 3211.4 To support the underst anding of physiological stress experienced by S. Typhimurium during food processing and help in the identif ication of points within the food supply chai n where there are increas ed risks of transfer of infection, work has been done to identify protein markers of stress caused by exposure to low temperature or hy pochlorite. Although no suitable stress- specific marker proteins were found for cells exposed to hypochlorite, initial evidence was found for a suitable marker for use in an assay to identify cells which had been exposed to low temperatures ( FSA B01008 ). In addition, efforts are being made in c onjunction with other funders24 to bring together all the data on food-borne pathogenic bacterial response to stresses in the food- supply chain ( FSA B01012 ). This collaboration has led to the establishment of a public database of growth, survival and inactivation data for bacteria in diverse environments of relevanc e to food processing operations25. 11.5 Novel approaches to cl eaning of raw, ready-to-eat fruit and vegetables have also been sought ( FSA B02005 ). Ultrasound and photodynamic washing techniques were examined, but it was found that neither was likely to be an improvement on existing techniques. 11.6 Gaps in currently funded research 11.6.1 Good hygiene at all stages in the food-supply industry is of real importance, and there will always be a need to assess the utility and efficacy of novel disinfectants, and to establish the mo st appropriate protoc ols for use of any selected materials and processes, whether new or established. However, there is unlikely to be a need for specific research in this area. 12. O THER 12.1 Three projects funded by MSFFG members have considered the possible long- term sequelae of Salmonella infection in humans. BBSRC AU00 includes investigation of Salmonella induced arthritis in mice, with further work on reactive arthritis being addressed in BBSRC AU/1/99 . In addition, an archive for DNA and other samples from gastrointestinal pathogens has been established and will be used in the analysis of data from the In fectious Intestinal Disease studies ( FSA B14004 ). 24The funders and supporters are the Food Standards Agency and the Institute of Food Research, UK, and the USDA Agricultural Re search Service and its Eastern Regional Research Centre, USA 25 http://www.combase.cc/ http://w yndmoor.arserrc.gov/combase/MSFFG 2005 Salmonella report 3313. C ONCLUSIONS 13.1 The work described in this report demons trates that during recent years there has been a substantial amount of research on Salmonella in the UK. It is notable that the level of effort has been higher with Salmonella than for either Campylobacter or E. coli in the same period26. 13.2 As a result, there has been considerab le advance in the understanding of the molecular biology of Salmonella , in particular with respect to the role of specific genes in the pathogenesis of the bacterium and in host-pathogen interactions. There is, however, a danger of there being a gap between this understanding, developed primarily thr ough laboratory-based studies and its application to real-life situations \"in t he field\". Ensuring t hat there is a link between laboratory and \"field\" resear ch has relevance in a variety of applications, in particular in the development of novel vaccines, the understanding of what happens in the host when infected with a pathogen and how new types and strains of food-bor ne pathogens emerge. This latter point is important as, for example, ther e has recently been a decline in the occurrence of one particular phage type of S. Enteritidis, PT4, relative to other phage types of S. Enteritidis27. 13.3 One area of research has, in particular, made very substantial advances to the benefit of public health. Since the mid-1990s there has been a major effort, addressed on a number of fr onts, to understand the i ssues of chicken meat and egg-associated Salmonella infections in humans. The research effort has been aimed at many aspects of poultry production, as well as retail, catering and consumer practice. As a consequence, this area of Salmonella research is likely to be less active in the near future, other than in the development of increased understanding of the interaction between Salmonella serotypes and the host birds. There may also be a need for research to explore the applicability of knowledge deriv ed from research on chickens to other types of poultry meat for exampl e turkey, and to develop an understanding of why there remain some persistent problems within the poultry industry despite the general and significant impr ovements. Benefits may also accrue by extending the experience with chicken to other farm animals, in particular pigs. 13.4 The success in reducing the levels of Salmonella in the poultry industry, and of associated salmonellosis in humans , has been considerable. There has also been real progress in under standing the issues of reducing Salmonella levels in other components of the hum an food-supply chain. The development of vaccines and other effective interv entions needs ongoing research, but this should be in the context not only of laboratory studies but of real-life application, including accept ability to and take-up by the production industry. 26 See http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/sc ience/research2/research_arc hive/pubfund/microbiosafe/vtec http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/research info/food-borneillness/microfunders/campylobacter for evidence 27 http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics _az/salmonella/data_human_se.htmMSFFG report 3413.5 The relationship between humans and food-borne pathogens is always of importance, but it can be a difficult area for research. However, the many advances which have been made in understanding of Salmonella would be enhanced by further work with hum ans, including disease studies, epidemiology and work to understand cons umer practice. There would also be benefit in more intensive molecu lar epidemiological comparisons of important Salmonella serotypes from the main sources of the bacterium, including livestock, foods, import ed foods and humans. These and other studies could contribute to gathering more quantitative Salmonella data in order to fill the gaps in fa rm-to-fork risk assessments.
