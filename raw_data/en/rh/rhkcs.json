DAVID K. HILL, DC Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer/Chairman, Scientific Advisory Committee Why is the quality of essential oils so important? What are the benefits of adding Lemon essential oil in water vs. fresh lemon juice? LEMON TIPS:As essential oils are becoming more mainstream, this question becomes even more paramount. There is a finite supply of essential oils on the planet, far less in fact than the consumer demand. What this means is that many products out there are impure or even synthetic. The chemistry of an essential oil is greatly determined by its purity and harvesting location and methods, and a wide variety of contaminants or irregular chemistries can find their way into essential oils if they're never tested for purity. As a result, an oil may not offer its intended benefits, and may even pose unknown risk. The best essential oils are pure, all-natural, and have known chemical compositions. Lemon essential oil is cold-pressed from the rind while lemon juice comes from the pulp, resulting in two very dissimilar substances with unrelated properties. Chemically, Lemon essential oil is very high in limonene, much more so than lemon juice. In particular, the high concentration of limonene is why Lemon essential oils is so cleansing and can aid in digestive and respiratory function when consumed. Essential oils are also highly concentrated; even if the substances were identical in makeup, it would take a large amount of fresh lemon juice to match the potency of two drops of Lemon essential oil in water. Finally, Lemon essential oil may also be easier to ingest for those with sensitive stomachs because it does not contain citric acid, the component of lemon juice that makes it sour. Add 1-2 drops to glass of water in the morning to rejuvenate and cleanse your body. Add a couple drops to tea for an invigorating citrus flavor. Add 1-2 drops to a spoonful of raw honey; eat by itself or mix in warm water. ONE TWO THREE What makes Spikenard so unique?The essential oil steam distilled from the roots of the Nardostachys jatamansi plant is one of the most unique and diverse we have ever discovered. Unlike most essential oils which have very dominant chemistry with a few primary constituents, Spikenard has nearly 170 basic constituents, some of which we have yet to find in any other oils. While this distinctiveness makes it difficult to categorize, it also provides an amazing spectrum of benefits, many of which we are just beginning to recognize. Spikenard is very grounding and calming when experienced aromatically and topically; diffuse during meditation or rub on the back of your neck to wind down after a long day. It also has many skin-benefitting properties. Add it to a hydrating cream or cleanser for smooth, healthy skin. 4 / EUROPE LIVING MAGAZINEEssential Oil SpotlightSpikenard Sourcing Origin: Nepal Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: RootsSpikenard is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayan Mountains. This essential oil is steam distilled from the roots of the plant and has been valued for centuries, traditionally used to anoint people of high honor. In ancient times, Spikenard was associated with wellness, sacredness, and spiritual healing. Historically, Spikenard has been used to calm the mind and uplift moods. As one of the most chemically complex essential oils available, it is highly valued still today around the world for its aromatherapy benefits. How to Use Aromatically Diffuse Spikenard when you need assistance calming your mind. Put a few drops of Spikenard in the palms of your hands, cup your hands over your face, and inhale deeply for a calming sensation. Add a few drops to your warm bath for an extra relaxing sensation. Topically If you are looking to relax for a restful night's sleep, then apply a few drops of Spikenard to your feet or temples. When feeling stressed, dilute Spikenard with Fractionated Coconut Oil and massage it into your temples and forehead. For a relaxing scalp massage, add 5 drops to your conditioner. Fun Fact: Spikenard has been used in perfume and in religious context in many countries for centuries. 6 / WINTER 2017 LIVING MAGAZINE ZenGest \u00ae Digestive BlendLemon Melaleuca (T Soothing Blend dTERRA On Guard\u00ae Protective Blend dTERRA Breathe\u00ae Blend PROPERTIES: PROPERTIES: Renewing, beautifying, rejuvenating, groundingPROPERTIES: Soothing, calming PROPERTIES: Cooling, energizing, natural bug repellent T ake a couple of drops internally to promote healthy digestion.* Add to water or tea and consume to help maintain a healthy gastrointestinal tract.* Rub a couple of drops on stomach to reduce bloating, gas, and indigestion.* Add to a spray bottle of water to clean tables, countertops, and other surfaces.

It is a crisis that has affected millions of individuals and families seeking a better life. With a vast majority coming from the Middle East, the Greek Island of Lesvos is a focus point for many of these refugees who come first to Turkey and then to Europe. Lesvos is one of the closest geographic points from Turkey\u2014where many of these asylum seekers temporarily reside. Over 90,000 people\u2014coming from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and even Africa\u2014have travelled to Lesvos from Turkey in the past year, which is more than the entire local population of 86,000. Journey in Search of Hope When the refugees arrive, they are often freezing and wet and have to be taken care of immediately. The volunteers who act as the initial contact for these individuals work around the clock to ensure that those refugees who are in the most need are tended to. These volunteers also act as spotters. They sit on the mountain side or walk the beaches all day watching for boats that are trying to make their way across the Strait of Mytilini between Turkey and Lesvos.After being pulled from dinghies, boats, rafts, and sometimes the sea itself, refugees who are not in immediate need of medical attention are taken to camp Moria. This is the starting point for refugees who are seeking asylum in Greece and Europe as a whole. Of the two refugee camps on Lesvos, (the other being Kara Tepe), Moria has a larger capacity. Currently, Moria is able to accommodate 2,500 people with plans to expand that to 5,000. Moria is where all refugees go to be processed, accounted for, and vetted. It's crowded and can sometimes be uncomfortable as people are emotionally drained and scared. Individuals spend a minimum of 25 days here while they are being vetted. If they are vetted successfully, they are relocated to the more communal, less restrictive Kara Tepe camp. It is here where refugees\u2014most with just the clothes on their backs\u2014begin to rebuild the lives they were forced to leave behind. In Kara Tepe, refugee families have been set up in \"pop up\" houses. There is a little school, garden, and playground, which helps create a sense of community. Here, these people try to make a home for their families and do the best they can to support one another. They share the little food they have and they help one another cope and survive in their dire circumstances. Kara Tepe currently has capacity to house 1,100 people with plans to increase that number to 1,500 as soon as they are able. \"When you come from a place of abundance, and then find yourself face-to-face with those who have little or nothing, it can truly humble you, if you allow yourself to be humbled,\" says Murray Smith, Managing Director, dTERRA\u00ae Europe. 8 / EUROPE LIVING MAGAZINE The current refugee situation is the largest crisis in Europe since the World Wars.

The most effective exercises are those that use several muscle groups synergistically to mimic real world movements that you can do with nothing, but a fixed surface...such as the ground. All movement is initiated through your body's \"core \": your hips, glutes, and supporting abdominal musculature. Whether bending down to pick up your child's toy or lifting a heavy box above your head, those muscles are crucial. You are not going to build that slim, sassy, and strong core and lower body by sitting on a machine.

Keep the chest up and your arms in place, and squat down as low as you can (remember form: sit back and keep the knees in line with your toes). Explode up into a jump, getting your feet off the ground as much as possible. Land in a squat position and repeat.1. WORKS QUADRICEPS, GLUTES, AND HAMSTRINGSDo each exercise for 30 seconds at high intensity. Complete each movement uninterrupted before moving on to the next, in a circuit fashion. Rest for 30 seconds (or as long as needed) after completing the entire circuit and repeat two more times.

Sourcing Origin: Paraguay Distillation Method: Steam Plant Part: Leaves and Twigs *This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.Citrus plants have earned a powerful place in this world by their familiar scent, taste, and health benefits. Petitgrain essential oil is derived from the bitter orange tree originally from the Southern region of China; however, in the early 18th century, Spanish Jesuits brought it to Paraguay where it thrives and now grows wild. Its name comes from the French word Petitgrain meaning \"little grains,\" which refers to the small, unripe, bitter oranges that resemble cherries in size. Like Lavender and Bergamot, Petitgrain has a calming and relaxing aroma. When consumed internally, Petitgrain can calm the nervous system* and promote a restful night's sleep.* Fun Fact Because of Petitgrain's ability to enhance other fragrances, it has been used in the perfume, cologne, and cosmetic industry since the 18th century. he name arborvitae comes from the francophone version of the First Nation name meaning the \"tree of life.\" For 10,000 years, this tree has been instrumental in their everyday lives. They used the tree to build canoes, long houses, and totem poles. The Nootka tree is named after the Nootka tribe who resided in an area called the Nootka Sound. It is considered a \"twin\" to the arborvitae tree, and it has been used in many sculptures that are a significant part of the First Nation culture in that region. Both trees also play an important part in the Pacific Northwest's forestry industry, which is one of the largest and yet most environmentally sustainable in the world. This industry also produces tons of sawdust every year that is normally burned for energy, but there are other uses for it, too. do-TERRA partners with a Canadian distiller that has perfected the productive use of the sawdust from these two unique trees to produce pure, quality oils with powerful properties. They are the only distillery in the world producing Arborvitae and Nootka essential oils.FOREST SUSTAINABILITY British Columbia is well-known for its sustainable foresting practices. Their rate of deforestation has been virtually zero for more than 20 years. Their entire annual harvest comes from less than 1 percent of the working forest. By law, all harvested Co--Impact Sourcing\u00ae Arborvitae & Nootka British Columbia, Canada The Pacific Northwest is home to the largest temperate rainforest on the planet where more than 40 indigenous tree species grow, including the Giant Arborvitae and the Nootka coniferous trees. Both trees are an important part of the aboriginal First Nation history in British Columbia, Canada. In 2015, do-TERRA introduced Arborvitae (Thuja plicata) as a single oil and do-TERRA TerraShield\u00ae Outdoor Blend was recently reformulated to include both Arborvitae and Nootka essentials as key ingredients. T 14 / EUROPE LIVING MAGAZINEArborvitae trees can live for up to 1,000 years, partially because they are naturally resistant to insects. Nootka and Arborvitae have both recently been added to the do-TERRA TerraShield\u00ae Outdoor Blend. areas must be reforested. The seedlings must be native species, and none of them can be genetically modified. Arborvitae and Nootka essential oils came about because of an effort to make sustainable use of all the elements of the trees, including capturing the important chemical components found in the sawdust residue. Because of the sustainable forestry program in place for harvesting these trees, not one additional tree is being cut down to produce the essential oils. Once the oil is extracted from the sawdust through a proprietary steam distillation process, the sawdust is then returned and used by paper mills for pulp production. \"All the resources, including these amazing and unique essential oils, are sustainably and responsibly harvested from these majestic trees\u2014which of course is a key priority for our distillation partner and for do-TERRA ,\" says Tim Valentiner, do-TERRA Director of Strategic Sourcing. WHAT MAKES THESE OILS UNIQUE? Arborvitae Arborvitae essential oil has molecules called tropolones, which have a unique chemical structure. Most molecules in nature are six-sided; tropolones are seven-sided. This makes it so other sometimes harmful molecules don't know how to attack them. Because of this, they are natural preservatives. This oil is also an effective bug repellant. Arborvitae trees can live for up to 1,000 years, partially because they are naturally resistant to insects. Nootka One chemical found in Nootka oil is nootkatone, which is strangely also found in grapefruits. This adds a sharp, citrusy note to Nootka oil and gives it similar properties to grapefruit oil. Nootka is also known for being a powerful insect repellant. doterra.com / 15bookMUST HAVE BASICS BAKING SODA Absorbs and eliminates odor. Use to clean countertops, sinks, and tubs.

FACTS Many household cleaners contain toxic chemicals. These chemicals may cause short-term and long-term health problems when you use them. 1 Children are often more vulnerable to chemical exposure during developmental stages, and certain chemicals may interfere with the development of their neurological, endocrine, and immune systems. 2 Main route of exposure: \u2014Eating \u2014Drinking Younger children have higher respiratory rates than adults, therefore they absorb more air contaminants per unit of weight, meaning they experience a higher inhaled dose. 2 According to the United States Environ-mental Protection Agency, the air inside a typical home is 200-500 percent more polluted than the air outside mainly due to toxic household cleaning products.

Everyone has heard of vitamins and their myriad health- supporting benefits. Vitamin A supports eye health, vitamin C supports cardiovascular health, vitamin D is crucial for calcium and phosphorous absorption;* but what role do those metallic -sounding substances in your multivitamin serve? Minerals are the unfamiliar nutritional superheroes that maintain body water balance, regulate nerve impulses, play a vital role in hemoglobin synthesis, and, as recent research suggests, are particularly important for those who regularly exercise.* Almost nobody is meeting recom- mended mineral intakes from food alone.1 The issue is particularly problematic in females, who lose precious minerals during menstruation and often avoid rich sources such as animal protein, nuts, and legumes in their normal diet. Along with a healthy balanced diet, it is becoming abundantly clear that it is important to supplement with a source of bioavailable minerals such as those found in the dTERRA \u00ae Microplex VMz\u00ae Food Nutrient Complex. Three minerals in particular are crucial for those looking to turbocharge their workouts and build that slim and sassy body. IRON Iron plays a direct role in oxygen transportation and the creation of red blood cells, and helps regulate the release of energy from cells. If you are low, you'll feel lethargic and struggle to get through your workouts.* Up to 20 percent of adult women do not meet the RDA of 18mg per day (8mg for males), making it the most common mineral deficiency. Those who exercise regularly face the greatest risk. One of the primary adaptations of exercise is the increase in red blood cell mass, which results in greater iron needs. Iron is also lost through sweat and minor gastrointesti-nal bleeding common during strenuous exercise\u2014the harder you work, the more iron your body needs to replenish its stores. Two types of iron exist in food and some sources are more bioavailable than others. Heme iron, found almost exclusively in animal protein and in highest concentrations in red meat, has an absorption ratio of 15-18 percent. The human body is only able to absorb 18 / WINTER 2017 LIVING MAGAZINE18 /EUROPE LIVING MAGAZINEabout 5 percent of non-heme iron, found primarily in plant-based foods such as legumes, cereal grains, and some fruits and vegetables. Absorption can also be influenced by what you consume along with iron-rich foods. Vitamin C, con-tained in Microplex VMz, improves absorption and a recent study found that taking a probiotic supplement, such as PB Assist \u00ae+, can increase the absorption of non-heme iron by as much as 50 percent. 2* PB assist+ is the perfect complement to Microplex VMz, which delivers 6 mg of highly bioavailable iron. CALCIUM Thanks to modern food marketing, we are all aware of the bone-strengthening benefits of calcium, and that milk does a body good.* Adequate calcium as part of a healthful diet, along with physical activity, may reduce the risk of osteopo- rosis in later life. Not as commonly acknowledged are the other benefits of calcium and that there are many other, possibly better, sources that are not derived from dairy. Calcium plays a key role in muscular-contraction and cellular metabolism, meaning it impacts your ability to sustain long and intense exercise.* Current RDAs for calcium are 1000-1300 mg per day. Y ou don't need a glass of milk at every meal or a cup of yogurt for dessert to meet your body's demands. Other healthy components of a balanced diet, including wild-caught fatty-fish, dark leafy greens, and some nuts (especially almonds), are all great sources of bone-building and muscu-lar-contracting calcium.* For those unable to meet their needs through their normal diet, Microplex VMz Food Nutrient Complex offers 500 mg of calcium. MAGNESIUM Magnesium is a vital component of hundreds of enzyme reactions, is involved in muscular contraction, and plays a role in the formation of healthy bone.* The mineral found in high concentration in nuts, legumes, and dark leafy greens also assists in the utilization of oxygen and glucose for muscular energy, making it vital for both strength and endurance. Like iron, magnesium is one of the minerals found in highest concentrations in sweat; the longer and more intensely you train, the greater your needs. Current RDAs for magne-sium range from 310-420 mg per day, but a recent study found that the average daily intake for women is only 234-267 mg. 3 The same study also found that those who use dietary supplements had a higher average intake from food alone and were much more likely overall to meet current guidelines. Each daily serving of Microplex VMz provides 150 mg of magnesium to supplement your diet and help you meet your body's demands. T o support natural and sustained energy production and muscular contraction, and to build the bone health we need to reach our fitness goals, it is crucial that we meet RDAs for macro and trace minerals.* Although a healthy diet of whole, unrefined foods is the foundation of any wellness program and a good start toward meeting our mineral needs, supplementing daily with Micoplex VMz and PB Assist+ will ensure that our bodies have the building blocks to continue progressing.* References 1.

This non-profit organization works to save children from sex trafficking by utilizing some of the world's experts in extraction operations and anti-trafficking efforts. THE MISSION AND VISION OF OUR RESCUE OUR Rescue strives to expose to the world the global epidemic of child sex trafficking. In doing so, they rescue children from slavery and assist law enforcement in the prosecution of traffi cking offenders. Rescued children are then placed in safe havens that pro vide appropriate recovery aftercare. Founded in December of 2013, OUR Rescue is not a government agency, and thus relies 100 percent on donations to continue their work. Since their inception, OUR Rescue has worked closely with experts in extraction operations and anti-trafficking efforts. These experts include former members of the CIA, Navy SEALs, and special oper a tions forces who coordinate identi fication and extraction efforts\u2014also sometimes called \"jumps.\" When these highly skilled teams have pinpointed an area that is known to have child sex trafficking, they then work with local law enforcement to make sure the children are rescued. A large part of the OUR Rescue project takes place post-extraction and is called aftercare. It is here that rescued individuals adjust to their new lives. Jessica Mass, Director of Aftercare, states, \"We believe that established, vetted aftercare centers are the experts in their country and we are servants\u2014servants that believe in empowering dreams, vision, and hope for each survivor's future. United we stand in the fight against human trafficking and the healing process of victims that become thriving survivors.\" THE do-TERRA PARTNERSHIP At a dTERRA\u00ae Day of Service event, corporate employees assembled human itarian and school kits for children who were rescued from sex trafficking. Beyond the kits, dTERRA executives knew more could be done. In 2016 the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation, donated $250,000 to the OUR Rescue cause, and officially announced a partnership between the two organizations. During the 2016 global convention, the dTERRA Founding Executives presented CEO and founder of OUR Rescue, Tim Ballard, with an additional check for $250,000 to support their aftercare program, making a total donation of $500,000 to the OUR Rescue cause. dTERRA also announced a new Hope blend that was developed and donated to OUR Rescue specifically for distri bution in high trafficking areas. Its comforting scent is not the only thing that sets this blend apart\u2014included on the label was a hotline number for those children needing help. A 10 ml roll-on blend is now available for Independent Product Consultants to purchase and features a newly designed label. All proceeds from the dTERRA Hope Blend will go toward benefitting the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation. In July of 2016, dTERRA Founding Executive and CEO, David Stirling, was also able to participate in a jump operation in California where a sting took place. He was able to see firsthand what OUR Rescue is doing and how they work to further their cause. David says, \"We partner up with just a few institutions that are doing good things in the world. One of these is OUR. We feel like they fit in with our mission and what we are trying to do, which is bring positive change to the world. We like to help people; we do that in many different ways with our essentials oils already, but this is a way to reach in and hopefully make a dent on this huge issue and rescue a lot of these innocent children.\"OUR RESCUE FOLLOWS A 6-STEP PROCESS: 1 Assess the feasibility of rescue. 2 Research the location, the children, and the background of those who are running the sex ring. 3 Design a strategy for rescuing the children. 4 Take action. 5 Recover the children. 6 Arrest, try, and convict the perpetrators. \"To the children who we pray for daily, we say: Your long night is coming to an end. Hold on. We are on our way. And to those captors and perpetrators, even you monsters who dare offend God's precious children, we declare to you: Be afraid. We are coming for you.\" -OUR HOPE BLEND with a new, redesigned label, is available for Independent Product Consultants to purchase with all proceeds bene fitting the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation.

Quality assurance (QA) is often referred to as the \"police\" of the manufacturing world, because some of our duties in QA make us seem like police officers. We enforce dTERRA standards, such as CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade \u00ae. However, there are also legal require - ments that we enforce throughout each stage of sourcing and bottling our oils. All of our products, whether they are foods, cosmetics, or dietary supplements, have regulatory requirements in each country where they are sold. These requirements influence and sometimes dictate the labeling, sourcing, and manufacturing processes that result in the end product. In brief, QA has the responsibility to review and approve items such as ingredient, component, and finished good specifications; procedures; manufacturing records; and equipment. This applies to dTERRA because our internal use oils are labeled as dietary supplements. 24 / EUROPE LIVING MAGAZINEQA Inspectors What does this mean to you?There are three branches of QA at dTERRA: QA Inspectors, QA Engineers, and Document Control Specialists. QA Engineers Document Control Since nothing enters or leaves the building without QA approval, you will find a QA Inspector in every process. QA Inspectors inspect every component of every batch. Before an incoming shipment can be moved into our warehouse, our QA Inspectors examine each batch of oil, labels, caps, bottles, boxes, etc. The QA Inspector then labels a raw material or component that passes as approved. QA Inspectors inspect the filling line at the start of every run, perform inspec - tions at set intervals during the run, keep samples of every batch, verify production records, and inspect each lot of finished goods. The samples collected ensure that we have a history of the oil's appearance, odor, and taste for future reference. Great quality lives in the details. Our constant checks, documentation, and reviews mean that we care about the details that make our oils world class. This passionate commitment means that you can use the oils and all of our products to benefit your family with confidence. Know that we are working tirelessly to check every detail, bringing you only the very best products. You can confidently share the products with people you love, knowing that we are constantly striving to improve our products and processes. Commitment to continuous improvement means longevity. Our Quality Assurance group works to ensure that the fabulous products you enjoy will continue to be the best for years to come.This highly technical group has a scientific education and extensive QA experience. They sign that each product meets our standards and they serve as a second set of eyes to verify our QA Inspectors have checked each detailed step in the process. They review and approve testing and changes to our equipment with our manufacturing engineers. If an Independent Product Consultant reports a quality issue with one of our products, a QA Engi - neer investigates the complaint to continuously improve our products and processes, developing new procedures as needed. The QA Engineers also conduct internal and supplier audits, and help us maintain our third party NSF cGMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certification. This certifica- tion requires a third party to audit our manufacturing facility every six months. As a QA team, we chose to pursue this certification because audit by a third party creates a culture of accountability. It is designed to keep us focused on meeting and exceeding our own quality standards. We create several hundred document files, totaling thousands of individual documents per week that must be housed and updated in an organized, easily retrievable fashion. Sample document types include: specifica - tions, formulas, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), batch records, label approvals, master manufactur - ing records, audits, investigations, maintenance and cleaning records, and equipment and room use logs. Just as it would not be possible for electricians, framers, and plumbers to build a house without a blueprint, all of the departments from sourcing to the chemists who come together to create, manufacture, and approve a finished oil need a set of \"blueprints.\" These specifications provide order and predictability to help ensure the desired outcome. Document control gathers all of the required information in one place, obtains approvals, and then releases the specification to all affected departments. Everyone has the same standard when producing, inspecting, and testing the oils. What is QA's role in CPTG\u00ae? Early in the process, Research and Development, Quality Control (QC), and Strategic Sourcing work with QA to carefully develop and define the testing criteria for each oil and blend. The result of this definition is documented in a specification created and routed for review by Document Control. This document is used by our QC laboratories to determine which tests are needed and to evaluate if the oil passes or fails. This specifica - tion is also used by the QA Inspectors to evaluate the raw and the finished good oils. Finally, the specification is used by the QA Engineers when they review the entire file that includes the production, QC testing, and QA inspection records to determine if the product meets our standards and can be released for sale. doterra.com / 25All-Natural Aromas Fill your home with the inviting scents of these diffuser blends and avoid the toxic chemicals of traditional air fresheners.

With the responsibility of protecting your body from illness and disease, your immune system is one of the most important components of your overall health. This complex network of cells, tissues, and organs works together to fight off fungi, bacteria, parasites, and other microbes while maintaining healthy tissue. While we are just beginning to understand how this intricate communication works, modern science has helped us identify lifestyle behaviors that support its proper function. The immune system isn't a single entity, but a collection of structures and processes that protect us against disease or other potentially dangerous foreign bodies. The main components of the immune system are the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, lymphocytes, thymus, and leuokocytes. Lymph nodes are the bean-shaped structures that store and help transport the cells that fight infection. The spleen contains the white blood cells, assists with blood circulation, and helps dispose of old and damaged cells. Bone marrow, the yellow tissue inside bones, produces white blood cells. The two types of lymphocytes, B and T-cells, are the white blood cells that actually defend the body against bacteria, toxins, and infections. The thymus is the leaf-shaped organ where the T-cells mature. Lastly, leuokocytes are another type of white blood cell, responsible for identifying and eliminating pathogens. We are exposed to countless potentially harmful microbes on a day-to-day basis, and when functioning properly, the immune system distinguishes these threats from our healthy tissue and attacks them. Following the healthy lifestyle behaviors outlined by dTERRA's lifestyle wellness pyramid is the first step in supporting optimal immune system function. Supporting Your Immune System Nutrition: While there is no specific food, nutrient, or supplement that has been proven to directly improve the immune system on its own, immune function depends on the vitamins and minerals provided by a balanced diet of whole fruits, vegetables, grains, and lean proteins. Malnourishment and micronutrient deficiencies can result in altered immune responses and increased risk IMMUNE SYSTEMUNDERSTANDING THE By James Geiger, MD 30 / EUROPE LIVING MAGAZINENutrition Healthy Immune System ExERCISE Sleepsupplementsfor illness. In particular, in vitro studies have demonstrated that deficiencies of minerals zinc, selenium, and iron, and vitamins A, B6, C, and E may be correlated with altered immune responses . (1) Supplementing your diet with specific vitamins, minerals, and probiotics may build up and fortify the immune system. (2) Microplex VMz\u00ae Food Nutrient Complex is rich in vitamin D3, which has been shown to support a healthy immune system.(3)* PB Assist\u00ae+ Probiotic Defense Formula contains six strains of microogranisms which support the healthy functioning of the immune system by maintaining balance and proliferation of beneficial bacteria.* Additionally, some essential oils such as Oregano may help maintain a healthy immune system when taken internally.* Add 2-3 drops to a dTERRA Veggie Cap or try dTERRA On Guard\u00ae+ softgels for daily immune support.* Taken daily, along with a healthy balanced diet, these supplements can be your first line of defense in preserving immune system health. Exercise: Recent research has shown that failure to exercise can temporarily decrease healthy immune response and make you more susceptible to illness. Exercise contributes to overall health and well-being, subsequently contributing to the maintenance of a healthy immune system. (4) It is believed that regular exercise may also directly promote immune system health by pro moting im proved circulation, allowing the com ponents of the immune system to move freely and do their job more effectively. The natural support of energy production and healthy circulation provided by taking Mito2Max\u00ae Energy and Stamina Complex can help you make physical activity a part of your daily life, contributing to a healthy immune system. Sleep: Both quantity and quality of sleep are important for maintaining a healthy immune system. The effectiveness of rest is dependent on the circadian biological clock, which regulates the timing of periods of sleepiness and wakefulness throughout the day. It is important that we get enough sleep and that we follow a consistent schedule of activity and rest periods. If we are sleep deprived, our T-cells, lymphocytes that play a central role in cell-mediated immunity, decrease the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (5) Furthermore, sleep influences the interaction between antigens, any substance that the body must produce antibodies to fight off, and T-helper cells such as interleukin-12, in a process known as immunological memory. In one study, researchers found that the length and quality of sleep the previous night affected the production of antigen-specific T-cells in response to a hepatitis A vaccination. (6) With each interruption in your sleep pattern comes a decrease in your body's ability to respond to the intruders it needs to fight off to stay healthy. Put a few drops of Lavender in the diffuser and enjoy its relaxing aroma as you hit the sheets. A peaceful environment can promote a restful night's sleep to keep that immune system ticking. Healthy lifestyle behaviors not only influence how you look and feel, but also your body's ability to ward off harmful invaders. Support your immune system by cleaning up that diet, adding some immune-supporting supplements and oils to your daily routine, getting up off the couch, and getting into a consistent sleeping pattern.

The plant material is then steam distilled, or in the case of citrus oils, cold pressed, and then transferred along the supply chain where these essential oils are either used as ingredients in blends or other products, or for our single oils bottled as the end product.

The logical response is to ramp up the workout intensity or volume and cut out those last few calories, but the most effective measure may be to do nothing at all. Sleep is one of the most important factors in maintaining optimal metabolism, supporting normal endocrine function, and regulating appetite. If you are serious about your body, optimum health doesn't always begin in the gym or the kitchen, but often between the sheets. SLEEP EFFECTS Exercise and Weight Management Sleep requirements change over the course of an individual's life; therefore, guidelines are primarily based on one's age. The National Sleep Foundation recommends up to 17 hours per day for newborns, and down to 6-8 for older adults. Advocates increased sleep time for those with particularly active lifestyles. There are also a series of sleep hygiene recommendations that can help you get the most out of your bedtime. The latest guidelines suggest not napping during the day to maintain normal patterns, avoiding stimulants later in the day, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine. One of the most important factors to keep in mind is that experts almost universally agree that attempting to \"catch up\" on sleep is a losing proposition. Even if you may initially feel more rested, following sleep deprivation with longer bouts of sleeping ultimately affects your circadian rhythms and may make it more difficult to set a consistent regimen. Like healthy eating and exercise, the effectiveness of sleep is highly dependent on consistency. Lack of sleep can have significant metabolic and endocrine effects that may reduce or even completely undo the success of your weight management efforts. Cortisol, the \"stress hormone\" secreted during times when the \"fight or flight\" response mechanism is initiated, is proving to be one of the most important factors in both fat loss and lean muscle tissue gain. In fact, one recent study found that participants on a professionally designed diet and exercise program found it impossible to lose weight when not reaching sleep recommendations 1. Cortisol levels influence body composition by inhibiting the processing of amino acids, obstructing growth hormone release, altering the proper regulation of blood sugar levels, and even making it more difficult to stick to diets. 2 A 2010 study found that those functioning on less than optimal levels of sleep had higher levels of cortisol throughout the day, and subsequently had less success in their weight management efforts.3 If you are experiencing an otherwise unexplainable uptick on the scale, it may be time to reevaluate your sleeping patterns. Recent research suggests that sleep deprivation may also sabotage your dieting efforts. Sleeping less than six hours has been shown to increase hunger, increase cravings for sweets, and ultimately may lead to weight gain. 4,5 Sleep- deprived individuals often exhibit several endocrine irregularities directly associated with appetite and weight regulation. Lack of sleep can increase the secretion of ghrelin, \"the hunger hormone,\" which regulates satiety and reward perception accompanying specific foods. Sleep deprivation appears to increase caloric consumption through two separate mechanisms, by increasing the sensitivity of the brain's reward system for ingesting energy-dense foods and encouraging one to eat more in response to the extra energy expended while staying up as opposed to sleeping. If you are having difficulty sticking to your healthy diet goals, the culprit may be your sleeping patterns. The amount and quality of sleep also may impact your workout performance. One recent study found that short-term sleep deprivation resulted in significantly decreased strength, power, and cardiovascular performance. 6 After only a single night of less than adequate sleep, study participants exhibited characteristics similar to those suffering from overtraining, and the effects seemed to increase over time. Another study found that disturbed sleep patterns adversely affect cognitive function and reaction time, which can increase exercise accident risk. 7 Furthermore, lack of sleep has been shown to be detrimental to exercise recovery, meaning you may need to exercise less and expend more effort on proactive recovery techniques to continue progressing and remain injury free.8 If you don't feel like working out today or notice your intensity and performance waning, the first step should not be toward a stimulant, but your bed. Progressing toward your fitness goals requires a lot of dedication, hard work, and even more rest. One of the most researched benefits of essential oils are their calming and relaxing properties. Including essential oils in your bedtime routine may be the extra push you need. A few drops of Lavender on your bedsheets and diffusing your favorite calming and grounding blend as you prepare for rest will create the calming sleep environment your body requires for recovery.
