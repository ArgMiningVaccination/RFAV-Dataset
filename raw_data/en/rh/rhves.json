Back coverColorado State University is a world leader in environmental science and sustainability, with internationally known programs in the natural resources, clean energy alternatives, ecosystems biology, and atmospheric science. As the model land-grant University of the 21st century, we consider it our responsibility to make a difference on a global scale. Thanks to the support of our friends and alumni, we are building Colorado State University's historic \"Forever Green\" legacy. In today's context, to be truly green is a great responsibility - a commitment not just to the future health and vitality of our campus, but to the sustainability of our planet and its resources. Your support enables CSU to move forward, look to the future, and solve the great global challenges of our time. Together we power our University. Our University powers the world. 2 Colorado State University Dear Friends: Colorado State University has a bold agenda, aimed at educating thinkers and supporting faculty who make a difference on a global scale. As this annual report demonstrates, your support for programs, scholarships, endowments, new facilities, and other giving opportunities provides the power needed to move this agenda forward at a rapid pace. The land-grant university of today is not the sleepy, rural campus of 100 years ago - our focus has evolved and matured as the needs and challenges facing our world have evolved. But our mission remains clear and true to its original purpose: To lead the way in providing research-based solutions, teaching, and outreach in support of a healthy economy and an enhanced quality of life. Colorado State faculty are pioneering new techniques in the treatment and prevention of animal and human cancer, devising clean-energy solutions for immediate application in developing countries, preparing the teachers who will energize tomorrow's K-12 classrooms, fighting infectious disease worldwide, expanding our understanding of human health and nutrition, guiding students as they explore new frontiers in communications and global enterprise, and much, much more. CSU also has secured a national reputation as the \"Green University\" through its pioneering efforts in green construction, natural resources, alternative energy, and advancing our scientific understanding of global climate change - as well as through its commitment to promoting sustainability and environmental awareness on our own campus. This report provides a glimpse at just a few of the many initiatives under way that give substance to this commitment and demonstrate our 21st-century land-grant mission in action. The Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System has now challenged the University and its supporters to push forward more aggressively than ever before toward a series of ambitious stretch goals. These include increased private giving and research funding; expanded enrollment and graduation of highly qualified students; greater prominence in athletics at all levels; and continued recruitment and retention of top faculty. These goals are far-reaching yet achievable, with the engagement of strong supporters who understand the value of the University and its impact on our state, nation, and planet. A great university like Colorado State can power the world - with supporters like you who give us the power to make this vision a reality. Sincerely, Larry Edward Penley PresidentReport on Private Support 2006-2007 3Dear Alumni and Friends, It is my honor and great pleasure to bring you the 2006-2007 Colorado State University Report on Private Support. This year's report celebrates the fourth most successful philanthropic year in our University's history, and reflects the continued and critical support given CSU to fund our students and outstanding academic, research and outreach programs. Colorado State University has a long tradition of philanthropy that began even before the University doors opened. In 1871, Robert Dazell donated 30 acres of land for the Agricultural College of Colorado. The first building on campus, the Claim Building, was constructed in 1874 with the help of local individuals, businesses and organizations, who donated $1,000 for materials. Generous and visionary donors, such as Robert Dazell and you, are so important not only to CSU, but also to the advancement of an educated, engaged and philanthropic society. This report highlights a handful of the nearly 29,000 supporters who together raised $53 million to further life-changing research; to allow the best and brightest to attend our University; and to provide the next generation of leaders with information and technology that will create a better, more sustainable world. The role each of you plays in making Colorado State University's ambitious goals a reality is truly invaluable. Donor gifts have resulted in 31 endowed University chairs and professorships, 700 scholarships, and $186 million in endowments. This allows us to offer world-class interdisciplinary programs in fields of study that include energy, health, infectious disease, and sustainability. It also results in excellence in our colleges, athletics and in every division and program on campus. Together, we have partnered to change the face of our campus with state-of-the-art buildings, and we are making great strides toward addressing the issues challenging our world today. From all of us at CSU, thank you for your continued commitment to Colorado State University. Your support is an inspiration to us all and enhances our proud tradition of philanthropy. It truly is this support that powers Colorado State University and because of you, our University has the ability to promote change and power the world. This is an exciting time to be a part of Colorado State University! Very best regards, Dr. Joyce Berry, '76 Vice President for Advancement and Strategic Initiatives 4 Colorado State University Colorado State in Action: Highlights from 2006-2007 One University Can Power the World Strengthened Commitment to Educational Excellence Colorado State has added 77 new tenure-track faculty lines in the past three budget cycles - roughly an 8 percent expansion of the faculty - after a long period of essentially no net growth in faculty numbers. In Fall 2007, the number of new students in CSU's Honors Program increased 30 percent over the previous year. The Fall 2007 freshman class was the largest ever for the second year in a row, with increases in resident students, nonresident students, and transfer students. The University's undergraduate student body reflects an ongoing commitment to diversity, setting new records the last two years for the most diverse student population in CSU history. CSU unveiled a comprehensive plan focused on continuous improvement of the undergraduate experience. CSU has taken leadership on assuring transparency and accountability with expansion of the National Survey for Student Engagement and the adoption of the Collegiate Learning Assessment to measure what students learn. Spring 2007 Monfort Lecturer Jane Goodall drew thousands of students and community members to Moby Arena to hear her message of environmental responsibility and resource preservation. Record Research Funding Colorado State's research expenditures for the fiscal year ending in July 2007 totaled a record of $296 million. This nearly $300 million total in research expenditures represents an 11 percent increase over the previous year, and an increase of 49 percent over the past five years. This level of research intensity is evidence of the extent to which CSU faculty are engaged in addressing the most pressing great global challenges of our time. Colorado State faculty continued to earn top awards and international accolades for their research breakthroughs and scholarship. Going Green CSU launched its Green Power Project - a wind farm that will make CSU the first university in the country to produce more energy than it consumes. The farm, still in the development stages, will be both a boon to the regional economy and a reflection of CSU's growing role as the nation's premier \"Green University.\"Report on Private Support 2006-2007 5 CSU opened its new Transit Center, which received LEED Gold Certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. President Penley appointed a University Environment and Sustainability Advisory Committee. With this committee's support, faculty members have spearheaded a campuswide curriculum project on climate change and the science associated with it. The CSU College of Business announced its new degree program in Global Social and Sustainable Enterprise. An Elevated Profile in Colorado and Beyond CSU was ranked once again in the top tier of U.S. universities in U.S. News and World Report . The University's role in the region will take on even greater visibility in the next few years, with the development of the interchange at Interstate 25 and Prospect Road as a CSU- themed and branded office and research park and the planned home to AVA Solar, a spinoff company built around the groundbreaking technology developed by Professor W.S. Sampath. The CSU Research Foundation (CSURF) is a shareholder in the company on behalf of the University, and CSURF's Technology Transfer Office and the University have partnered with AVA in the development and marketing of the technology. The success of the company, then, will continue to fund future research and technology developments at CSU for many years to come. The CSU System hired its first marketing director to help tell the story of the University's progress and achievements. Enhanced Facilities Students celebrated the opening of the new Academic Village, a state-of-the-art residence hall that integrates the living environment with learning facilities including study, lab, and classroom spaces. The Village was designed to meet LEED standards, with water-conserving irrigation and landscaping that includes many drought-tolerant, native plants. The University continued to improve the quality of its facilities, with the completion of the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory on the Foothills Campus, development of a new Admissions and Welcome Center in Ammons Hall, groundbreaking on a new Computer Science building, progress toward completion of the University Center for the Arts, and first steps toward development of two new athletics facilities: an indoor practice field, and a weight-training and educational facility. Meeting the Great Global Challenges Colorado State launched its first Superclusters, a pioneering approach to technology transfer, in infectious diseases, cancer research, and clean energy. This groundbreaking new model for speeding University research from the lab to the marketplace is attracting considerable interest in the U. S. and abroad. The University approved a long-term vision and plan for international relations and enhanced international partnerships. The campus and statewide community undertook a new era of partnership and cooperation with the launch of UniverCity Connections in Fort Collins and a new citywide initiative in support of CSU athletics programs; with a strengthened alumni operation; and with a new organizational structure for outreach that takes advantage of CSU's Colorado-wide responsibility in Extension, 4-H, the Forest Service, and Agricultural Experiment Stations. 6 Colorado State UniversityFY 2006-07 Advancement Highlights Gifts Elevate Colorado State's Stature as National Leader A number of gifts made in Fiscal Year 2006-2007 testify to the strength and uniqueness of Colorado State University - named once again by U.S. News and World Report as one of the country's top national universities. Average freshman retention, faculty resources, and alumni giving are among the criteria used to evaluate universities nationwide. Your gifts to endowments, scholarships, programs, and facilities are critical to elevating Colorado State and distinguishing it from other public institutions. As well, your support contributes to the University's vision to set the standard for public research institutions in the 21st century and to meet the great global challenges of our time. Outstanding among recent gifts are a number of new endowed chairs, which help attract and retain stellar faculty members who are central to Colorado State's success. The Colorado State University Foundation permanently invests funds that are given to establish endowed chairs, and the interest generated is used to support the chair. Because the principal is never used, endowments allow continuous funding to supplement the chairholder's salary, graduate student work, and research and activities tied to the chairholder's program. Throughout this report, Colorado State University is pleased to provide a variety of giving highlights from the past fiscal year, and below, a brief recap of particularly noteworthy gifts to each college and the University Libraries. We thank you, our donors, for your leadership, generosity, confidence, and support. Report on Private Support 2006-2007 72006 Seven years ago Charles and Lucia Shipley made a $3 million gift that led to an endowed professorship that further distinguishes Colorado State's innovative College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. Last September, the College announced that $600,000 of the Shipleys' donation was used to create the nation's first professorship of complementary and alternative medicine. Dr. Narda Robinson, a recognized expert in scientific and evidence-based alternative medicine, was named to the position. Founder of the complementary and alternative medicine service at Colorado State's Veterinary Medical Center, Dr. Robinson is now devoting her full-time career to the practice and development of alternative therapies in veterinary medicine, such as acupuncture, and research that can benefit both humans and animals. In October 2006, Hewlett-Packard continued its generous spirit of philanthropy to Colorado State with a gift of an HP Integrity rx8620 Server, valued at $537,507. The lightning quick, high-performing server is being used jointly by the College of Natural Sciences and the College of Business. The new technology enables faculty to enhance their cutting-edge research and assists them in being national leaders in natural science-, mathematical-, and business-related disciplines. In November 2006, Vico Software Inc. , one of the largest architecture, engineering, and software companies in the world, donated $1.1 million in 5D modeling software to the College of Applied Human Sciences' Department of Construction Management. The donation enables students to develop skills and become familiar with Vico's Virtual Construction software, which has been used to design more than 1 million completed buildings worldwide. The company also is providing updates to the technology as it evolves. With the software, students are learning hands-on how to use Building Information Modeling, or BIM, a technology that enables users to build a project virtually, prior to construction. From the virtual model, project participants can then collaborate to identify coordination issues, produce an estimate, create a 4D schedule, and take measures to minimize waste. Colorado State University Clinical Sciences professor Dr. Narda Robinson performs low level laser therapy on Buster. 8 Colorado State University Jud and Pat Harper In December, Sami Bedell , a senior in the College of Liberal Arts, committed the largest-ever donation by an undergraduate student. Bedell, who graduated shortly after making the gift, pledged a total of $80,000 on behalf of the Bedell World Citizenship Fund, established in 2004 by her father, Tom Bedell. Sami Bedell's donation will provide $60,000 for scholarships for students in the College of Liberal Arts and an additional $20,000 to the College's Center for Applied Studies in American Ethnicity. \"I saw a void in the number of scholarships available to liberal arts students,\" said Sami Bedell. \"Providing scholarships to future students is one of the best ways to make sure I can continue to make a difference in the lives of others for years to come.\" 2007 Jim and Cecilia Herbert , from San Francisco, Calif., made a generous gift in February to the College of Agricultural Sciences' Equine Teaching Enhancement Fund. The fund was established to help finance equipment purchases and program support for nearly 500 students, including the Herberts' daughter, who are enrolled in the College's Equine Sciences program. Proud of their daughter's achievements at CSU and also of the Ag family she is now a part of, the Herberts decided to donate to the academic program their daughter is in to enhance her learning experience and that of many other students. In March, longtime Colorado State supporters Jud and Pat Harper named Colorado State University the beneficiary of a $1 million life insurance policy. The gift will partially fund a new $1.5 million endowed chair in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Colorado State's chemical and biological engineers are poised to help solve national problems associated with sustainable use of resources, environmental quality, renewable energy, and meeting global problems of hunger, said Jud Harper. \"The endowment will assist the department in attracting and retaining quality faculty who teach and do research, which is fundamental to its ongoing quality and impact.\" Sami BedellFY 2006-07 Advancement Highlights continued Gifts Elevate Colorado State's Stature as National LeaderReport on Private Support 2006-2007 9 Colorado State Professor Emeritus Bob Behnke is the world's most widely recognized expert in salmonoids and cold-water fisheries. In appreciation of Behnke's achievements, members of Trout Unlimited and the Rocky Mountain Flycasters established an annual fellowship in his name. Behnke was so honored by this recognition that in June 2007 he and his wife, Sally, made an additional gift of $128,044 to permanently endow the scholarship. The Robert J. Behnke Rocky Mountain Flycasters Research Fellowship will allow a graduate student to study pressing environmental issues, such as reintroducing the native greenback cutthroat trout to Colorado fisheries, eradicating whirling disease, and mitigating the effects of runoff from fire disasters on cold- water watersheds. Thanks to $418,000 from Colorado State students , through the University Facility Fee, Morgan Library opened its doors this past fall with greatly improved study, research, and learning areas that are benefiting the Colorado State community - most importantly, our students. The gift helped complete one phase of the Morgan Library Redesign Project, which is aimed at providing state-of-the-art learning spaces with increased access to technology in environments conducive to both individual and group work. The Libraries is moving forward with the next phases of the redesign project. The ultimate goal is to build a 24-hour study zone to better accommodate students' varied schedules. CSU students helped complete the first phase of the Morgan Library Redesign Project, providing state-of-the-art learning environments.

A key part of this commitment involves educating the leaders who will help put this groundbreaking scholarship to work. Scholarship support from private donors makes this possible. U.S. AgBank FCB established one such scholarship in honor of Jerold Harris, a graduate of the College who built a career focused on solutions in service to the greater good of agriculture. The U.S. AgBank/Jerold Harris Farm Credit Bank Scholarship recognizes Harris's positive leadership style and his 43-year career with the Farm Credit System. \"I have never met a better mentor, a stronger leader, or a more respected business associate,\" said Jim Grauerholz, U.S. AgBank's senior vice president for administration, of Jerold Harris. Harris, a 1963 graduate of the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, is talented in many areas, said Grauerholz. But he believes his most notable trait is his \"unique ability to work with people and bring them together in a common cause.\" \"I love agriculture, and I feel I received a strong formal education at CSU,\" Harris said. \"But a college education is just the beginning - learning is a lifelong experience.\" The scholarship will provide College of Agricultural Sciences students with a quality education that will help them develop into strong leaders and continue the proud tradition of the Colorado State University College of Agricultural Sciences. College of Agricultural Sciences: www.agsci.colostate.edu 24 Colorado State University Rowena RiveraA Gift to Inspire the Study of Foreign Languages and Literature The College of Liberal Arts at Colorado State University offers students an education that deepens their understanding of the world and prepares them for meaningful lives and careers. Programs in the College of Liberal Arts are designed to sharpen communication skills, develop the ability to think critically and analytically, and stimulate intellectual development. Students learn how to learn, enabling them to build a variety of careers, adapt to the many changes they will face as those careers evolve and be prepared to lead full and rich lives. Rowena Rivera knows how valuable a liberal arts education can be. Rivera, a retired Spanish professor who taught at CSU in the 1960s, was born in Mesilla, New Mexico, and grew up with bilingual parents who spoke Spanish to her as a child. \"If you learn a language at home, it stays with you forever,\" she said. The experiences Rivera enjoyed with her Spanish students studying abroad in the 1970s were so enchanting that they have become the basis for the short stories she writes today, some of which have been published by University of Arizona Press. To give her students a similar experience, Rivera accompanied them to places such as Cuernavaca and Madrid, where each student stayed with a family and was required to speak only Spanish. \"I told my students, 'Do not be afraid. If you make mistakes, you will learn from them. If you continue with the Spanish, you will come back to college being completely bilingual,'\" Rivera said. When Rivera translates aloud from one of her short stories, her voice again carries the wonder of being abroad with her students: We always walked through the labyrinthine streets of Cuernavaca, in hopes of an adventure with a friend or a stranger, a strange happening, or an intriguing escapade, and there was always a surprise. Rivera has made a planned gift of one-third of her estate to Colorado State's Department of Foreign Languages and Literature. She hopes the scholarships her gift will provide will inspire more students to study Spanish, here and abroad, and come to love the language, teach it, and enthrall others in its mystery and magic. College of Liberal Arts: www.libarts.colostate.edu Report on Private Support 2006-2007 25 Elizabeth (Young) Davis; from the 1941 Silver Spruce.Gifts Help Fund, Implement Nutrition Research Colorado State University's College of Applied Human Sciences promotes the well-being of people, and the environment in which they live, through education, research, and community service, while helping students learn to apply creative, interdisciplinary research to solve social problems. The Colorado State University Nutrition Education Center will provide a rich experiential learning environment for CSU students and promote scholarship in teaching, training, and research, while providing nutrition outreach to the greater Larimer County community, as well as to University employees with need. \"The Center will offer valuable services to help people learn about their nutritional status through assessment of dietary intake and clinical measures,\" said department head Chris Melby. \"It will also provide educational programs for weight management, heart-disease prevention, and healthy cooking.\" Alumna Elizabeth (Young) Davis is a passionate advocate of nutrition education and research. Davis, who graduated in 1941 from Colorado A&M with a degree in home economics, went on to receive a master's in textiles with a minor in nutrition from Auburn University. \"Nutrition was where I belonged all along,\" Davis realized when she embarked upon a doctorate in nutritional biochemistry. After serving on the faculty of Tuskegee Institute and Auburn University, Davis became an administrator with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research Services. There, she and her colleagues monitored funds allocated for critical nutrition and social sciences research at land-grant universities. Davis has consistently supported the CSU College of Applied Human Sciences Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition with annual gifts of $500 to $1,000. She hopes her gifts are enhancing students' and the department's research endeavors. \"When I was teaching, the graduate students had very little support for their research and often had to pay for it themselves,\" Davis recalled. \"I thought a few dollars could make a big difference.\" College of Applied Human Sciences: www.cahs.colostate.edu 26 Colorado State UniversityCam's New Home Away from Home Inspires Colorado State Pride Cam, accompanied by Ram Handlers Jennifer Golden and Lance Pfeiff, makes an appearance with his new trailer and truck at the Fall Address.If you attended a Colorado State football game this past season, you've likely seen the splashy new trailer and truck that transport Cam the Ram to games. Decorated with the University's logo and a larger-than-life photo of Cam, the vehicles have stirred up plenty of excitement, said Dr. Kraig Peel, the animal sciences professor in charge of Cam and the student Ram Handlers. Cam's previous ride - a 5-by-6-foot trailer - was not suitable for a mascot that symbolizes school pride. As Cam jostled around on the road, his horns scratched walls and broke windows in the trailer. That won't happen in his new digs. Cam's 8-by-15-foot compartment inside the 34-foot-long customized trailer is fully padded and well-ventilated. \"He's gone from the slums to the Hilton,\" Dr. Peel said. The new vehicles also are elevating the University's image. \"The impression anyone will have seeing Cam and the trailer going down the road is that Colorado State University is a first- class institution,\" said Carl Maxey, general manager of Maxey Companies Inc., who, with the Henry-Maxey families, were among the largest donors of the trailer. Joe Gebhardt and Davidson-Gebhardt Chevrolet donated the use of the one-ton truck that pulls the trailer. The trailer includes a motor home-style living environment that serves as a gathering place for alumni, friends, and University personnel. At Colorado State's first game this past season, against CU at Invesco Field in Denver, Maxey was surprised by the throngs of people who wanted to have their pictures taken with Cam. \"Now, with the trailer, you have a beautiful backdrop behind every picture,\" he said. Office of Alumni Relations: www.csualum.com Report on Private Support 2006-2007 27 Sharon and David NeenanThe Business of Addressing Great Global Challenges To address today's most pressing global challenges, students in the College of Business's new Global Social and Sustainable Enterprise concentration are learning to meld technology and enterprise-development skills with cultural understanding. The new master's degree concentration teaches students the skills necessary to achieve sustainable global development. \"The GSSE program is based on the idea that enterprises focused on a triple bottom line (financial, social and environmental) can drive sustainable development and succeed where many publicly funded efforts have failed,\" said Program Director Carl Hammerdorfer. Until the College of Business unveiled the new GSSE concentration in Fall 2007, entrepreneur David Neenan had almost lost hope for a world that could provide its occupants with a fair opportunity to earn a living and enjoy a decent quality of life. But the program renewed Neenan's faith. He and his wife, Sharon, embraced the GSSE program, which, they believe, provides a context for enabling people to liberate themselves. In July, the Neenans hosted a fundraising event attended by more than 100 influential Colorado citizens. The Neenans and Bill and Jane Reynolds each made challenge grants of $50,000 to the GSSE program and another $50,000 to the Institute for Liberty and Democracy, an organization established by Hernando de Soto, Peru's globally recognized economist and an ardent GSSE supporter. To date, the event has raised more than $200,000, and contributions continue to come in to support the 23 students presently enrolled in the program. \"The GSSE program is a bigger answer to a global challenge,\" said Sharon Neenan. \"Students are learning skills they will pass on to support people in third-world countries to become sustainable on their own.\" College of Business: www.biz.colostate.edu 28 Colorado State University Natalie Stone and Stefanie Ferguson, CSU women's golf team members, practice at the Harmony Club. Shaping Student-Athletes with Top-Notch Facilities With the addition of two state-of-the-art facilities - an Indoor Practice Facility and an Academic and Training Center - Colorado State aims to attract and develop some of the nation's finest student-athletes. Not only will such standouts boost the competitiveness of the University's teams, they will enhance CSU's reputation as they achieve success after graduation. The Indoor Practice Facility will provide space for numerous CSU teams to practice and will enable University student athletes to prepare for important games, no matter the weather. In this 57,000-square-foot facility to be located north of the Student Recreation Center, the football team can practice for a bowl game on a synthetic turf field on snowy December days. The men's and women's basketball teams can get ready for their seasons on a regulation-size court and two half-courts, as can the women's volleyball team on two full-size, side-by-side courts. The facility also will feature a four-lane training track. As the final cold-weather Mountain West Conference member to build an indoor practice facility, CSU will gain new leverage in recruiting top student athletes. The Academic and Training Center will shape the complete CSU student-athlete by providing a quality learning environment and a top-notch weight room to promote strength and conditioning. The Anderson Academic Center will help student-athletes meet the University's high academic standards by providing four private tutoring rooms, a computer lab, and staff offices. A first- class weight room will help student-athletes gain the muscle and stamina to excel in competition. The new Academic and Training Center, to be located south of the McGraw Center, will support exemplary students pursuing lofty academic and athletic goals. CSU's new golf practice facility, tops in the conference, provides a shining example of how the University already is promoting athletic excellence. Located in the Harmony Club in Timnath, Colo., the facility allows the men's and women's golf teams to practice year-round, thanks to indoor and outdoor areas for driving, chipping, and putting. Byron Collins, a 1980 finance and real estate graduate and Colorado entrepreneur, provided the vision and generosity to make this facility a reality. As CSU's golf program grew in stature over the years, Collins became engaged in discussions about how to improve its facilities. He seized such an opportunity as he planned Harmony, an upscale community featuring rural landscapes and a private golf course. CSU's golf facility also includes coaches' offices, locker rooms, and video equipment. In addition, the golf teams have use of Harmony's 18-hole course designed by CSU alumnus Jim Engh. \"The impression from recruits and their parents - and I've experienced this firsthand - is that they're very excited,\" Collins said. \"Harmony speaks well for all of Northern Colorado, which is a wonderful place to live, work, and play - and this facility is an extension of that.\" By establishing the Indoor Practice Facility and the Academic Training Center, Colorado State University hopes to generate similar enthusiasm among all student-athletes, alumni and members of the CSU community. Division of Athletics: http://csurams.cstv.comReport on Private Support 2006-2007 29Ensuring a Top-Notch Education for Engineering Students With an emphasis on cutting-edge research, technology, and experiential learning, a College of Engineering degree from Colorado State University may have a different emphasis than it did 70 years ago, but its value is just as strong. CSU engineering graduates help the state's high-tech labor force - attracting new industries to Colorado and fueling economic vitality. But you also can find them in key positions around the globe, engineering solutions to global challenges such as alternative energy and climate change. This tradition of excellence and innovation has characterized CSU's engineering College since its founding. Ranked as one of the top engineering programs in the nation by U.S. News & World Report , CSU's was the first engineering program in the state of Colorado and maintains an international reputation for excellence in research and student learning. Engineering centers and laboratories explore the full spectrum of practical and theoretical technologies that will improve our world. CSU's tradition of excellence in engineering has expanded through the years. In 1939, alumnus Frank Gray interviewed for a position with the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, producer of the diesel-electric locomotive that was replacing most of the world's steam locomotives. When asked if he had a degree in electrical engineering, Frank said \"yes\" - a response that led to a long and fruitful career. \"I've never forgotten that moment when my electrical engineering degree meant so much,\" he said. During World War II, Frank served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He later returned to GM, where he became a senior electrical engineer in the Electro-Motive Plant Engineering Department. Upon retiring in 1973, Frank and his wife, Hazel, moved to Arizona where they reside today. They are pleased to will a portion of their estate to the University, to support the College of Engineering and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. \"By giving, we know that the future of CSU will be even better than what the school has been in the past,\" Frank said. \"Even so, it will be hard to match today's high standards set by CSU.\" College of Engineering: www.engr.colostate.edu Frank and Hazel Gray 30 Colorado State UniversityLois Arnold and Carmel Saving Pets' Lives While Breaking New Ground in Human and Animal Health Colorado State University's James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital is the only veterinary cardiac surgery program in North America to offer comprehensive surgical options to dogs suffering from heart disease, the second-leading cause of death in companion dogs. Many of the strides the Animal Heart Center has made in cardiac surgery wouldn't be possible without the support of private donors, such as Lois Arnold, whose dog was treated by Dr. Chris Orton, head of the Animal Heart Center and its Open Heart Surgery Program, and his surgical and support team. As the Animal Heart Center looks to expand its research, teaching, and outreach missions in the coming years, private funding will remain critical to its success, and to continuing to produce surgical success stories, like that of Arnold and her pet, Carmel. When Arnold took her beloved cockapoo for a routine rabies shot, the veterinarian told her Carmel had end-stage heart failure, and that there was no treatment. Refusing to accept this devastating news, Arnold scoured the Internet for animal heart-disease specialists. Nine hours later, she was speaking with Dr. Orton, who told her he'd performed several open-heart surgeries on dogs with the same problem Carmel had. Although she understood the procedure was risky, Arnold brought Carmel to Colorado State in October 2001. Carmel underwent surgery, and survived. \"I was so impressed with Dr. Orton's level of commitment,\" said Arnold, who added that the surgeon even stayed overnight at the hospital, to be there if any complications arose with Carmel. Grateful for the outstanding care both she and Carmel received, Arnold said, \"I felt a karmic obligation to return the gift I'd been given.\" That's when she developed the idea for the Phoenix-based Heart to Heart Pet-a-Rama, an annual event that raises money for research and treatment of animal heart disease at CSU. In 2005, its first year, the Heart to Heart attracted 3,000 attendees and raised $18,000. Two years later, attendance doubled, and $83,000 in proceeds was awarded to CSU. Arnold believes this support will lead to groundbreaking discoveries in heart disease not only in beloved family pets, but in humans, too. \"I believe Dr. Orton when he says his goal is to find the cause of valve degeneration, and he believes it's possible,\" she said. \"The crossover to human medicine is just staggering.\" College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences: www.cvmbs.colostate.edu Report on Private Support 2006-2007 31 Young Alumnus Inspires Faculty and Staff to Give Back It's hard to believe that someone who was once shy and introverted will now stand up and lead 200 alumni in the singing of the CSU Fight Song. But that's Erik Glenn for you - and he credits Colorado State with bolstering his confidence to do what he really wants to do: become a leader. Since graduating in 2002 - the year he also began donating to his alma mater - Glenn has visited hundreds of colleges and universities. None, he said, have the unique environment that Colorado State has; an environment that empowered him to become vice president of the student body and a Legislative intern, and to serve on the Interfraternity Council and coach girls competitive soccer. Today, Glenn is associate director of Denver alumni programs for the University's Alumni Association. He's also an annual donor. As a champion for the University's 2007 Faculty-Staff Drive, Glenn is encouraging other Colorado State employees to support the institution that has inspired so many people to pursue their dreams. \"I feel it's really important to give back, because my degree wouldn't even have been made possible without the generosity of donors before me,\" Glenn said. He believes employees' gifts to the University enable Colorado State to reach new heights, which, in turn, makes his degree that much more valuable. \"I support the possibilities and dreams that Colorado State University inspires, encourages, and fosters within its students, alumni, faculty, and staff,\" Glenn said. \"CSU is a place of endless possibility where knowledge and dreams intersect.\" Faculty-Staff Drive: www.advancing.colostate.edu/ASI/FACULTY-STAFF Erik Glenn 32 Colorado State UniversityExtending a Helping Hand to Community Members Fulfilling the promise of access to higher education for Colorado State University students is an important goal of CSU's Division of Enrollment and Access. The Division's Center for Educational Access and Outreach plays a key role in fulfilling this challenge by helping make education accessible to all people and groups by developing the talents of ethnically diverse, first generation (neither parent has earned a bachelor's degree), or limited-income individuals. The Center provides services for those who would benefit from receiving information about opportunities in higher education; would like to develop the skills and motivation needed to attend college; or would benefit from assistance in the transition into college, raising the graduation rate for those students. Niles and Dorothy Miller never had the opportunity many students today have to complete their college educations. They were too busy serving their country, family, and Platteville, Colo., farm. From the 1940s to the 1980s, the Millers worked hard to carve out a living as dairy, wheat and corn farmers, and ensure that their children would receive college educations. They also supported their larger family - the people of Platteville. The Millers helped create the town's most beautiful buildings: a church, a museum, and a library, all places that foster learning, sharing, and a sense of community. Before Dorothy died from cancer in 2004, she and her husband talked about what to do with the money they'd saved from their successful businesses and a lifetime of frugal living. Characteristically, they agreed to use the money to help others who were less fortunate. In 2006, Niles established the Niles and Dorothy Miller Scholarship fund with a $100,000 endowment, which generated enough interest for three $1,000 scholarships. He and his family trust, the Dorothy J. Miller Testamentary Trust, recently made another contribution, to double the number of annual awards. Today, the fund is helping members of the Millers' extended community - needy students from rural areas in the Platteville vicinity - to receive college educations. \"Rather than do something for ourselves,\" said Niles, \"we decided we'd rather do something to help students go to college who otherwise wouldn't be able to.\" Division of Enrollment and Access: www.es.colostate.edu Niles and Dorothy Miller Report on Private Support 2006-2007 33Colorado State University Report on Private Support 2006-2007 Financial private support includes outright gifts, pledge payments, unpaid commitments and private grants, contracts and cooperative agreements, but does not include payments made to pledges from prior years.

Beneath the photo it says: \"Be Among the Best - Read.\" The poster is among several produced years ago to raise funds for CSU's Morgan Library. \"The library sustained me for half a century,\" said the now retired Rosenberg, who makes annual gifts to sustain the place that he says helped him connect with his students through books. Rosenberg remembers coming to Colorado State in 1959 and receiving $100 from the department, \"to buy all the books I needed to teach medieval history.\" That was the beginning of his enduring relationship with the library. Recognizing Rosenberg's eminence as a medieval scholar, the library sought his recommendations for books that would enhance their collections in this area. In the 1970s, while in Italy, Rosenberg met with a rare-book dealer and helped facilitate the library's purchase of its 700,000th volume - an incunabulum published in 1472. The ancient tome, a collection of sermons by the charismatic 15th-century friar, Roberto Caracciolo, was printed by Sweynheim and Pannartz, the first printers to establish a press in Italy. Only three known copies remain of the 275 books printed. The University's copy is a fine specimen of early printing and binding. It is the oldest volume the library owns. \"I hope we don't lose sight of how we have to treasure the past and the written word,\" Rosenberg said. \"The library must remain the heart of any institution of learning.\" Colorado State University Libraries: http://lib.colostate.edu Harry Rosenberg 42 Colorado State UniversityOn June 20, 2005, CSU graduates Javad Marshall-Fields and Vivian Wolfe were killed in a drive-by shooting just days before Marshall-Fields was to testify as a witness to his best friend's murder. Marshall-Fields and Wolfe, both 22, were model students who loved attending Colorado State and growing intellectually, civically, and athletically. Marshall-Fields was a speech communication graduate interested in pursuing a law degree. Wolfe was a nutrition graduate who hoped to become a midwife. The couple was preparing to continue their educations and eventually marry. \"One day we were celebrating Javad and Vivian's graduation and their love for each other, and the next day we were crying, because someone had taken their lives away,\" said Marshall-Fields' mother, Rhonda Fields. In their children's honor, Rhonda Fields and Christine Wolfe, Vivian's mother, have established the Javad Marshall-Fields and Vivian Wolfe Memorial Scholarship to provide awards to high- achieving students with strong community service experience. The recipients, like Javad Marshall-Fields and Vivian Wolfe, must come from an Aurora or Colorado Springs public high school. The two mothers coordinate a golf tournament and a community awards celebration to generate new annual revenues for the scholarship fund, which has grown from $25,000 to nearly $50,000. Following the progress of the scholarship recipients, Rhonda Fields said, \"We're striving to develop honor and integrity in people, so they will make good choices. \"It's very sad that I will never get to see Javad smile again. The only thing that really brings a smile to my face is seeing these young people fulfilling the dreams that Javad and Vivian weren't able to.\" Division of Student Affairs: www.studentaffairs.colostate.eduTragedy Leads to Scholarships to Promote Character Development Vivian Wolfe and Javad Marshall-Fields Report on Private Support 2006-2007 43Kay and Jim LaBau Experiencing Outdoor Learning at Pingree Park As one of the most comprehensive programs in the country, the Warner College of Natural Resources at Colorado State University provides hands-on training in scientific investigation, management, and conservation of land, wildlife, plant, mineral, and water resources. The WCNR has a unique and rich history, having grown from one forestry course offered in the Department of Agriculture in 1904, to one of the most comprehensive natural resources colleges in the nation. Today, the WCNR is a national and world leader, solving new and more complex natural resources and environmental issues in a dynamic, fast-paced global community and economy. Students participate in field-based programs at Pingree Park, including a one-month summer course during which students learn the fundamentals of a variety of disciplines. Pingree Park provides students with the opportunity to study in a unique outdoor classroom that sets the program apart from others nationwide. \"The experience I had at Pingree Park was one of the most important things that ever happened to me,\" said Jim LaBau, a 1957 forest management graduate. \"It opened my eyes to how forestry is done.\" Jim's passions extend from forests to his CSU education and, especially, to the Pingree Park Summer Camp he attended in 1954. While at CSU, Jim met and married Kay Thayer, a home economics major. The couple now lives in Alaska, but visits Fort Collins regularly. To express their gratitude to CSU and for the Pingree Park experience, Jim and Kay have created an endowment in the Warner College of Natural Resources to assist with scholarships for Pingree Park Summer Camp students. \"We've established this scholarship so the advantages of this summer program will be passed on to others,\" said Jim. This year Jim helped organize the Class of '57 Pingree Park reunion, and along with two other classmates, helped organize a Homecoming Reunion for the Class of 1957 Forestry and Natural Resource graduates. During Jim's 36-year career with the U.S. Forest Service, he worked in forests across Colorado, California, and Alaska, surveying forests and monitoring forest health. After retiring, he monitored insect infestations in Alaska for the University of Alaska. He has published more than 80 professional papers and participated in numerous boreal forest discussions at professional meetings worldwide. \"My forestry career was highly rewarding from a personal and professional standpoint,\" said Jim. \"Much of that can be attributed to the excellent education I received at CSU/Aggies and at the Pingree Park Summer Camp.\"Warner College of Natural Resources: www.warnercnr.colostate.edu 44 Colorado State UniversityBequest Advances Opportunities for Chemistry Department and Hands-On Learning The science of chemistry often is described as a \"central\" science, partly because of its importance in all of the present and emerging areas of basic science and technology, and partly because of its impact on life in general. The Department of Chemistry in the College of Natural Sciences at Colorado State University is nationally and internationally recognized for excellence in research and teaching. Part of its mission is to help young scientists as they work to unlock some of science's greatest mysteries through a deepened understanding and advanced application of modern chemistry. To make this possible, Kathryn \"Kitty\" Hach-Darrow, a valued friend of CSU's College of Natural Sciences, bequeathed $500,000 to the Department of Chemistry. Hach-Darrow has been a steadfast supporter of the College's students and programs not only personally, but also through the Hach Scientific Foundation, which provides premier scholarships to CSU's outstanding chemistry students. Hach-Darrow was raised on a Missouri farm and later attended Iowa State University where she met her husband-to-be, Clifford Hach, and earned a degree in food and nutrition. In 1948, the couple started Hach Chemical Company with the proceeds from a patent Clifford Hach authored. He did the chemistry; she handled the company's marketing and business activities. By 1968, the company was publicly held and had developed a complete water analysis product line. Clifford passed away in 1990, and Kitty continued as CEO and Chairman of the Board for Hach Chemical Company. She was the first woman director of the American Water Works Association, the first woman to serve as director of First National Bank of Loveland, Colo., and is a founding member of the Committee of 200 Executive Women organization. An avid pilot, Hach-Darrow has flown for more than 50 years. She is multiengine-, instrument- and jet rated, has accumulated more than 7,000 hours of flying time, and is a member of the Ninety-Nines, an international organization of licensed women pilots. Just as she has soared to new heights in her own life and career, Hach-Darrow's hope is to give top chemistry students their own wings to reach new heights. Hach-Darrow's gift will have a tremendous impact on the department and the chemistry profession. Working with a land-grant university such as Colorado State, she said, \"provides Hach Scientific Foundation with the versatility of supporting those wishing to become chemistry teachers and researchers and also those wishing to pursue careers in academia.\" College of Natural Sciences: www.natsci.colostate.edu Kathryn \"Kitty\" Hach-Darrow Report on Private Support 2006-2007 45 Colorado State's internationally recognized College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences began as a full academic program in 1907, thanks to the vision, persistence, and leadership of Dr. George Glover. To ensure a safe animal-food supply for the people of Fort Collins, Dr. Glover worked tirelessly to eradicate tuberculosis from local dairy herds and the transmission of disease from contaminated meat. His efforts exemplify the close relationship between animal-, human-, and environmental health - a relationship that drives the work of CSU's veterinary scientists today. Over the last 100 years, researchers in the College have pioneered many advances in health. The outstanding work done in the College has led to: One of the first veterinary X-rays in the country. Development of a technique to treat bone cancer in dogs, significantly increasing the chances for children with this type of cancer to be cured. The world's first courses in veterinary medical ethics. The nation's first veterinary oncologist. The first university to produce twin foals by splitting a single embryo.Celebrating a Century of Hope, Care, and Cures: The College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences continued on following page 46 Colorado State University The first equine-dedicated MRI in the United States. The internationally known Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory. Predetermining the sex of calves and the first calves produced by artificial insemination. Introducing environmental health as a major. Managing the on-site health and safety program at the Sept. 11 recovery site for the World Trade Center. Introducing new programs in food-animal education and cancer biology, as well as an undergraduate degree in biomedical sciences and combined degree programs, including a D.V.M. with a Master of Business Administration or a Master in Public Health. As well as unsurpassed veterinary science, diagnosis, and treatment, the College is a worldwide center for infectious disease research. On a global scale, the College is leading national biosecurity/infectious disease efforts in its new Regional Biocontainment Laboratory at the CSU Foothills Campus. The College's innovative blending of research and teaching enables faculty, staff, and students to provide the very best care for animals. Ranked today as one of the nation's top two veterinary medical schools, the College also is an internationally ranked center of excellence for education and exploration in the biomedical sciences. It is the nation's leading recipient of funding for veterinary research, in particular, National Institutes of Health research funding, and is home to four University Programs of Research and Scholarly Excellence. The College's goal for the next 100 years is to be at the forefront of innovations in veterinary medicine and public health, environmental health, population medicine, fostering the human-animal bond, and preventing zoonoses - diseases communicable from animals to humans. As we are finding that many treatments on animals can be transferred to humans and vice versa, we are indeed embarking upon an expanded vision for one world, one health, one medicine.

Private gifts have enhanced Colorado State's teaching and research facilities. Gifts-in-kind of equipment and computers are used in laboratories and classrooms across campus. Charitable donations have funded research opportunities to make the discoveries of tomorrow. Outright Gifts Cash Gifts The most popular way of giving is a cash contribution in the form of currency, money order, bank draft, or check made payable to the Colorado State University Foundation. In most cases your gift is tax deductible. Gifts of Securities Gifts of appreciated securities may be one of the most tax-wise ways to make a substantial contribution to Colorado State University. There is a double tax benefit from such a gift. The full value of the securities is usually deductible and you don't have to pay capital gains taxes on the increase in value. You may give and deduct appreciated property up to 30 percent of your adjusted gross income each year. Any excess amount may be deducted over the following five tax years. Gifts of r eal Estate There are many ways to give real estate to benefit Colorado State University. The method you choose depends on your individual circumstances and needs and how you want your gift to support the University. Any gift of real estate is subject to acceptance by the University's Land Acquisition Committee. These gifts are also subject to the Foundation's right to sell and realize the proceeds if the property cannot be used by the University. Non-Cash Gifts Many donors choose to contribute artwork, books, musical instruments, manuscripts, furnishings, animals, and other personal property as acquisitions or additions to existing University collections. These assets can be used for outright gifts. The tax consequences for gifts of tangible personal property will differ and are dependent upon the nature of the asset and the standard of \"related use.\" The gift must be related to the University's exempt function. Generally the \"exempt function\" means the gift of personal property must be put to use by the University and not sold at the time of the gift.Giving to Colorado State University Planned Gifts Bequests and r evocable Trusts, r etained Life Estate Agreement One of the easiest and most common ways to make a planned gift is through a bequest in your will. Through a well-planned will, it's possible to make charitable gifts of a specific amount, a particular property, a percentage of the estate, or all or a portion of your remainder - what's left after providing for other heirs. A bequest in your will is an excellent method to provide a charitable gift for Colorado State University. Upon your death, the Foundation will receive your gift and utilize the funds as directed in your will. For many donors, a bequest enables a substantial gift to be made to the Colorado State University Foundation that may not have been possible to make during their lifetimes. Important estate tax savings can result from a gift by bequest, since bequests to the Foundation may be deducted entirely from the taxable estate for the purpose of determining estate taxes. Your bequest may be one or both of the following: Specific Bequest - a bequest of a fixed amount of money or specific property; or Proportional Bequest - a bequest of a specified portion or percentage of the residue of the estate, usually after other provisions have been fulfilled. The proportional bequest is advantageous because it is self-adjusting to the size of the estate. A specific bequest might require revision from time to time as the size of the estate changes. Charitable Gift Annuity Through a charitable gift annuity, you can make a gift to CSU and receive fixed annual payments for life. The payment amount is based on your age (or the age of the payment recipients) when the gift is completed. The older the donor (recipient) the larger the payments. An income tax deduction is allowed for a portion of the amount transferred. For a period of years, only part of the payments will be taxed as income. If stocks or other property that has risen in value is given in exchange for a gift annuity that pays income to a donor and/or spouse, the realized capital gain can generally be reported at what may be more favorable capital gains tax rates over a period of time. If you (the donor) and/or a spouse are the only payment beneficiaries, the amount used to fund a gift annuity is generally not subject to estate taxes that might otherwise be due. 70 Colorado State UniversityThe payment can begin currently or can be deferred for a period of time at your determination (but no more than 20 years). You can name yourself as the sole annuitant or designate another annuitant, either solely, concurrently, or consecutively. A sum of money or certain other property may be used to establish a gift annuity. An income tax deduction is allowed for a portion of the amount transferred in exchange for a gift annuity. Up to two people may qualify for annual gift annuity payments. Charitable remainder Annuity Trust and Charitable remainder Unitrust Charitable remainder trusts are irrevocable trusts that feature income to be paid to lifetime beneficiaries. The annuity trust pays a fixed income based on the value of assets at the time the trust is created, while the unitrust provides a fluctuating income based on a fixed percentage of the trust's market value as determined on an annual basis. When the trust is created, capital gains tax can be postponed, and an income tax deduction is available for a portion of the value of the property. Income from the charitable remainder trust may be taxed favorably under lower capital gains tax rates. There also may be estate tax benefits. When the trust is created, an income tax deduction is allowed for a portion of the principal used to establish the trust. Throughout the life of the trust, income is reportable to you (or another income beneficiary) based on the nature of the assets held in trust. Life Estate Agreement Entering into a Life Estate Agreement is another way to donate a ranch, farm, or residence for those donors who want to continue to enjoy and use their property during their lives. While an actual transfer of the future interest in the property is made to the Colorado State University Foundation now, you may still live in the home or on the farm for the rest of your life. At the time of the irrevocable transfer of ownership of the property, a substantial income tax deduction may be allowed. The charitable deduction is the full market value of the property minus the calculated dollar value of the retained life estate as determined by government tables. This donation allows you the full use of your property during your lifetime and the lifetime of your beneficiary. You continue to pay maintenance, insurance, and taxes and retain other rights, including the right to rent the property. The residence does not need to be the principal residence - it can be a second residence or vacation home. If it is a farm, the donor does not need to reside on the farm when it is given to the Foundation.For example, if you irrevocably transfer your home to CSU, you retain the right to live in it for your lifetime, a term of years, or a combination of the two. You may also use a vacation home to create this kind of gift. While you retain the right to live on the property, you continue to be responsible for all routine expenses, maintenance fees, insurance, property taxes, repairs, etc. If you later decide to vacate your property, you may rent all or part of the property to someone else or sell the property in cooperation with CSU. Owner or Beneficiary of Life Insurance Policy or retirement Plan Gifts of life insurance have valuable and attractive benefits for the University and the donor. If you have no dependents, or when your dependents no longer need the protection of an existing life insurance policy, you can give the policy to the Foundation and gain substantial tax benefits for the year of your gift. If you make a gift of an existing life insurance policy, you can make a sizable gift without reducing your income, you may receive an immediate and substantial federal income tax deduction, you may receive deductions for future premium payments, and your federal estate taxes may be reduced or eliminated, depending on the size of your estate. You may also purchase a new life insurance policy and name the Colorado State University Foundation owner and irrevocable beneficiary. In this case, you receive a charitable deduction for the unexpired premium in the year of the gift and all future premiums. Another alternative is for you to name the Colorado State University Foundation as beneficiary of a life insurance policy you still control and own. Although you do not receive a federal income tax deduction now, you may reduce estate taxes because the proceeds are a charitable gift. Giving Through r etirement Plans Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), company-sponsored pension and profit-sharing plans, and other methods of saving for retirement may be appealing sources for charitable gifts. If you are over age 59\u00bd and find that you have more than adequate resources set aside for retirement, it may be wise to periodically use a portion of your retirement funds to make charitable gifts. Amounts remaining in qualified retirement plans at death may be subject to income taxes and possibly estate taxes when received by heirs. For this reason, charitable gifts of retirement plan balances can be a gift of choice from income tax and estate planning perspectives. If you wish to provide a loved one with income while also providing for your charitable interests, retirement plans can be designated to fund a special type of gift to meet both objectives. All arrangements must be made with the plan sponsor, not through your will.Giving to Colorado State UniversityReport on Private Support 2006-2007 71Other Gift Considerations Your philanthropic gifts are an investment in the current and future success of Colorado State University. Whether you make an unrestricted or designated gift, you can choose to use your gift to create an endowment fund or an expendable (non-endowed) fund. A gift to establish an endowment creates a perpetual source of funding by keeping the principal of the gift intact forever. Only the income of the fund's earnings can be spent to support Colorado State University in the manner of your choice. A portion of the endowment earnings is added to the principal in an effort to keep pace with inflation. Your endowment gift will support Colorado State for generations. If you choose to use your gift to establish an expendable fund, the fund may be spent in its entirety to support Colorado State University in the manner of your choice at the time the gift is made. Your non-endowed gift will be expended for current needs of programs you select. Named Endowment Opportunities Endowment levels indicate the minimum funding required from private sector donors. Each chair, professorship or other endowment may need to be funded at a higher level to meet the needs of a specific program. According to the current spending policy of Colorado State University Foundation, 4.5 percent of an endowment's market value is available for allocation each year. This policy is subject to change at the discretion of the Foundation Board. $3 Million University Endowed Chair This designation is accorded to that select number of faculty judged to be truly outstanding scholars and teachers according to rigorous, nationally accepted standards. The title of University Chair is one of the highest honors Colorado State University may award to a faculty member. The reputations of recipients reflect their special creative and research contributions, as well as their efforts in shaping the world's understanding of their fields of study. University Chairs at Colorado State, as at other prestigious universities, constitute that small cadre of exceptionally gifted professors whose names evoke immediate acknowledgement and respect in academic circles. Annual allocations from the endowment are expected to fund the salary, benefits, and operational costs for the position. $1.5 Million College Endowed Chair Recipients of these chairs must have demonstrated significant contributions to their fields through exceptional teaching and scholarly excellence. These individuals are expected to be of national stature with established track records of achievement. In addition to acquiring a minimum gift of $1.5 million from a donor, a college must commit an appropriate level of funding to cover salary, benefits and operational costs for the position. $750,000 University Professorship This designation is intended to enhance faculty positions held by scholars/teachers with outstanding qualifications. The achievements and qualifications of Distinguished Professors are expected to be extremely high, setting them apart from the majority of their colleagues. Earnings from these endowments supplement faculty salary lines. $375,000 College Professorship Professorships are typically held by gifted faculty members whose accomplishments indicate great potential. Their efforts are focused on honing their teaching skills and on carving out areas of research or performance. Earnings from these endowments supplement faculty salary lines. $250,000 Endowed Visiting Lecturer or Artist Fund This designation is reserved for those select and accomplished leaders who are invited to lecture or teach at Colorado State University for a limited period of time and are not permanent members of the Colorado State faculty. $50,000 Endowed Graduate Fellowship Fellowships are awarded to students performing research on campus. These fellowships enable outstanding students to continue their pursuit of research on the graduate level. $25,000 Endowed Scholarship or Program Fund Scholarship or program endowments support students or programs in any of Colorado State University's colleges or units.
