The importance of Qi to body imbalances and restoring harmony TCM is based on the concept of Qi (pronounced chee), which is the life force or vital energy and the complementary relationship of yin and yang, TCM uses treatments to address imbalances and guide the body back into harmony. In TCM, good health occurs when there is a harmonious balance between yin and yang and a smooth flow of Qi throughout the body. Disharmony between yin and yang and a disturbance in the flow of Qi may result in disease. At SFNM, we're experts in identifying the proper treatment within the full spectrum of traditional Chinese medicine to remedy symptoms and restore the harmony that's essential to your health. Treatment individualized and tailor-made for each patient Holistic in approach, TCM treats the whole person (mind, body, spirit) and works to rebalance yin and yang and the smooth flow of Qi, the animating force that warms us, protects us from external pathogenic factors, promotes the functions of the body and holds our organs and tissues in place. Taking a holistic approach means that we determine treatment only after a complete understanding of a patient's history and needs. This process involves an interview and an examination of critical areas of the body. Only then can we identify patterns of disharmony and outline the proper course to take. Treatment is so thoroughly personalized that it's safe to say that if ten people are experiencing a migraine, ten very different treatment plans will emerge based on individual symptoms and health history. Our knowledge and experience with traditional Chinese medicine enables us to provide the ultimate in personalized care.
