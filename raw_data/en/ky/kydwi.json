A recent review of studies conducted si nce 1985, shows an estimate of the prevalence to be 1-1.4 per 1,000 for classic autism, and possi bly as high as 4-5 per 1,000 for all autism spectrum disorders (ASD) combined (Kedesjo et al 19 99; Rapin, 1997; Arvidsson et al., 1997). While these rates are 3-4 times higher than rates f ound in studies conducted 15-20 years ago (Fombonne, 1999), there are several recent studies, including a study done by Baird et al. (2000) and an investigation in Brick Township NJ, which su ggested that the rate of autism may be higher still with rates of 3.1 per 1,000 and 4 per 1,000 respectively (CDC 2000; Baird et al. 2000). These higher prevalence rates, coupled with reports of increasing numbers of children with autism being served by schools and service age ncies (California Department of Developmental Services,1999) have prompted concerns that the rate of autism may be increasing. A study published in 1998 in the Lancet (Wakefield et al, 1998) has lead some to hypothesize the MMR vaccine may play a role in the recent trend upw ard in autism rates. This study was a case series of 12 children who were referred to a pediat ric gastroenterology clinic because of chronic enterocolitis and were found to also have autistic behavioral characteristics. Eight of the 12 children were reported by parental interview as fir st experiencing the onset of autistic-like symptoms following the MMR vaccine, and an addition al child's onset occurred after measles infection which lead the investigators to hypothesi ze that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine might be associated with the onset of autis m. While suggestive, this clinical case study lacked evidence to evaluate a possible causal assoc iation between MMR vaccine and the occurrence of ASD (6). More recently, Wakefield and Montgomery (1999) have suggested that the MMR vaccine may alter the immune response for o ne of the vaccine components due to an interaction with one or more of the other vaccine c omponents. Animal models support the possibility of interference of T-cell responses bas ed on exposure to several viruses simultaneously but to date this has not been demons trated with the MMR vaccine (IOM, 2001). Wakefield et al., (1998, 2000) have also suggested that exposure to the MMR vaccine may be linked to inflammation-mediated intestinal permeabi lity that results in incomplete breakdown and excessive absorption of gut-derived peptides fr om certain foods (Wakefield, 2001). A number of other studies have been designed to try and confirm the alleged association found between autism and the MMR vaccine. A study in Swed en, which used data from the only ongoing population-based registry of autism, showed that the prevalence of autism did not increase after the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1982. (Gillberg & Heijbel, 1998). Taylor et al. (1999) identified 498 children with a utism (261 with typical autism, 166 with atypical autism, and 71 with Asperger's syndrome) i n eight North Thames health districts in the 2United Kingdom (UK) who were born since 1979. Thes e cases were linked to an independent regional vaccination registry. The investigators e xamined time trends in rates of autism, compared age at diagnosis for children vaccinated b efore and after 18 months of age, and performed a case series analyses examining temporal trends between MMR vaccination and age of onset of autism. There were no statistically sig nificant associations between the onset of autism within 1 or 2 years after vaccination with M MR. Further, developmental regression was not clustered in the months following vaccination a nd no significant temporal clustering for age at onset of parental concern was seen for cases of core autism or atypical autism with the exception of a single interval within 6 months of M MR vaccination. There were several possible weaknesses in the study including failure to confir m ICD10 criteria for diagnosis of ASD and the possibility of incomplete ascertainment. In a series of large epidemiology studies (Patja A, Davidkin I, Kurki et al, 2000; Peltola H, Patja A, Leinikki P., 1998) a Finnish cohort of 1.8 milli on individuals with approximately 3 million MMR vaccine doses from 1982 to 1996 was examined. T here were 173 potentially serious adverse events that were claimed to be causally ass ociated with MMR vaccination. Of these adverse events, 45% had evidence suggesting other c auses or contributing factors (i.e, infectious agents, viruses). The resulting incidence of advers e events was 5.3 per 100,000 MMR vaccinees. There were no cases of autism that were associated with MMR vaccination. In 2001, Kaye et al. (2001) published a study that examined children 12 years of age or younger from the UK diagnosed with autism between 1988 and 1999 through the use of the UK general practice research database. Because only 3% of chi ldren did not receive the MMR vaccine, time trend analyses were carried out to determine whethe r there was a temporal association between the age of receipt of the MMR vaccine and the diagn osis of autism over time. A total of 305 children with autism aged 12 years or younger whose first recorded diagnosis occurred between 1988 and 1999 were identified from 3,092,742 person year observations. Subsequent analyses were restricted to boys aged 2 to 5 years born betw een 1988 and 1993. Annual birth cohorts were analyzed separately. There was a significant increa se in the rates of autism between 1988 and 1999 from 0.3 per 10,000 person years in 1988 to 2. 1 per 10,000 person years in 1999. However, there was no temporal association between MMR preva lence rates and the risk for autism. The major weakness in the study was that diagnosis of a utism was not confirmed from original records. More recently, Dale et al. (2001) published results of a study carried out in California that was conducted to determine if a correlation existed bet ween the trends of MMR vaccine coverage and autism occurrence. The researchers of this study p erformed retrospective analyses of children from kindergartens who were born in 1980 to 1994 (s amples of 600-1900 children each year) and of autism cases derived from the California Dep artment of Developmental Services who were born in the same years. School immunization r ecords were reviewed to determine the age at which children received the first dose of the MM R vaccination. Two main outcome measures were used: the proportion of children in each birth year that received the MMR vaccine by the age of 17 months and the proportion of children tha t received the vaccine by the age of 24 months. The results of this study showed no correl ation between the trend in MMR vaccine coverage and the occurrence of autism. It was note d that there was a marked increase in autism from 1980 to 1994, 44 per 100.000 in 1980 to 208 pe r 100,000 in 1994; however, it was also 3found that changes in MMR immunization coverage wer e smaller and of shorter duration. The administrative data had limitations especially with the diagnosis of autism. Finally, in April of this year the Institute of Med icine (2001) reviewed the research examining the association between the receipt of the MMR vacc ine and risk for autism. They concluded \"The evidence favors the rejection of a causal rela tionship at the population level between MMR vaccine and autistic spectrum disorder.\" Although t hey rejected a causal hypothesis at the population level they strongly encouraged additiona l studies to examine possible associations between the MMR and certain subgroups of autistic c hildren. In terms of the suggested link between MMR vaccinat ion, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autism (Wakefield et al.1998, 2000, 2001) sever al additional studies have been carried out to try and confirm the associations. Fombonne (1998) u sing two large databases (a clinical database from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Services o f large teaching hospital in south London with about 9000 clinic records and a second survey of autism in France in school-aged children in three French departments from a population of 32 5,347 children) examined records of children with autism for the co-occurrence of ulcerative col itis or Crohn's disease. There were no cases that were identified in either database, suggesting that if the two conditions were associated, as suggested by Wakefield et al. (1998) it was a rare occurrence. Davis, Kramarz, Bohlke et al (2001) carried out a c ase-control study of individuals from four large health maintenance organizations in the Unite d States. They identified 155 cases with ICD- 9 codes for IBD and up to 5 controls matched on sex , age, and HMO. Only 142 cases were subsequently used in the analyses of timing of vacc ination and diagnosis of IBD. Of the 142 cases, 75 were Crohn's diseases and 67 had ulcerati ve colitis (UC). Ninety four (66%) of cases had been vaccinated with MMR and 38 with other meas les containing vaccines (MCV). Ten had never been vaccinated with either MMR or MCV. There were no statistical associations between timing of vaccination and subsequent diagnosis of I BD, Crohn's Diseases or UC at 2, 4, 6, or 12 months after vaccination. In an effort to resolve the speculation regarding t he association between the MMR vaccine and autism, investigators from the CDC have conducted a matched case-control study utilizing the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Sur veillance Program to look at this potential relationship. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the association between the CDC case definition for autism and timing of the receip t of the MMR vaccine. The CDC's Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabi lities Surveillance Program (MADDSP) monitors the rate of serious developmental disabili ties using records from public school special education and other medical facilities for children with one or more of four developmental disabilities -- mental retardation, cerebral palsy, hearing impairment, and vision impairment. In the 1996 surveillance year autism was added to the MADDSP in response to public concern about the possible increase in the prevalence of au tism and related disorders. The first year of prevalence data for autism is completed with over 7 00 children with autism identified. The strengths of MADDSP include the multiple source app roach to identifying children with developmental disabilities and the expert clinical review of case information to determine cases status. 4 Justification for Study Several limitations of previous investigations exam ining the association between the MMR vaccine and autism included incomplete case ascerta inment and inability to confirm the diagnosis of autism. Most of the studies described above used selected service provider databases to identify children with autism and only the Taylor et al. (1999) study attempted to confirm the diagnosis of autism from original recor ds. These limitations along with the continuing concern surrounding this issue suggested the need for further research to clarify the relationship between MMR vaccine and autism. The b enefits of the CDC study include 1) complete ascertainment of known cases from a large population, 2) extensive record review of cases by a panel of autism experts to confirm the c ase definition for autism, 3) inclusion of a sample of controls matched by age, sex, and school system to compare the distribution of age at MMR vaccination among cases and controls, 4) inclus ion of birth records to control for other background variables that may be associated with au tism and receipt of MMR vaccine including birth weight, gestational age, maternal age, and ma ternal education, and 5) because of the extensive clinical information on case children, th e ability to examine the case group by the presence or absence of other co-existing conditions , e.g. mental retardation and possible genetic risk factors. It is expected that findings from th is study will provide important information regarding the relationship between MMR vaccine and autism. Study Design We used a case-control design to examine the distri bution of age at receipt of the first dose of the MMR vaccine among children with autism compared to control children. Case children were identified through a population-based surveillance system and control children were selected from the same population as the case children and m atched on birth year, gender, and school system. Objectives: We did not have information regarding onset of symp toms for most cases in this study and this limited our ability to do certain types of analyses such as case series analyses. In addition, a totally unexposed group (i.e., never received the M MR vaccine or other measles containing vaccine) was not available since measles, mumps, an d rubella vaccination are required for school attendance in Georgia. The following objectives are considered the primary objectives for this study. 1) To determine if case children were more likely than their matched controls to have been vaccinated with MMR before 36 months of age. DSM-IV criteria for autism require that onset of symptoms occur before 36 months of age. Th erefore, the 36-month cut-off is one that by definition can be used to classify a defini tely \"unexposed\" group. 2) To determine whether there was a difference between cases and controls in the proportion of children exposed to their first dose of MMR vaccine before 18 months of age. This objective is based on the research that suggests the timing o f first parental concern for the development of autism appears around 18 months of age (Taylor e t al, 1999). In addition, Cathy Lord has 5reported that the range of first parental concern f or regression was between 12 and 23 months of age with a mode of 19-21 months. 3) To determine whether the age distribution for recei pt of the MMR vaccine differs between cases and controls. Study population MADDSP was established to ascertain all children wh o have one or more of the five developmental disabilities -- mental retardation, c erebral palsy, autism, hearing impairment, and vision impairment -- who are 3 to 10 years of age a nd whose parents reside in the five-county metropolitan Atlanta area. In 1996, this area had a n estimated population of 2.5 million people, approximately 38,000 live births per year, and 289, 456 children 3-10 years of age. Cases: Information on potential cases was collected via a multiple-source case finding method of record abstraction. Children's records that contain descr iptive behavioral information, diagnostic tests, and other relevant diagnostic information were abst racted at different sites including school systems (special education records) and medical fac ilities that serve children with autism. Children with Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disinteg rative Disorder were excluded as autism cases; however, information on these children was m aintained in the database. An autism case was defined in MADDSP as a child: (1 ) who was 3-10 years old at any time during 1996 (birth years 1987-1993); (2) whose pare nt or legal guardian resided in the five- county metropolitan Atlanta area during 1996; and ( 3) who displayed behaviors (as coded by a qualified professional) consistent with the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Spec ified (PDD-NOS) or Asperger's Disorder [DSM-IV reference]. In this analysis plan, the term \"autism\" will be used to refer to autistic disorder and the related autism spectrum disorders. A coding system based on the social, communication, behavioral, and age criteria, as well as the associated features for autism was developed by a p anel of professionals who have extensive experience in the field of autism. The panel consi sted of two developmental psychologists, a clinical psychologist, and a special education spec ialist. Children's school and provider records were screened for statements of a broad range of be havioral triggers associated with autism (for example, decreased eye contact, problems with socia l interactions, rocking, etc.). If a single trigger was present, verbatim behavioral descriptio ns were abstracted from the medical, psychological, and educational reports. In order to determine case status for each child, o ne of the four autism experts reviewed the abstracted evaluations for each child and scored be havioral statements found in the records according to DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder and other related autism spectrum disorders (PDD-NOS and Aspergers disorder). Based on the sco res for each child, children were classified an autism case, an autism suspected case, or not an autism case. For cases with limited or questionable information, a second reviewer indepen dently scored the record for the DSM-IV criteria and then consensus was reached on whether the child met the case definition for autism. 6If the case status of the child was still in questi on following the second review, Catherine Lord, Ph.D, a clinical psychologist and expert in the dia gnosis of children with autism spectrum disorders, reviewed the record to determine final c ase status. In the absence of described behaviors in the abstracted evaluations, children w ith a previous diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder by a qualified examiner were classified as suspected cases. Reliability estimates for the scoring system were obtained by randomly selecting 20% of the records and having two reviewers independently score each record. A total of 755 final cases were identified and abstracted for the study. Controls: Control children were selected from the same popula tion as cases and were matched based on age within 6 months, sex, and school or a school in close proximity to the matched case school. A total of 2,265 controls were abstracted for the s tudy. The ratio of cases to controls was chosen to be 1:3 and for a small number of cases, fewer th an 3 controls were obtained. Controls were selected from regular education programs and were n ot receiving special education services at the time of abstraction. After controls were abstracted, they were matched a gainst MADDSP and the Georgia Special Education Files to determine if the child had recei ved special education services at some point prior to abstraction. While none of the controls w ere found in the MADDSP database, 111 (7%) were found in Georgia's Special Education files ind icating that they did receive special education services at some time but they did not ha ve one of the MADDSP eligible developmental disabilities. All controls will be i ncluded in the analyses independent of whether they received special education services. Vaccination history: Trained abstractors collected vaccination histories of cases and controls from the standardized State of Georgia immunization forms that all childr en are required to provide to attend public schools in Georgia. The immunization form, also ref erred to as Form 3032, reflects the immunization requirements (minimum standards) for a ttendance at Georgia schools (See Appendix A). The forms are filed in each student's permanent school record. The child's primary health care provider completes the forms pr ior to school entry. All childhood vaccines required by Georgia law are recorded on the vaccina tion forms. During the period of this study, Georgia law required the following vaccines for chi ldren: 1) at least 3 doses of either diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis combined vaccine (DTP, DT, o r DtaP), 2) a combination of at least 3 doses of either trivalent oral polio vaccine (TOPV) or en hanced potency inactivated polio vaccine (EIPV), and 3) at least one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine in the form of either the combined vaccines, MMR or MR, or single antigen vac cines. Effective with the 1994-95 school year, for entrance into the sixth grade of school, a child needed to have received at least one additional dose of the MMR vaccine, for a total of two MMR vaccines administered on or after the child's first birthday and at least one month a part. A child can also meet the measles and rubella requirement with lab confirmation of the pr esence of protective levels of antibodies. Hepatitis B vaccine and Hemophilus Influenza B (Hib ) vaccine were not required at any time during the study. Other information collected from the vaccination forms included location of 7vaccine administration, the physician or qualified examiner who administered the vaccine, and information regarding the administration of vaccine s not required for school entry or additional doses of a vaccine that was required. Data regardi ng vaccination exemptions (medical and religious) were also available. Only one child in t his study had an exemption filed in the school records. Family Background and Other Data Collection: Information extracted from the child's school recor d included child's date of birth, sex, birth state, and race. Subsequently cases and controls bo rn in Georgia were matched to state birth certificate records. The matching criteria used wer e birth certificate number and child's first and last name. Of the children identified as being born in Georgia, approximately 95% of cases and 88% of controls were successfully matched. For the subset of children with Georgia birth records, sub-analyses will be performed in which po tential confounding variables from the birth certificate will be used to adjust the estimated as sociation between the MMR vaccine and autism. The variables that will be assessed as potential co nfounders will be birth weight, APGAR scores, gestational age, birth type, parity, maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and maternal education. Additional background information was obtained from the MADDSP data set for case children. This included information on the presence of other developmental disabilities (mental retardation, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing imp airment, and epilepsy), the presence of a coexisting medical condition (specifically, tuberou s sclerosis and fragile X syndrome), intelligence quotient (IQ), as well as prenatal and perinatal conditions (fetal alcohol syndrome, bacterial meningitis, otitis media, etc). In addit ion, we identified major congenital malformations among the case children by matching w ith the CDC's Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, a population-based surv eillance program of major congenital defects that covers the same geographic area (Edmon ds et al, 1981). MMR Exposure Variables All children in Georgia must document receipt of th e MMR vaccine before school entry or obtain a medical or philosophical exemption. Theref ore, for this study there will be too few subjects to define an unvaccinated referent categor y. The primary exposure of interest in this study will be the age of receipt of the first dose of the MMR vaccine. The DSM-IV criteria for autism requires onset of symptoms before 36 months of age and therefore MMR exposure would need to occur prior to 36 months of age in order to be causally associated with autism. The age of MMR vaccination will be examined in several ways. T he first two analyses will examine two alternative age cut-offs for exposure to the MMR va ccine: 18 months and 36 months. The third analysis will examine age of MMR vaccination catego rized The referent group will be > 36 months. 8Other Vaccine Related Exposure Variables Prior to 1999, thimerosal was included as a preserv ative in most multi-dose formulations of DTP, hepatitis B and Hib vaccines. The hepatitis B and H ib vaccines were not recommended by ACIP for children aged less than 1 year until 1991. Most children in this study were born prior to 1991 and therefore will not have been exposed to thimero sal from either the hepatitis B or Hib vaccines during the first year of life. In addition , Georgia schools did not require the Hib vaccine at the time of this study and administration of the Hib vaccine appears to have been poorly recorded in the school immunization records. There fore, the association between thimerosal dose received early in life and subsequent risk for autism will not be addressed with this data. Power Calculations We have identified 755 cases of autism and 2265 mat ched controls for inclusion in the study. If we assume 80% vaccination coverage among controls a t 24 months of age and an alpha error of .05, we will have greater than 90% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.5 and greater than 80% power to detect odds ratio of 1.4. If we assume 90 % vaccination coverage among controls at 36 months of age and an alpha error of .05, we will ha ve greater than 90% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.7 and greater than 80% power to detect a n odds ratio of 1.6. If we assume that 50% of cases and controls for the analyses will be included in the birth certificate analyses then, with 80% vaccination cov erage among controls at 24 months of age and an alpha error of .05, we will have greater than 90 % power to detect an odds ratio of 1.7 and greater than 80% power to detect odds ratio of 1.6. If we assume 90% vaccination coverage among controls at 36 months of age and an alpha err or of .05, we will have greater than 90% power to detect an odds ratio of 2.0 and greater th an 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 2.2. Statistical Analyses: We will use conditional logistic regression stratif ied by matched sets to estimate the odds ratios for the association between age at MMR vaccination and autism. In the main analyses, we will include all autism cases. Potential confounding variables will be evaluated i ndividually for their association with the autism case definition. Those with an odds ratio p -value < 0.20 will be included as covariates in a conditional logistic regression model to estimate adjusted odds ratios for the association between age at vaccination and autism. The only va riable available to be assessed as a potential confounder using the entire sample is child's race. For the children born in Georgia for whom we have birth certificate data, several sub-analyse s will be carried out similar to the main analyses to assess the effect of several other pote ntial confounding variables. A recent case- control study (CDC, 2001) carried out with a subset of the autism cases from this study found that age matched cases and controls differed on sev eral important background factors including maternal age, maternal education, birth type, and p arity. The variables that will be assessed as potential confounders in this study will be birth w eight, APGAR scores, gestational age, birth type, parity, maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity , and maternal education. (See Table 2 for how variables will be categorized.) 9 Analysis of Autism subgroups The IOM (2001) specifically recommended additional research regarding autism subgroups and MMR. We will examine several subtypes of autism in this study. Data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program will be included in the sub-analyses to identify particular sub-groups. The following sub-group analyses will b e conducted: 1) Analyses excluding cases with an established cause for autism or a co-occurring condition suggesting an early prenatal etiology (e. g., tuberous sclerosis, fragile X, or other congenital/chromosomal anomalies.) We propose to conduct a case-control sub-analysis l ooking at cases without an established or presumptive cause for autism, such as tuberous scle rosis, fragile X, and other congenital/chromosomal anomalies. The purpose of d oing this analysis is to create a more homogeneous case group that may be more likely to b e impacted by the timing of the MMR vaccine. The objectives from the primary analyses will be replicated in this sub-analysis. 2) Analyses of Isolated versus Non-isolated Autism. Isolated autism cases are cases with no other co-mo rbid developmental disability while non- isolated cases do have a co-morbid developmental di sability. Previous research suggests that the majority of non-isolated cases have a co-existi ng developmental disability of mental retardation (CDC, 2001). Both isolated and non-iso lated cases will be compared separately to controls. The objectives from the primary analys es will be replicated in this sub-analysis. 3) Analyses examining Gender Effects Males are at substantially higher risk for autism a nd may be more vulnerable to the exposure associated with the MMR vaccine. We will analyze ma les and females separately and replicate the main objectives of the primary analys es as well as examine the potential confounders available from Georgia birth certificat es. 4) Analyses excluding autism cases with known onset pr ior to 1 year of age. For a subset of autism cases, we were able to ident ify the timing of parental concern. This sub-analysis will exclude all cases excluded with a n established or presumptive cause for autism (e.g., tuberous sclerosis, fragile X, and ot her congenital/chromosomal anomalies.) and children for whom we have been able to identify fir st parental concern prior to 12 months of age. 10 Study Strengths and Limitations: Strengths: < Population-based study that attempted to ascertain all autism cases in a well-defined geographic area. < Extensive record review of cases to confirm the dia gnosis of autism. < Standardized form for MMR vaccine exposure informat ion that was completed by the child's primary care provider. < Matching with birth certificates allows controlling for several potentially confounding factors such as birth weight, gestational age, mate rnal age, and maternal education. Limitations: < Retrospective study with information on cases restr icted to what is available in various records. < Inherent in this type of record review are errors t hat cannot be rectified through use of an independent data source. Care was taken to record t he information accurately with edits done by the computer programmer, the abstractors, a nd the project coordinator. Several immunization forms contained errors in dates that c ould be reasonably corrected (e.g., transposition of year digits 98 for 89) whereas the others that could not be corrected will be counted as missing data. This will be reflected by the numbers of case/control children with complete information available for an alyses. < Date of onset or first occurrence of autism behavio rs was incompletely recorded. < Incomplete ascertainment of all autism spectrum dis orders, especially Asperger's Syndrome and high functioning autism.
