The \"Guidelines on the Provision of Traditional Chinese Medicine Services in Hospitals and Nursing Homes\" are attached at Annex. - Hospitals and nursing homes must keep the Ministry informed if they intend to set up or provide Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) services within the premises of their institutions. The healthcare institutions must also ensure that the TCM practitioners are appropriately registered with the TCM Practitioners Board. GUIDELINES ON THE PROVISION OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE SERVICES IN HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES (2005) Co-location with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Clinic - A full service TCM clinic (including acupuncture, tuina and herbal medicine services) can be co-located within the premises of hospitals and nursing homes licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics (PHMC) Act. - The TCM clinic will be considered a separate entity and will not come under the purview of the PHMC Act. The healthcare institutions (HCI) should however keep MOH informed of the setting up of the co-located TCM clinic. - The HCI concerned must take steps to ensure that the TCM clinic is clearly projected as a distinct entity (eg. different name) and clearly demarcated from the conventional medical services and is not seen as part of the conventional medical services provided by the HCI. - As TCM is not under the purview of the PHMC Act, the co-located TCM clinic can set its own policy with regards to its referral system and TCM services to be provided. However, the TCM clinic must ensure that its TCM practitioners have the appropriate registration with the TCM Practitioners Board. Provision of Acupuncture Services - Hospitals and nursing homes licensed under the PHMC Act that wish to provide acupuncture services as part of their package of services to their patients can proceed to do so. These services may include appropriate general TCM diagnosis and consultation as part of the acupuncture treatment, but must exclude the use of other TCM treatment modalities. - The acupuncture service could be provided by the HCI's own doctors (who are registered acupuncturists), TCM practitioners employed by the HCI or TCM practitioners of the co-located TCM clinic. The TCM practitioner who is engaged by the HCI to provide acupuncture services must not administer other modalities of TCM to the patient. - HCI that require credentialing of practitioners should require acupuncturists to be credentialed in their respective HCI. - The provision of acupuncture services should be in accordance with the clinical evidence. The use of acupuncture for conditions where evidence of clinical efficacy is lacking should be carried out with full disclosure and documentation, or on a clinical trial basis, subject to the standard scientific and ethical review and approval from the relevant authorities. - The acupuncturistsn-CM practitioners would be allowed to see patients referred by the registered medical practitioner in the outpatient clinics and the wards. - The TCM/acupuncture practitioner is answerable to the TCM Practitioners' Board for his actions. If the acupuncturist is also a registered medical practitioner he would be answerable to the SMC too. Referral for Acupuncture Services - The registered medical practitioner in charge of the patient is responsible to assess whether acupuncture is appropriate for the patient and refers the patient accordingly. The registered medical practitioner in charge must explain to the patient the reasons for recommending acupuncture and ensure proper documentation of the reasons for referral and obtain informed consent. - Inpatients would not be allowed to seek acupuncture treatment on their own accord. Outpatients may on their own accord (i.e without a doctor's referral) choose outpatient TCM treatments at the co-located TCM clinic, in which case they would be considered as any walk-in-patients to the TCM clinic.
