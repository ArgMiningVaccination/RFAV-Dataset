AAT produces rapid, long-term results for the relief of associated allergy symptoms. AAT merges 21st century science with 3,000-year-old traditional acupuncture and modern chiropractic principles to offer an effective alternative to the treatment of symptoms associated with allergies and sensitivities. - Non-invasive - No needles - No herbal remedies - No supplements - No avoidance - Just results! Understanding Allergies and Sensitivities Allergies and sensitivities are caused by an inappropriate reaction to harmless substances. The word \"allergy\" comes from the Greek allos, meaning \"other\". It was first used in 1906 to refer to an \"altered reaction\" in the body's immune system. A \"true allergy\" is a reaction triggered by the immune system, however there are a vast number of symptoms or conditions caused by sensitivities that may or may not involve the immune system. With reactions involving food, a large percentage of the population believes they have allergies, yet fewer than 2% actually have true allergies. In fact, many suffer from undiagnosed food sensitivities or intolerances. The majority of patients who seek the AAT treatment do not have true allergies; their symptoms are likely to be caused by sensitivities with no immune involvement. Since there are few options for the treatment of sensitivities, other than avoidance, AAT provides a highly effective alternative. Symptoms caused by true allergies, however, also respond well to the treatment as the organ systems involved in the reaction are also addressed. The use of the word \"allergy\" has become a generic term used by the public to describe allergies, sensitivities and intolerances. What is AAT? Advanced Allergy Therapeutics (AAT) is a clinically proven treatment that is highly effective in relieving the many symptoms associated with allergies and sensitivities. It is a therapeutic approach that was developed from over 16 years of clinical research. The AAT treatment does not rely on the use of medications, herbal remedies or supplements. The treatment is safe, painless and available to patients of all ages including infants. Advanced Allergy Therapeutics works directly with the relationship between the major organ systems and inappropriate reactions to harmless substances. While the immune system is responsible for initiating an immune reaction in the case of true allergies, it is the health and state of the organ systems that often determines the type of symptoms that may arise. With both sensitivities and allergies, symptoms typically stem from the organ system affected. For example, one patient may have a reaction to soybean by getting rashes while another patient may react with sinus congestion, heartburn or irritable bowel syndrome. The symptoms in each of these cases represent a different organ system involved. By treating the organ system(s) involved in a reaction, the body is able to respond more appropriately. During treatment, gentle pressure is used on points that correspond with the organ systems involved in a reaction. The degree of stress on the organ systems caused by an allergen or offending agent, is proportional to the degree of the negative reaction. While the stimulation is applied, a subtle representation of the offending substance is introduced to the surface of the skin. The stimulation reduces the stress on the affected organ system, allowing for a more appropriate response. All holistic fields of medicine are aligned in the approach to treat the whole body. They share the understanding that health conditions may develop as a result of interference in proper functioning caused by various forms of stress or other factors. Reducing the stress or interference allows for optimal health. When the specific organ system is supported and stress is reduced, the whole body is able to respond more appropriately. - AAT does not diagnose allergies, sensitivities or intolerances. - AAT does not test for allergies or sensitivities. The AAT system simply assesses what may be causing a stress to the body. - AAT does not cure allergies, nor does the therapy treat the immune system. AAT is a highly effective treatment that provides long-term relief from symptoms associated with allergies or sensitivities. - AAT does not treat cases of anaphylaxis or life threatening symptoms. Strict avoidance is always advised in these cases. Symptoms Treated A sensitivity or inappropriate reaction may cause symptoms from any organ system in the body. Some systems are prone to reacting to certain families of allergies or substances, such as the respiratory system reacting to pollen. However, a substance may affect any organ system, which could cause a multitude of allergy symptoms varying from case to case. For example, a reaction to wheat may cause hives in one person, digestive issues in another, fatigue, wheezing or acid reflux all in different patients. AAT addresses the specific organ systems affected by the allergen or offending substance. Digestive System Respiratory System Symptoms include sneezing, congestion, runny nose, wheezing, and shortness of breath, coughs, postnasal drip, skin conditions, rashes and itchy, watery eyes. Reactions may be associated with pollens, dust, food allergy, chemicals and animals (including dog and cat dander and bird feathers), airborne substances and contactants. Dermatological Symptoms may include red, itchy, or scaly skin rashes, blisters with oozing and crusting, dry leathery patches or hives. The main cause of dermatological reactions can be a reaction to food but can also be caused by plants, contactants and chemicals. Headaches and Migraines May be caused by reactions to food such as chocolate and caffeine, airborne irritants such as pollen and chemicals including household cleaners, perfumes and vehicle fumes. Tiredness and Fatigue Many reactions result in lethargy and feelings of fatigue. Tiredness can also occur at certain times of the day, such as in the afternoon after eating. Multiple Systems Symptoms may affect multiple systems in the body, resulting in headaches, irritability, hyperactivity, mood swings, fatigue, tachycardia, or inflammation. General - Chemicals - household cleaners, perfumes, building materials, washing detergent, pesticides - Occupational sensitivities such as latex or building materials such as paints, glues, carpets, woods or varnishes - Animals - Heat, cold and humidity/dampness Symptoms associated with an allergy or sensitivity can contribute to common conditions such as: asthma, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, not all cases involve allergies or sensitivities. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is primarily caused by sensitivities and affects approximately 15% of the population. Common symptoms include diarrhea, constipation, and bloating and abdominal pain. Skin conditions, such as eczema, dermatitis and hives are commonly associated with the symptoms of an allergy or sensitivity. PLEASE BE ADVISED AAT cannot guarantee any results. While AAT may be highly effective in the relief of many symptoms associated with allergies or sensitivities, some cases do not respond. AAT does not treat cases of anaphylaxis or life threatening symptoms. Strict avoidance is always advised. Common Allergens or Offending Agents - Contactants - Inhalants - Ingestants - Shell Fish - Red and White Wine, Beer - Chemicals, Latex - Fruit - Food Components - Perfumes - Berries - Airborne Irritants - Herbal Remedies - Eggs - Dust, Dust Mites - Nutritional Supplements - Nightshades - Seasonal Allergies - Environmental - Grains - Animal Dander - Woods, Metals - Dairy - Fabrics, Upholstery, Plastics - Stinging Insects - Coffee and Chocolate - Detergents, Softeners - Sunlight - Barometric Pressure FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Many cases respond quickly to the treatment and achieve long-term results within the first few treatments. However, each case is different and some patients require additional treatment. Bloating, cramping, reflux, heartburn, gas, diarrhea, nausea, runny nose, sneezing, congestion, post-nasal drip, itchy watery eyes, coughs, wheezing, shortness of breath, red, scaly or itchy rashes, blisters with oozing and crusting, dry leathery skin areas, hives, itchy skin, hyperactivity, mood swings, headaches, fatigue, tiredness, chemical sensitivities, reactions to the sun, any negative reaction to harmless substances. The number of sessions required depends on the number of items causing a reaction. For example, a patient who reacts to five families of substances (dairy, wheat, corn, animal dander and pollen) may require between five to 12 sessions to relieve the allergy symptoms or resolve a condition. No. All ages may be treated, including infants. [How long do I have to wait before I can have contact with the items that were addressed in my session?] Following a session, a patient should avoid the substance that was treated for two hours, if possible. Depending on the item addressed, avoidance is not always possible. It is recommended that the patient not have excessive contact with the item until the following day. Yes. Two treatments can be completed in one day. However, there must be at least two hours between sessions. The Initial Session takes approximately 30 minutes and includes an assessment and one treatment. Follow-Up Sessions take 15 minutes and include one treatment. - Please do not smoke or wear perfume or fragrances prior to coming into the clinic. This is a courtesy to other patients who may be sensitive to those substances. - Please bring any allergy tests from medical doctors to the initial session. - Prescription or over-the-counter medications will not affect the treatment. - Patients who have other therapies (massage, chiropractic, acupuncture, etc.) scheduled on the same day as the AAT treatment should schedule those therapies PRIOR to the AAT treatment, if possible. - If experiencing an acute stage of illness including an elevated temperature, the patient should contact the clinic to reschedule the appointment. The Alliance Integrative Medicine DOES NOT treat anaphylaxis or any life threatening symptoms. Strict avoidance is always advised. No, patients do not need to stop taking medication that has been prescribed by a medical doctor without his/her authorization. You may continue taking over the counter medication to control current symptoms, as this will not affect the treatment. Are any traditional medical allergy tests offered in the clinic? We do not offer any conventional allergy testing. Patients are encouraged to bring in allergy tests from their physicians. Unfortunately, we can offer no guarantees; however, the majority of our patients respond favorably to the AAT treatment on a long-term basis. We cannot guarantee that new symptoms will not develop in the future. All practitioners at Alliance Integrative Medicine are fully credentialed health care practitioners. No. Food intolerance is different from an allergy or sensitivity in that there may be an enzyme deficiency, which inhibits the body from properly digesting the substance. Such cases are not affected by the treatment. No. We do not treat conditions involving anaphylactic reactions. However, patients with an anaphylactic reaction may be treated for other sensitivities that are not life threatening.
