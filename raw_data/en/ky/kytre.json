While [the definition of self-care varies](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/self-care-ideas-rituals), the purpose is easy to define. And [Lisa Marie Basile](https://www.lisambasile.com/), creator of [Luna Luna Magazine](http://www.lunalunamagazine.com/)and author of the upcoming [Light Magic for Dark Times](http://www.lunalunamagazine.com/light-magic-for-dark-times/), encapsulates it beautifully. \"I think of self-care as the little things we do to nourish or sustain our mental and physical health,\" she tells Refinery29. \"Being mindful about making a little time each day to destress and focus on self-development is so important on a physiological level. But it can also help us connect with our intuition, dreams, and goals.\" AdvertisementADVERTISEMENT Basile adds that, while relaxation is a valuable part of any self-care practice, regeneration, where we take steps to feel restored and determine where to direct our newfound energy, should actually be our goal. \"Regenerative practices are all about shaking off the darkness and making new, amazing things happen \u2014 especially during times when you feel you've been kept down or silenced,\" Basile says. An entire chapter of Basile's book is dedicated to regenerative self-care rituals detailing practices that anyone can adopt in order to restore their confidence, motivation, or sensuality. But, Basile is quick to add, the guidelines of each ritual are merely that \u2014 not hard and fast rules. As long as your intention is clear, that's what matters: \"Ritualized self-care is like a secret little tool we always have, even when everything else feels stripped away,\" she explains. Ahead, check out a selection from Basile's chapter of regenerating and recharging rituals from Light Magic for Dark Times, available for purchase tomorrow. 1 of 6 A New Moon Ritual for Kicking a Creative Block If you've ever hit a wall creatively, you know the sting of a blank page staring back. Unwritten work, unfinished paintings. Your heart feels like a blank canvas begging for color, but it remains undone. Unfulfilled creative urges can weigh heavily, which is why this practice allows you to get those creative energies flowing. Begin this ritual on the day of the new moon. It will last five days. Materials Tarot deck Pen Journal White candle At the end of each night, pull one tarot card. Look at its corresponding meaning and journal about how the selected card might associate with your work. You can focus on the imagery and write down ideas that inspire you, or you can focus on the card's story and how it meshes with your own as an artist. You can also journal about how the lesson in the card corresponds to your piece of art. Be creative. Make lists of ideas; allow for stream of conscious. What do you feel? What do you think? Nothing is irrelevant. When you move through all the junk, you might find gold. As a creator, you must sow the seeds to reap the garden. At the end of the fifth night, display your tarot cards: Make an altar or simply prop them up on your desk. Light a white candle and say: I am creative. I am generative. I am prolific. I have planted a garden of ideas and it blossoms bright. If you've ever hit a wall creatively, you know the sting of a blank page staring back. Unwritten work, unfinished paintings.

You feel like a wilted flower, passed over. This ritual will get you thinking about why you're absolutely magical, so you can start feeling like yourself again. Materials 7 small candles, each in a different color to represent the different days of the week. A container, like an empty coffee can or a large sachet bag Do this ritual over seven days. Select seven colored candles, one for each day of the ritual. The colors should correspond to an element of your personality that you love and want to celebrate. For example, a red candle might symbolize your fiery passion, while a light-blue candle might represent your ability to go with the flow, like water. At either the end or the beginning of the day, light one candle. Envision how that color represents an element of who you are. Think about why that element is so powerful, so lovable. Envision your body emanating with that quality. Bask in it. As you concentrate each day, say: I am ___ and this is enough. Fill in the blank with whatever word or phrase you've chosen for that day. It might be something like \"trying\" or \"alive.\" Burn each candle for as long as you can each day. At the end of each day, place your candle in your container. Sleep with it near your pillow. On the seventh day, charge your container under the moon's light. Then it will always be a symbol for why you're so amazing.

For any time you feel like you want to get back in touch with the Scorpio in you (Scorps are ruled by Pluto, and all the super chthonic things, like death and sexuality), this pick-me-up ritual involving the archetypes of the Egyptian god Bes (god of music and sexual pleasure, and, awesomely, helping birth babies) and goddess Bastet (goddess of perfume and protection and, amazingly, cats) will get you moving and feeling divine.

I celebrate and honor my body and its sacred sensuality. Put on your music and dance. Go wild. Think about the way your body moves and feels as you dance.

In fact, many witches would say that resistance is part and parcel of an ethical craft. Using your privilege, be it your platform, your voice, or your vote, is a form of magic. However, social activism and protest can be emotionally and physically draining. In this spell, you'll be able to recalibrate and focus on recharging your energies after acts of protest and resistance, or even simply engaging with trolls on the Internet. Materials A bowl of lukewarm water Your favorite essential oil To your bowl with lukewarm water, add a few drops of your favorite essential oil. (Lavender is great for tranquility, while rose is good for love.) Place one palm up, facing the sky, and place one palm over the water, facing down. With the face-up palm, begin to envision the universe's energy coming into you. Feel it charging through you as a pure, white light. Say: I ask for the energy to stay active, healthy, and efficient. I ask to be replenished. I am a tower of strength and power. Imagine that energy moving through you toward your other palm. Pour that white light into the water. When you feel you've sufficiently charged the water, wash your hands in it, rubbing them carefully together, making it a point to care for your body. Enjoy this moment for yourself, and repeat whenever you need to recharge your energies lost to resistance work.

In this spell, you will break down barriers to new friendships \u2014 leaving you open to beautiful, magical, mutually respectful new relationships. Materials White candle Pen A small piece of paper An envelope During the new moon \u2014 when manifestation practices are strongest \u2014 take a moment before bed to perform this spell.

Think about what you can offer your friends, too \u2014 maybe you're loyal, optimistic, and radically vulnerable \u2014 and the qualities you possess that you'd like others to appreciate. On your piece of paper, write down this statement: The new moon has brought a gift. A friend, a light, a come-true dream, a friendship as wild and as beautiful as the sky. Say this statement aloud, as well. Pour a bit of the wax onto the paper, fold it, and put it into the envelope. Carry the envelope with you throughout the day.
