They can also feature tailored content regarding exercise, healthy living, and nutrition, or more specific topics based on a client's requirements. In addition to social media posts, ChiroPosts' suite of services also encompasses \"Google My Business\" optimization. A properly developed \"Google My Business\" listing can make a chiropractor easier to find online, which can lead to more patients coming into a given office. According to a Harris Poll that surveyed over 1,200 Americans, 55% of consumers find out about new brands on social media. These figures reveal that having a regular social media presence is imperative for businesses attempting to grow their client base. ChiroPosts also creates monthly, branded newsletters and sends them to patients on chiropractors' behalf.

Chiropractors who decide to take advantage of ChiroPosts' service will now have their set-up fee that it used to charge waived. New clients will also benefit from one month of service at no charge. Amidst these advantages, ChiroPosts will still maintain its monthly billing and no-contract service terms.
