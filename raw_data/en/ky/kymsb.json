You may have an idea of certain vitamins and supplements you should take, such as a multivitamin of sorts, but do you know which supplements Chiropractors like to recommend on a daily basis? Chiropractor Recommended Supplements: Multivitamin You want a good quality multivitamin. A power packed multivitamin would include essential vitamins and minerals (Vit A, Vit C, Vit E, Magnesium, Calcium, Vit B1, 2, 6, & 12) and phytonutrients. A good quality requires at least 2 capsules or tablets per day. You would want your multivitamin (or any vitamin for that matter) to be NSF and cGMP certified. Omega 3s Natural anti-inflammatory, aka fish oil. These are not included in most multivitamins. You should not exceed 2 grams of dietary supplements of omega 3. Probiotics Supports and maintains a healthy balance of good bacteria in your gut. This supports both digestive and immune health. What supplements should you take for joints and bones? Joints - Glucosamine and Chondroitin (usually not located in your multivitamin selections) - MSM has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and is good in conjunction with glucosamine and chondroitin - Vitamin C: ease pain, reduce inflammation, and protect against cartilage damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). - Turmeric: pain, swelling, tenderness, and joint mobility. Turmeric may work better combined with glucosamine. Bone - Cal Mag D: Helps build strong bones with calcium, magnesium and vitamin D. - Vitamin D: Helps calcium absorption for strong bones.

I am a Chiropractor in the New Orleans area and I have a passion for helping others in any way that I can. My goal is to help you get back to doing what you love, whether its through adjustments or supplement support. I am a mom of two little boys, married for 7 years to a wonderful husband, and mommy to two fur babies. I own two businesses and am the athletic chiropractor for Tulane University. Why supplements? I have learned through my athletic, academic, and professional life, not to mention the mom life, that exercise and fitness wasn't enough. I was missing something and I found that missing puzzle piece in supplements. They help fuel me, fill in my missing pieces, fit into my busy and crazy lifestyle, and keep me going for all the roles I have on a day to day basis. Supplements scared me for the longest time because there were too many options, but through my education and experiences, I was able to create a system that worked best for me. Now, my goal is to share that with others, which is why I created a nutritional supplement counseling program (in person and virtually). This allows you to be able to focus on what matters most to you and leave the planning and thinking to me. I would love to help you meet all of "}
