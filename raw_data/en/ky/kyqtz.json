Toxicol Rep ; 7: 1448-1458, reaction to [viral infection](for COVID-19, SARS, and [influenza]alike). There are four major approaches being employed or considered presently to augment or strengthen the [immune system], in order to reduce [adverse effects]of viral exposure. The three approaches that are focused mainly on augmenting the [immune system]are based on the concept that [pandemics]/ [outbreaks]can be controlled/prevented while maintaining the immune-degrading [lifestyles]followed by much of the global [population]. The fourth approach is based on identifying and introducing [measures]aimed at strengthening the [immune system]intrinsically in order to minimize [future] [pandemics]/ [outbreaks]. Specifically, the four [measures]are 1) restricting [virus]; 2) providing reactive/tactical [treatments]to reduce [viral load]; 3) developing [vaccines]to prevent, or least attenuate, the [infection]; 4) strengthening the [immune system]intrinsically, by a) identifying those factors that contribute to degrading the [immune system], then eliminating/reducing them as comprehensively, thoroughly, and rapidly as possible, and b) replacing the eliminated factors with immune-strengthening factors. This [paper]focuses on [vaccine] [safety]. A [future] at the national/international level. [Vaccine development]has been accelerated to achieve this [goal]in the relatively near-term, and questions have arisen whether [vaccine] [safety]has been/is being/ compromised in pursuit of a shortened [vaccine development] [time]. There are myriad mechanisms related to [vaccine]-induced, natural [infection]-induced, [infections]that could adversely impact [vaccine "}
