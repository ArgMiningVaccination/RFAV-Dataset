Thankfully, Maryland has seemed to find its distribution footing as more vaccines have become more available across the country. To date, Maryland has vaccinated over 2 million people and continues to vaccinate over 43,000 people per day. Over the next month all of those in Phase 2 will be eligible for vaccination and as of April 27th, Maryland will enter Phase 3 which means all people over the age of 16 are eligible for vaccination. Check out the Maryland's [Vaccine](https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/pages/vaccine) webpage to pre-register at a mass vaccination site or to find a vaccination site near you. So you've found an appointment and you're wondering how to prepare and what to expect? Before you go: - Though severe allergic reactions are super rare (2-4 people/million per the U.S Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), talk to your doctor if you have a history of allergic reactions to vaccinations. - Plan enough time for your appointment. Even though you have a scheduled appointment time, it's possible there will be a wait to receive your vaccine. Even if there's no wait time there is a mandatory 15 minute onsite waiting period after you've received the vaccine to monitor you for an adverse reaction. - Wear something loose fitting that allows for easy access to your upper arm. It just makes the process that much easier for everyone! - Consider an acupuncture treatment before your vaccine to calm any nerves you have about getting the vaccine and to harmonize the Ying Qi - Wei Qi relationship. Ying Qi (or Nutritive Qi) supports the Wei Qi (or Warrior Qi) which ultimately helps our bodies assimilate the vaccine. - Don't take anti-inflammatory medication prior to your vaccine. Our immune system responds through controlled inflammation, therefore it's possible to have a reduced immune response to vaccination if you take pain relievers prior to your shot. During your appointment: - Deep breaths! It can feel a little unsettling to be around so many people if you've been mostly sticking to home, the grocery store and outdoor walks. - No pain! Truly, it doesn't hurt. - A big thank you to the medical personnel administering vaccinations goes a long way many of whom have not yet been able to receive their vaccinations. After: - Side effects = good news, your body is mounting an immune response! Most people report the onset of side effects 18-24 hours after vaccination and worse side effects are reported with the second, booster shot vaccination. Talk to your doctor before using acetaminophen and ibuprofen to manage pain and discomfort after vaccination. - Most common side effects are: sore arm (super sore in my case), headache, low grade fever, chills and body aches. - Within hours of vaccination your immune system is working hard: T-Cells (cytokines and interleukins) are working hard to respond to the mRNA spike protein found in the vaccine while the B-cells begin to create antibodies. This is often experienced as achiness, fatigue, fever or that \"coming down with something\" feeling. Ultimately the immune system creates T-memory cells and antibodies so that if we're exposed to the coronavirus again, our body knows exactly what to do. Note: it takes 10-14 days after the second dose to achieve full immunity. - Since vaccines are engineered to create inflammation, treating your body to some good old R&R can help you get back to feeling better in no time. Consider an epsom salt bath to relieve discomfort at the vaccination site. Consider a day off of work if you can. Order in some healthy eats or meal prep some easy to digest meals. Hydrate. Binge that Netflix show. Read the novel on your bedside table or simply sleep. - If you're feeling well enough after the first day, schedule acupuncture to continue supporting the body's immune system via the Ying Wei - Wei qi relationship. Thank you! Getting vaccinated not only protects you, but it reduces strain on the health care system and helps us all get closer to a new normal in the post-covid world.
