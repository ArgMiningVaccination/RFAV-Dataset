This is not only unconstitutional, but is against the Nuremberg code and is extremely discriminatory! As an alumni of this great university I speak very highly of my time at this schoo l , ho wever I will not be able to share those praises with others and will encourage others to find another school if this is the route you are going to take with regards to medical freedom. As a wife of someone with a seizure disorder who cannot get this vacci ne and has been advised by the makers of these vaccines as well as numerous medical professionals to refrain from getting this, I would be disgusted if he could not attend college simply because of something that he has no control over and because you are decidi ng to pr omote medical tyranny instead of medical freedom and limit those who simply cannot receive this vaccine and there are many other reasons (allergies, immune disorders, anaphylaxis)! I also myself have passed out from vaccinations before and have been advised to hold off on these shots as well. I encourage ALL of you to re search the Nuremberg Code as well as laws surrounding the demanding and mandating of medical products; in particular 21 US code 360bbb3 stating that \"NO EMERGENCY AUTHORIZED MEDICAL PRODUCT CAN BE MANDATED\"! e 1 Aii III \"the option to accept or REFUSE administra on of the product\" .I also encourage you to look at the sites of these companies that state very clearly that NONE of these vaccines are FDA approved. Look at the site on adverse reactions of vaccines and in particular the makers of these and see how many have died and had horrible life altering reactions and this site is estimated to only have 10% reported! College students are not at risk whatsoever from this virus and they have an effective way to combat this virus without a vaccine in the event they contract it. The medicines have been prov en effective and with no risks (Hydroxychloroquine As well as ivermectin, budecinide among others ) which means there is NO reason to require or even get a vaccine that isn't through trials until 2024! Please know this is unacceptable and upsetting that ANY college campus would require this to attend and especia lly kn owing how many have had horrible reactions and died from an unapproved product ! I am saddened to hear this and hope you all reconsider this immediately. Please understand there are many who CANNOT get this shot and it isn't because they are choosing not to , it is a risk to their health as well, other religions do no t believe in vaccines for various reasons too. Make the right choice and do the right thing! You can be the change , you can make a difference. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 1 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I have two kids that probably will not go back to UNM if you enforce a vaccine mandate. Looking at where the rates are for NM you can see that it's not necessary, 7 day average cases are close to 1 in 100,000 and that the state is going to be fully openi ng July 1s t. There should be provisions for those who decide to not get the vaccine especially in light of the recently reported cases of myocarditis in young people who receive the vaccine. Wearing a mask on campus or regular testing even could be offered if online classes cannot be made available.Ge ng vaccinated is a personal choice, it says this on the CDC website, please respect the students choices for their bodies and do not impose your will on them. Thank you. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I am appalled that the University would require mandatory vaccinations for students and staff. An individuals right to choose what is best for their body, religion, or ethics should not be dictated by a public university. COVID19 cases are at such a low percentage as to make the requirement of mandatory vacc inations unnecessary. The polics of vaccinaons must not overrule a persons right to choose what is best for them and their body. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Discrimination,you don't have the right to choose for anybody, I attended umm in 1976. Rethink your draconian policies and stop with your political BS. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Hello.. I'm a Lobo supporter and UNM Anderson School MBA Alumni (2002). I wanted to voice my strong opposition to the University of New Mexico requiring the Covid vaccination for its students and staff. I disagree with forcing students and staff to be vaccinated to enroll and attend in person classes, or to be a pa rt of the University staff and family. Individuals may have many different reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated, including personal preference, health, religious, and many others. Whether someone desires to be vaccinated should be a personal and private decision. That decision should be made with consultati on wi th a person's doctor, and should be made by an individual privately. That decision to be vaccinated or not, cannot be one that results in punitive and life changing impacts on students and their families. There are many additional arguments that can be made regarding a person's choice in this matter, but suff ice to say, we live in a country based on personal freedom, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. UNM should do the right thing and lead in in this area by allowing people the freedom to make this decision personally and privately without repe rcussion and impa ct on their ability to gain a meaningful education and work opportunity Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 2 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I was not aware that the university has so many physicians that they are able to assign a doctor to each and every student, so they are able to offer personal medical advice to each student... Or does the university have that many attorneys that they welcome all of the law suits that will follow? Last time I checked what a person decides to do medically to their body is between a patient and their doctor... if the university proceeds with this overreaching quest for control and unwarranted power, I will never donate money again and I will discoura ge any al umni to offer any support to the university ever again. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Dear Provost and Execuve Vice President,As a concerned citizen of NM and Alumni of UNM Taos, I am asking that you not create a mandatory COVID19 vaccination requirement for all staff and students.Why?* This is NOT, by denion, a vaccine at all, but an experimental gene therapy. Let us not forget about the Nuremberg Code.* Mandatory injec on of a gene therapy is discriminatory and UNLAWFUL!* Everyone has the right to make their own medical decisions.* Everyone has the right to informed consent.* This policy would lead me to disenroll, or rule out UNM as a school for myself, as well as to anyone I could advise. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Good Aernoon, I am wring to urge you not to pass the proposed policy to require all Students, Staff, and Faculty to have the COVID vaccination at UNM facilities. Many people are uncomfortable with or do not need these shots and requiring them will create a discriminatory, twotiered environment around UNM. Ma ny families will choose not to send their students there, including mine. My daughter graduated from an Albuquerque high school this year and was accepted to go to UNM, but we will be sure to send her to a college which is not asking for these shots instead. There is no compelling medical reason for her to get them, and they are not proven to be safe or effective yet. This is a pers onal decision that families should be left to make without undue pressure or threats from outside sources, including having your right to a local educaon revoked. As an Alumni, I am disturbed that my Alma Mater is considering a policy which would have precluded me from attending. Please do not adopt this policy, and keep UNM available to all Students and Faculty who would like to attend it's beautiful campus. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 3 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceReligious Accommodation To Whom it May Concern,As a lifelong cizen of Northern NM, a lifelong NM taxpayer and NM business owner, a parent, an aluma of UNM, and one dedicated to preserving all citizens' rights as granted by the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights, I must lodge my formal complaint and voice in sha rp contrast to the proposed mandated \"vaccine\" for any and all returning or joining students this upcoming Fall. This objection also applies to all faculty, staff, and personnel of UNM that may shortly be subject to this unjust policy and atrocity. As a State Funded school, founded in 1989 and incorporated in 1900 to represent the citizens of The Territory of New Mexico and then later our State of New Mexico, I expect more from you and your organization Based on a longstanding tradition of serving our diverse population base, I cannot fathom yo ur proposed draft as outlined here: https://bringbackthepack.unm.edu/vaccine/vaccine requirement.html?fbclid=IwAR24KOPVfo77ublPIMKK1VctgPVUniJO IA62YubwPqV61nve_v50sXzVDvE. If I do not and you do not hold yourselves to a higher bar, who then will?! Should you truly wish to \"Bring Back the Pack\" (of Lobos that we are), you would welcome back the rich cultural and religious diversity New Mexico was founded upon and stands for! We all know that as a stat e that consistently has one of the most paltry and substandard education system in our nation, we need University of New Mexico to be the pioneer in changing that fact and reality. As a nonprofit institution given powers by our Secretary of State and the laws of this sta te, your primary duty is to serve the citizens of our state and provide educational opportunities to your students, both traditional and nontraditional in all routes of degree certification, regardless of religion or creed, disability or medical choice. To comply with the myriad of rights of these individuals and al l citizens of this state, I encourage you to reconsider this proposed policy on the following grounds:Under the US Constuon, the 1st amendment protects me and allows for freedom of religion. Further, as of 1925, the Supreme Court of the US demands that the State of NM afford those very same rights to me, under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendme nt to the Constitution. Any vaccination or rather, experimental gene therapy, particularly that has not been duly tested or proven to be effective and/or safe, is against my religion and therefore would preclude me from obtaining further education through UNM. Likewise, for those reason I will certainly never send my daughter to UNM or rec ommend it to any of my other community members for themselves or their children. As one of the 12 protected classes under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and federal antidiscrimination laws, it is imperative that my freedom of religion and creed take precedent over any medi cal tyra nny or mandate handed down by those with dubious agendas, as it is my choice alone regarding the health of my body and how I live my life in accordance with my own religion and creed, both. Addionally, the Establishment Clause negates the government or any government institution from establishing any national or state religion or funding or giving preference to any one religion. Should you choose to implement Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 4 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment your proposed draft and mandatory \"vaccine\", you will be supporting and serving and giving preference to only those who have certain religious beliefs!The Free Exercise Clause gives all Americans the right to practice their religion freely, without interference or persecution by the government, and I remind you as a nonprofit corporation, you ultimately are held to ethical and legal standards consistent with any other government entity. This clause does NOT say if we choo s e to exercise our unique religion, we will be denied services, human rights, civil rights and fear prosecuon and persecuon!Your 4000 word maximum does not allow me to fully express objections Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentI earned a BA as well as a Master's degree at UNM and am a lifelong Albuquerque resident.If UNM adopts a policy to require the COVID injection, I will not send my senior high student to UNM as an incoming freshman 2021. Even though she has received scholarships from UNM, we will not enroll her at UNM if there is a requirement to have the COVID injecon. The \"vaccine\" is not FDA approved and is only allowed now to be given to people because of the emergency powers. People getting this injection are the clinical trial. There are many serious and even fatal reactions to this injecon among healthy individuals. It is therefore illegal and unconscionable for anyone to require another to take this injecon. I refer you to Leigh Dundas, Human Rights Aorney to review her body of work concerning the COVID injections. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentI do not like the idea of a mandatory vaccination policy for students. There is too great of a number of students that either worry about the potential long term effects of a vaccine or or will not take it due to their beliefs in religion and faith. Seeing the overall trend here in New Mexico, many students will already be vaccinated by time August 2021 comes. With a significant amount that are willing to receive a vaccine already should help keep COVID19 form spreading. The constant reminder to wash hands and keep personal hygiene a top priority will help as well. As a former student, UNM has struggled with enrollment over the past 5 years. With this potential proposal, this could further limit enrollment, which is the opposite of the long term goals for leadership. Strongly recommend a vaccine but do not require it. It will not attract new students that UNM wants to bring to begin their academic career or continue it. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentAs a UNM graduate I am deeply appalled by the discrimination that is being presented with mandatory vaccinaons. I was planning on entering the Fine Arts Master's Program in the near future however, I do not consent to this discrimination against healthy individuals, and I will not comply. Everybody has the right to make their own medical choices. I ask that you take the me to listen to those who are for bodily autonomy and against mandated pharmaceu cals. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 5 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetySo if someone gets an adverse reaction, dies, or has long term side effects from this experimental vaccine, who do they sue? Can they sue the university? Because, as all of you know, pharmaceutical companies are exempt from any and all liability for any vaccine injuries or death (the government in demnifies these big pharmaceutical companies from all liability). Does the university not trust the so called 90% efficacy rate of this vaccine to require others who do not want it to take it (because you have a 99% chance of surviving this virus and don't want to risk vaccine injury from corpo rations who are know as criminal entities (i.e. Pfizer who has been nailed for criminal and civil penalties totaling 3 billion dollars).This is medical discrimina on at its nest. If this institution is so liberal in its views, can't it just require those who do not want this garbage vaccine to just submit to the PCR/rapid angen response test. Yes I know UNM can say...well if you don't want the vaccine, that is your choice and go find another job or go to another institution to finish your degree. However, there are individuals who need a job or need that degree who don't like being put into a vile corner. These people have families to feed or paid thousands of dollars to attend your university and now you tell them to submit to the vaccine or else hit the road toad.This is so shameful that this nation, New Mexico, and this university has come to this...trusting an experimental vaccine from corrupt companies who have knowingly lied to the masses. What happened to my body...my choice? Oh wait...this isn't the United Stat es of America anymore...its now the Nazi States of America where we have to show our papers to do anything anymore.Oh yes...and if this vaccine is so good, then why are people contracting the virus even after receiving both doses. If it is so good..then why are you afraid of having another outbreak with the minority of the population who choose not to be vacci nated? If it is so good...why is the occupant in the State of New Mexico's office of the governor still requiring you to wear a mask. If this is vaccine is so good then why are there so many side effects that being reported on the Vaccine Adverse Event Repor ting Sys tem (blood clots, death, allergic reactions, rashes, termination of pregnancies, menses irregularities, paralysis, brain injuries, and death. If this vaccine is so good then why are the vaccinated carriers of the virus. If this vaccine is so good then why does the government provide blanket immunity from all liabilitie s from va ccine injury and death (Yes Reagan passed this indemnity law back in 1980's).I smell violation of our constitutional rights and violation of the Nuremberg Code.So back to my original queson, will UNM pony up to any student/employee who is injured or dies from this vaccine? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 6 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth As a former UNM student, I'm deeply disappointed by the University's decision to intend to require all students to be vaccinated.Requiring a student to take a vaccine that is only authorized for use under the EUA and not FDA approval is reckless and dangerous to the community. According to the CDC, it is unclear if the virus can shed to others AND you may still transmit the virus EVEN with the vaccine. The vacc ine only reduces mortality and NOT transmission. Furthermore, the mortality rate for your average age of student is amongst the lowest in all categories. Please also consider those who CANNOT recieve the vaccine due to underlining health issues. This is discrimination and forcing otherwise healthy and young individuals who aren't at risk (for a virus with about a 97.7% survival rate) is also discrimination. New Mexico's mortality rate is .2! This segregated those who feel they at unable to join becau se religious beliefs and medical condions prevenon the vaccinaon. UNM needs take personal responsibility for providing a safe and clean environment by hiring more janitors and cleaning professionals to maintain a clean campus. That includes replacing old air filters, addressing poor plumbing issues, cleaning high touch areas, carpet care and obtaining safe serve certifications for any food services. UNM has not been very good in the area for the past few years as explained in student feedback forms.If in fact UNM will require students to get vaccinated, my 20212022 college freshman will seek education elsewhere outside the state. She will not be forced to take an experimental vaccine where the vaccine manufacturer and the University of New Mexico do not hold any liability in the even t of a reaction, health issue or death. This will continue to drop the states education statistics and with more students leaving hurting the economics of the state as well as the university. Please reconsider your decision. The University has no legal right to make medical decisions for their students. They are not a privately funded school and should not hold students to their ideas of medical intervention, you'd never ask students for vasectomies to help stop the spread of STD'S, which is what you are asking to do with the vaccinations. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 7 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;It is currently unlawful to mandate any Emergency Use Authorization product, but even once \"approved\", it is absolutely unconstitutional. Each and every individual has a right to freedom of choice over his/her own body, period. The FACT that there are SO many reasons to NOT mandate this, makes it difficu lt to priorit ize and fathom how this could even be a proposal. Any thinking (not even critically thinking) person MUST question the egregious conflicts of interest with pharmaceutical companies paying universities (and everyone else who has the authority to push such mandates, including the CDC, FDA, WHO); MUST question manufacturers having zero li ability; MUST question the largest number of hospitalizations and deaths reported in the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in just a few months than all adverse events with all vaccines combined since the system originated; MUST question the absurdity of mandating a product for the majority of a group with a survival ra te of 99.9%; MUST question that every prior corona virus vaccine attempt FAILED with horrific consequences, most consequences of which are not yet known with current vaccines because the trials are nowhere near complete; MUST question the push for mandate when NONE of the vaccines claim or prove to stop transmis sion or infection; MUST question why the CDC keeps changing definitions and terms of how covid deaths are reported, PCR cycle numbers for testing, how herd immunity is defined, and now how vaccinated people with \"breakthrough\" cases (i.e., got covid at least 2wks after receiving dose(s) of vacc ine) are counted: Unvaccinated all cases \"count\", Vaccinated only those who are hospitalized or die; MUST question the censorship of ALL information that may lead to vaccine \"hesitancy\" despite being factual data, which is by definition, providing Informed Consent. All of this information is FACTUAL, with references, most of which may be found on the CDC website itself. STOP the nonsense and HARM by even considering such a violation of the Constitution, ethics, and humanity itself. THINK. YOU are and will be held accountable for your actions. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI feel that the vaccine, being an experimental alternative should not be required for admittance to the University. Because the vaccine is a choice that it should not be required to attend. Who are we to demand that people take a drug? We would be taking away the person's choice for thei r own body and health. We could be denying them an education. That is not our right to take away others rights. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 8 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI am so grateful that I graduated before UNM became a bastion of fascism. Open minds, research, and freedom are cornerstones of a good university. This is not the case at UNM. This vaccine is only approved for emergency use. Thus far I know over 100 people who got covid with no prob lems, but i know people who now have bells palsy and who have miscarried normal pregnancies after getting the experimental vaccine. UNM is practicing a dangerous policy and is stepping the line over bodily autonomy and health privacy.I have a child that will be aending college next year and now UNM is NOT on our list of schools due to this draconian and seriously misguided policy. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyAs a former UNM student, I'm deeply upset by the University's decision to intend to require all students to be vaccinated.

Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 10 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyWhen the pandemic began my son who is a sophomore in college took a leave of absence from CU Denver to be closer to home and he decided he would like to stay in New Mexico so we were preparing to apply for admission to UNM. My son has mulple health concerns including a Thyroid autoimmune issue. Given the limited scientific data on administering the vaccines to those with conditions such as my sons we have decided as a family that it is not medical decision that is feasible for him at this time until more is kn own about how the mRNA vaccines will interact with his immune system. Addionally, given the fact it is not fully FDA approved and only EUA we believe it is medical discrimination to require those who are enrolling into universities to be vaccinated with the COVID19 vaccine seeing as to how not even the US military is requiring it of our troops. There are now alternave therapies to decrease the severity of COVID19 cases and we believe it should be left to individual choice to decide which medical treatments are appropriate for our families. If UNM does in fact mandate that all students be vaccinated with the COVID19 vaccine we will have no choice but to look elsewhere for educaonal instuons for my son to nish out his degree. Our family urges the UNM policy makers and staff to reconsider making vaccines mandatory and instead leave it up to the individuals to decide.Thank you for your me and considera on. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyThis is outrageous that you would try to make someone take an experimental gene treatment shot just to attend the university. This goes against all our values as human beings. You cannot force someone to undergo medical treatment without their consent. This goes back to the Nuremberg Code from the Geneva convenon in WWII. I am a graduate of UNM and this would be an absolute no go for me if I was attending. New Mexico is already bottom of the list in education, no you are pushing even more away from our state. Florida is a wonderful example of freedom. Something the le has forgoen about PANDEMIC OR NOT (NOT) THERE'S NEVER A REASON TO SUSPEND OUR GOD GIVEN CIVIL RIGHTS. YOU CANNOT FORCE A MASK ON MEYOU CANNOT FORCE AN EXPERIMENT SHOT ON MEWhen will we admit we've been conned? CDC and John Hopkins University both show no big change in US yearly death counts from 20192020. The death numbers are wrong, but for some reason you feel the need to virtue signal and going along with the lies by FORC ING the stud ents to do something that could very well harm their body. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 11 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI have read the Proposed Policy on Mandatory Vaccinations for the University of New Mexico, and it approving such a proposal will have serious consequences for UNM.The \"vaccines\" approved for Covid19 under Emergency Use Authorization are experimental and most of them include mRNA technology, which has never been approved to use as a vaccine previously. We know that there are many serious known side effects, and that there is no longterm data on these gene therapi e s in large populations. What liability is UNM willing to bear if or when students, staff, and faculty are damaged by these potentially mandated injections? There are many concerns, including immediate side effects, including death, infertility, and death via antibodydependent enhancement, which may kill many in the fal l and winter. and I have been looking at returning for a Master's Degree. If this proposed policy were enacted when I was a student, I would have left UNM. If it is passes, I will not seek my Master 's Degree at UNM . I will spend my time and money at an institution that respects bodily autonomy and has properly studied the real risks of Covid19. If it is passed, there are many people who will never participate in anything associated with UNM again, including performances at Popejoy Hall.Medical decisions must be personal. The college experience for many young people is about maturing into their own, learning to make their own decisions. To impose a medical mandate is to go against the principles of individualism embraced in universities. If UNM mandates the gene therapies, it must be willing to be legal l y liable for damage to its students, staff, and faculty. If UNM is not willing to bear that responsibility, then it must be an unreasonable risk. Why is it acceptable to force students, staff, and faculty to bear the medical risk to life and health to be permitted to study, work, an d teach?Thank you for your me and considera on Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI think it is wrong to mandate a vaccine that has not been FDA approved and that could potentially put someone at medical risk. Nobody has a right to tell us what to do with our bodies! UNM was a place of both understanding and respect when I attended a few years ag o and almost all of my professors encouraged people to stand up for their rights. Students have a right to choose not to be vaccinated without punishment of a loss of opportunity to receive an education. Is UNM prepared to lose students who refuse to be vaccinated? Is it prepare d to lose more students when it is force d to raise tuition due to low registration? This is a vicious cycle fueled by political fear and force. Don't be another sheep. Honor your community and your paying students. Give them a choice. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 12 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To whom it may concern,Requiring vaccines for a coronavirus is a gross violation of personal liberty for students and faculty returning to UNM. I am disgusted that my almamater would even consider such a proposition as this one. Being the center for research and development in New Mexico, I would expect UNM to have rece ived better insight on this absurd response. It is well known that vaccines for coronaviruses are woefully ineffective and there is no reason to believe that the vaccines which have been released for this coronavirus will be any different. Additionally, the Chinese Flu is known to not be particularly deadly in peopl e under the age of 50 and even less so in people aged 1830 which is the primary demographic for the campus. Oh and the CDC data will back that up. Please see the sources in this article here for further information on why this is such a Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth When considering mandatory covid vaccines for students and staff, UNM must remember that an Emergency Use Authorization drug CANNOT be mandated by any government organization. Additionally, every vaccine injury, if mandated while under EUA, will fall solely on the institution. We are still under the Emergency Act which the Governor keeps resigning which means ev ery adult has medical, philosophical, and religious exemptions to this vaccine. The school must tell the students and staff that these are available. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyIf the Covid 19 vaccines are only allowed under EUA (Emergency Use Authorization), how is legal to require them? Doesn't this violate federal law and the Nuremberg Code? Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIt seems fascistic to require people to obtain a vaccine that has opposion outside of medical and religious objecons. What will be the consequences of as student or faculty if that person refuses to obtain the \"vaccine\" after FDA approval? What contingency is in place for this policy that requires one to obtain the vaccine and all vaccines are later disproved for general use? Alumni Opposed to Policy Impact to EnrollmentAs a magna cum laude graduate from the UNM Honors program and Political Science Dept, I will forgo my allegiance to the university and send all four of my children (ages 17,15,12,12) to GCU if mandatory vaccines or tesng is mandated. People have a right to make their own private medical choices. Mandating any kind of onesizefitsall medicine is absurd and totally unnecessary. You're going to be left without anyone to foot the bill if you continue to pursue restrictive policies instead of focusing your efforts on creating more opportunities. People are fleeing the state as it is; mandatory vaccinations will be the last straw for an economy on life supp ort Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 13 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;Hello. I would like to say that the vaccination should not be required for students or faculty to return to school. There have been very low severe cases for the majority of the age group that attend university. Those that are worried can get the vaccine or perha ps ther e will be online courses available for them? Or those that are at risk and unvaccinated should wear a mask. There have been many concerns raised recently from young adults who have gotten vaccinated and regret it because they are having side effects such as heart palpitations and women are having severely irregular menstrual symptoms . Yes, if you try and research this through basic google search or listen to the news, advertisements, companies, etc. You will find that they are trying to downplay the issues that are resulting from the vaccine. But if you really search for people's real life experienc es from blogs and really dig deep, it is out there. Anyways, I feel this last year has been detrimental on our society and especially on our youth. Requiring young adults to risk themselves with this emergency use vaccine will cause much more unnecessary issues. Plus the school will lose students and possibly employees, leading to a drop in how much money it will mak e, they will find places that are not expecting such a risk. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;Get off the gestapo bandwagon, open the campus to ALL students, and stop the nonsense with the dictate lockstep policies with all the rest of the koolaide drinkers re: those who want to force the bogus severely undertested \"vaccines\" which are at best in actuality a theraputic upon eve ryone. I've done the homework on this topic and it is astonishing how dangerous these \"vaccines\" truly are. In 1976 when a \"vaccine\" for swine flu was administered to approx 40 Million people here, <60 died from that vaccine, and the CDC and FDA immediately halted the initiative. Cont ra st that with over 4000 dead in the first 5 months of administering the three different \"vaccines\" for Wuhan flu, and the same agencies are SILENT about this. Do your homework!!h ps://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.htmlh ps://leohoh mann.com/2021/04/30/highly Outraged that UNM would even consider such a ridiculous MANDATE, but not surprised. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Stop the nonsense, citizens are responsible for their own health. If they want to get vaccinated fine, if they don't fine. We have all had enough BIG BROTHER in our lives. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 15 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI am greatly troubled at a potential policy requiring UNM employees & students to take a \"vaccine \" which is still unproven and in the TRIAL stage. As a taxpaying and law abiding citizen of New Mexico, I write to express my reasons for opposing such a mandate. According to CDC reports (VAERS) many adverse events from this COVID shot including blood clots, anaphylactic reactions, & Bell's Palsy, to name a few, have occurred. In addition, numbers of deaths also have occurred after people have taken the doses of one of the available shots and a number of pregn ant women have mi scarried following the injection. I personally know a gentleman who suffered an adverse reaction & had to be hospitalized after his 2nd injection & I have friends report of individuals who died following the injecons.Given that there have been injuries & deaths attributed to COVID vaccines, the manufacturers have no liability in the US as per the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (1986) and supported by the PREP Act (Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness ACT per the US Dept. of Health & Human Se rvices which has added 7 amendments as of Mar. 11, 2021.)In addion, two of the companies making the vaccines (Moderna and J&J) have never brought a vaccine to market before COVID). J&J, Astra Zeneca, & Pfizer have been taken to court and had to pay out huge sums on other products they brought to market such as Bextra, Viox x, Celebrex, Thalidomide, and opioids. Here are examples of Pzer's past provenincourt corrupon.From a digitized version of an article from The Times: \"A unit of Pfizer inc. has agreed to pay $10.75 million to settle justice department claims that the company lied to get federal approval for a mechanical heart valve that his fractured killing...\". Reuters rep orted in 2004: Pfizer said yesterday that it had reached a $60 million settlement of a class action lawsuit over it's capital REZULIN diabetes drug, which was withdrawn from the market in March 2002 after about 100 people who took it had to have liver transplants or died from acute liver failure.In court they were found responsible for knowing their products would cause harm and still they profited from their products. They were liable for those products. Does it make sense that they have no liability for their vaccines and I can trust them?The COVID vaccines have been tried since 2000 and have not been successful. For example, The Journal of Virology in Nov of 2004 reported \"Immunization with modified vaccinia virus Ankarabased recombinant vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome is associated with enhanced hepatitis in ferrets. Nature international we ekly journal of science reported in January 2005, The study conducted by the National Institute of allergy and infectious disease in Bethesda, Maryland reported: \"In the case of SARS, It remains unclear how anbodies might be helping some viral strains into cells...\"The CDC just doesn't know yet how these COVID vaccines will affect us in the future & unfortunately, people are being asked to trust that there will be no harm and given the past experiences with these companies that have made products that caused injuries and death, how can we turn a blind ey e and trust the companies. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 16 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Until the trials are completed and we can see the results, we should not be required to take a trialstage injection given that there are proven treatments if given in the early stages of the virus. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; Mr Stokes,As a UNM graduate and a long standing member of the New Mexico business community, I strongly discourage you from making the Covid19 vaccines mandatory in your school. I believe that all people have a right to make their own medical choices. This is a highly unproven vaccine and there are safe alternati ves such as therapeutics, forcing the vaccine on students is notconstitutional. This policy would lead me to rule out UNM as a school for my teenager that is currently looking at college choices. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyThere is a HUGE difference between complete FDA Approval and Emergency Use Authorization. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(III) states that individuals to whom the Covid vaccine is to be administered shall be informed: (I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product; (II) of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to whic h su ch benefits and risks are unknown; and (III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their bene ts and risks.This section of code indicates that as long as the Covid vaccine is under emergency authorization, an individual can refuse the take the vaccine and it cannot be required as a standard of attendance. Furthermore, even if the vaccine is no longer under the emergency authorization, to require its use without further evidence of its efficacy would open the university and its board to lawsuits under the recent amendment to the tort claims act. Lastly, forcing students to accept the vaccine or not be allowed to attend in person wou ld place the University in the undesirable position of excluding current and potential students from future enrollment as well as the loss of fee associated with such actions. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI request that those involved in enforcing proposed vaccine policy read/watch the attached information. Subjecting students/staff to potential vaccine hazards could prove to be a disastrous mistake. Page 17 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about PrivacyRequiring vaccinations for students, faculty, and staff is a gross overreach if privacy and health. Even asking for proof from those that have received a personal medical procedure is a misuse of power. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Religious Accommodation; Hello.I am a graduate of and former masters level instructor at UNM. As such I want to implore you to consider the impact of your proposed mandate on the experimental covid injectable for all students and faculty.First and foremost, it is unethical and most likely illegal to force people to have an experimental concoction injected into their bodies. What about \"my body, my choice?\" What about the Nuremberg Code of Ethics? As far as I know we are still a nation founded on liberty and inalienable rights. One of those rights is bodily Integrity. I am sure there are many students, faculty, and employees who choose not to have this experimental injectable for any number of reasons. Some have religious objections based on the use of aborted fetal cells in the producon of these treatments. You will be facing many lawsuits from those people who may lose their jobs or who are restricted from their educaon.Please consider carefully the need for such an extreme mandate. Thank you. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;Religious To whom it may concern, Please reconsider the COVID19 vaccination mandate. New Mexico has current legislation that allows for the exemption of vaccination for religious purposes. Those that may utilize this right would be forced to disenroll or seek schooling elsewhere. Furthermore, those that chose not to get the vaccine for other reaso ns wou ld be marginalized and discriminated against. Other reasons someone may chose not to get the vaccine...Personal conviconsAllergyPregnancy and breast feeding (future or current)Cultural restriconsOther health concernsEtc.All of these reasons are deeply personal. Even in the event that exemptions were accepted, it is in violation of a persons medical privacy and personal rights to disclose why they would deny the vaccine. Please consider your current students and future students that would miss out on the precious oppor tunity of higher education if vaccination becomes a requirement.Sincerely,A fellow New Mexico cizen Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety hps://twier.com/MSill3/status/1390873493185642497?s=19 I f you follow the link I posted above you will see the science from the Jonas Salk Institute condemning the COVID \"vaccine\" ..... which is NOT A VACCINE AT ALL. It is deadly dangerous & should NOT be utilizes for ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER! Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyReligious AccommodationI'm concerned that UNM is proposing a mandatory vaccine policy. I think these issues are personal and private. Some people choose not to vaccinate for religious reasons and I am concerned UNM is not being inclusive. My sister had a bad reaction to vaccines as a child which resulted in epilepsy and men tal retardation. For this reason people in my family have concerns about being vaccinated. This is a medical choice and it should not be mandated. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 19 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs a UNM alumni I find this proposed vaccine requirement in order to attend and further one's education outrageous and disappointing. This proposal to mandate vaccines is very discriminatory and will violate all individuals right to bodily integrity and choice. All individuals should have the opportunity to make thei r own medical choices. As a parent if this mandate is approved I will make sure that my college age and soon to be college age children do not spend a dime of mine furthering their education at UNM. I will also pull my support from UNM athletics. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think that this article from the AAPS holds some very interesting points the University should consider. https://aapsonline.org/open letterfromphysicians touniversities reversecovidvaccinemandates/Addi onally, the surveying by a Pfizer, with Universities, in order to push their profit from vaccination is scandalous. I'm curious as to what incentives they have given the Universities to push the vaccine on their staff and students. The public is no longer naive. https://www.acha.org/documents/ACHF/ACHF_VaccineCoverageS urveyReport.pdf Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs a UNM alum, I am disappointed to hear that UNM is considering removing personal choice from the matter of whether or not to get a vaccine. This policy is authoritarian and unAmerican and is an overreaction to a virus that has proven to be far less dangerou s than o riginally expected. For instances where I may visit UNM's campus in the future as an alum, I look forward to ignoring and/or defying this policy if implemented. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 21 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceTo all: Universities are intended to be bastions of free thought,choice, and most of all, research. Mainstream media is NOT the sourcefrom which to make important decisions, but apparently that's where allinforma on about Covid is being obtained. There is a plethora ofstudies from genuine doctors and researchers that are available toanyone with even the niest amount of movaon, which apparently noone at UNM has. They document the ecacy of Ivermecn,Hydroxychloroquine, and other methods of treang Covid These studiesare oen suppressed by the media, but are ndable.Are you actually ignoring the documenta on that 99.85% of Covidpaents recover? Yes, it is a high risk to a relavely smallpopula on, most of which are not in the university venue. Mandating anexperimental vaccine is highly discriminatory to those who can't orwon't agree to take the jab and yet you're seriously considering thispolicy. The vaccine should be by choice only...you know the saying: \"Mybody, my choice.\"I'm a graduate of UNM and had a fabulous expe rience there. I hope some one at UNM willdip deeper into the alternatives to mandated vaccines, and in themeanme, I'd sure be checking on the law. UNM is a state funded schooland as such, should be held to appropriate laws regarding invasivemedical procedures. Iand many otherswill be closely watching yourdecision. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice To whom it may concern,I was recently informed that UNM may make the Covid19 vaccine a requirement for students and faculty. Please reconsider. New Mexico has current legislation that allows for the exemption of vaccination for religious purposes. Those that may utilize this right would be forced to disenroll or seek schooling elsewhere.

Making the covid vaccine mandatory is discriminating against individuals who do not want to take an experimental vaccine. We live in a country that is free to make their own choice for their own body again you will discriminate against them.We all have the right to make our own medical choices. I have 3 children all of which have looked at going to UNM because I went there and so did my father, If you make this mandatory they will no longer consider going to UNM.I hope you rethink your decisions and keep medical decisions for each individu a l person Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMandatory vaccination is discriminatory. Everyone has a right to make their own medical choices. This takes away someone's choice. This policy goes against a person's fundamental rights to chose. Please do not enforce this policy. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMEDICAL TREATMENT SHOULD NEVER BE COMPELLED. Get your policies out of our bodies. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs a believer in free will, this decision is absolutely abhorrent. The vaccine should not be mandated for anything. I hope you will see sense and undo this choice you have made. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Good morning All,I am wanng to voice my concern against mandatory MRNA injections for students and staff. I graduated from UNM in 2007, one day would like my children to attend UNM. I believe one should have a choice in having the experimental MRNA shots injected into their bodies and it should NOT ever be ma ndatory in order for our children to get an education in our state. This is wrong, immoral, discriminatory and against the law in every way. Human trials are not over until 2023 and these experimental MRNA shots are not yet approved until trials are over. We have no idea what the long term affects of this wil l be and need to be thinking of the safety and health of our future generations. I hope you all will make the correct choice and think of our children's safety, health and wellbeing before making any decisions. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceDisappointed that you are even considering requiring student to be vaccinated. It is a personal choice to get vaccinated. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 26 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Hello All, I am wring to voice my concern over a possible mandatory vaccine decree at UNM. My daughters are currently attending and my third daughter will be enrolling in the near future.If vaccines are going to be mandated, we will nd another university to send our girls.Covid vaccines are experimental and we all have a right to make our own medical choices. Please consider allowing UNM Alumni and students to have the freedoms of choice.I personally know people who are very sick from receiving the vaccine. My brother in lawcannot move his arm and is seeing neurologist to figure how to regain movement, this isaer receiving the vaccine. We all should have a choice as to what we put into our body. Thank you for your me Albuquerque, NM Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To whom it may concern,I am wring today as a concerned parent of a potenal student of UNM. First of all, I would like to start by saying I am an alumni of UNM and am grateful that we have access to such a university in New Mexico being that we are a state with limited resources and opportunities. I am a New Mexican whos e family has b een here for multiple generations and I take pride in our community.When the pandemic began my son who is a sophomore in college took a leave of absence from CU Denver to be closer to home and he decided he would like to stay in New Mexico so we were preparing to apply for admission to UNM.My son has mulple health concerns including a Thyroid autoimmune issue. Given the limited scientific data on administering the vaccines to those with conditions such as my sons we have decided as a family that it is not medical decision that is feasible for him at this time until more is known about how the mRNA vacc ines will interact with his immune system.Addi onally, given the fact it is not fully FDA approved and only EUA we believe it is medical discrimination to require those who are enrolling into universities to be vaccinated with the COVID19 vaccine seeing as to how not even the US military is requiring it of our troops.There are now alternave therapies to decrease the severity of COVID19 cases and we believe it should be left to individual choice to decide which medical treatments are appropriate for our families.If UNM does in fact mandate that all students be vaccinated with the COVID19 vaccine we will have no choice but to look elsewhere for educational institutions for my son to nish out his degree.Our family urges the UNM policy makers and staff to reconsider making vaccines mandatory and instead leave it up to the individuals to decide. Thank you for your time and consideration. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 27 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyStudents and their families may justifiably believe these policies discriminate against individuals who aren't candidates for this vaccine, have preexisting conditions, previous COVID19 disease, cite religious objections, or are otherwise exercising their freewill choosing not to participate in this optional vaccine experiment. Refer to the Nuremberg code from WWII, which requires indiv iduals, \"to be able to exercise free power of choice. This is discrimina on.COVID19 convalescent students may be harmed by college and university policy requiring COVID19 vaccines. They already have extensive immunity and would be likely harmed from a forced confrontation with COVID19 vaccine induced spike protein causing autoimmune reactions leading to illness and possible death.I hope the university is prepared this legal and financial consequences of adverse health outcomes, they have mandated. These seems like a huge liability for a vaccine that lacks long term safety date. Definitely, taking a large risk if they decide to make it compulsory. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI am writing to oppose any policy requiring mandatory vaccinations for staff or students at UNM. This policy would be discriminatory and would violate one's right to choose their own Medical treatments. The vaccines are not FDAapproved and are not actual vaccines. It would be careless and Reckless to force this on to peop le not knowing the longterm risks. You might want to consider the possibility of lawsuits in the future. I am a UNM alumnus and will not make any monetary contributions to the university if this policy takes effect. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Greengs all,I write to express my opposion to UNM's proposed vaccination policy. I object for the following reasons, though this list is not exhausve:1. The human vaccine trials won't even be over unl 2023. 2. The vaccines are not FDA approved.3. My body, my choice. My medical decisions should be my own, and private.4. Requiring vaccinaon in order to reenroll at UNM is discriminatory.5. We are no longer in a pandemic. Our situaon is endemic, that is, contained. 6. There is no agreement on the administered vaccine percentage required to create herd immunity, especially since the survivors already have antibodies. As of this writing, 36% of New Mexico's population is fully vaccinated. 51% of the state has received at least one dose. https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid vaccinetracker states/ state/new mexico By the proposed August 2nd deadline, these percentages will be much higher, further weakening the case for mandatory vaccines in the UNM community. Please do not approve the proposed policy on mandatory vaccinations for UNM. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice This is a terrible idea. Why would someone who has already had the disease require a shot.? This goes against all medical knowledge. Who is going to assume liability for this? The pharma companies have made sure they are not.This is just following the crowd rather than good science. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 29 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear Provost Holloway, As the parent of a UNM student and a twotime UNM alum, I am extremely distressed to hear that you are considering a policy to require students to be vaccinated to attend UNM next semester. I find this distressing for a number of reasons: *All COVID19 vaccines are under emergency approval and have not been approved by the FDA, and as such, the long term effects are not known regarding these EXPERIMENTAL vaccines. *Previous mRNA vaccines have had devastang results that only appeared later. *There are indicaons that COVID vaccines have possible implications for fertility in young women and possibly young men. *COVID19 has not been shown to be a grave concern in young people and in fact, there is a 99% recovery rate. *Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory and leaves UNM open to ligaon. *Medical informaon is protected by HIPAA regulation and you cannot force someone to reveal their medical information to you so requiring proof of vaccination is a direct HIPAA violaon and leaves UNM open to ligaon. *Requiring all students to have a medical procedure ignores the individual needs and desires of students and infringes on their personal decisions regarding vaccinaon. If the University moves forward with this dangerous and flawed regulation I will be forced to find another educational institution for my child that does not seek to infringe upon his rights in order to attend. Thank you for your time and attention. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceVaccines are never supposed to be mandatory. If someone who has already had the virus, fought it off and built up antibodies.....they don't need the vaccine. Plus, it has already been wide spread, this stupid vaccines they are pushing on all of us to get \"will not stop you from con tracting the virus.\" They put the stupid disclaimer on it from the getgo which states \"our product does not work. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 30 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety UNM Provost,I am a UNM alumni. I am writing today to urge you to not enforce mandatory vaccination for students and staff at UNM. I was injured by the HPV vaccine when I was in graduate school. I developed Bells Palsy. One of the side effects of the COVID19 vaccines are also Bells Palsy. Had I not caught it early, I could've had permanent facial disfigurement. I personally would not want to go through that again, an d I feel that since I've been previously injured I would be at high risk to be injured again. Since the COVID19 vaccines are not FDA approved and have not fully completed the animal trials, I feel it should be people's right to decline this vaccine. We do not know the lo ng term affects on fertility either. Which could have long term effects on our New Mexico communi es. If this was made mandatory at UNM and I was still in attendance, I would have to disenroll. Had I chosen to get the third HPV shot, I could very well be paralyzed for life. I understand the current fears of Covid19, however, it is important to set an example for the state as a Un iversity. Requiring mandatory vaccination could result in massive disenrollment along with potentially injuring or killing many students and staff. Thank you for your me, Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyIt is unethical and dangerous to require all students to get the vaccine. This assumes that all students are able to tolerate a pharmaceutical injection. Given peoples' personal health status and experiences, they should be allowed to decide if they think this vaccine is a good idea for their bodies. And those who can't or eve n don't want to take the risk with new vaccine technology, should be given equal access to higher education. This is a slippery slope. Please don't make it a big legal fight for access to equitable education! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 31 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice To Whom It May Concern: I want to express my deep concern in regards to the idea of the mandatory COVID19 vaccination requirement at UNM. Not only does it deeply sadden me but it sincerely scares me for the repercussions of this mandate especially for our young population who has a greater than 99% surv ival rate. Whether someone chooses to get the vaccine or not should be purely based on their own medical choice. Furthermore, mandatory vaccination is discriminatory and a violation of medical freedom. I, myself, am UNM Alumni who proudly graduated from a graduate program within the school of medicine. However, I can say without a doubt I would not have attended UNM if this policy had been in place when I was applying for schools. I got accepted to 4 other universities out of state and I would have opted to attend a schoo l that did not mandate the experimental vaccine. Additionally, I have children who may one day opt to attend UNM; however, if this discriminatory mandate is in place, UNM will not be a considera on. UNM is at the forefront of medicine, especially in NM, and for this reason I sincerely hope that the risks associated with this experimental vaccine are considered and that the vaccine not be mandated at UNM. As of May 3 there have been 4,178 postCOVID Vaccine deaths reported to the U.Sbased Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). https://vaers.hhs.gov The risk is real and our students do not deserve to be subjected to such risk, ever. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIf UNM goes forward with the proposal to mandate the Covid vaccine my daughter and I will sadly be looking elsewhere for her to finish her studies. I am a native New Mexican, attended UNM myself, and my parents have three degrees between them from UNM. It is highly unethical and very distressing to see our hometown University consider forcing a medical intervention on its students and faculty. Please don't mandate this vaccine.

Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 33 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs an alumni and parent of a current student I am saddened that UNM would try to make the COVID19 \"vaccine\" mandatory. I thought a University was a place to challenge students, faculty and staff to think for themselves and outside of the box. It is suppo sed to be a place where people ca n expand their thinking horizons. It is a shame that when people actually use their minds and education to make informed decisions about their own bodies they are targeted and lose privileges and the ability to finish their degree at Universities where they are limited by coerci on to do as per the mandates. I think it is disheartening when you purport to give people the right to choose life because it is their body but not when their choice doesn't fit the mold of people who have an alternate perspecve. You have made no provision for people who cannot receive the \"vaccine\" for medical reasons such as allergies or autoimmune disorders. How is that not considered discrimination? And what happened to HIPA law and the privacy act? Are you going to require each student to list any and all STDs, med i cations, recreational drug use, etc.? And how will you curb the activities that lead to STDs and drug use? UNM you are setting a very dangerous precedent if you mandate this \"vaccine\"! Your decision on mandating the \"vaccine\" is a precipice, are you really willing to go there? I have 2 other students who aend CNM and are about to transfer to UNM within the next year, if you mandate the \"vaccine\" you will lose the tuition for 3 full time students from just our family. Not to mention as an alumni, I would not donate one dime to UNM or support it in any way. I will encourage others who seek a college education to go somewhere you are not discriminated against for having a differing opinion than the masses. Last time I checked I am responsible for my own body and my own health . I mu st do and choose what is best for my body and my health. I hope and pray that you will not mandate the COVID19 \"vaccine\" for students, faculty and staff. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyI strongly urge UNM NOT to require a Covid vaccine to attend school. No student should ever feel coerced into a medical procedure in order to receive higher education. In addition, HIPPA law prohibits others from demanding access to a student or faculty member's private medical information, so requiring acce ss to that informaon would be against the law.Myself and all 5 of my siblings graduated from UNM, as well as my husband. We have 8 children, the oldest of whom will soon be of college age, and rest assured that with this proposed vaccine policy in place, we will absolutely not be sending any of our children to UNM. We wil l find another university at which to spend our money educating our children. Hundreds of my fellow New Mexico parents feel the same.Thank you for your considera on. Again, I urge you to decide AGAINST this Covid vaccine requirement. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 34 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am strongly against making employees/students prove that they are vaccinated. This is discriminatory, and is a violation of protected health informaon.Please allow people basic freedom to choose their own health decisions, and not be coerced into doing things they otherwise would not want to do.The university will be a part of making \"two classes\" of people. Ones who are educated and ones who cannot because of health reasons. I will not be sending my children to your university if this is the decision that is made to disclose personal heal th information. Please strongly consider and being a leader, not the first universities to jump to require the vaccine. Thank you. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceWe do not agree with a required vaccine OR testing. Every student should have a right to refuse either. Thank you. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am all for those who choose to be vaccinated, but I am against UNM mandating that students, faculty, and employees of UNM have the COVID \"vaccine\". To be vaccinated is a personal health decision. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyWe are parents of a junior, and we are also alumni. We are in direct opposition of any effort by the University to impose a mandatory vaccine on our student. If there is an \"accomodation\" made, any monitoring for those who chose not to receive the vaccine would be a violati on of privacy an d we would choose to move our son to another university for his senior year. I hope the University will reconsider these actions as we will seek legal advice on our options for credits that may not transfer. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 35 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI find it appalling UNM is buying into the narrative and flawed policies that have effectively shut down our great state and much of the United States. UNM students are in an age group that has very low risk for serious disease from SARSCoV2. Mandatory vaccina tion is an outlandish draconian policy given the FDA has not approved COVID19 vaccines for general use and the vaccine has caused far to many vaccination induced deleterious side affects to considered taking the vaccine. As a family we have made the decision to refrain from taking the vaccine. If our daughter is required to take a COVID19 vaccine, she will be forced to withdraw from all programs offered at UNM. She will take her funds elsewhere and finish studies at a more friendly unive rsity. Furthermore, we will no longer consider UNM a deserving charitable organizing in the future. Medical decisions are personal. Vaccinations of any kind should not be forced on an individual by any government or agency. It defies the notion of personal liberty. Organizations that are proponents of such policies should be called out and those responsible for making or proposing such a abhorrent policies should red and replaced. I am sad to see that the UNM administration would even consider such a policy and those responsible should immediately retract it. Sincerely,A very concerned UNM Alumnus. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Privacy To Whom it May Concern Compulsory vaccinaon is a direct attack on personal privacy, especially health privacy, and the decision to do such should be discouraged at all costs. In light of the COVID19 pandemic and its global effects, there is not enough evidence to approach this virus with the same rigor as othe rs in the past. The decision to make vaccinaon for COVID19 compulsory is a slippery slope; please consider the ramifications of this type of regulation and its direct assault to freedom and an individual's right to their own personal property. Consider the super precedence from the Roe V Wade trial. It was the persona l priva cy clause that helped rule for the woman's right to aboron.Sincerely, Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyThe entire state is in turquoise. There is no need for a mandate. If people want to get it fine, if they don't fine. You say that you won't share the vaccination status of students, yet will require a sticker or badge of some sort? LIES. Not a proud almuni anymore. Whe n my kids grow up I'm sendin g the m elsewhere. Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am ashamed of my alma mater. For always touting their pro inclusion, prodiversify prochoice in every way stance, UNM has totally missed mark. You are going to exclude a student based on their personal CHOICE? Talk about discrimination. If someone wants to get the shot, then let them. If so meone chooses not to, then ok. The Covid19 shot is not an immunity building vaccine. It's experimental gene therapy. If someone chooses to not join the experiment, then that is their personal prerogative. I am stunned that that UNM is even considering this shame on you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 36 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoicePlease reconsider this strategy. There is no reason to vaccinate these young people for one. Secondly, there is an arcle out by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons urging vaccination requirements NOT be in effect. https://aapsonline.org/covid vaccinesshouldnotberequired to returntocampus statestheassociation ofamerican physicians and surgeons/?fbclid=IwAR1403J_ZQ5sD5JPXRBy9sFEezZz7QkrPQdifw0 1H95gu5bHmiWSzXq18vEAs the parent of a daughter at UNM there is not enough longterm testing to know how mrna vaccines will eect these young ladies. Lastly, the arcle highlights the Nuremberg Code: \"Protections expressed by the Nuremberg Code require individuals \"to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervenon of any element of force.\"\" FORCING vaccinaons is a civil liberes violaon, plain and simple. Please act for the good of all. Alumni Question Concerns about ChoiceI believe that REQUIRING the vaccine of ALL students oversteps a person's right to choose whether or not they want to be vaccinated, especially in the case where they previously contracted COVID and continue to have the antibodies in their system. Could there be a provision allowing them the same freedoms as a vaccinated person if they can show that they have a sufficient amount of antibodies to protect themselves and the people they come in contact with by taking a lab certified antibodies test at regular intervals, say 23 months apart? Alumni Question General Complaint It is not appropriate to require any vaccine of any student or staff member. I attended UNM and graduated with my bachelor's in 2005 and master's 2007. No proof of having received any vaccine was required for my attendance at that time. The diseases for which vaccines are required for children to enter publi c sc hools are much more dangerous than covid19 and those vaccines have much better established safety of history. But UNM did not even require proof that students received those vaccines. So it makes me wonder what is the motivation for requiring the covid19 shot especially for a population whic h is not sev erely affected by the virus? It's fine for you to recommend that a student or a staff member receives the covid shot but it should never be required even if it does receive FDA approval. Alumni Question Concerns about ProcessWill proof of vaccination be required for alumni to attend functions at the University such as a performance at Popjoy hall or a sporng event? If so, how will the proof be veried? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 37 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Question Concerns about Enforcement Hello How would this proposed policy impact the people who visit the campus for Popejoy shows, basketball games, football games or other public events such as homecoming? Does this mean no one could participate if they were not vaccinated? It would seem as if this might impact attendance as well as enro llment in Continuing Ed cla ss. The summer program for children could very well be impacted with limited participation. Please consider the huge impact you will have on the larger community by requiring only vaccinated people to be on campus. UNM does more than just education and research. It is a big part of the Albuquerque community. Alumni Question Concerns about Enforcement Impa ct to EmploymentThis is a TERRIBLE idea! Are you going to require vaccine for ALL other communicable diseases (some of which are significantly more severe) as well? What about other events on UNM campuses? Will you need a vaccine to attend sporting events, shows at Pope Joy, job fairs etc. What about UNMPD, do they need it? Are you willing to risk losing law enforcement over it? The fact that UNM is even contemplating this is utterly disgraceful. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I believe a requirement to be fully vaccinated to be on campus is a great move. This will help be a beacon for other orgs in the state who are tip toeing around the idea of having vaccination policies for their people. Additionally, it will make our community feel safer, encourage people to ge t their vaccines, and will keep us healthy. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy I agree that requiring a vaccine for any person coming to campus will improve safety for everyone. UNM leads in science and medicine Lobos set the standard that will drive our entire state. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Making a mandatory vaccine requirement is a good policy As a high school instructor, I personally know several students that put off going to college this past school year due the pandemic and are waiting to feel safe in returning. A mandatory vaccine policy will go a long ways in helping create a safe environment for all students and staff. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As a healthcare provider for our community, and a spouse to a faculty member of UNM, I absolutely think that vaccines should be mandatory for students to resume in person classes. It provides a safe reentry plan for large volume classes and helps to keep everyone safe!We have both been vaccinated since December and it has given us both great peace of mind when getting out and moving towards a more normal life Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy This is a good idea. A safe learning environment for all students requires psychological and physical safety, including from COVID. A vaccine requirement will help achieve that safety. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 38 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy Sounds like the only way to go.If you weren't implemen ng these polices, I wouldn't want to go back myself.With them in place, I'd feel confident being in a classroom all day ... and I haven't eaten indoors at a restaurant since June and that wasn't preferred then. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy This is a great policy that will help decrease the spread of an illness that is killing millions of people. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy This sounds like a great idea to require it. We need safety in our environments and this is one more way to make this a safe space. Other universities are doing the same, keep the pack safe. Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy Is there a timeline for when to expect the FDA to issue a regular use approval? Because it is in our best interest to have everyone vaccinated before fall term starts and I am concerned this will cause delays. Having a mandatory vaccination policy is an excellent plan so I do not want to see it watered down or delayed. Also, I am both an alumni and a current graduate student, why is there no option to select \"graduate student\" on this form? Are TAs and instructors not included? Alumni Supportive of Policy Support Policy I approve of this recommended policy! Vaccines are free and there are numerous ways to get a vaccine if you sign up at health dept. Web site. My UNM student is one of the students who is already fully vaccinated. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Why would you require a COVID vaccine when the mortality rate is .1 % per the cdc for college age students. The death rate of flu, meningitis and many other things are much higher and not required. I feel you can encourage the vaccine, even promote it but it shou ld NOT be mandatory. Please rethink requirements on Covid19 vaccines have not been long term tested and these young people should have the right to choose for themselves. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Treating symptomatic Covid19 patients who have hypoxia and cytokines with Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is very effective and honors body integrity. It is illegal under international codes to force consent, particularly for unlicensed injections with no guarantee a student will not come down with Covid19 nor pass it to so meone else. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I feel it is important to know how many students you will have to turn away for your school if the covid vaccine is mandatory. Most people I know are declining vaccination regardless of the consequences we face. Restricting peoples lives without having this medical procedure is uncons titutional and deplorable. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 39 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I understand you have a lot of pressure to keep people safe. I can't imagine the amount of responsibility you hold on a daily basis. I desperately need to tell you about the responsibility I hold. I am responsible for myself, my children, and their future. I am responsible for keeping them safe until they are adults where they will make that decision for themselves. Mandatory vaccines are a violation of that responsibility. Everyone has the right to choose their medical care for themselves. I will never... NEVER.... enroll, do busines s, or otherwise engage with a location who mandates vaccines whether I have the vaccine or not. If this mandatory vaccination requirement goes through, it will create discrimination that will set society back at least 50 years and perhaps farther. Shaping future minds is an incredible undertaking. Organizations like yourself are revered and valued. Please do not implement mandatory vaccines. It is devastang when people die for any reason. Many people die from the Flu virus every year for decades. Reminder that no mandates have ever been required for the Flu vaccine. The survivability rate for Covid19 is over 98%. This is not a mandatory need. Thank you for taking the me to consider Not having mandatory vaccinations. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Hello, I am an UNM alumni, and I was just emailing about some of the new policies that are trying to be put in place. There should be no mandatory mask and vaccine to go to this college. College has always been about free choices right? Where you can be your own pers on and grow into so much more. These kind of mandates are reasons I will have my kids attend a different school. These are unacceptable and unethical requirements. Medical records are and should remain confidential. And masks have been proven time and time again to be pointless control. Please don't add such ridi culous requirements. Any support that I would have giving unm will be pulled. I cannot support this kind of breach of freedom. Thank you for your time Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory. All people have a right to make their own medical choices. These vaccines are experimental and they have very high rates of adverse reactions! Please use your head and stop this!Thankyou, Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Dear President Stokes, Please do not make the vaccine mandatory for students or staff. It is an experimental drug. Recovery rate for Covid is 99 percent. This violates rights of Americans. Thank you. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Medical procedure is an individual choice. Forcing them is illegal, unethical, and tyrannical at best..

Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Dear President Stokes, I wanted to send along my thoughts on what UNM should do about the COVID 'passports'. Please try not to fall in line with the left on this issue. There are very real consequences to the choices made on this issue and I implore you to consider the big picture. To consider what comes next.I was a student and employee at UNM for a few years and always marveled at how little thought went into decisions about conformity. Please don't let this decision on the restriction of freedom become another poorly considered choice with huge ramifications. I could go on and on but will spare you al l that, unless you want the conversation. In that case, I would relish the conversaon.In closing, please preserve the Constuon over expediency. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Forcing people to take experimental drugs is against all that America stands for. Covid has a99 percent recovery rate. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Dear President Stokes,Covid 19 Vaccines should be oponal especially since the vaccines are being allowed on the market under an Emergency Use Authorization. Even when granted full FDA approval the vaccination of students should be a matter of choice. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I'm a community member that works for CNM. We usually follow a long with what UNM does. I'm very AGAINST this policy for anywhere to have. It's ridiculous! My body my choice! For everything not just this subject.

We can almost predict with 100% certainty what's next on your communist agenda by reading the WEF website.. It seems most corporations are following the same script. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Covid 19 vaccination should be voluntary. UNM should not mandate it as a requirement. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 41 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to Enrollment Dear Ms. Cordova, Please see the comment below that was le on the UNM website. We are absolutely opposed to the proposal of mandatory vaccination and /or Covid testing. And we will *not* send our 4 children (ages 1217) to the UNM if this is approved. Besides the obvious violation of rights and overwhelming evidence showing us that the student population is not at significant risk, you will witness an even more significant decline in enrollment if you mandate vaccines/testing. It's a selfsabotaging decision. We are already witnessing families fleeing the state's struggling economy and exporting our brightest students in favor of sta tes that are choosing to invest in their youth. In fact, the census report recently verified what we are seeing in our neighborhoods by stating that NM has a growing elderly population and declining collegeage population. Furthermore, trade schools are competing successfully for student dollars.Focus your eorts on expanding opportunities for Albuquerque & improving UNM's abysmal safety/security status instead of attempting to mandate unconstitutional policies. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I have only seen the Nazis in Germany enforced putting foreign agents into people's body. These kids are young and healthy and do not need chemicals I do nothing to help them put into their body. coronavirus covid19 or China virus none of them have any effe ct to these young kids, whatsoever. You need to quit enforcing unethical, unconstitutional, unhumanitarian practices on these kids! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Never in the history of this once free and great country has such an asinine vaccine push been mandated to such a level as what you are currently pushing! This vaccine is not without injury, I personally know of several that have suffered from this vaccine, one of which died last Friday!You do not have the right to force ANYONE to do something like this and the fact you are trying to anyway is absolutely abhorrent! If you had any decency, you would advocate for freedom to choose instead of FORCING something on staff and students, what a shameful disgrace your \"higher educaon\" facility is!I implore you to do the only right thing and stop this idiotic vaccine mandate lunacy by allowing EVERYONE the right to choose free of reprimand.God forbid you foolishly force this and even one student is injured or dies because of your inability to allow people to choose for themselves! DO NOT MANDATE VACCINES! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I am shocked at the audacity of any institution demanding such measures as forcing a student to accept medical treatment if they do not want it. I do foresee, and will assist in legal action against such institutions who are participating in medical tyranny! The documented ill affects from these EXP ERIMENTAL gene therapy injections is overwhelming. I'm sure your institution will become the target of legal action for the inevitable medical problems that will ensue. I recommend you make a wise choice at this time and let people make their own decisions regarding this issue. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 42 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; Dear President Stokes of UNM and colleagues,I am wring this letter of concern to you regarding students of UNM and namely, my son, who is a member of the Class of 2021 at UNM, but is planning on starting his master's degree in the fall at your presgious University.I am wring to inform you that he was naturally infected with SARSCoV2 in 2020. Because he was naturally infected, it is highly likely that he is already naturally immune. Therefore, I am very concerned that COVID19 vaccination may be a totally unnecessary medical treatment in him with only the possibility of adverse reacon or harm.I would like to ask that you consider carefully the safety and liability implications of indiscriminately mandating COVID19 vaccination in students, including my son in whom the vaccine is an unnecessary, or potentially dangerous, medical treatment: that is, those who are already immune or recently infected.However, because UNM, as a private corporate institution, is now considering engaging in mandated blanket vaccination, I am writing to inform you that the risk of liability for harm to your students, who are naturally immune or recently infected, from indiscriminate COVID19 vaccinaon, is nonnegligible.Please consider two main points of liability:First, it is abundantly clear that the vast majority of persons who are naturally immune from prior SARSCoV2 infections gain little to no benefit from additional vaccination. This statement is not only consistent with the basic tents of immunological clinical science, but it was also demonstrated by the results from the J&J vaccine 's clini cal trials AND by recent results emerging from Israel (see below links). Therefore, vaccination of the naturally immune is simply an unnecessary medical treatment in the vast majority of such persons. And you all know that any complications resulting from a medical treatment that is unnecessary, no matter how \"rare \", fit under the category of \"unreasonable harm\". Please do review the below links with care and consider the fact that many of your students receiving indiscriminate and mandated COVID19 vaccinations are undergoing an unnecessary, and therefore only potentially harmful, medical treatment because of your indiscriminate COVID 19 vaccine maer of clinical standard we already know that vaccinating infected persons is potentially harmful. Certainly, recent CDC guideline indicates that persons infected with SARSCoV 2 should wait before getting vaccinated \u2014 this is an implicit acknowledgement that such persons are at risk of harm. Certainly, we already know that a substantial number of persons are asymptomatically infected with SARSCoV2 and, thus, will not know that they are infected at the time of their vaccination at your facilities. Moreover, recent data emerging from the UK is demonstrating that ambulatory patients with prior infections are the ones having the most inte nse vaccine related adverse reactions. You may review this data Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 43 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; Dear President Stokes, The proposed policy on mandated vaccines is not a good idea for the University to be imposing on its personnel and student body. The Covid19 virus has a survival rate of 99.9% and the vaccines are only experimental and not fully FDA approved as is stated on some of the paperwork received at th e me of administra on of the shots. Please reconsider this policy and treat people as individuals capable of making their own health decisions. This is a terrible virus, I understand, but the long term effects of what it has on people has not been fully determined, and of special concern to me is the effect it has on women of childbearing age. Thank you for looking at all of the angles here and not forcing young people to take a risk until more informaon and research is known about the vaccines. NMSU is a great institution of higher learning and it is for this reason that more research needs to be done and questions need to be asked and answered. Let NMSU stand apart from other institutions of learning and be a unique place and beacon for free thinking individuals across the country and around the world to come and enroll and experience. Best of luck to you in this very difficult decision making process. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;Dear Mr Stokes, it has come to my attention that UNM wants to implement a mandatory vaccination for all staff and students. Let me say that I believe this is a very bad decision to make. Let me be clear, this is discrimination against people's right to decide their own medi cal choices. You nor anyone else has the right to force anyone to take a vaccine for any reason. These vaccines have not been approved by the FDA, and forcing people to take them, is wrong. Please understand that and choose to do the right thing. It should always be personal choice to ge t vaccinated. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;Forcing students to vaccinate with a drug that has not been \"approved\" by the FDA in order to attend school is unconstitutional and an overreach into private medical matters and choices. This is appalling to see that you are in a sense hijacking and ransoming a higher education for someone submitting to a medical experimental procedure with their body or else what??... all their money and years are wasted that they've invested and entrusted to UNM? These students deserve beer and we deserve that you act more ethically and professionally with their best interests at heart. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I want to express my opinion as a NM Taxpayer and Citizen that I am against any forced vaccination of UNM students. This is tyrannical and controlling. Let those who want to, get it. If it is really so effective, then this should take care of the problem. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;This us an emergency approved vaccine. You should not make it mandatory. Specially if people will begin to have heart problems. Dont force it on people. We should have the freedom to choose our own medical treatment. Our body our choice.

If you mandate the vaccine we will pull her from the roster. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Requiring vaccination for students or staff is infringing upon the civil liberties of the individuals. Each person is responsible for their own wellbeing; and the university should not encroach upon the constitutional right of Americans (and should respect the rights of exchange students to do the same). Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I am an attorney who works with New Mexico Stands Up! A non partisan, volunteer driven organization working to protect individual rights through public interest legal action, providing support to New Mexicans facing loss of health freedom, and educating the public about their rights with regard to manda ted medical intervenons. You may be aware that the mandang of COVID19 vaccination for students or employees has become a serious issue in the United States and in New Mexico. Currently, there are several lawsuits which have been filed on behalf of employees who have been fired or threatened with termin ation for not bein g vaccinated. New Mexico Stands Up filed one of those lawsuits against Do\u00f1a Ana County personnel for firing employees who chose not to be vaccinated. We are preparing another suit against a private business in Albuquerque who has threatened to fire an employee who chooses not to be vaccinated for religi ous reasons. We hope that you will seriously consider the legal and moral ramifications before taking the action of mandating vaccines for your students or employees. The COVID19 pandemic does not justify violations of fundamental individual, economic, and religious liberties.

Mandatory vaccination is discriminatory and as human beings, we have the right to make their own medical choices. Forcing a vaccine is comparable to forcing someone to practice m edicine without having a license. Is this what UNM is encouraging? As and individual who has family who attends school at UNM, I am strongly petitioning against a move like this. This policy would lead us to disenroll and cause us to not participate in supporting UNM in any way. Plea se consider the personal choi ce and decisions of others and the affect your decision will have on our community and our local economy. Best regards, Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyMS. Cordova, if this vaccine hasn't officially been given the ok by the F D.A. Then how, can it be legal to mandate the vaccine??? If the rights in America are Freedoms, for citizens. How does UNM. Think it's their right to mandate anything on a free society. If the vaccines, that I already took Willingly.. if they protect me from getting the covid 19 then, why should I be forced to continue and wear my mask?? None of this really makes sense.. not in a free society. I would hope, that the sta at U.N.M. could see, that they might appear to have egg on their face?? Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI would like UNM to withdraw any vaccination requirements, including covid vaccinaons for students. The Associaon of American Physicians and Surgeons have expressed concerns over such a policy for a variety of reasons, which they have posted online. In addion, it is dangerous and highly unethical to require people to inject substances into their bodies. Such a policy sets an extremely dangerous precedent.Vaccina on should be a choice. If an individual feels a vaccination will afford them protection, they should have the right to vaccinate themselves. If an individual is concerned about vaccine injury, or the lack of studies on longterm health outcomes, they should have the opon to abstain. Personal freedom is the bedrock of this country. A mandatory vaccination policy violates human rights.Thank you. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyWhy force healthy young students who are not at risk to take experimental vaccine of a disease that has a 98% recovery. The fact the the drug companies are not liable for injuries from vaccine is a HUGE RED FLAG. You don't know the effects of the vaccine in 5 or 10 years. These are yo ung kids who are still growing and developing till there mid 20's. This is unconstitutional for a state funded schoolroom demand an injection. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 48 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI very strongly oppose making the vaccine a REQUIREMENT to return to classes. It's so appalling that I don't even know where to begin explaining how sick it makes me to hear you're even considering it. Whether or not to get injected with an experimental concoction is and has always been a personal choice, and should never be considered as a requirement in order for an individual to connue educaon. Please come to your senses, UNM. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 49 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyYoung adults are a healthy and immunologically competent and vibrant group that is at, \"extraordinary low risk for COVID19 morbidity and mortality.\"College and University students, however, are under significant mental health strain already from COVID19 fears, circumstances, distance learning problems and the imposion of government health policy restricons.Even though the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for three COVID19 vaccines, they are not FDA approved to treat, cure or prevent any disease at this time. Clinical trials will continue for at least two years before the FDA can even consider appr oval of these vaccines as eecve and safe.The COVID19 vaccines on the market in the U.S., mRNA (Moderna and Pfizer) and DNA (Johnson & Johnson \u2014 Janssen), have caused notable side effects, pathology and even death (>2300 deaths per VAERS as of April 20). These adverse reactions result in absence from school and work , hospital visits, and even loss of life.College age women may be at unique risk for adverse events following administration of the experimental COVID vaccinations currently available. According to the CDC, all cases of lifethreatening blood clots, subsequent to receiving the J&J vaccine, reported so far in the United States, occurred in younger women. The vast ma jority of cases of anaphylaxis have also occurred in women. In addition, \"women are reporting having irregular menstrual cycles after getting the coronavirus vaccine,\" and 95 miscarriages have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID vaccinaon as of April 24, 2021.Recent research data demonstrates that the spike protein, present on the SARS CoV2 virus and the induced primary mechanism of action of COVID19 vaccines, are the primary cause of disease, infirmity, hospitaliza on and death.Students who have had selflimited cases of COVID19 already possess antibodies, activated Bcells, activated Tcells (detectable by lab testing). This durable, long term immunity would not only prevent them from getting recurrent COVID19, but would also represent herd immunity to protect others in the college or university community.COVID19 convalescent students may be harmed by college and university policy requiring COVID19 vaccines. They already have extensive immunity and would be likely harmed from a forced confrontation with COVID19 vaccine induced spike protein causing autoimmune reacons leading to illness and possible death.Students and their families may justifiably believe these policies discriminate against individuals who aren't candidates for this vaccine, have pre existing conditions, previous COVID19 disease, cite religious objections, or are otherwise exercising their freewill choosing not to participate in this optional vaccine experiment. Refe r to the Nurem berg code from WWII, which requires individuals, \"to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force ...\"The ADA, Americans with Disabilies Act, requires \"reasonable accommodations,\" be provided based on an individual's own unique health situation. This includes rejection of an experimental vaccine intervention which may exacerbate known health problems and thereby cause harm.Colleges and Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 50 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Universities should consider whether they might be liable for damages, poor health outcomes, and loss of life due to mandatory COVID19 vaccinaon policies.\"Posi ve cases,\" as dened by laboratory testing alone, may be false positive testing errors or asymptomatic infection that is not clinically proven to spread disease.Ambulatory outpaent early treatment for SARSCoV2 infection / COVID19 has been demonstrated effective in adults.Informed consent is the standard for all medical intervenons.

All of the Covid19 vaccines were authorized for emergency use only, which means that people MUST have the right to refuse as explained in Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 53 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Good aernoon:I am extremely concerned about the recent news that UNM is intending to create a policy to require covid vaccination for all students and staff. I am a business professional working in the Albuquerque metro and have been considering attending UNM to earn my MBA. However, the following points are troubling:1) The \"vaccine\" is not a true vaccine, as it does not guarantee immunity. One can still contract covid, even if vaccinated. Anyone receiving this shot is not protected against the virus. Some have reported that their reinfection symptoms have been more severe after the shot than they were during the orig inal infection. KHN (Kaiser Health News), a publication of the Kaiser Family Foundation, reported on this (https://khn.org/news/article/the shockandreality ofcatching covidaerbeing vaccinated/), which brings me to #2. 2) It is not FDAapproved and has been released for emergency use only. It mystifies me why UNM and other organizations are trying to \"require\" a shot that is experimental, for an illness that over 98% of those contracting it survive. mRNA technology has never been us ed enmasse on humans and the longterm effects of the shot are as yet unknown. Anyone taking this in effect becomes a lab rat and an unpaid one at that, since people who volunteer for risky medical studies are typically compensated at a level that makes ta king the risk worthwhile. Since it was fasttracked, it skipped the clinical and animal trials that would have uncovered potential problems. Those taking it may be opening themselves up to death or irreversible health effects caused by the shot, and we will not know the extent for 35 years or longer . Should harm occur, the manufacturers are immune from accountability and liability. Americans experienced a similar situation in 1976 with the swine flu shot. So that you understand my position, once and if this shot completes the proper trials, obtains FDA approval and demonstrates true efficacy and safety, I and those of us without med ical or religious objections would have no issue in receiving it.3) There are many who cannot or do not want take this shot, for a variety of reasons. In the cases of true vaccines, such as polio or measles, exemptions exist for medical and religious reasons. Your proposed policy states that you will allow exemptions, but those taking them will be subject to ongo ing surveillance and testing. By planning to require an invasive procedure either taking the shot or getting tested in order to attend class or work on campus, you are medically discriminating against your prospective students and staff, invading their privacy and breaking Federal law. Like the C19 vaccine, C19 tests do not have full FDA ap proval. Given the requirements for FDA approval, it is unlikely that either will earn it based on the efficacy and track record they are showing. Thus, it is against Federal law to mandate either of them. All United States citizens have the constitutional right to make decisi ons concerning their own bodies and health. You would not force a teacher or a student to obtain an abortion, have elective surgery or use birth control as a condition of study or employment, and you likewise should not require this shot or consent to constant testing. The same laws and legal preced ence Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 55 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment apply.UNM has a long history of being an educaonally superior institution for New Mexicans seeking to acquire business credentials. However, should you require covid vaccination, I will be attending another school that has more respect for my personal health and civil rights. My company reimburses employees for educational expenses and recommends UNM programs, and I wil l also inform our Human Resources of your proposed requirement so that others can make an informed choice. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI have been made aware that UNM is imposing mandatory vaccinations for all their students. I think that you are making a mistake in imposing mandatory vaccinations some of the reasons why I believe that this is a mistake are as follows: Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory.All people have a right to make their own medical choices.If I were aending UNM I would certainly disenroll or rule out UNM as a school. I did attend UNM for some classes and if this were imposed while I was attending I am sure that I would have disenrolled. Folks don't like to be forced to do things . You will get more out of people if you let them make their own choices regarding vaccines. I hope that you rethink this policy as it could be detrimental to your already low enrollment at your university. Make the right choice and make the vaccine oponal for students so as not to impinge upon their freedoms. I also buy season tickets to Lobo Football and will reconsider my patronage if these vaccines are made mandatory. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 56 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyMy son is supposed to attend next year. It should NOT be Mandatory for students to take an \"Emergency\" vaccine to receive higher education. Young people are extremely low risk. Please reconsider your mandatory vaccination policy immediately.Sincerely, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 58 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Good morning Ms. Cordova,I am contacng you about the policy that UNM is considering making the experimental mRNA injection mandatory for staff and students. This is a HUGE infringement upon people's constitutional rights, bodily integrity, medical freedom and the RIGHT TO CHOOSE for themselves what is best for them!It would also set up a very discriminatory caste system between the \"vaccinated\" and un \"vaccinated\", where those who have chosen not to get the mRNA injection would be outcasts - does that align with your diversity, equity and inclusivity policies at UNM? If staff refuse to get the mRNA injection, will they be fir ed from their jobs? What about when \"boosters\" are needed every 6 months, or every year? Are you in the position of tracking every single student and employee to make sure they receive all of these additional shots? Several safety and ethical considerations exist related to this harmful policy. For exa mple, there are NO long term safety studies on this mRNA injection, this mRNA injection does NOT provide immunity (does not protect one from getting SARS COV 2 or prevent transmission of it to others - it MAY reduce the severity of symptoms if one gets it, but doesn't prov ide immunity) and all of the lab animals in the early trials died when exposed to the actual virus. And, is there going to be any consideration for people who've already recovered from a SARS COV 2 infection or COVID illness who may have robust, longlasting immunity?? Natural immun ity (T cell, for example) is FAR superior to the mRNA injection as it can protect against several variations of this virus, while the mRNA injection creates spike proteins against just one strain. Also, mandating a treatment for which there are many harms, including deaths, that are being reported to the Vaccin e Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) after people receive this mRNA injection, seems very risky. People need to be fully informed about the harms as well as any possible small benefits of this therapy - and then allowed to make their own decision about getting the shot based on their risk tolerance, and indiv idual values and preferences! As an academic institution, the fact that this policy is even being considered by UNM leadership is absolutely baing!! Most college students are young and at virtually NO risk of complications from COVID, so they are not even the demographic that should consider getting this so called \"vaccine\"! My son, who is 21, is considering which college he wants to apply to, but with this discriminatory policy, there is no way that I wi ll spend money to send him there. I imagine you may also very well have several lawsuits facing your institution for discrimination and/or any harms that come to staff or students forced to take this experimental gene therapy. Will UNM accept liability for any harms that come to studen t s or staff as a result of taking this therapy? Also, you say that those who don't get the experimental mRNA injection will be subject to additional tests and surveillance - of ASYMPTOMATIC people! That is absolutely ridiculous, as it is well established that those without symptoms do not spread the virus! Are you aware of the absolute FLAWs with the PC R tests that are used? These are not meant to \"diagnose\" COVID - and depending on what cycle threshold (CT) is used to Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 59 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment analyze test samples in the lab, can produce a huge percentage of false positives! There is a wealth of information on this problematic test and several countries have banned its use in their COVID response. Finally, these tests are also under Emergency Use Authoriza on and are experimental. Please reconsider this harmful, invasive, unconstitutional, tyrannical policy and allow health decisions to be made by individuals - VOLUNTARILY. Thank you. Here is a leer from the AAPS about this, as well: hps://aapsonline.org/open leerfrom physicians touniversities reversecovidvaccinemandates/ Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 60 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To Whom It May Concern,I understand that UNM is considering requiring the COVID19 vaccines for employees and students. I am an alumna and I disagree wholeheartedly with this idea for reasons supported by scienc ndings, as well as moral reasons.Young people are at minimal risk from complications or death associated with the Coronavirus. Young people are said to handle the illness much better than older people, with mostly mild symptoms and few deaths. They are also less likely to transmit the illness. Furthe r , young people are at significantly greater risk to long term complications simply because they have more years of life ahead of them. The FDA has not approved these vaccinations, rather they are currently under Emergency Use Authorization. While this may change before the start of the fall semester, rememb er that no other vaccine has ever been studied for such a short period of time. We must know more about the longterm effects of this vaccine before moving towards any kind of requirement to take the vaccine.My greatest concern is for young women. There is too little known about how these vaccines impact fertility and pregnancy. Imagine if your daughter were unable to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term as a direct result of having received a Coronavirus vaccine. We don't know that these vaccines could have suc h an impact, but we also don't know that they will not have such an impact.We have fought long and hard to obtain freedom to make our own decisions about what medical procedures we will accept for ourselves. My body, my choice must apply to this decision about vaccinaon as well.I am certain you are aware of the open letter to colleges and universities from The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons in which they state 15 reasons why vaccination should not be mandatory. Their explanations certainly hold more weight than mine, and I agree 100% with their asser ons.Also, according to VAERS (which is purported to track fewer problems than are believed to be in the actual population) the number of people who died after receiving one of the Covid vaccines is 3362 (December of 2020 through April 23rd). In 1976, 45 million people were vaccinated for the Swin e Flu and 53 people died after getting that shot. The program was halted immediately because authorities decided it was too risky. Yet deaths following Covid vaccines are 63 times that number, and you are considering requiring students and employees to take the shot? Finally, vaccinaons have been made available to all US residents over the age of 16. If your concern is that college students or employees may contract and subsequently transmit the virus to others who are in higher risk categories, those higher risk individuals may be vaccinated for their own protect ion. Anyone who wants the vacci nation can get it, so if the vaccinations work, there is no reason to require college students (or your employees) to be vaccinated to protect others. Those others can be protected by the vaccines that they have chosen to take. Please keep in mind that the risk from Coronavirus is different for different categories of people. Older and comprised individuals are at a much higher risk, while younger and healthier people are at a Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 61 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment significantly lower risk. The choice to undergo a medical procedure should be between an individual and their physician with zero input from anyone else, even an employer or a school. To require someone to take this experimental procedure is requiring them to participate in the biggest drug trial in history, something that is against the Nuremberg Code.Please do not require these vaccinations for your students or your staff. Community Opposed to Policy General Complaint; President Stokes, Respecully, I say do Not implement Any vaccine mandates. Now or any me in the future. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;It is unconstitutional to force employees or students to get the experimental \"vaccine\" to keep their jobs... It will not be tolerated and a large lawsuit is being developed in this state for employers like yourselfThe shot is dangerous and we will not allow your mandate. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 62 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyIm not happy with the fact that covid19 vaccines have to be mandatory. This is not fair. You are not giving us the choice over our body. You are also violating the Federal Patient's Bill of Rights. Not everyone approves of this. You are pretty much saying you are ok with man y people disenrolling from college. Theres not enough evidence to show that the vaccine is safe. Many lives have been lost due to the vaccine. We dont feel safe.Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Injunctive Relief Against Discrimination in Places of Public Accommoda onCreated by FindLaw's team of legal writers and editors | Last updated September 12, 2017The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is federal civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination in numerous settings including: employment, education, voting, and public accommodations. See FindLaw's codes section for the entire Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, Title II prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, co lor, religion, or national origin in places of public accommodations and provides injunctive relief for such violations. See the enre Title II text below.SEC. 201. (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, and privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or naonal origin.(b) Each of the following establishments which serves the public is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of this title if its operations affect commerce, or if discrimination or segregation by it is supported by State acon:(1) any inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment which provides lodging to transient guests, other than an establishment located within a building which contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and which is actually occupied by the proprietor of such establishment as his residence;(2) any restaurant, cafeteria, lunchroom, lunch counter, soda fountain, or other facility principally engaged in selling food for consumption on the premises, including, but not limited to, any such facility located on thepremises of any retail establishment; or any gasoline staon;(3) any moon picture house, theater, concert hall, sports arena, stadium or other place of exhibition or entertainment; and(4) any establishment (A)(i) which is physically located within the premises of any establishment otherwise covered by this subsection, or (ii) within the premises of which is physically located any such covered establishment, and (B) which holds itself out as serving patrons of such covered establishment.(c) The operaons of an establishment aect commerce within the meaning of this title if (1) it is one of the establishments described in paragraph (1) of subsection (b); (2) in the case of an establishment described in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), it serves or offers to serve interstate trav elers or a substantial portion of the food which it serves, or gasoline or other products which it sells, has moved in commerce; (3) in the case of an establishment described in paragraph (3) of subsection (b), it customarily presents films, performances, athletic teams, exhibitions, or other sources of entertainment which move in Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 63 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyImpact to I think that this is a very dangerous policy for the University or any public entity. Not only is it most likely unconstitutional and a violation of civil rights of your Staff Faculty and Students, but is can be a costly precedent that is being set by the University. If this becomes po licy one would ask why the Flu vaccine is not also a requirement, and this can go on and on for all other Virus type vaccinations that exist today and in the future. Yes we should be looking out to the interest of the public, but not when it violates the rights of the individual, that is called Socialism. It is your right to mandate this policy, but there are consequences that may not been seen at this time. In addition by the time that this policy is enacted the volume at which the public has been vaccinated will most likely be at a point in the Country and the State of New Mexi co that herd immunity will take hold and continue to suppress the Virus making the policy uselessThe risk to the University is if this policy is a condition of employment or enrollment, then the University stands to loose valuable Staff, Faculty and Students on a policy that is really not needed. In addition since these vaccines are approved on an Emergency basis with not much resea rch an d understanding of the long term effects of the vaccine, does the mandate or condition of employment of the policy make the University responsible for any long term issues the vaccine make create. Yes, you can say you can quit or not enroll, if you don't want to get vaccinated, but if an em ployee is released because they did not get vaccinated or a student not enrolled and if they felt threatened by the thought of being released or not enrolled and got vaccinated against their will, then it is yet to be challenged as to who is responsible. I am not sure that is a risk I woul d want to take as a University as this means costly law suits are coming to the door step. Wonder if anyone in the College of Medicine was consulted or all their opinions where considered and reviewed, both in favor of and against? Would be interesting to know this info. Dump the policy you don't need it! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory.All people have a right to make their own medical choices.Please stop this. We are about to lose our very civil rights on an emergency approved vaccine. Please keep in mind thee US Federal bill of rights Title 2 Act SS 201(1)Neither are tests accurate and have not being fully approved by the FDA. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyIt is very sobering to see institutions such as UNM even put forth the idea of requiring students and faculty to receive an experimental injection in order to participate. This is not only immoral but it is uncalled for. This virus is not at all as deadly as the medi a has made it ou t to be. We are not your test subjects. We are free people and it is against the very definition of Liberty to require a person to inject a substance into ones body in order to be granted access. I and most people that I know are disturbed by this an d will be making our voices heard. We will not be turning or heads the other way or sticking then into the sand. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 66 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyWhere there is a risk, there must be a choice. Since the new experimental CV19 shots don't keep you from catching CV19, don't stop you from transmitting the virus and are only designed to lower symptoms, then mandatory shots to attend in person classes or live on campus don't mak e any sense. The shot only gives the person receiving the shot reduction in symptoms, but doesn't build immunity to protect others. When a medical product has death as a side effect, there must always be a choice. Restricting an education for the unvaccinated infringes on personal liberties and freedom s. For a virus that has a 99.7% survival rate and a 0.4% death rate, the need for a mandatory shot is not necessary. There are treatment options for CV19 that have been suppressed. Coercion is not informed consent. Telling people that they cannot attend in person college or live on campus without proof of vaccination is Coercion. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyTo start requiring this is wrong. Clinical trials don't technically end until 2023. Talk to nurses and doctors IN hospital settings right now. The pee that are suffering after having this shot is horrific. These doctors and nurses are afraid to speak out. If you ask them in person and off the record they wi ll tell you. Do NOT impose this on these kids who have such a high survival rate to begin with. Instead maybe make a class teaching about how to keep your body healthy and the things that support that would be better money spent and benefit all in the long ru n. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Chances of dying from flu in 1949 age range 0.2%Chances of dying from Covid19 1829 age range 0.1%Chances of survival from Covid19 99.8%Current Covid19 vaccines are using experimental technology that has never been used in humans. They have only been on the market for 4 months.Covid19 vaccines are currently in phase 3 trials. On the fact sheet it states you have the right to refuse.Even aer FDA approval the Covid19 vaccine companies will be monitoring the reported side effects of those who have taken the vaccine for another two years.Why inject perfectly healthy young adults who will be interacting with other young adults and have almost zero chance of dying with something that is brand new and never used technology? The population that needs Covid19 vaccination is the older demographic which is high risk from dying from Covid19. There has not been enough long term stu dies on these vaccines to inject them into our future generaons.If students want to get the vaccine then let them, but if students don't want to get the vaccine let them have that choice as well.New Mexico is 36th in the nation for Covid19 cases. 4,098 deaths. Currently New Mexico has a vaccination rate of 52% with one does and 40% are fully vaccinated. By the time the school year starts in August that number will be even higher.Again do not take away a student's ability to a higher education simply because they choose to not take the Covid vaccine shot. This would be a travesty on a students rights and freedoms.Thank you and I hope UNM opts to not enforce any Covid vaccine policy at this time. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 68 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyPlease do not require any vaccinations, especially the covid19 one. These are private medical decisions for each person to make and no one has any business asking or requiring such a personal thing. Our medical privacy is protected by our freedoms, please don't try and take those rights away. Also, there is no proof that the covid vaccine helps prevent transmission. It even says that on the fact sheet from the companies. And it does not garuntee that people will be protected from covid (also stated in the fact sheet). It is a experimental drug th at is not approved by the FDA and is illegal to mandate. If you care about your community, students, and teachers health, you will protect their freedoms and allow them to make their own decisions about their health. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHow is this legal? The vaccinations are not approved and are still in trial phases. Requiring these untested vaccines is illegal because it aliens students and staff who do not want to get it. All medical procedures are VOLUNTARY. The chances of a person 1825 dying of covid is .001% and 30 60 is .007%. There is no logical reason to require healthy adults to take the shot against their will. No one should ever be forced to have a medical procedure and carry a passport of such proof to participate in society or school. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyRequiring covid vaccines for students is WRONG! It is an experimental injection! It could possibly be affecting fertility!!!! College aged kids have almost a 0% chance of dying of covid, however a far GREATER risk of dying due to the covid shot! My husband graduated from UNM, and I'm a proud wife! Our children could pos sibly go to your school, however, i would never send them to a place that imposes draconian measures that go directly against the nuremberg code. You should be ashamed of yourselves for even suggesting this!!!! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth To whom it may concern, I was recently informed that UNM may make the Covid19 vaccine a requirement for students and faculty. Please reconsider. New Mexico has current legislation that allows for the exemption of vaccination for religious purposes. Those that may utilize this right would be forced to disenroll or seek schooling elsewhere. Furthermore, those that chose not to get the vaccine for other reasons would be marginalized and discriminated against. Other reasons someone may chose not to get the vaccine... Personal convicons Allergy Pregnancy and breast feeding (future or current) Cultural restricons Other health concerns Etc. All of these reasons are deeply personal. Even in the event that exemptions were accepted, it is in violation of a persons medical privacy and personal rights to disclose why they would deny the vaccine. Please consider your current students and future students that would miss out on the preciou s opportunity of hi gher education if vaccination becomes a requirement. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 69 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety; To Whom It May Concern: I am wring this to express my deepest concerns that UNM is proposing to mandate the covid vaccine for staff and students. I find it very troubling that UNM would mandate something that is not FDA approved and that UNM would attempt to infringe on the community's right to medical priva cy. However, I know that my opinions alone will not persuade you, therefore I am going to list the issues that Dr. Fauci himself has raised, as well as other issues that UNM seems to be ignoring with this proposal. The rst should be enough to give UNM pause immediately. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has updated their website to state that if an employer that requires any of the various COVID vaccines to work if there is any serious harm to the receiver of the vacci ne (or death) the em ployer will be liable. Indeed, according to the Star Newspaper, it is illegal for employers to require vaccination with a Covid vaccine distributed under a EUA. These vaccines have only been authorized for emergency use which means that getting them is voluntary. Legally UNM isn't even allowed to do this . Now whether or not I am in the wrong, I am opened to being corrected, but I know that none of these vaccines are FDA approved. Therefore, it does not seem like I should be forced to get it. Links to OSHA's and breakdown for what this means for emplo yers who require this Addionally, it is reported that between 160k injuries from these vaccines as well as almost 4k deaths have been recorded since December. Also, no one seems to be talking about the fact that multiple countries like Norway, and now Halifax, Novia Scotia, have paused AstraZeneca due to the seve re blood clotting issues that it has caused. It only took one case of the clotting issues in Norway for them to put a pause on this vaccine. And only three days ago, the BBC published an article saying that it is now \"normal\" for women to experience change s to their periods after it was stated that this was not a side effect and that women who reported that were lying. Articles can be found here: hps://news.yahoo.com/norway not astrazeneca of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment scrapped.html hps://www.bbc.com/news/health 56901353 I have also heard MANY stories of people having adverse reactions almost directly after receiving one of the various options. You might say, well that's only hearsay, but I must ask, is every person on this planet a liar, or is there some truth to these claims? But what I want UNM to conside r is this: is one destroyed li fe worth you mandating something that I know a large portion of the population is against? What if (God forbid) a young person died? Or what if they experienced such physical damage that they couldn't carry on with school? Not one of these compa nies is liable if an ything adverse happens. UNM would be. Again, see the OSHA link above. No amount of money could ever undo such damage, however, parents or family members would be open to a lawsuit against the university. Seeing as UNM is already a struggling school, that does not seem like an issue th at the university would want to potentially face. But more so, the loss of even one life should be enough to make you rethink this policy. You may think that because I am presenting not mainstream media news articles that I consi Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyAsking people as a blanket statement, to take an experimental, and not yet FDA approved pharmaceutical is not only illegal but it's dangerous and negligent. Please reconsider making this vaccine mandatory, and start examining the real numbers on both sides of the CV19 virus and vaccine. There's a proved 99.98% survival rate for the majority of age groups. There's not long term studies done on the effects of this vaccine since it's still in clinical tr ials, and please research how many adverse reactions are being reported to VAERS. If you haven't heard of VAERS yet, be aware also, that only about 1% of actual reactions or adverse events are even reported.

Community Opposed to Policy General Complaint While Covid has taken the lives of many people worldwide, getting the virus is not a death sentence. 99 percent of people who acquire it survive it. It is illogical and tyrannical to require a vaccination for Covid. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety; Dear President Stokes,As a mother of a teen looking at colleges, I have to say loudly that there will be not a penny of my money going to any university that tries to mandate an experimental, untested vaccine. There are numerous wellrespected physicians warning the public about the dangers of it. I will also be quite vocal and will actively discourage others from attending or in any way supporting a university that tries to mandate it. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;In response to mandatory vaccinations. As a RN we have never mandated medical treatment for a 98% recoverable virus in order to exercise our right to be educated. These vaccinations at this point are no more than an experimental drug. And you would be going down a very commun istic path to require this. I' m asking you to do some research and not be paid off to act in a weak manner. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety; Mr Stokes, Please! Please! Don't make it mandatory that students, take the vaccine. It's there body, it should be there choice. Vaccine's take years with trials to make sure they are safe. This is not the case with this vaccine. My husband and I have been doing a lot of research and listening to a lot of Dr.s, and that's how I am coming up with the fear for the safety of this vaccine that has not been properly tested. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety; Ms. Stokes, Why would an instuon of higher learning force teachers and students to partake in a human experiment? This experimental gene therapy is just that. I'm sure no one needs to explain to you what truly is considered a safe and effective vaccine. This gene therapy is new and the longterm hu man trials have yet to be completed. Patience is clearly in order as the CDC determined that young folks are at very little risk of dying from this virus. So, I urge you to be bold, stand firm and wait for the true outcome of this experimental thera py before demanding or requiring the shot to be taken by staff and students. Remember, everyone has the right to decide what medication they choose to put into their bodies. They should not be punished for exercising their rights. By demanding this of young people, you will be harming their educaonal and nancial potenal.Thank you for your attention. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 73 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety; Good Morning President Stokes: Please reconsider your stance on mandatory vaccinations for students and staff of UNM. I am afraid it would drive current and potential students and faculty away from the University of New Mexico.

All COVID19 vaccines are merely authorized, not approved or licensed, by the federal government; they are Emergency Use Authoriza on (EUA) only. They merely \"may be eecve.\" Federal law states:Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I III) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmec Act states:individuals to whom the product is administered are informed\u2014 (I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product;(II) of the signicant known and potenal bene ts and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such bene ts and risks are unknown; and(III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternaves to the product that are available and of their bene ts and risks.EUA products are by denion experimental and thus require the right to refuse. Under the Nuremberg Code, the foundation of ethical medicine, no one may be coerced to parcipate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is \"absolutely essenal.\" A federal court held that the U.S. military could not mandate EUA vaccines to soldiers. Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld, 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (2003). The court held: \"...the United States cannot demand that members of the armed forces also serve as guinea pigs for experimental drugs.\" Id. at 135. No court has ever upheld a mandate for an EUA vaccine.The liability for forced participation in a medical experiment, including injury or death, may be incalculable. Medical and religious exemptions will be insucient to overcome the illegality of EUA vaccine mandates. Children's Health Defense urges U.S. employers, universities and other institutions to respect and uphold the rights of individuals to refuse EUA COVID19 vaccines.

PLEASE BE AWARE THESE COVID VACCINATIONS ARE EXPERIMENTAL, AND OVER 10,000 DEATHS HAVE BEEN REPORTED to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and it 's equilavent reporting system in the EU. Additionally, ALL STUDIES DONE TO ASSESS THE PERCENTAGE OF ACTUAL ADVERSE EVENTS TO VACCINES WHICH ARE REPORTED INDICATE BETWEEN 1% AND 3% ARE REPORTED, which means that it is very likely that ONE MILLION deaths are attributable to the covid vaccine s at this time. The numb e r of deaths reported to VAERS in the past 5 months related to covid vaccines exceeds all deaths reported from all vaccines for the previous 10 years combined! Please be warned that mandating experimental covid vaccination is a violation of the Nuremberg code and is a serious bree ch of ethics. The covid vaccines contain mRNA (or DNA) that causes all the cells in the body to express the covid spike protein, which is KNOWN TO CAUSE BLOOD CLOTS, BRAIN INFLAMMATION AND OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS. Here are some references for to contact me if you have any questions. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Health Accommoda on; Religious What sort of exemptions are applicable and how will students be informed about their exempon rights? Tradionally, three kinds of vaccine exemptions have been valid: medical, philosophical (personal belief), and religious. I am highly opposed to mandang vaccines, as the purpose of education (and even more so, higher education) is to allow people to exert their free will judiciously and for the benefit of everyone. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 82 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;General UNM should most definitely NOT mandate any medical procedure, and specific to this request, Covid19 Vaccines. As we all know, the EUA will turn into a full authorization, likely within a few weeks, so the real argument lies in human/medical freedom and our constitution. I cannot say it better than board certified phys icians, surgeons and Nobel laureates who have been censured. Please see the REAL science at Association of American Physicians and Surgeons Open Letter to Universities: https://aapsonline.org/open letterfromphysicians touniversities reversecovidvaccinemandates/ (and americasfrontlinedoctors.org)Here is a summary of key points and references are available on website above.1.Young adults are a healthy and immunologically competent and vibrant group that is at, \"extraordinary low risk for COVID19 morbidity and mortality.\"[iv]4.The COVID19 vaccines on the market in the U.S., mRNA (Moderna and Pfizer) and DNA (Johnson & Johnson - Janssen), have caused notable side effects, pathology and even death (4.178 deaths per VAERS as of May 5, 2021). These adverse reactions result in absence from school and work, hospital visits, and even loss of life.[vi]5.College age women may be at unique risk for adverse events following administration of the experimental COVID vaccina ons currently available. 6.Recent research data demonstrates that the spike protein, present on the SARSCoV2 virus and the induced primary mechanism of action of COVID19 vaccines, are the primary cause of disease, infirmity, hospitaliza on and death.[xi]7.Students who have had self limited cases of COVID19 already possess antibodies, activated B cells, activated Tcells (detectable by lab testing). This durable, longterm immunity would not only prevent them from getting recurrent COVID19, but would also represent herd immunity to protect others in the college or univ ersity community.[xii],[xiii]8.COVID 19 convalescent students may be harmed by college and university policy requiring COVID19 vaccines.[xiv] They already have extensive immunity and would be likely harmed from a forced confrontation with COVID19 vaccine induced spike protein causing autoimmune reactions leading to illness and possible death.[xv]9.Students and their families may justifiably believe these policies discriminate against individuals who aren't candidates for this vaccine, have preexisting conditions, previous COVID19 disease, cite religious objections, or are otherwise exercising their freewill choosing not to participate in this optional vaccine experiment. Refer to the Nuremberg code from WWII, which requires individuals, \"to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force....\"[xvi]11.The ADA, Americans with Disabilies Act, requires \"reasonable accommodations,\" be provided based on an individual's own unique health situation. This includes rejection of an experimental vaccine intervention which may exacerbate known health problems and thereby cause harm.12.Colleges and Universities should consider whether they might be liable for damages, poor health outcomes, and loss of life due to mandatory Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 83 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment COVID19 vaccinaon policies.[xvii]13.\"Posi ve cases,\" as dened by laboratory testing alone, may be false positive testing errors or asymptomatic infection that is not clinically proven to spread disease.14.Ambulatory outpaent early treatment for SARSCoV 2 infection / COVID19 has been demonstrated effective in adults.[xviii] Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I recognize the intent behind the vaccination policy is to maintain the health and safety of the community. However, I have a major concern which no one appears to consider. There is an obvious, yet despicable historical repetitiveness that may sneak it's way in without great care.How does UNM propose to avoid the same and/or similar issues as that which occurred due to any form of segregation (wherein that term holds the idea that someone is \"special\" in some way that another is \"not\") that could very clearly and obviously arise from such a policy?This should especially be considered in light of the fact that vaccinations have not yet been approved for general use. And, that there are definitely those people who are ubercautious about something that hasn't proven itself longterm, due to being so new.Is not the real purpose of a university to help educate the masses? Such policies counteract that central purpose. Rather, why not assert that this return to in person classes also be accompanied by a permanent shift to hybrid, inperson/interac ve remote courses?Or, minimally, shift the policy from required to strongly encouraged. The risk of social degeneration must be weighed, also, but as far as I've seen, no one has started in on that conversaon.UNM's thoughts?Thank you. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I do not believe college students should be forced to be vaccinated because it is not safe for them, science tells us it's not safe for young adults, there's no reason for it to be an either/or and what has happened to my body, my choice. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 84 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; To New Mexico schools, instuons and businesses:By way of introduction, New Mexico Stands Up! is a nonpartisan, volunteer driven organization working to protect individual rights through public interest legal action, providing support to New Mexicans facing loss of health freedom, and educating the public about their rights with regard to mandated medical intervenons.We are writing to you as a New Mexico school, institution, or a private business. You may be aware that the mandating of COVID19 vaccination for students or employees has become a serious issue in the United States and in New Mexico. Currently, there are seve ral lawsuits which have been filed on behalf of employees who have been fired or threatened with termination for not being vaccinated. New Mexico Stands Up filed one of those lawsuits against Do\u00f1a Ana County personnel for firing employees who chose not to be vaccinated. We are preparing another suit again st a private business in Albuquerque who has threatened to fire an employee who chooses not to be vaccinated for religious reasons.We hope that you will seriously consider the legal and moral ramifications before taking the action of mandating vaccines for your students or employees. The COVID19 pandemic does not justify violations of fundamental individual, economic, and religious liberties. Both the United States and New Mexico constitutions protect the right to perso nal autonomy and bodil y integrity. This includes the right to decide for oneself whatmedical treatment, drugs or vaccines one is willing to take or undergo.Although it may not be clear from the push towards universal vaccination, COVID19 vaccines have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They have not gone through the longterm efficacy and safety testing that would be required for full FDA approval. The federal law which allowed COVI D19 vaccines to be distributed before being fully tested is an emergency use authorization. Federal law 21USC\u00a7360bbb-3 requires that recipients of unapproved medical products (including vaccines) be advised \"of the significant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of the extent to which such benefits and risks are unkno wn\" as well as \"the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product, and of the alternatives to the product that are available and of their benefits and risks.\"At the Centers for Disease Control Advisory Commiee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting held at the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, in August 2020, the CDCACIP Executive Secretary Amanda Cohn, MD confirmed the nonmandatory nature of an EUA vaccine: \"I just wanted to add that, just wanted to remind ever ybody, that under an Emergency Use Authorization, an EUA, vaccines are not allowed to be mandatory. So, early in this vaccination phase, individuals will have to be consented and they won't be able to be mandated.\"Adverse reacons to COVID19 vaccines are being downplayed in the media. In the United States, negative reactions to vaccines can be reported to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (also known as VAERS). As of April 30, the VAERS database has 157,277 negative reactions Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 86 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment that have been reported for COVID19 vaccines. That includes: 16,014 serious reactions, such as anaphylactic shock, blood clots, GuillainBarre syndrome, convulsions, and heart aack 946 cases of Bells' Palsy, or facial paralysis 235 miscarriages and/or preterm births 3,837 deaths, with the youngest death being in a 15yearold.Onethird of these deaths occurred within a few days of vaccination. It is known that adverse vaccine reactions are greatly underreported, and it has been estimated that only 110% of these reactions are actually reported to VAERS system. That means that the VAERS data potentially represents hundreds of thousa nds of adverse reactions and tens of thousands of deaths related to COVID1 Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyAs a public state university that receives federal funding, how can you require vaccinations when the federal government has stated COVID19 vaccination is not mandatory? Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI encourage you to please use the above link to look at the deaths (all verified in the public record) of previously healthy people who have died from the Covid vaccine. Please know that if you mandate this vaccine there will be tragedies that you are directly respon si ble for. I would also encourage you to look a the CDC's VAERS (Vaccine adverse effects reporting system) from this you will see that these vaccines are anything but safe and in people under 65 are much more dangerous that getting infected with Coronovirus.I implore you to do some research and then do the right thing. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyPlease do not make the vaccine mandatory. This would be a violation of basic human rights. Students should be allowed to make their own decisions about their health. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyMy brother has been sick for 3 weeks after his 2nd shot, they do blood tests and find nothing. Don't impose an experimental vaccine on anyone who doesn't want it.My daughter is going to NMSU soon and thank god she is smart enough to know the facts! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI am writing today to ask that you not require vaccines for students and sta at UNM.These \"vaccines\" are creang a myriad of physical issues for many, many people who've been injected. To force these shots, which have not undergone vigorous testing, is akin to forcing students and staff to inject random poisons into their systems.Should you force people to get this shot you will be participating in a crime against humanity. Be wise and make the right choice. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 87 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; 1. When would the proposed policy go into eect?Response: \"This policy would become effective as soon as a COVID19 vaccine is approved for regular use. In anticipation of FDA approval, the UNM community would proactively make all efforts to comply with this policy by August 2.\"But unl then, it is illegal to require this mRNA gene therapy, nor can you discriminate against someone who chooses not to receive the experimental mRNA injection. One of the FDA approval dates is April of 2023 - by then, almost everyone will have probably been infected anyway! By adm itting you are willing to wait until April 2023, you are also entertaining the ridiculous notion that this is going to be a never ending \"pandemic\" - which it won't, because we are already at the end of it and have been for quite some time. Tax payers, parents, students an d staff that support your institution are curious to know if your policy development team consulted with any experts that don't adhere to the official COVID narrative. In other words, those who don't have an agenda, have intellectual curiosity about what has been done to us this past year and have been wil ling to conduct their own research about things like \"cases\", \"deaths\", the infection fatality rate (IFR) vs. the case fatality rate, the wildly inaccurate modeling conducted in March of 2020 by the Imperial College which GROSSLY overstated the IFR, and highly effective, cheap, treatments that have been available for years. Hav e you noticed that there has been NO debate or dialogue for the public's benefit at any level about our COVID response? Any alternative information that counters the narrative is censored or deleted from the public's view. This kind of dishonest behavior is very suspect and creates mistru st and sus picion by the public and for good reason. 2. Why is UNM proposing requiring vaccines for students, faculty and staff accessing University facilities and programs?\"UNM believes that doing so will support the health and safety of our campus community. It will lower the rate of infection and further the goal of having an oncampus experience that is crical to academic success and personal growth.\" This whole global fiasco has never been about \"health and safety\". Using threats, intimidation, coercion, manipulation, fear, lies, goal post moving and censorship to institute medically useless, politically beneficial mandates/lockdowns for a virus that has a 99.97% survival rate for most age groups is NOT an evidence based public health approach. Also, it DOES NOT (as you know) affect college age students!! If you think implementing this requirement is going to allow anyone to return to normalcy, you are mistaken. It does not infer immunity, nor does it prevention transmission! This genethe rapy does not r educe deaths from the infection. DoubleVaccinated infected with Covid have also died. There are few benefits to the mRNA injection compared to the risks as there are many reported negative side effects - and deaths with more reported every day. At a minimum, getting the mRNA injection should be vol untary - as with masks (which are also completely useless, per decades of research and literally dozens and dozens of studies showing this). 3. Would I be required to be vaccinated to aend school?Response: \" Under Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 89 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment the proposed policy, all Lobos must be fully vaccinated against COVID19 in order to access University facilities, classrooms, housing, programs, services and activities in person, unless they have been granted a reasonable accommoda on.\"Funny how UNM claims to support equality and then you propose to actively transform your campus into a segregated one based on \"vaccine\" status! Also ridiculous and unnecessary is to vaccinate people who have already been infected with SARS COV 2 or developed COVID.DO NOT Make this experimental, unnecessary treatment mandatory for students and staff!!! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety Dear UNM Decision Makers,I have three children who will be attending college soon enough. I would like them to stay in New Mexico for their college years, but I absolutely will not send them to any institution that coerces students to take an experimental vaccine as a condion of admission. As you should know, all of the available COVID19 vaccines are currently approved for emergency use only, and have not yet received full FDA approval as the trial phase will not be complete for at least another year. As such, anyone who takes the COVID va ccine is essentially participating in a medical trial. That is certainly their right, but it is also a person's right not to participate if they choose not to. It is highly unethical to force anyone to participate in a medical experiment against their will, as we learned from the Nuremb erg Trials.College age people have an extremely low risk from COVID19. But there are risks being discovered associated with the vaccine. The one that concerns me the most for my children is that there are many thousands of women reporting changes to their monthly cycles, and several hundred reported miscarriages post vacci ne. Several doctors have raised concerns that the vaccine may be affecting the reproductive system, and may even make some people infertile. There are even warnings about this on the vaccine inserts. I will advise my children against taking the COVID19 vaccine until the longterm effects of the vaccine on the reproducve system are answered. It would be truly horrible if UNM, or any institution in New Mexico, made the COVID vaccine mandatory to find out in a few years that many of these students cannot have children as a result. It would also leave UNM open to liability for forcing students or empl oyees to take the vaccine, when they may not have chosen to otherwise. For all these reasons, I ask you to not make vaccines a requirement for attendance or employment at UNM. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyHello, at this point, the university doesn't have the right to require students or staff members to be required. The vaccines are all under Emergency Use Authorization and until it is fully FDA approved, it would be unreasonable to require people to do so. The university doesn't require students and staff to get the annual flu shot, which also protects against a deadly disease. It could be a nightmare trying to enforce a policy that is not in line with FDA approval. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 90 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety To Whom it may Concern:Please do not approve your policy mandating the staff and students of UNM be fully vaccinated for COVID 19 to return to work or school.Young adults are healthy and have strong immunities and are at very low risk for contracting or dying of COVID19. Even though the FDA granted emergency use for three COVID19 vaccines, they are not FDA approved to treat, cure or prevent any disease at this time and are, I believe experimental.Although I did not graduate from UNM, I did aend courses in order to complete my BS in Computer Science. Both of my great nephews plan to attend college in the near future. If there is a mask mandate, I will encourage them to attend a college out of state where there are no mask madates for aendance.All people have the right to make their own medical choices. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI am glad that UNM is making plans to ensure student safety. And I do understand that we are in a pandemic. However as a parent of 2 students attending college, I don't believe that people should be penalized for not getting the vaccine. Yes FDA states it is safe, and the y will back it....BUT it has not even been 1 year, to see what effects show up in the long run, meaning there are many medications out there FDA approved and some years down the road you see lawyers coming on TV stating people can file claims becau s e these \"safe\" medications have now shown to cause other health problems!!!Life is too precious, and yes while I believe protocols need to be put into place such as surveillance testing, etc. I don't believe that penalizing people like not allowing them to go to college, unless they are vaccinated is fair. Thank you for your time! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety All,I am sickened to learn that you are considering requiring your staff and students to take the COVID19 \"vaccination.\" These injections have not completed clinical trials, and have created a huge surge in incidents reported to the VAERS. In addition, they have not been proven to provide immunity OR prevent transmi ssion. Even if they were proven and safe and FDA approved (which they are not), every human being has the right to make their own medical choices. This proposal is wrong on every level, and it's illegal. Way to drive students to other universities in other states. Brilliant. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 91 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyThose who receive the injectables for this medical experiment are not immune from getting COVID and can still transmit it according to the CDC, in fact, they are constantly transmitting ill health to those they encounter, especially to the unvaxxed. Taking the jab happens to create a walking, talking bioweapon.Manda ng an experimental bioweapon to the university population is extremely irresponsible. In a place of learning it is reprehensible that no research has been done regarding the effects this jab produces.Please tell me why an experimental mRNA injecble, neven tested on animals, is now being jabbed into college students who have a 99.97% of recovering if they do get COVID?I would hope if you in charge of this decisioninjure someone that you are held personally responsible for crimes against humanity and will be duly prosecuted as the vaccine companies have absolutely no liability. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI am a very very concerned Grandmother of a student scheduled to attend UNM in the Fall. We have specifically chosen New Mexico because they did not demand a vaccine. These vaccines are at least notably dangerous and affect a very personal aspect of a persons essence the messaging RNA of a persons permanent DNA. For a governing board to demand the changing of a young persons messaging RNA of their DNA affecting their entire body's cellular life and any children they may have into the future is wrong. Please, please do not mandate these vaccines. You are an educating inst itution that strives to raise up free thinkers and free choosers to contribute to a wonderful dynamic diverse world; don't develop a robotic atmosphere of oppression and division. I beseech you, don't mandate these vaccines. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyHere is a 150page compilation of media reports and social media postings of deaths, injuries, permanent disabilities, miscarriages, etc. from vaccinaons: hps://www.cellphonetaskforce.org/wp content/uploads/2021/05/Informed ConsentMattersMay 32021 Update.pdf.It is connually updated. I am sending you the May 3, 2021 update. It includes the current statistics from CDC's Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System. These vaccines are killing and injuring far more people than the coronavirus.You should NOT require UNM students, faculty and staff to do this to themselves in order to be on campus. Thank you. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Good morning I received the informaon about the proposal of mandatory vaccination for everyone on the UNM campus.Personally I believe that every person has the right to make their own choices in their lives but especially in the area of health. One of my children is considering UNM in the near future, but if UNM decides to push mandatory vaccination, then our family will not consider UNM as a real possibility.I hope you honor the personal choices of the New Mexicans and anyone interested in the program that UNM provides. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 92 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice To whom it may concern:I am in opposion of the policy regarding mandatory vaccinations! I find this absolutely appalling that this education system would even consider implementing those Personal Healthcare decisions! My grandchildren will be considering colleges in the near future and I will highly advise them not to consider the Unive rsity of New Mexi co if this is implemented! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceUNM I do not support the mandatory COVID vaccine to UNM student. The recovery rate is over 99% and it should be at choice. This is getting way out of hand. Why can a woman chose to abort a child because it's her body but we cannot chose to take th e so called vaccine. How many people take the flu vaccine each year? Please reconsider this. Thank you Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceYOU CANNOT FORCE SOMEONE TO TAKE A MEDICAL EXPERIMENT WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. THIS NOT ONLY GOES AGAINST OUR WESTERN VALUES AND THE CONSTITUTION BUT ALSO AGAINST THE NUREMBERG CODE FROM THE GENEVA CONVENTION. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThere is no reason to require this vaccine for students and staff. This \"pandemic \"Is hardly worthy of all these restricons. Please review the infection rate and death rates nationwide, worldwide, or statewide. This isn't the Black Death.Sincerely,Sent from my iPad Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Hello, I write you to respecully ask that you reconsider any language, policy, or action that would mandate any medical procedure (including injection, vaccination, immunization of biologic agent, or surveillance testing) for students and staff at your institution. As a native New Mexican, a mother with children who will enter college, and a healthc a re worker I feel obligated to advocate for our rights to medically autonomous decision making. We must value the freedom to bodily autonomy without coercion and the right to make our own medical choices. These choices will lead to discriminatory enrollment practices and targeted students and staff who chose alternatives for their healt h . Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Please stop this unconstuonal health threat. No vaccines for' cOvid' or anything related! No testing with PCR test kits that produce false positives, no shots, nothing....against US constuonal health!Our US cizens and those people who are living here in the US are not Human Test subjects! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 94 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoicePlease stop trying to take away our rights. Mandatory vaccination is discriminatory. Mandatory testing for people who receive vaccine exemptions is not acceptable. All people have a right to make their own medical choices.This new policy you are trying to enforce would lead me to disenroll or rule out UNM as a school for me and my family. This is not a wise policy! Let people make their own decisions.Again mandatory vaccinaon is not a good idea. Making people do something you want to please someone else or to look good is never right. This isn't even a true vaccine yet and doesn't protect like a true vaccine would. How about we focus on being clean and respect ful with our germs while they work on making this vaccine safer for all of us. Then you won't have to force it down people's throats.I hope you read this email. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoicePeople have the right to do their own Reseach and make their own medical decisions. This is a body given by God not man. We all go to college ans learn to make critical decisions. Health is one. Yours Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice We the people Live in the United States of America! When did it become a place where we aren't allowed to go to school if we don't take a vaccine? Why would we want to be apart of the problem and become the solution. We all have medical and religious freedoms. Coming from a schoo l that could easily promote abortions and work on aborted fetuses but won't allow students to attend school because of a mandate that you have control over.

We are living history, yet our understanding of the sequence of events since January 2020 has been blurred.Worldwide, people have been misled both by their governments and the media as to the causes and devastating consequences of the Covid19 \"pandemic\".The unspoken truth is that the novel coronavirus provides a pretext and a justification to powerful financial interests and corrupt politicians to precipitate the entire World into a spiral of mass unemployment, bankruptcy, extreme poverty and despair. More than 7 billion people Worldwide are directly or indirectly affected by the corona crisis.The COVID19 public health \"emergency\" under WHO Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 97 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceWith a 99.7% recovery rate from COVID19 why would anyone even consider an untested vaccine? When you consider all the tainted and false positives with the testing, everything from heart attacks and motorcycle accidents being counted as COVID deaths because the hospitals no longer have character, honor or principl e when fa ced with a choice of truth vs up to $53,000 per COVID positive patient if place on a ventilator, who would believe anything the medical community ever said again? Dr Fauci's first act in his position in 1985 was to get liability immunity for pharmaceutical compan ies and when told to stop his work on 'gain of functio n' (making a virus more deadly) he takes the project to Wuhan, China. Does anyone believe the people in the labs where this thing was said to be cooked up, wear the masks you and I are told to wear? Why are the Doctors th at counter the main stream narrative concerning the safety of the vaccines censored? They will tell you the masks is like trying to stop a mosquito going through a chain link fence. Countries around the world are recognizing the issues with the vaccines and banning them. While thos e with compromised immune systems (usually the elderly) can die from this virus just like thousands die in this country and around the world every year from whatever virus happens to be around that year, why is it that we never got so concerned about it before? Because the main thrus t of COV ID19 has never been about the medical concern, that was the guise, the catalyst to bring about the real end game of economic destruction to the U.S. by an admitted enemy and the total control of everything you and I do by those behind this global agenda. Unfortunately aided by the 'go alo ng to get along' crowd all the way down the line. What does that say for institutions of higher learning that know better and those in their leadership positions? Have we no longer the appetite to push back against tyranny and peacefully, yet firmly, refuse this vaccine? If you don' t understand that this is a question of liberty and that there is never an easy way or convenient time to counter oppression, and think if given enough time it will all go away, you are more naive than you ought to be. It will never be easy dec ision to counter this, but easier now than it will be later, if not impossible later. We need leaders to step up and be leaders of liberty. Naivete is no virtue. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoicePersonally I believe that taking the covid 19 vaccine should be a choice not a requirement. Not everyone wants the vaccine and being forced to take it is not right. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 101 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMandatory vaccination is discriminatory and as human beings, we have the right to make our own medical choices. Forcing a vaccine is comparable to forcing someone to practice medicine without having a license. Is this what UNM is encouraging? What about individuals who have already had the virus and have natural immun i ty? Aren't we all entitled to make our own choices for our own health as we see t?As an individual who has family who attends school at UNM and someone who has been considering furthering my education at UNM, I am strongly petitioning against a move like this. This policy would lead me to disenroll and cause us to not participate in supporting UNM in any way. Please consider the personal choice and decisions of others and the affect your decision will have on our community and our local economy. Thank you for your consideration. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am extremely opposed to mandating a vaccine in order to attend your school. Please allow Americans the right to choose whether they should or should not be vaccinated. This is a very personal choice. I have 3 teens who may want to attend your school in the future. At this point we are not planning on being vaccinated and don't want to lose the opportunity to attend your school because of this choice. Thank you for your considera on.Sincerely, Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am greatly concerned to hear that you are considering a mandatory vaccination policy. Such a policy would be discriminatory! How dare you try to impose mandatory vaccination! All people have a right to choose what medical procedures to undergo, and you cannot discriminate against people for exercising this right. Many people already have natural immunity to this virus, and many others prefer to use alternative treatment strategies. Plus, the CDC has expressly said that these vaccines have not been tested on pregnant or lactating women, immunocompromised people, or people with autoimmune condions.As of April 16, the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System database has 86,080 negative reactions that have been reported for COVID19 vaccines, including 3,186 deaths including an 18yearold who died 3 days after vaccination. Informed consent without coercion or threat is absolutely essenal to our free society. If this mandatory vaccination policy is approved, I will advise my niece in Albuquerque (who is graduating from high school this year and determining which college she will attend) to strike UNM from the list of schools to consider. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 102 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThis is to express my strong disagreement with a mandatory vaccination requirement for staff and students for COVID 19.1.COVID has a 99.7 recovery rate; most fatalies occur only in the aged (70+), and then only in those with comorbidities. Serious illness or death is largely nonexistent in other demographic groups. There is NO NEED for the young and healthy to be vaccinated against this virus.2.mRNS vaccines are purely experimental; they are authorized for use only under emergency procedures and therefore cannot be lawfully required to be taken. All forms of COVID19 vaccines are mRNA and are experimental. Compelling individuals to take these violates Nuremburg Convenons.3.If the vaccines are eecve, then those who chose to take them are protected and have nothing to fear from those who do not take them. If they are not effective, then there is no reason anyone should take them as they provide no protection against any disease.4.There is no such thing as asymptoma c spread; this was floated as a theory early on in the socalled pandemic; but is contradicted by all scientific journals. If a person does not have a high enough viral load to show symptoms, they do not have a high enough viral load to spread disease.5.My body; my right. No one should be compelled to take medical treatments that violated their religious or other personal objection; mandatory vaccinaons for COVID are discriminatory. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice PLEASE VOTE AGAINST MANDATORY VACCINATIONS.GOD BLESS OUR FREE AMERICANS AND CHOICE!!!! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIt has come to my attention that the University of New Mexico is considering a policy of mandatory vaccinations for staff and students alike. I want to express my and my organizaon's strong opposion to this proposed policy. The COVID 19 pandemic was a frustrating and challenging time for all of us, but forcing people who work and go to UNM to be vaccinated against this virus is simply not the correct path forward for the school. Vaccine passports and the like are not the right path forwar d for our society either. Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory. All people have a right to make their own medical choices. There is no public policy that will lead to perfect safety. But mandates and vaccine passports will have clear, negative impacts on our medical freedom. Thank you for your me. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 104 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Dear UNM associates,I understand that mandatory vaccinaons may be implemented at UNM. As a concerned citizen, I would like to express my opinion in this matter. To require vaccinations for attendance is to discriminate against those who choose not to get the vaccination. Or else, to enforce such makes one have to choose the ir education over their right to choose what happens to their bodies. Taking away this choice is the part of the inevitable domino effect of having our freedoms taken from us. Eventually, this vaccine will be forced upon everyone and then what else? Some might think to not get the vaccine as selfish, putting lives at stake for something so simple. But it isn't so simple. It's our freedom that is at stake, and isn't that more important? If I can send my husband to Afgha nistan to possi bly die for someone else's freedom, isn't this risk worth my freedom? I hope that you will all take this matter seriously and consider these concerns as I am not the only one with them.Thank you for your me in reading this,ArielSent from my iPhone Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceWe should not be allowing our communities, schools, places of employment to ostracize citizens that CHOOSE not to vaccinate. We have a CHOICE to choose in this Great Nation and State. I ask that you do not FORCE mandatory vaccines on the staff and students of UNM. You WILL be taking away our freedom to choose our own medical and religious choices. We have a VOICE, rights and liberes to live peaceable how we choose. Melissa Guerrez We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; ... Tomas Jefferson Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceProposing mandatory vaccines is disgusting, unconstitutional & puts us all in danger since it has been scientifically proven that vaccinated people SHED the covid 19 virus & uninfected people can then contract it from vaccinated people. Don't be a fascist institution or patriots will certainly make sure your campus ha s anti vax protests & all your funding will be stripped. This ridiculous idea does more harm than good. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI can not agree with a mandate. If you choose to receive a vaccination that is your choice. There is not nearly enough information to prove the long term effects of a brand new, never used type of vaccination. We have gone over a year and already prov en that we can be smart and protect ourselves and others from the virus, unless the last year has been a lie. If UNM proceeds with these restrictions my children will be taking our money elsewhere. There are many other institutions that can provide an education. Let educated and smart people make their own de cisions. Do not force people to comply with your wants. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 107 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am absolutely against this mandatory vaccination in order to attend UNM in person. For the past year and a half this school has continued to charge its students nonreduced tuition and fee costs while significantly reducing the quality of the education programs and accessibility of facili t ies. The faculty has not met the challenges to provide solid (forced)online learning curriculum, guidance, and just plain good teaching to help these students through this very difficult time both academically abs mentally. The students are teaching themselves and the professors skate through just making demands without offering a proper educat i on. Violating rights and enforcing receiving a vaccination, that while on the surface seems safe and effective, but could have long term impacts that are not yet known, is checking a box to cow to the governor and the narrative so called experts have used to control. If you impos e this ru le and force those who are making a choice with their own bodies to receive the vaccine, the school had better lower tuition costs to full time online learners. I'm just appalled. Thank goodness the local K12 schools did not follow these same thought processes. If individual UNM staff, facul t y, and students CHOOSE to get vaccinated because they are concerned for their health, I fully support that CHOICE! But taking away our rights and punishing when noncompliant, I DO NOT SUPPORT! Can this institution afford to lose students to those universities out of state not imposing such authorita rian dicta tes? Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMy current senior in high school, from Sioux Falls SD, has applied and been accepted to UNM in Fall 2021. As a parent, I am horrified that UNM would require people to take an experimental vaccine with undetermined longterm side effects as a condition of enro llment to the school. Th is is dispicable. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI am writing as a mother of a UNM student and as a member of the Albuquerque community. I want to express my opposition to UNM's proposed vaccination policy. I ask you to please consider the following: 1. The human vaccine trials will not end unl 2023.2. The vaccines are NOT FDA approved.3. Medical decisions belong to the individual alone, and cannot be dictated by the University.4. Requiring vaccinaon in order to reenroll at UNM is discriminatory. My daughter will be forced to transfer to a University in Texas if this policy is put into place. 5. We are no longer in a pandemic. Our situation in endemic, that is, contained. The new map for NM indicates that the majority of the state is at the turquoise level, which is an indication that New Mexicans are on their way to normalcy again.6. There is no agreement on the administered vaccine percentage required to create herd immunity, especially since the survivors already have antibodies. As of this writing, 45% of NM population is vaccinated. By the proposed August 2nd deadline, these percentages will be much higher, further weakening the case for ma ndatory vaccinaon.Please do not approve the proposed policy on mandatory vaccinations for UNM. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 108 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; I disagree with forcing anyone to get a vaccine!Every employee and student should have a choice. I will never send my children to any school that forces them to vaccinate. Do you realize the true science says people who have had Covid have antibodies and the vaccine is worthless in these cases? What happened to my body, my choice?We're not forced to get a flu shot to aend school and more people die from the flu each year. I think it's even more ridiculous that online sta and students have to vaccinate!If it was that great people wouldn't have to be bribed to get it! That should be enough common sense. Nobody knows what the long term affects are so stand up and let each individual decide not the pressure of government!!! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Greengs UNM sta,Word has goen out that you are considering mandating these experimental injections for staff and students. Despite the fact that FDA \"emergency authorized use\" is NOT FDA approval, and that the Nuremberg Code exists.There are plenty of people who have legitimate medical, religious and personal reasons for not wanting to offer themselves up as guinea pigs for criminal, historically fraudulent oligarchs like Pfizer and Moderna, who shouldn't be allowed to do business on planet Earth given their history of decepti on, corruption and straightup murder.You've clearly NOT done your due diligence into the reality of this virus (99.7% recovery rate), or the history of these injection manufacturers, let alone the danger of these injections, which include aborted fetal tissue, heavy metals and DNA mangling technology. As such, it is utterly egregious that you would think to mandate thes e experimental injections for your students and sta.While the pharmaceu cal cabals are indemnified against the lawsuits that the death and injury their injections are already causing would otherwise inspire, YOU are not.Not only would the mandang of these experimental injections violate every international human rights law on the books, but it would render you EXTREMELY vulnerable to a slew of lawsuits, which would likely bankrupt both the school, as well as all the leadership who would make this insane decision.Thank you for coming to your senses, and for honoring the rights and choice of your staff and students. It would be smart to catch yourself up to speed as to the history of these injections and their manufacturers before taking it upon yourself to do their geno ci dal bidding for them, while dishonoring your community.AB Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 109 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Hello UNM President & Administra on, You may or may not be able to STOP this mandatory vaccine push but I have done a lot of research and this vaccine hurts our immune systems, spikes your proteins and causes your T killer cells to fight against themselves.

The beauty of New Mexico can not even be captured in a lens because it is so disarmingly stunning.The second thing I saw hovering over your population, was a blanket of fear. It occurred to me that you all live many many feet above sea level. Oxygen is already in short supply. The fear amongst your people created off balance behaviors. This was experienced in very unpleasan t wa ys by me and a friend. As tourists we le withcompassion and thought perhaps a year of masks, and further oxygen deprivaon,was the cause of the mass fear. The billboard campaign could have added to thedecline in crical thinking as well. A friend from NM has alerted me of the new measures being considered at UNM.We are one United States so yes, this effecting NM effects us all. Human rights are under attack in NM, NY across this country and on a global scale. That is why I am sending this letter. Stop and look out of your windows. Is distancing ourselves from the glory of natu re really wise ? There are many who believe in natural medicine. As one of those folks I also respect those who disagree with me. I do not respect those who disrespect the United States Constitution. I sometimes comment on instagram. I recently commented about revisiting history through the WW2 fil ms made between 1938 and 1946. There in lies the key to how an entire people can be forced into camps, into ghettos, into experimental chemical meds, into time lines that seem so disgraceful that they seem fictional. Taking away rights to an education based on religious or medical exceptions to a cen tralized belief is not fiction, it is dangerous pure and simple. I have been experiencing my faith, in the courage of human kind, fade. There are those who know they can make a difference but do not. Where does fear end, and the realization of what the implicaons are if a stand is not taken, then begin ?As educators, parents, citizens of a country built on freedoms.... I ask again, where does fear end, and the realization of what the implicaons are ( to mandatory inoculaons) then begin ?There are many alternatives to bullying, to ending dreams of learning, to iron clad rules that trample on our US Constitution. Use the alternatives, your creativity and preserve the liberty of those who write tuition checks. Use your critical thinking and your knowledge of his tory to breath in some oxygen before Mandating something that, in the future, could very well read as quite tragic and finite in our history. We are living in unprecedented times that require courageous safeguards.An alarmed cizen,CSSent from my iPad Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 111 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceHow ridiculous of an idea to FORCE people a medical procedure on students. You are selfish as an educational organization. You should be ashamed. Good luck getting students. Y'all are as about brainwashed as it gets. You probably didn't know this joke virus has a 99% survival rate fo r students who are in the college age?! You're telling me you're getting a shot to protect you from a virus you haven't had all year? I truthfully can't believe it. You need to wake up before it's too late. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceA mandatory vaccine is an infringement on freedom of choice. Your staff and your students should not be placed in this conundrum. My children are on the verge of applying to universities and have always strongly considered UNM a top choice, but if this mandate is passed we will no longer suppo rt you. I hope administration considers the lives and domino effects of this decision. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice To whom it may concern,I was recently informed that UNM may make the Covid19 vaccine a requirement for students and faculty. Please reconsider. New Mexico has current legislation that allows for the exemption of vaccination for religious purposes. Those that may utilize this right would be forced to disenroll or seek schooling elsewhere. Furthermore, those that chose not to get the vaccine for other reasons would be marginalized and discriminated against. Other reasons someone may choose not to get the vaccine...Personal conviconsAllergyPregnancy and breast feeding (future or current)Cultural restric onsOther health concernsIt is sll in the only stageIt is sll in the tesng phaseEtc.All of these reasons are deeply personal. Even in the event that exemptions were accepted, it is in violation of a persons medical privacy and personal rights to disclose why they would deny the vaccine. Please consider your current students and future students that would miss out on the precious oppor tunity of higher education if vaccination becomes a requirement.Sincerely,A fellow New Mexico cizen Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice All people have a right to make their own medical choices. Nazi like requirements not funded by alumni. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choicehttps://aapsonline.org/open letterfromphysicians touniversities reversecovidvaccinemandates/ Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI disagree strongly with this plan. I, for one, do not plan on getting the vaccine due to many reasons and for this to be a determining factor in returning to campus has me furious. I took a year off school until we could return to in perso n learning, but I will not be continuing my education at UNM if this policy is in place. I know I speak for more than myself when I say that. Thank you for your time. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 112 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceYou have stated that this policy is made with the assumption that health conditions will improve and that a significate proportion of students and staff will be vaccinated, which at first glance makes the requirement moot. Additional information and reasoning would be appreciated. Also I would really prefer if there is mentio n of stu dents and staff able to have room to intelligently discuss the issues that educated people have about the vaccine and the surrounding issues.In your FAQ you responded to the queson of \"how will I know if my coworkers or fellow students are going unvaccinated\" with a \"...however, there may be badge attachments, stickers...\" comes across as you encouraging others to announce that they are vaccinated. This will make those who are unva ccinated stand out . Will you also be including in your policy ways to fight against the discrimination, bullying and or ostracizing that will probably occur due to this? People may not be able to get vaccinated due to a number of medical reasons that they should not be made anxious about, nor should they be haras sed or feel the need to explain what may be a personal medical and private issue in order to be accepted. Will you be including in your policy antireligious discrimination policy for those who feel spiritually convicted (and not because they don't care about others) to not be able to take the vaccine?Currently vaccines are being paid by the government, but this will be another additional cost for those students who struggle with health insurance and other bills already. This would be an area to check into if the cost of vaccines end up being expensive.For your asymptomatic surveillance, will you be questions students and staff if they are vaccinated and only choosing those who are unvaccinated? Will there be privacy policies for these students (both unvaccinated and vaccinated) and staff? Will UNM be doing asymptomatic surveillance even if the city/s tate does no t require or need it?Will you be including a date for this policy to expire? If not, will you be including a required reevaluaon?Thank you for your time and consideration for ALL your students and staff Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceEncouragement is great, but disagree with mandatory. This infringes in personal medical choice rights. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Dear UNM Provost, Good Morning, I am wring to ask as to Why your faculty is enforcing ALL people in the UNM area to be Vaccinated? Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory!!!ALL people including yourself have the right to make their OWN choices!!! Sit and think as to why this is normal for anyone to push unknown chemicals on or in peoples' bodies???Thank you for your me Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 115 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Greengs, I am a resident here in Portales, NM and I would like to express my absolute outrage that you're considering mandating vaccinations. Education should be available to people of all beliefs, religions, colors, and class. What gives you the right to deny education to people who desire bodily autonomy, and who feel dierently than you do about COVID 19?If you feel so strongly about safety, I advise you to find another way, such as separating vaccinated and unvaccinated classes, but to entirely ban the unvaccinated from your school is unacceptable and goes against everything we stand for as Americans and New Mexicans.You are discriminating, same as the Jim Crow laws discriminated against Americans based solely on the color of their skin. Your proposal is a complete reversal of all the Civil Rights movements our parents championed, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.I will say this, if you persist in this, I will throw everything I have behind any movement to keep you away from our tax dollars, as this kind of discrimination has no place in our society, and should never be funded by the People of this State, or this Nation. I will also encourage eve ryone I know not to attend your school as you are an enemy of human rights. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI just took my daughter out of a CA college to attend UNM in the Fall. I have asked several staff in admissions about mandating vaccines to attend in the Fall. I was told repeatedly itv was HIGHLY unlikely, which is why I enrolled my daughter. Please do not manda te a vaccine that is under EUA and not FDA approved. I think the vaccine should be encouraged but not mandated. My daughter should be allowed to do weekly covid testing if needed but not forced to get a vaccine. I am pleading you not to change your policy and deny my daughter a cha nce to go to college in the Fall. If you do change your policy i would want a full refund as this changes everything. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM Policy Makers,I just learned of your proposed Mandatory COVID Vaccinaon Policy.Something like this may be in all our futures, but right now it is too soon. This policy at this me is highly controversial, scary, and discriminatory. It would be best if you wait, give it some time, wait for more research data.. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 117 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyMy daughter attends UNM living at home not on campus. We do not feel comfortable getting the vaccine when long term studies haven't been conducted. We have a high history of mulple sclerosis in our family and it has been known to lie dormant and could easily be triggered by a vaccine, such as a flu vaccine and covid vaccine. We have people we personally know that this has happened to. We feel the risks of the unknown are great er than the risks of covid. We would rather adhere to covid tesng as often as necessary to prove negative results rather than be mandated to take a vaccine that should be our personal choice. Especially with cases decreasing and the worst behind us,. I don't feel it should be made a requirement for in person courses. There is no way to control the people on campus going to Popejoy hall and other area of the campus for events so how can UNM jusfy this requirement for students? It is our body and should be our choice. I work for the public school system in NM and it is oponal for sta and students. That's how it should remain. I feel UNM will lose many students if this mandate is passed. I feel it is becoming safer to be in public settings as we have now progressed into green and turquoise and movie theaters and other businesses are opening up fully . There is no guarantee that the vaccine will be 100% effective, just like the flu vaccine is not 100%. It's a virus with 99% recovery rate. It should not be mandated nor be required. The students are paying a lot of money for their educaon and should have the choice! It is not any more dangerous than going to Walmart or the mall, or a movie theater or flying. Any public place poses the risk of exposure but if taking precautions with PPE, that should provide the necessary protection for those in a classroom without havin g to have the.vaccine. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 118 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To Whom it May Concern:It is my duty and authority as a resident of the State of New Mexico, and parent to respond to your proposed tyrannical, unconstitutional and discriminatory vaccine mandate. As one who has paid nearly 100K$'s into the coffers of UNM for tuition, fees, books and other assorted costs associated with one of my children r eceiving a UNM medical school degree it is incumbent on me to impress on you the many reasons to stop this foolish overreach and abuse of power that your proposed policy chooses to exploit. Here are just a few:Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory.All people have a right to make their own medical choices, as clearly stated and cautioned to be aware of those who would deny them, by our founding fathers in the US constuon.If the experimental vaccines are so effective, there should be no concern by those who have been vaccinated about being exposed to the CV19 virus. Accordingly, forced vaccinaons are clearly irraonal and unjused.If your attached policy is implemented I nor my spouse will choose to have any elective or required medical procedures performed at any UNM facility as long as the policy is in force.If implemented I will advise, any who inquire, to avoid any and all contact with UNM as this policy is a strong indicator of UNM's dictatorial and oppressive conviction. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To UNM: As a resident of New Mexico, I am appalled that UN mis considering making a covid vaccine mandatory for students and faculty. I am not an alumnus of the university, but I do have children that will start graduating starting next year. We are currently looking at colleges for my oldest daughter. If UNM ma kes this vaccine mandatory it will make a college decision a little easier for my family as we can no longer consider UNM as an option. I have a total of 6 children, all of whom I would hope plan on furthering their education. I would not consider UNM at any point as an opon if this is made mandatory for any period. Mandating medical treatments, especially on which is not approved by the FDA (only emergency approved) is just wrong. Medical decisions should be a personal matter and decided by an individual. I have no problem with vaccines in general but feel that the co vid vaccine was rushed and may have long term effects that are not seen. The fact that it only has emergency approval warrants further consideration before I would take a vaccine or any medical treatment. Most of the students who would be attending college are young and what risks would out weig ht the bene ts of the vaccine. If the vaccine is made mandatory, I will also not attend any events for UNM. While I do not attend all sporting events, I have been to football games and basketball games in previous years. I can ensure there will not be continued support from myself or hous ehold. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 119 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyDear All Who are Part of this University but Do Not Research or Stand Up for Health, just for MONETARY ISSUES: The vaccinated are harming the unvaccinated.The push to make certain people don't get the truth is EXTENSIVE.Nothing is more important right now than to push these EXPERIMENTAL VACCINES. Young men in their 20s cannot get it up anymore because they were vaccinated. My friend overheard to young men in their 20s speaking in the gym and one said after he got the vaccine he couldn't perform. The vaccines attack the immune systems of the unvaccinated. My friend's friend who is 64 wrote her to let her know that after menopause it began again. No, she didn't get the vaccine but she spent time with her daughter's motherinlaw who did and she was in close proximity and her period began again and went for 8 days aer years of none at all.My FB friend from Australia had her period for 4 weeks and she didn't have a vaccine either but spent time close to someone who did. She went to the hospital and they told her she didn't even have enough blood to get a blood sample. Perhaps eventually they did but whe n she posted that, my FB friends started praying for her. She came home from the hospital and is seeing a specialist today.All of the INJECTIONS of foreign genetic matter contain the SPIKED PROTEIN that causes Sars Cov2, which is Covid. All of them do. The reproductive systems of women are at stake, as well as men.Non vaxxed people cannot be in close proximity with the vaxxed for extended periods of time. Children of the vaxxed are getting black and blue toes and bloody noses from their very own parents.I hope someone sues the pants o of you.Or beer yet, I hope someone in this group of emails does some research and pulls back from considering mandatory vaccines for all connected to the University. I know the monetary system runs the university and money is king and not education or truth but if there is an integrous person amongst yo u, I hope he or she fights hard. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 121 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM Fellows,A er WW2, there were trials in Nuremberg, which outlawed any medical procedure being performed on people against their will. You cannot disregard this and try to make a policy that forces injecons upon people.Are you not aware that this vaccine is experimental? As such, it definitely cannot be vetted, and you are likely to have some liability in this matter should you attempt to proceed, and people begin to have adverse reacons.Are you not aware that there are numerous deaths already associatedwith this \"vaccine\"? It is esmated that incidents(Approaching 3000 deaths now) reported to the VAERS system(part of CDC) only represent 10% of the actual adverse incidents.Please wake up! You are becoming part of the plan that WILL NOT have a bene cial outcome for Humanity.Please do a lot more research ASAP .How do you explain such dramac steps that we have taken to battle a virus from which 99.9% infected recover? If you will please open your eyes, you will see this for what it is, and realize that you are on the wrong side if you actually care about human beings. If you really want to be part of this in the capacity that you are entertaining, God Help Your Souls, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 122 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dr. Holloway: I am deeply disappointed and shocked that UNM is choosing to violate the rights of all personnel accessing university resources in person by forcing them to take the covid injecon. Are you unaware that this is discrimina on?As a doctorallevel Epidemiologist, former Public Health Professional and Medical Researcher, I have been researching since last year the pharmaceutical products that are now being referred to as covid \"vaccines.\" You must be aware that covid injections are not actually \"vaccines\" but are more akin to ex perimental drugs or gene treatments. These two facts should be enough for UNM to act in good conscience and suspend its unjust and discriminatory covid injection mandate. The UNM personnel making this mandatory decision have the responsibility to actually look at the facts concerning what these shots are pu tting into people's bodies as well as the pharmaceutical companies' THEORIES as to how they MAY work in the human body.Surely you know that these injections have not been approved. \"Emergency Use Authorization\" is a far cry from actual FDA approval. This fact turns all covidinjected people into the \"guinea pigs\" (or other lab animals) that the covid injection manufacturers chose not to test these new products on. This, in turn, profoundly violates long standing safety protocols, as you likely know.In addion, all UNM covid mandate decisionmakers must also be aware of the many recent reports of healthy noncovidinjected people suddenly becoming ill after spending time with covidinjected people? If you believe that such transmission or transfection from injected to noninjected people is prep osterous, I advise you to read the Pfizer covid injection product proposal, which discusses in detail how such transmission can (and does) occur.How can UNM choose to force people to give up their bodily integrity and bow to UNM orders? Didn't UNM consider how its mandate colludes in making UNM personnel helpless victims in this massive human experiment? This UNM decision makes the university and its decisionmakers culpable for all harm that ensues.I call upon all UNM personnel involved in creating this medical mandate to reverse this profoundly harmful and discriminatory decision. UNM must then prove to its community that all of you respect the community and recognize every individual's rights, including each person's inalienable right to make their own health choices with out duress, mandate or any outside pressure. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 123 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI understand that UNM is looking into a mandatory vaccination requirement for staff and students. This is a discriminatory practice at best and blatant disregard for people at worst. People should have the right to make their own medical choices, whether it's just because they do not want the service provided or be cause they have a preexisting condition preventing them from having the service provided. I have a student that is coming up to college age and would not even have UNM be a consideration if vaccinaon will be a mandatory pracce for students and sta. Please consider that America was founded on the principals of freedom and by making vaccination mandatory, you are removing those freedoms, which seem to be disappearing at a frightening pace these days. Stand against the de and keep medical procedures a choice for your staff and students. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM President, Administra on and Sta: Mandatory vaccination is discriminatory and should never be forced on students or any Americans. We know now that the \"vaccines\" are experimental and have not been approved by the FDA. You are endangering the health of your students and staff by mandang the \"vaccine\". Please do not do this. These experimental \"vaccines\" are causing death and sickness across the world. Please research the opposition standpoint by many mainstream healthcare professionals around the world including Frontline Doctors, Dr. Mercola, Dr. Tenpenny, Dr. Judy Mikovits, Dr. Jim Meehan, Dr. Thomas Levy, etc. In this country, all people have a right to make their own medical choices. Not only is it unethical, but It is highly unlawful and against many statutory laws to even consider this criminal activity of forcing students and staff to potentially harm their bodies when it doesn't pro tect against the virus. It actually can make a person shed the virus to others. Don't believe it? Just do some honest research outside of the current polical/government/medical media culture. We have many UNM Alumni in our family, as well as family and friends currently attending school there. We are appalled that you would put them into a dangerous position like this. They may have to decide to quit their studies or endanger their health by taking an experi mental shot. You are infringing their rights over their own bodies if you do this. This is a civil rights issue of the highest importance. Remember, \"My body, my choice.\"? We will urge our grandchildren not to aend UNM if this injusce occurs.As taxpayers and citizens of New Mexico for many years, we strongly request you to retract this path of nonsense and instead make a decision to protect and advocate for the rights and health of our students and staff, and citizens of New Mexico. It is up to UNM leade rs to fight and resist this tyranny of the great reset and globalism, and let's face it, downright communism. We don't want any of this in New Mexico or in our country. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 124 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Director Hule:I am deeply disappointed and shocked that UNM is choosing to violate the rights of all personnel accessing university resources in person by forcing them to take the covid injecon. Are you aware that this is discrimina on?As a doctorallevel Epidemiologist, former Public Health Professional and Medical Researcher, I have been researching since last year the pharmaceutical products that are now being referred to as covid \"vaccines.\" Are you aware that covid injections are not actually \"vaccines\" but are more akin to expe rimental drugs or gene treatments? These two facts should be enough for UNM to act in good conscience and suspend its unjust and discriminatory covid injection mandate. The UNM personnel making this decision have the responsibility to actually look at the facts concerning what these shots are putti ng into peop le's bodies as well as the pharmaceutical companies' THEORIES as to how they MAY work in the human body.Surely you know that these injecons have not been approved. \"Emergency Use Authorization\" is a far cry from actual FDA approval. This fact turns all covidinjected people into the \"guinea pigs\" (or other lab animals) that the covid injection manufacturers chose not to test these new products on. This, in turn, profoundly violates longstanding safety protocols.In addition, UNM covid mandate decisionmakers must be aware of the many recent reports of healthy noncovidinjected people suddenly becoming ill after spending time with covidinjected people. If you believe that such transmission or transfection from injected to noninjected people is prep osterous, I suggest you to re ad the Pfizer covid injection product proposal, which discusses in detail how such transmission can (and does) occur.How can UNM choose to force people to give up their bodily integrity and bow to UNM orders? Didn't UNM consider how its mandate colludes in making UNM personnel helpless victims in this massive human experiment?

UNM must then prove to its community that all of you respect the community and recognize every individual's rights, including each person's inalienable right to make their own health choices without duress, mandate or any outside pressure.And, rest assured, I will never consider enrolling in any UNM program for any reason with such a discriminatory and unjustifiable decision in place. And, I would similarly never recommend a UNM program to anyone for any reason.Sincerely, D.

My nephew is a UNM student. If he is faced with a forced vaccination, I will encourage him to continue his education at a school that will respect his right s as a free man. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 127 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM Admissions,This email serves to voice my concerns (and many others in our state) of the proposed policy on mandatory vaccinations. My granddaughter just decided to attend UNM this fall from among several other college choices. She was prepared to quit her job a few months ago if the covid shot was re quired, which it was not. She realizes that the covid shot is experimental and not FDA approved. She is aware of the risk of becoming sterile with the covid shot. If UNM goes forward with this policy, I will be encouraging her to go elsewhere for her education. Below are the points re garding your proposed policy and \"mandatory vaccinaons.\"Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory. All people have a right to make their own medical choices and to keep those choices private (HIPPA laws)mandatory vaccinaon is unconstuonalthe covid19 shots are not FDA approved. They are being tested on humans with many devastating consequences currently, and many that will become apparent in the next year, including death.There are reports coming out that unvaccinated people are having adverse symptoms from being around covid vaccinated individuals, including blood clotting issues, miscarriages, etc. So it is possible that the vaccinated are a risk to the nonvaccinated. This is a human experiment. Regarding accommoda ons in your proposed policy, nonvaccinated may be required to participate in or implement additional CSPs \"to mitigate risk to others,\" is basically stating that the shots don't give the vaccinated any bene t or protecon.I have seen the following statement in medical records regarding the covid19 PCR test. \"The covid 19 PCR test is for in vitro diagnostic use under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). This test has not been FDA cleared or approved.\" Considering this, the test cannot be forced upon anyone as well. Thank you for your me and considera on in not creating this policy that would be heading down the path that was taken in Germany many years ago with devastating consequences. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI live in New mexico, I really am sad to think that Unm is possibly mandating the vaccines. Its not a good decision, for 3 reasons. 1. It's their body. No one should have the right to mandate a somewhat, experimental vaccine, on anyone. ( SOME PPL HAVE HAD RANDOM ill eects.) 2. Apparently the vaccine hasn't even been stamped, with approval by our Fda. How can this action be legal.3. Each individual, should always be assured of their rights as free cizens. If we even.. sll have rights in our country. ( with all this moronic, cultlike... cancel culture .) Then, the right to refuse a vaccine.. is included. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 128 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To whom it may concern,My daughter is a senior in high school, my son is a sophomore. They will be going to instate colleges, focusing on the degree best suited for each. My daughter has her sights set on becoming a nurse, and will be attending ENMU Roswell, for the first several years. My son is looking at teaching or political science. We are still undecided where he will aend.There is a good chance one, or both, may be looking at UNM, in a year or so, but the mandatory covid19 vaccinations will be a deal breaker and we will look elsewhere, or possibly online or trade school.The vaccine is sll in clinical trials, sll unapproved by the FDA, still experimental, still consider an emergency vaccine. I am not an antivaxxer, but I am a selectivevaxxer after my best friend got GuillainBarr\u00e9 syndrome after getting a routine flu shot six years ago. She still deals wi th the after effects of paralysis and limited mobility. And that is from a vaccine that had been in research and development for decades.The covid vaccine consists of some research on a broader scale, and the vaccines available are either the two/three shot mRNA from Pfizer or Moderna, or the one shot Johnson and Johnson (which, to my understanding has been halted due to blood clot issues), but they stopped the double blin d control group testing far too soon, along with unprecedented shortcut safety issues, to churn these vaccines out quickly.Yet, it's for an illness that have proven not to have a high mortality rate, hospitalization rate, or injury/damage rate for the normal person with a healthy immune system. Our family had it in December of 2019. Three out of four of us were very sick for three weeks, the fourth never had any symptoms. All of us have the natural antibodies. Why would any of us be forced to have the vaccine?It comes down to sovereignty. Who owns our bodies? It comes down to free market and private businesses doing as they think best for their organization or company. If you choose to move forward with force, don't be surprised to have protesters voice their concerns with equal energy.I ask you to reconsider your stance and the impact it will have on the availability to educate those wanting to grow their knowledge with higher education. Allow these adults to make the decision of what's best for them and their bodies.This hits very close to home for me, personally, as my mother survived Hitler and Nazi occupation. We do not want to repeat that history. We. Do. Not. Want. To. Repeat. That. History.Thank you for your me. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI am very disappoint to read the UNM wants to force students and staff to get a vaccine. Being an education institution, please allow students and staff to make an educated decision if they want the vaccine, especially in light of the adverse reactions (e.g. blood clots). I am a RN and I supp ort and advo cate for medical rights. You are taking away the most essential right of all: freedom. Please do not have this policy, give your students and staff the right to choice. Epifania Saure e, community member Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 129 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear Admissions Department, I understand UNM is considering a mandatory vaccinaon program. This would be a terrible mistake, akin to requiring everyone to use contraception, or attend a certain church, or not attend a certain church, or declare themself transgender, or have a colonoscopy. It would be a violation of individual rights, of privacy, of medical freedom, and of a person's control over his or her own body. We know that none of the vaccinations are safe; they are maiming and killing many people around the world. Vaccine makers have no liability, and under our current vaccination schedule there are more children with learning disabilies and ausm than ever before. Covid19 is not a significant health threat at this time, with a 99.85% survival rate. Its fatality rate of 0.15% is close to that of influenza's, which is 0.1%. Nowhere are flu vaccines mandatory. Thus covid 19 vaccines are completely unnecessary. See this March 2021 study: hps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13554Reconcili ng estimates of global spread and infection fatality rates of COVID19: An overview of systematic evaluations Ioannidis European Journal of Clinical Investigation Wiley Online LibraryAbstract Background Esmates of community spread and infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID19 have varied across studies. Efforts to synthesize the evidence reach seemingly discrepant conclusions...onlinelibrary.wiley.com I will not allow my son to be vaccinated in order to attend UNM, as there are other schools that do not require vaccinations. I hope you will take a stand against the dangerous policy of requiring vaccines for students, faculty, or sta. Thank you, and please reply. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 130 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI think it is a HORRIBLE IDEA to require the covid19 vaccination for all students to enter the campus next year! This vaccine has only been given to the American and world wide population under \"Emergency Use Authorizations\" and has NOT been fully FDA approved. These various vaccines have NOT undergone ANY sort of human longterm studies. Not a single one! The adverse reactions repo rted to the VAERS database for these vaccines is off the charts compared to \"routine\" vaccines such as Dtap, MMR, etc. You would potentially endanger your students by subjecting them to this mandatory policy! Also consider, receiving a vaccine especially an mRNA vaccinemust be considered a medical procedure. There's no way it can't be. Without long term safety studies in humans, these vaccines are still experimental especially the mRNA technology. The Nuremberg Code, which states that nobody shall be involved in a medical expe ri ment without their knowledge and consent, has been codified into Article 7 of the U.N's. Internaonal Covenant on Civil and Polical Rights: Arcle 7 No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scienc experimenta on.It is unethical, highly immoral, and and irresponsible for the University of New Mexico to even suggest mandating an experimental vaccine for which NO LONG TERM safety data has been gathered.If you want to make sure that people have tested negative before entering buildings in order to mitigate the chance of cases spreading in the future, that's one thing. But unvaccinated people ARE NOT A THREAT to the vaccinated. Correct? Additionally, the vaccines DO NOT PROVIDE IMMUNITY fro m covid19. They merely try and make \"symptoms lessened\" when a person is infected. Renk this policy! It is a BAD IDEA and it's shameful to even think that UNM would entertain it. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyAs a community member who has a son attending UNM, I would like to respectfully request that vaccines not be made mandatory for the upcoming fall semester. I have concerns about the safety and even the ethics involved in taking the some of the vaccines and would like to request that consid erati on be taken for those who have those concerns. The decision to take the vaccine or not should be left up to the individual, so that they can make educated decisions based on the facts and their own individual situation. Thank you for your considera on.

There are 15 reasons listed, but this space does not have room, so I have included some of them. https://aapsonline.org/open letterfromphysicians touniversities reversecovidvaccinemandates/Dear Deans, Governing Boards and Trustees,On behalf of the Associaon of American Physicians and Surgeons, I am writing to ask you to reconsider your new policy mandating COVID19 vaccination of students prior to returning to campus.[i] Institutions of higher learning are divided on this issue.[ii] ,[iii] Although, at first glance, the policy may seem prude nt, it coerces studen ts into bearing unneeded and unknown risk and is at heart contrary to the bedrock medical principle of informed consent.There are mulple reasons to reverse your policy. I ask you to consider the following:1. Young adults are a healthy and immunologically competent and vibrant group that is at, \"extraordinary low risk for COVID19 morbidity and mortality.\"[iv]3. Even though the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for three COVID19 vaccines, they are not FDA approved to treat, cure or prevent any disease at this time. Clinical trials will continue for at least two years before the FDA can even consider approval of these vaccines as eecve and safe.4. The COVID19 vaccines on the market in the U.S., mRNA (Moderna and Pfizer) and DNA (Johnson & Johnson - Janssen), have caused notable side effects, pathology and even death (>2300 deaths per VAERS as of April 20, 2021). These adverse reactions result in abs ence from school and work, hospital visits, and even loss of life.[vi]5. Collegeage women may be at unique risk for adverse events following administration of the experimental COVID vaccinations currently available. According to the CDC, all cases of lifethreatening blood clots, subsequent to receiving the J&J vaccine, reported so far in the United States, occurred in younger women.[vii] The vast majority of case s of anaphylaxis have also occurred in women.[viii] In addition, \"women are reporting having irregular menstrual cycles after getting the coronavirus vaccine,\"[ix] and 95 miscarriages have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID vaccinaon as of April 24, 2021.[x]9.Students and their families may justifiably believe these policies discriminate against individuals who aren't candidates for this vaccine, have pre existing conditions, previous COVID19 disease, cite religious objections, or are otherwise exercising their freewill choosing not to participate in this optional vaccine experiment. Refer to the Nuremb erg code from WWII, which requires individuals, \"to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force....\"[xvi]12. Colleges and Universies should consider whether they might be liable for damages, poor health outcomes, and loss of life due to mandatory COVID19 vaccination policies.[xvii]15. Informed consent is the standard for all medical interventions. The FDA factsheet for the healthcare provider reads, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 132 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety To Whom It May Concern:I urge you to seriously reconsider your policy on mandatory medical intervention with this experimental 'vaccine' and ongoing surveillance as a condition of admission and employment at your campus.If I may.Where is your conscience?Interfering with somebody's right to do what's best for their body, health and wellbeing is in violation of basic human rights.No pharmaceu cal product or procedure should ever be forced, particularly a fasttracked, experimental medium that is free from liability for any harm it might cause \u2014 be it a reaction, injury, including reproductive harm, or death. Young women and men attending your college who plan on having a family one day may be harmed from this experimental medium. Millions of doses of COVID19 vaccines have been administered in the USA thus far. As of April 8, 2021, a total of 68,347 negative reactions related to COVID19 vaccines have been reported to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) [1], including:2,602 deaths, with the youngest being 188,285 serious reactions, such as anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest526 cases of Bell's Palsy (facial paralysis)114 miscarriages and preterm births Is this something you want on your conscience for being a part of?Vaccine reacons are known to be greatly underreported to VAERS. It has been estimated that fewer than 1% of adverse reactions are reported to the VAERS [2].Medical mandates and surveillance (tesng, tracking) have no place in a free society and violate free, prior and informed consent, right to privacy, and right to religious freedom.It doesn't matter whether this experimental medium works or not.It doesn't maer whether this is even a vaccine or not.What matters is that each individual has sovereignty and authority over their own body. Without health freedom there is no true freedom.Among many laws that protect individuals from the excess power of those in authority, here are three...1. Federal statute FDA 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 360bbb-3, which covers Emergency Use Authorization for medical products, requires that individuals who receive a medical product approved for emergency use must first be informed \"of the option to accept or refuse administration of the produ ct\"...and of the alter natives to the product that are available\" [3, 4]. 2. Forced vaccinaon and surveillance violates the right to privacy, which is protected, secured and guaranteed by the 4th Amendment of the US Constitution. The Othena website that is to track the vaccine verification requires a plethora of one's personal informaon.The Othena.com website states it collects the following informaon:Name email, Id, mailing address, phone number, date of birth, access to your CAMERA, all Photos, all images, all audio, les video and other details.Would you want somebody else to have access to certain aspects of YOUR PRIVATE CONTENT without your consent? Think about that for a minute.hps://curapa ent webapp.s3.amazonaws.com/data/privacy.pdf3. Forced vaccination and surveillance tactics are unlawful DISCRIMINATIONS, discriminating against those who have cell phones or want to parcipate in AI.Again, I urge you to seriously Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 134 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment reconsider your policy on mandatory medical intervention with this experimental 'vaccine' and ongoing surveillance as a condition of admission and employment at your campus. This affects everyone. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Sir, I am wring to express my concern at UNM's considera on of mandatory vaccines. Vaccinaons have always been a maer of free choice among free people. I consider forcing a vaccine on student's violates their constuonal rights.

The hidden elite have informed us that they intend to reduce the population to 500 Million. See the Georgia Guidestones. This alleged virus has never been isolated. Koch's Postulates have not been demonstrated. The alleged viron genome is a computer generated guess. Flu has been renamed, and anyone who tests positive is counted as a \"case\" even though they are completely asymptomatic. The tests yield 96% false positives and its inventor stated it was not designed for the current use and that it is worthless for this purpose. People with terminal cancer who test positive are counted as a \"Covid Death\". Shooting deaths and motorcycle deaths of positives are counted because the doctors are bribed to diagnose that condion. Amazingly, this virus has completely cured Flu and Pneumonia. Look at the stascs. Masks provide no protecon and cause inter alia: 1. Anoxia...confused thinking ; toxic buildup, brain neuron death. 2. Hypercapnia...mul ple eects on all organ systems.3. ...which causes acidosis.4. High blood pressureAnd in small children, permanent brain damage. Further, masking the very young interferes with socialization because they cannot interpret the face of others. Children's educaon is being severely harmed. Our economy is destroyed. The damage to small business and workers is yet to be seen. All of this is intenonal. It is now understood that most of the Spanish Flu epidemic deaths were not caused by the viron but were caused by bacterial pneumonia made worse by the masks. Fauci was a coauthor of the study. He knows the masks ar e harmful and continues to promote them. He is heavily invested in vaccines. To a parcle carrying virions, the mask looks like a chain link fence appears to a mosquito. I have about 15 peerreviewed studies showing that masks in the surgical theatre are useless. Most of them have no difference between postop infections with and without masks... except one of the studies; there the infection rate was 50% less without mask s. The use of masks in surgery is psychological theatre, and wearing them reduces the clear thinking of the medical team. If you proceed with this action you will violate the Nuremberg accords against human experimentation. This places you in the same category as the NAZI scientests. This deadly concocon that includes the cells of dead babies and monkey kidney cells and godknowswhat else has never been tested for safety or efficacy. In many recent and current studies a significant percentage of people died and others were seriously injured.

I heard recently that UNM is considering mandatory vaccines for its students. This is very concerning to me. Most college students are incredibly unlikely to be harmed by a covid infection and the vaccine is not FDA approved. This should be a medical decision between the parent and the child. Forci ng vaccines upon students is completely unethical. If vaccines are effective, then the school should not take an antiscience and anti choice stance. They should trust that those who want to be vaccinated will be safe from the unvaccinated. I'm shocked that a university would even cons ider forc ing vaccines upon young students. Please let me know if you will be antiscience in this regard and I will look to send my four children elsewhere. I look forward to your response. Thank you, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 139 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM Provost, Hello. It has been brought to my aenon that UNM is considering making CoVid19 Vaccinations mandatory for all of its students faculty, and staff. Although some students, faculty, and sta may decline the vaccinaon and be allowed an exemption, these people will then be required mandatory surveillance testing. I urge you to strongly consider voting 'No' for both of these policies and not implementing them in the fall semester of 2021.First, these vaccinaons are in the third trial stage and still labeled experimental. Not one of the corporations creating these experimental injections has been approved by the FDA. One of the companies will nish its trial cycle at the end of October 2021; another January 31, 2022, and the third in the year 2023. Our students, children, and adults should not be subjected to an experimental injection for which the side effects and harmful injuries are not yet fully known nor fully recorded by medical experts and practitioners on the VAERS website. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is known throughout the health care professional system to record only one percent of cases. This false sense of security of low statistics leaves the public in the dark about the true and actual adverse effects of any vaccine and therefore leads to a false sense of efficacy, safety, and informed consent regarding medical choices. As of April 30, 2021 (four months of vaccinations): 3,607 postvaccination deaths; 2,527 recorded lifethreatening cases, over 1,600 cases of permanent disability, and nearly 8,500 cases where paents reported hospitalization. On the CDC site as of April 16, 9,245 people tested positive for CoVid19 after receiving their final vaccinaon (informaon is voluntarily submied).Secondly, all students who are American citizens have the right to choose his or her own medical/health care as we are still a democracy under the U.S. Constitution. The first Amendment protects every single student fromharming him/herself especially if ignorant of non disclosed consequences. Under the Fourth Amendment in the Constitution is the right to privacy. Gathering personal medical stascs, including temperature, vaccinaon schedule, and requiring a mask to be worn, is in violation of a person's right to privacy. No health order, emergency order, state of emergency, or policy may violate the Constitution which is the highest law of the land. New Mexico Administra ve Code 12.3.1.8: Businesses are required to comply with the law. Activating this policy may violate established law both federally and with the State of New Mexico. As with the mask mandate for the State of New Mexico, all businesses implementing a \"policy\" or \"health order\" or \"city ordinance\" or \"executive orders\" are in violation of five federal laws under the U.S. Constitution and thirteen New Mexico State Laws.Implemen ng this policy is discriminatory. Period.Implemen ng this policy under the false pretense that the United States is still under a state of emergency and that UNM as a business must follow the CDC guidelines is misleading, at best, and hinges on propaganda. TheCDC is not a government run agency Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 140 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment but a stand alone entity. The CDC and many of its representatives are heavily invested in the corporations creating these injections and will prot considerably. By design, these injecons are not correctly defined as vaccinations and are defined instead as gene therapy (Pfizer and Moderna websites). As experimental 'vaccines', please use extreme caution implementing such a policy on UNM's campuses. Please do not claim 'just doing business' in the name of capitalism in exchange for the lives and health of your students, faculty, and sta.Thank you for your me. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyMy son has been approved and was planning on going to your school in the fall. It is completely unreasonable to require an 18y.o. child to get a vaccine that has no long term studies as to what complications could happen in 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years down the road. He has expressed thes e concerns to us, independently from my own opinion, and will not be attending school there if it is required. The school systems and government have already done massive damage by shutting the economy and schools down. If you require this, you are not only doing the students, but a disservice your school as well. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 141 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM President and Administrators:I oppose UNM's move to require mandatory vaccination for students and staff. Here's why:1.All of the coronavirus vaccines on the market today are experimental. They are still in clinical trials, which are, in general, scheduled to go on until 2022 or 23. As such, the longterm effects are absolutely unknown. How can they be known with only about ten months of trials (or about six at the time of EUA auth orization in Dec, 2020)? Therefore, mandating an experimental vaccine whose long term effects are unknown, for a virus that, based on seroprevalence studies, has a global IFR of about 99.8%, (and for those under 30 more like 99.99%) (see: https://swprs.org/studies oncovid19lethality/ list of studies) is a mindboggling ly reckless step. It calls into question the reasoning of the UNM administration. This is overwhelmingly so for students, who, in general are under 30 and have many years of life ahead of them.2.The vaccines, being experimental, are authorized for use ONLY on via Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), 21 U.S.C. 360Bbb 3. Accordingly, they cannot be given absent informed consent regarding their risks, and the consequences of not taking them. How can there be informed consent if the vaccine has only had about ten months of trials to dat e, the trials are ongoing, and therefore, (again) long term effects are unknown? Without informed consent, a vaccine mandate amounts to coercion, in violation of, among other things, the Nuremberg Code. In addition, the trials to date have NOT included certain groups, such as pregnant women. Therefore, even in the best case scen ario, it is impossible to say whether the vaccines are a \"one size fits all\" intervention. This argues against essentially forcing them on a population anxious to either further their education or stay employed.3.Aside from any unknown (or known) medical risks, mandating an experimental vaccine is discriminatory. If there are to be exemptions, who decides which exemptions are available, and how are these decisions made and applied? And will those with exemptions be stigmatized by forcing them to undergo other draconian restrictions such as mandatory testing, temp er ature checks, etc., at regular intervals? And who decides on when, if and how those are implemented? And will these \"alternatives\" be so onerous as to essentially force kids and staff to be vaccinated in order to attend school or work without constant pressure to conform? That certainly makes for a heal thy learning environment, doesn't it?4.Manda ng an experimental vaccine violates bodily integrity. As former MIT professor Sanjoy Mahajan has said\" 200 American colleges will mandate experimental gene therapies (\"COVID vaccines\") for students starting in the fall, mostly in violation of federal and international law and all in violation of the right to bodily autonomy. he admin istrators and trustees making these decisions are little Eichmanns across the country making the trains run on time but not asking where these trains are headed. . . . I have never been more ashamed of my own profession.\" https://twitter.com/SanjoyMahajan2/status/13895399802682204 16. Well put.5.The vaccine manufacturers have almost total immunity from lawsuits. Given the NCVIA of 1986, and the 2020 Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 142 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMandating vaccination is \"Practicing medicine without a license.\" Private personal health care decisions should be determined only by a person's chosen physician and that person. 247A2 of the New Mexico Uniform Health Care Decisions Act, Uniform Health Care Decisions, Chapter 24, Human Rights, states that an adul t has the right to make his or her own healthcare decisions. These decisions are not the right of bureaucrats nor health department officials. Requiring vaccination to enter into a public facility violates H.R. 5586 The Customer NonDiscrimination Act that prohibits discrimination in public accommodations for other purpo ses, & is an open door for future litigation against the university and personal freedoms. The NMDOH's statistics suggest only 1/2 of the state's populations have been vaccinated, either once or twice, with numbers constantly changing. That would also indicate 1/2 of the Population choose to not have a flu shot. Looki ng to the future, that could guarantee your enrollment will drop 1/2 if the current EUA approved flu vaccinations, which are not actually vaccines but medical treatment for the flu, are mandated for entry into UNM. It may be time and prudent for a deeper study of infectious diseases and their roll in health an d possibly future law suits against UNM. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI dont believe the covid 19 vaccine should be made mandatory, it should be each Individuals choice to either get it or not! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceRequiring this vaccine is criminal. Requiring tests is criminal. Cease and desist. We are watching you. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Francie, I am shocked and appalled that UNM is even considering such a blatant violation of one of our most basic human rights!!! Each and every one of us need to be in charge of our own bodies. Our health care is a personal and private thing and needs to stay that way.I am a UNM Alumni, and frankly I am ashamed and appalled that this blatant violation of Human Rights!! If this process continues I will be forced to reassess my stand on support of this institution going forward. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI really don't believe this is a wise decision to mandate a student receive the Covid vaccine. The Covid was less than 1% contagious The vaccine is not effective to keep from getting Covid just have less severe symptoms So why mandateThis is all about fear and control Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 144 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice I would like to Remain AnonymousAccording to the Nuremberg Code, human beings are not required in any way to take vaccines (or in this case MRNAs), this would have to voluntary. This should not be forced on anyone at UNM. It should remain a voluntary decision. In addition we know that those who are of a certa in age and without health issues (060 years old or greater) survive this virus by 95% or greater depending on age and health. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am writing this letter to you to ask you not to endorse a policy of mandatory vaccination for your employees or students attending the university. Medical treatment, especially one involving an injection into the body, should be a personal choice. This, so called vaccine, is an experimental treatment an d should never be mandated. There are many physicians who feel that it is a threat to our health and that much more research and safety testing needs to be done before it's released to the General Public. The vaccination mandate is part of a bigger agenda. Please don't take pa rt in this. Stand up for your individual freedom and the freedom of others to make these choices about their bodies. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice To whom it may concern: I am dismayed that UNM is in the process of creating a mandatory COVID19 vaccination requirement for all staff and students. Primary reasons for my feeling that this is anabhorrent measure, are: Mandatory vaccinaon is discriminatory.All people have a right to make their own medical choices.I beg you to reconsider such an unjust measure, it is not a proper role for educators to deny education to those who feel differently. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIt would be a travesty to require Mandatory Vaccines. First it is against all civil rights!! Second this is still an emergency use drug only! Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Dear President Stokes:The mandate being considered by the University of New Mexico for untested Covid vaccines is egregious, unconstitutional and unwarranted. The need for such a mandate is unsupported by science and will do damage to your students and the reputation of your institution. You will, as well, open yourself and your institution to future liabi lity as these vaccines are already proving far more dangerous than Covid itself. Opposition to these vaccines is high and no doubt you will lose both students who will refuse the vaccination and contributors who will understand the danger you would impose. What could be the point when the average colleg e student is in an age group little threatened by Covid? Please consider these factors and do not establish a mandate that makes no scientific sense and will constute a precedent dangerous to American freedoms.Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 145 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety IDear ocials of UNM, Please reject the noon that all young healthy students need the covid vaccine. They are not in danger from the virus, and a many have already had it, making it a non issue. Please respect each individual's freedom to choose. No one should be forced to inject something in their bodies they don't wan t. It could take their life, or have an effect far worse than the virus itself, as has been shown. The longterm effects of this vaccine aren't known, as it is vastly different from other vaccines. We will not send our youth to any school that discriminates. Please respect our freedom to choose, by keeping education open to all, and not mandang vaccinaon.Thank you for your me, Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceYou guys should not mandate the vaccine. It is unfair to those who wish to not support the vaccine. The flu vaccine was never mandated and more people have died from that. You're taking away peoples rights of refusal and are discriminated against those who don't want to take it. I hope you gu ys don't force people. I will be very disappointed Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Dear UNM Provost,This is atrocious that you would mandate the Covid19 vaccination!

The FDA has not app roved the vaccine, it is approved for EUA and the vaccine trials do not end until 2023. To condition access to education on and the use of an experimental drug is dangerous and a violation of the rights of New Mexicans to make healthcare choices they feel are appropri ate. Limit ing exemptions to those approved by the FDA while the FDA has not yet fully approved the use of the drug seems to be contradictory and hypocritical on the part of both UNM and the FDA. UNM does not know the long term effects which could in a few years result in Lawsui ts to UN M and the taxpayers of NM that pay for UNM. Most UNM students have a very low risk for serious illness or death from COVID and for this reason alone should not be required to obtain a vaccine. High risk staff, faculty, or older students should be accommod ate d to prevent contraction by remote option or vaccination, it should be their choice just as it is for students. UNM is risking a great deal by requiring rather than recommending vaccines enrollment may fall further, lawsuits, falling revenues, donors may choose to give their dollars to schools that do not have such re strictions. Give people a choice. If they are at risk accommodate that risk. Risk assessment can result in better outcomes than a rush to do the wrong thing. I know you can do the math. Community Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyConcerns Mandatory vaccines requirements are in direct violation of our personal freedoms and hippa rights. Medical treatments and decisions should be left between a patient and their doctor. Science has proven that children and young adults do not have serious effects from the virus. And with young adults, immunity is better and more effective through contraction rather than vaccination. Thus, leading to a safer and more effective immunity community. Many of the students have already had Covid. Therefore vaccinating them is futile and ex posing them to more adverse reacons unnecessarily. This policy will cause many to leave the state for higher education and is an attack on personal freedoms. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 153 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Question Concerns about Process;How does the draft policy accommodate international student needs? Their home country has not yet made vaccinations available for their age group. Saying UNM will not enforce a policy until vaccine is FDA approved leaves them at mercy of unknown FDA schedule. Vaccinations are not immediately available to them upon ar rival and also have a builtin 2 week or more delay to be effective. Community Question Concerns about PrivacyUNM should follow federal guidelines and trends when returning to full operations. If the federal government requires a vaccine to return to schools or the worksite, then UNM should follow suit. We already know this to not be the case since the Biden Administration has requested that all schools (K12) reopen at the soonest possible me. HIPAA allows disclosure of personal health information for a serious threat to health and safety, but does not allow for banning students and employees from campus or the worksite due to noncompliance with taking a vaccine. If, by the end of June 2021, the state of NM is fully open, this will be the indication from the Governor that she is confident that the pandemic has lessened within the state of NM enough to be able to return to work. Grocery sto res, movie theaters, restaurants, schools, etc, will have have been open to full capacity well before an expected return to full operations on August 2nd. Therefore, because the risk of contracting covid19 will have substantially dwindled, the exceptions to protecting private health information allowed under HIPPA would also no longer apply. In other words , there would not be a \"serious threat to health and safety\" to require protected health informaon disclosure.How long would this policy be in place? A temporary policy should not be put in place without a predetermined reevaluation date. If the predetermined reevaluation date is expected to be January 1, 2022, then students and staff should have the option to continue to learn/w ork remotely (without penalty) until a vaccine is deemed no longer required to return to campus. UNM has had security breaches of private data in the past. What new security mechanisms have been put in place to ensure the safety and privacy of personal health information both at a high level, and also at a smaller, departmental level? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 155 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Question Concerns about Safety;I have a family member that is a part of your school and I have very important questions regarding your outreach regarding the vaccine and what you are wring on Social Media.yesterday you posted a a q&a and this is what it said:Q: Why is the vaccine not FDA approved?A: It is. The vaccine has met the FDA's rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency authorization.

Was this purposefully misleading and are you being honest to your community? Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy I would like to see vaccines required for students and staff at UNM. UNM students come from all over. The UNM community could be factor that promotes the spread of the virus, or if vaccination is required, could help the whole city control the virus. Please require vaccination. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy Unrelated, I saw UNM is considering vaccination as a requirement to return to campus. I think that's a great idea and was glad to see that's under consideration. I've seen first hand the difference it makes in various care facilities when staff are vaccinated. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 156 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy Allow vaccinated students to attend in person classes and events, also live in on campus housing.Unvaccinated students should not be able to do these things but can take on line classes.This is a public health issue that reaches far beyond the UNM campus. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy Vaccines should be required for all students and staff at UofNM. If there is any hope of approaching a state of normalcy, this is a minimum. There are people who will continue to be at risk, despite their receiving the vaccine, so they rely on herd immunity. Everyo ne nee ds to do their part. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Dear President Stokes,Inperson teaching is beer than remote teaching.In person teaching is possible only if faculty, sta and students are fully vaccinated.Therefore UNM should require faculty, staff and students to be fully vaccinated before the start of the fall semester.Thank you for the many ways you have improved UNM. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a UNMH patient, I was appalled that the young woman who performed my mammogram at OSIS in March told me she had declined the vaccine. I spent at least 15 minutes with her in an enclosed space. She wore a single physician's mask. Fortunately, I'd been vaccinated. But what abou t others who hadn't been or for whom vaccination may not be entirely effective (e.g., the immunocompromised)?UNMH needs to change its policy immediately and the rest of UNM should do so as soon as possible. In this society and community we have responsibilities to each other. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy Very much approve of this draft policy. School outbreaks are a big risk. Let's minimize risk! Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am a parent of a UNM student. I fully support this!!! It will serve to protect our children, all students and teachers, as well as all those employed there at UNM!! Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy My recommendation is that students and staff be required to be vaccinated. There are many people, including students and staff, who have compromised immune systems or are immuno suppressed. Their only protection against contracting Covid19 is herd immunity, because Covid vaccines offer them very little, in some cases negligible, prote ction. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy Not sure if I qualify as a community member if I'm a parent of an outofstate undergrad, but I wanted to add my full support of the vaccine policy: Everyone who isn't deemed medically unable to take a COVID19 vaccine should be required to be eligible to return to campus. Thank you for proposing this. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 157 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a parent of a student, I don't believe you should require everyone to be vaccinated to access an education at your university. It is taking away people's right to choose what goes into their bodies. Especially since none of these covid vaccines have been properly tested or approv ed. The covid vaccine has only been fda clear for EUA which means it didn't go through proper testing. Students shouldn't be required to be guinea pigs for this vaccine just so they can have an higher education. Would you tell a woman to have an abortion to attend your university? No, you wouldn't, because it is their body and not yours. Everyday they are finding new and sometimes deadly side effects of this vaccine, and no one knows the longterm effects this could have. The vaccine should be a choice! Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a parent, I'm ok with this proposed requirement although my wife has reservations. My son (incoming freshman) also tells me he's ok with this requirement Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am in favor of a vaccine requirement. Your plans are well thoughtout and benefit all of us in the community. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy I feel as though everyone coming back should be vaccinated or there should be consequences for those who choose not too be and don't properly wear a mask or face covering. Community Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a parent of an incoming freshman, I fully support requiring COVID19 vaccination of UNM personnel and students, with limited exceptions, including periodic boosters if deemed necessary. I feel strongly about preserving medical autonomy in the majority of situations. However, the need for a decisive response to the current pand emic requires us to set aside personal autonomy and act for the good of the community. Faculty Neutral Concerns about ProcessMany students complete clinical rotations and/or fieldwork. During these experiences they are supervised by preceptors, who are volunteers. Would these individuals be required to be vaccinated? They are not employees and the activities are offcampus. If so, how would UNM require this? If this is a requirement we need to let thes e individuals know ASAP because fieldwork for fall has already been assigned and the availability of fieldwork sites relates to student graduation/course completion progress. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 158 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Neutral Concerns about Process;Impact to Enrollment;I advocate vaccination but I am extremely concerned about negative consequences of requiring covid vaccination for Fall 2021. Many young people are skeptical of the vaccine and it is currently under emergency authorization, even if the emergency authorization status changes that will leave a short time window for decisions and many students will not want to feel fo rced. I think that requiring the vaccine has a high potential to drive students away, either to other schools that do not require it or away from a university education in Fall 2021 altogether. Both of those potential outcomes are bad for education in NM and th e future of UNM. A recent email communica on from the provost indicated that ~25% of UNM students report being fully vaccinated. If that's true, I think it could be a disaster to require vaccination in 8 weeks among a population that only reports 25% vaccination several weeks after everyone in NM has had free acc ess. Those reports about vaccination seem like a clear message from the existing UNM students that many if not most of them would not want it to be required. The numbers could be even less favorable among 'potenally' incoming students. Please consider ways to strengthen incentives for vaccination and improve education about the benefits and risks of vaccination without requiring vaccination for Fall 2021. Could UNM find funds to enter any vaccinated students in drawings (lotteries) for scholarships, tablets, or laptops? Anything to encourage the vacci ne without immediately requiring it seems worthwhile to make UNM an inclusive campus for the NM populaon.Thank you for seeking feedback on the draft vaccine policy. Faculty Neutral General Complaint;I think it's a joke to put forward a policy that you are not going to enforce. Policy on the horizon is no policy at all. That puts everyone at risk, especially the staff who will be required to return to campus ahead of the faculty by roughly the incubation time of covid. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyPlease don't make this a policy. I struggle with vaccine reactions and I would rather make that choice for myself and after there are more studies to back up research. Thank you Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 159 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy Health Accommoda onI mpact to EnrollmentReligioAs I manage a large group of faculty and students who are enrolled in traditional healing arts practices grounded in cultural, religious and spiritual practice. Many of our faculty and students are not in support of vaccinations for medical and spiritual reasons.I am concerned if UNM mandates the \"Vaccine Policy\" these orders for attendance will ostensibly \"kill\" our programs.On a side note, we have had live classes with COVID Safety Practices since August of 2020 for our medical massage and structural integration programs without incidents with regards to COVID. Our fields have already had protocols for disinfecting, hand washing and we simply added the wearing of masks indoors. I believe this demonstrates that a com mon sense approach to disease management is all that this needed, even in a \"high contact\" profession.I would hope that the university would consider the value of diversity and approach to traditional healing arts and medicine as valid. I am concerned that the Religious and Medical exemptions as they are written in the draft will be to arduous and have a strong bias toward Allopathic approach to medicine.Warm regards, Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Enforcement; Con1. Enforcement of this policy would be difficult to administer. The students who sign up and employees of the campus could be tracked, but anyone who comes on campus to eat, visit, tour, advertise, collaborate would be difficult to enforce or track without violang HIPAA.2. Personal rights. For a campus environment who believes in the right to choose, one could infer that by creating a mandatory requirement that could (one study had a 34% miscarriage rate) endanger pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant from making free choices about education and health. If the campus operat ed so lely on the premise on the safety of others, it would operate as a prolife campus, and enforce this policy with the same 100% compliance. 3. False sense of security. The vaccine does not completely stop the spread of the virus, nor does it prevent you from getting the virus. The vaccine creates an immune response to fight the virus, creating less symptoms or asymptotic carriers. Having a 100% vaccine policy woul d only create the perception that students are safe on campus to conduct acvies as normal.4. Addional strains. How would the university continue this policy of an additional strains presence on campus, would those previously vaccinated no longer be covered by the policy, would this create further requirements or expectaons that would drive policy decisions in the future? 5. Precedent. A few of your best minds on campus with the most diverse attitudes will leave UNM due to this policy, and would leave campus with students in a groupthink mentality, intolerant to differing opinions. Exactly the opposite of the culture the university has tried to create.A virus with such an extremely low risk to the specific university population is overly risk adverse. A university that does not accept risks and take risks during the execution of its mission, will fail to achieve its full potential.

Because viruses can affect more than one type of cells, it's possible that the altered viruses may infect additional cells \u2014 not just the targeted cells containing mutated genes. If this happens, healthy cells may be damaged, causing other illness or diseases, such as cancer.Infec on caused by the virus. It's possible that once introduced into the body, the viruses may recover their original ability to cause disease.Possibility of causing a tumor. If the new genes get inserted in the wrong spot in your DNA, there is a chance that the inseron might lead to tumor formaon.The gene therapy clinical trials underway in the U.S. are closely monitored by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health to ensure that patient safety issues are a top priority during research. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Impact to Enrollment;The UNM passport is terrible idea. It promotes inequity. It is discriminatory. It seem the definition of privilege and elitism to have a campus policy that requires 100% vaccine conformity of its faculty, students, and sta.It discourages young people whose risk from COVID is nearly non existent from attending UNM. People calculate risks and should be free to do so, and will do so regardless of UNM policy. In a variety of studies, young people, who colleges cater to, are some of the least likely adults to ind icate they plan to get the vaccine. Students have a great deal of choice; we are a shrinking campus. Since states and universities are making different choices about a vaccine passport this could be a deciding factor in whether to come to UNM or not. Therefore, it is like ly that some students will choose an alternative campus that doesn't require the vaccine harming enrollment. Other students who cannot attend other campuses will likely decide college is not for them. The vaccine is EUA only, requiring someone to take a vaccine for something that has not been fully tested or vetted by the FDA is very concerning. It may leave UNM open to legal challenges. In the past few days the evidence is growing that there is a heart issue after vacc ination in young people. There may be other unknown concerns that are yet to be determined, especially for young people. We should be very careful about seng policies that limit who can attend college. What will be the next requirement? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 161 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyVaccines should NOT be required, as so many have allergies and should not have to reveal their medical history to get an exemption. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;I do not agree with requiring the Covid19 vaccine, or the option to be remote must be offered. As a vaccinated person already I also understand there are many reasons why people may not feel comfortable with getting the vaccine yet. There are a lot of questi ons around these vaccines still in play and a lot of unknowns about adverse effects on subpopulations. These sensitive subpopulations may not even be known of yet. This requirement places some people in a very uncomfortable situation and they may be forced to make the decision to remove themselves from UNM or compromise their pea ce of mind. If it is mandated, I think you must provide the option for remote work/study for those individuals that are not vaccinated, at least for the next year or 2 depending on how things progress. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;It's a shame that this question about mandatory vaccination is open for discussion. But I ask a key question to the University: Will you get monies and/or \"incentives\" of any kind for mandating covid vaccines? If the answer is yes, that should cause you in good conscience to question why. This ho use of cards is about to fall as numerous sources are now reporting horrific damage and death resulting from a lack of longterm safety trials in these emergency use authorized products. There are effective treatments and the absurdity of mandating vaccination for a 99.98% survival rate for tho se between 2049 is highly suspect, according to CDC data. There are unthinkable conflicts of interest relating to these experimental products. For one, the NIH is a patent owner for the Moderna covid product and is providing grants to prevent vaccine hesitancy. The conflicts of interest should raise enormo us concerns fo r anyone how much more, the University of New Mexico that prides itself as an R1 university. Again, these truths about the dangers and conflicts of interest will not be censored much longer to the public at large and UNM should be a leader standing on the right side of CHOICE on this issue. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;The proposed policy completely ignores the natural immunity developed by people who became infected and have recovered from COVID19. That is not consistent with the stated goal of a sciencedriven policy.I suggest people who recovered from COVID19 should not be required to take a vaccine. Faculty Opposed to Policy General Complaint;You all should be ashamed of yourselves for pressuring students to take a vaccine that they may not want in order to get an education. An absolute disgrace. I am disgusted with UNM. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 162 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I am strongly opposed to this dictatorial policy. Whatever happened to \"my body my choice?\" I suspect you may have lawsuits on your hands over this totalitarianism. Faculty Opposed to Policy Support Policy; I fully support this polic y , Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 163 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy General Complaint After further reviewing the proposed policy, it would be in UNM's best interest to add the following additional stipulations to support the health and safety of our campus community and ensure that our oncampus experiences promote academic success and personal growth. 1.) UNM should install metal detectors at every campus entrance. Oncampus gun violence is a risk to everyone's safety. These metal detectors should also have scanners for vaccination cards. The detector alarm will sound if someone is carrying a potential weapon or firearm or if no vaccination card is prese nted and emi t an electric shock pulse that sends the offender tumbling backward into a useless smoking heap. This would make me feel safe.2.) Every UNM sta, student and faculty member with a BMI above 30 should be fitted with a Fitbit or other device where UNM administrators can monitor their daily activity, heart rate, body temperature and calorie intake. All such overweight and obese people should be subjec ted to mandatory ri gorous exercise three times daily. UNM should supply employees with chairs that emit a lowlevel, uncomfortable shock to ensure that people get up and exercise. Cardiovascular disease kills 18 million people prematurely every year (far more than the 3 million killed by COVID), puts them at a higher ri sk of dying of COVID, and is an unnecessary tax on the public healthcare system. This would make me feel safe.3.) UNM should implement a mandatory public Two Minutes Hate on campus three times daily, during which images of the COVID virus and unvaccinated people are projected onto screens so that we all can express our hatred for them. This would make me feel safe.4.) UNM should divest all of its investments in fossil fuels and reinvest in sustainable energy sources. This would make me feel safe.5.) UNM should make all students between the ages of 18 and 25 ingest a medication that dampens their sex drive. The CDC estimates that young people aged 15-24 years acquire half of all new STDs and that one in four sexuallyactive adolescent females has an STD, such as chlamydia or HPV. This is avoidable and cou ld lower birth rates in the future. It's also an unnecessary tax on the healthcare system. This would make me feel safe.6.) UNM should ban all fastfood establishments on campus and set new standards for healthy food choices to reduce obesity rates of its students, faculty and staff. Nutrition courses should be a part of our annual compliance training. This would make me feel safe.7.) UNM should remove all grass areas from campus, replacing them instead with community gardens that produce eco friendly and lowwater crops that are healthy and edible. UNM should also water only in the evening hours, per city policy, and ban all pesticide and herbicide use. This would make me feel safe.8.) UNM should implement an annual dra (sort of a Selective Health Service) where students, staff, and faculty are required to become uncompensated public health agents and participate in at least one pharmaceutical clinical study a year as a required public health service and as a civic obligation to fight disease. This would creat e an unlimi ted pool of candidates who can serve as guinea pigs for experimental or emergency use Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 164 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment authorization drugs. Only pharmaceutical studies with companies who maintain their sovereign immunity from litigation should be allowed. This would make me feel safe.9.) Every UNM employee that is retirement eligible should be forced to retire immediately. They've fulfilled their obligation to the University and, anyway, old people are more at risk of dying from COVID. This would keep them safer and make me feel safe.Thank you for your consideration, for supporting the health and safety of our campus community, and for ensuring that my oncampus experience promotes my academic success and personal growth. Thank you for your commitment to making me feel safe. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThis is quite possibly the most horrifying thing that I have ever read. What comes next? Shall the unvaccinated don red robes and white bonnets? UNM will be discriminating against and coercing individuals who are exercising their inalienable right to not inject themselves with a substance any substance. If it comes down to ch oosing between being forced, threatened or coerced into publicly declaring my health status in order to keep my job or living under a bridge, I choose the bridge. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Hello, policy decisions should always be for the people. Making it mandatory for all attendees of UNM to be Vaccinated from the SARSCoV2 vaccination while it is still undergoing trials in an emergency use system is unconstitutional. Treating others differently who are not vaccinated is discriminatory in all poss ible ways. When has the Unites States or UNM ever treated individuals differently for not being vaccinated of the common Flu? Never. When has there been \"bonus's\", \"gifts\", \"incentives\" for being vaccinated? Truly a state crime in action to gain power over those people whom are vulnerable in the State of New Mexic o AND those students attending UNM luring them into vaccinating with monetary prizes. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 165 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice I am concerned about a mandatory vaccinaon policy. Please note: (a) I was deployed to New York City in AprilMay 2020 to provide care and assistance at a hospital in the Bronx for COVID19 support, (b) I have been supporting the local VA in inpatient and outpatient settings for COVID19 s upport (approved by my leadership), and (c) I have been vaccinated, as has every member of my family. I am not a science denier or an anvaxer.My concerns: All COVID19 vaccines are only approved by the FDA for emergency use (EUA). They do not have full FDA approval, even if it is recommended by Public Health professionals. The Provost has stated that there are no 'mandatory' vaccines required by UNM (MMR, TDAP, Polio; Seasonal Influenza). We have these vaccines because theses diseases have either high levels of morbidity and/or mortality. of note, Public Health professionals are vocal in recommending people take these vaccines also. During the season influenza, hospitals require nonvaccinated employees to wear a mask if they can't/won't vaccinate. Seasonal influenza and COVID19 share the same form of transmission. Based on the above information, I believe it would be unethical to establish a mandatory COVID19 vaccination policy. A mandatory COVID19 vaccination policy has a high likelihood to be challenged in court, and I think this is not a good use of university fund ing. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;According to the constitution people should not be forced to any medical procedure without their consent. Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceDear UNM President, Provost, Admissions, and Student Associaons: I am a past adjunct professor at UNMTaos, teaching art and design and art history (in 2015). I have been an educator in Tennessee and New Hampshire, also teaching media studies and computer design. Crical thinking is the foundation of sound personal decision making, and something often lost on some of us who are selfidentified as more mature educators. My observation is that we have become too comfortable with media messaging and techniques. We have stopped noticing that alternative viewpoints are not bein g offered in media outlets. Vaccinaon and the compelling ecacy and need for it is such a topic. The UNM plans underway for mandatory vaccination does not protect anyone, since at best, it offers the chance of decreased symptoms once infected with this virus. For your education body to make such actions is discriminatory and takes away the personal choice of those you propose must receive it.There are equally eecve methods of enhancing one's immune system that many people use and this applies to the pandemic. Studies exist but they are hard to find media suppression exists. All people have a right to make their own medical choices. I will not connue my patronage and monetary support of UNM if you were to enforce mandatory vaccinaon.Sincerely, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 166 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIn re: my previous comments about the legality of requiring vaccines, see:the arcle \"Yes, it's legal for businesses and schools to require you to get a coronavirus vaccine\" in the Washington Post today. https://www.washingtonpost.c om/outlook/2021/05/04/vaccine mandatelegal schoolsbusinesses/It has some good informaon about what the Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA really means.It also corrected an error I made in my previous comment as I was unaware that the UC system in California, while requiring vaccines, is waiting until regular authorization by the FDA. Based on the article, I don't believe that's necessary or wise.Thank you, Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMy body my choice! This is unlawful! Why not promote healthy life style and choices. Stay home if you're sick, etc Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Enforcement ConcI am very concerned with interfering with the individual right to choose when it comes to health issues regardless of whether or not it is a religious reason or a health reason that a doctor would provide a waiver for. It will be many years before we understand the longterm side effects of both recove ring from COVID19 and/or having the vaccine. Individuals should have the choice of choosing whether or not to take the risks of the vaccine as well as the risks of contracng COVIC19.I also have concerns about how this will be implemented and enforced. I work in adult education, a noncredit instructional program that is available at the branches. Our students are not a part of the Banner system. What will the burden be on our programs and other prog r ams that serve community members regularly? I think the big queson UNM should be addressing is how can we provide the highest level of protection to faculty, staff, students, and community members without taking away the freedoms and without discrimination? Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI am against COVID vaccine requirements as this practice is against our freedom. While I respect those who choose to get the vaccine, others have serious concerns about the safety of the vaccine and should not be forced to do something against their will in order to keep their job. Long term effects are st ill unclear and a critical and serious decision such as getting the COVID vaccine should never be forced on anyone. An alternave might be a pass or license for those who got the vaccine, which would allow these people more freedom on campus including not having to wear masks. Those who do not have this pass must adhere to current COVID safety measures. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 167 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI don't agree at all w required vaccination. There are many reasons why: There is a derivave of fetal ssue within the vaccine The vaccine is not approved by FDA or CDC Also, I have a right to choose what goes in my body or does not go in my body and my further employment should not be affected by that choice. These are just a few reasons for now. Thank you for your time Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyAs an online faculty member of UNM for 12 years and as a student going back to school to earn a Ph.D. in instructional technology, we should have the freedom to choose to get vaccinated or not. We can still wear masks to keep others safe. People that get the vacci ne can still transmit COVID. The only industry not responsible for injuries or death are vaccine makers. This vaccine is still experimental and is not fully approved. Even if it gets approved, how many successful trials are being collected? My family in Europe is dying from getting the vaccine. I do not feel comf ortable being forced to get a vaccine. I mainly teach online, but as a student in a Ph.D. program, I will need to go to a facetoface course this fall. Please let our students, staff, and faculty have the right to choose and if we don't get va ccinated, provide us with guidelines to keep others safe is wearing a mask is not enough, what more can we do?Thank you for your considera on! Faculty Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI feel this is an unfair requirement for citizens of the United States of America and of the University of New Mexico. I have natural immunity and am exercising my right to use that immunity rather than have a COVId shot. Faculty Question I am UNM retiree and adjunct teaching faculty member. I am teaching in the fall. I got both of my COVID vaccinations during spring semester, but I can't find a way to report that to the UNM Dashboard. Is there a place where I can put that information in? Faculty Question I direct a community music school in the Department it Music that (preCOVID19) serves about 400 children, infants through 12th graders, and their families per semester. How will the vaccine policy be adapted for young children who are not eligible for vaccines at this time and participate in UNM community outreach programs like mine? Faculty Question I am wondering about maskwearing in Fall 2021. As a vaccinated instructor teaching two inperson classes in the fall, I would LOVE not to have to wear a mask while lecturing. If masks are sll going to be required, I'm wondering if there can be some wiggle roomfor instance, could vaccinated instructors lecture without a mask, but if they approach individual students (coming closer than, say 6 feet) maybe they'd have to put the mask back on...Let us know! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 168 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Question Concerns about Enforcement;Con cerns about Process; To Whom It May Concern,I am grateful to you for providing opportunities for the Lobo community to provide feedback on this dra vaccine policy. Thank you.I am very concerned about being indoors with unmasked individuals and with unvaccinated individuals. UNM is allowing people to seek medical or religious exemptions to the mandatory vaccination policy, thus it is possible that people will be indoors with others who have not been vaccinated. I have written previously to strong urge that the university allow those who will be in the presence of unvaccinated people to be alerted to this fact. We do not need to know who the unvaccinated people are, but we need to know if we will be in their presence.I would also like to know how the mandatory vaccination policy will be implemented. Will it be an honor system? If so, then I do not trust all others to be honest. Given this, I want to know if I will be allowed to require masks in my classroom. I ask this becau se 1) even va ccinated people can contract and transmit the virus; 2) I have a child at home who cannot be vaccinated and I fear transmitting the disease to that child; and 3) I do not want to have the virus, even if my experience of it might be more mild given that I have been vaccinated. Even masked individuals can transmit the virus, thus I do not feel safe being indoors a) with others who are vaccinated but unmasked and b) with unvaccinated individuals at all. What assurance can you provide that these conditions can be met in my classroom so that I can come back to te aching classes in person? Will each faculty member be allowed to set their own guidelines in their classrooms? Will you alert faculty, staff, and students if they will be in the presence of an unvaccinated person? I need to know this information in order to be able to return to in person teaching.Thank you again for your considera on of my feedback.Sincerely, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 169 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Question Support Policy; Part II.FAQ re volunteers and contractors. \"Employees of contractors, independent contractors, and volunteers who work sidebyside with staff, faculty or students or who have direct contact with patients or students, would be asked to participate in the program.\" I am concerned about the phrasing \"asked to participate.\" For consistency, and particularly since the University has a choice in the matter, unvaccinated contractors and volunteers should not be permied to work on campus.FAQ re visitors to campus. \"Would visitors to UNM facilities and campuses need to show proof of a vaccine? TBD.\" I believe that the answer to this should be 'YES'. As in the case of volunteers and contractors, visitors (including the many children who visit UNM) have no inalienabl e right to be on campus, and potentially put members of the UNM community at risk as disease vectors. Question re Popejoy and other performance spaces. Would the visitor policy apply to those who wish to attend performances at Popejoy and other venues?FAQ re vaccinaon status. \"How will I know if my coworkers or fellow students are going unvaccinated? UNM will not disclose the vaccine status of other individuals to coworkers or fellow students; however, there may be badge attachments, stickers, pins, or other indicators that vaccinated individuals may choo se to use to show that they have received the vaccine. Be advised you should not ask other individuals if they are vaccinated.\" As an instructor, in order to feel safe in a confined space with my class, I would want to know that my students are all either vaccinated or constantl y bei ng tested due to a medical accommodation. To avoid HIPAA concerns, perhaps this could take the form of a general clearance, input at time of registration, e.g., that would not reveal the specific basis for the clearance. Faculty Question General Complaint I teach a studio class in Art education. My class is scheduled to meet in person in the fall. The class caps have been raised for fall. I assume we will still be wearing masks in the fall. Will we still be required to social distance in the fall semester? Faculty Question Health Accommoda onR eligious AccommodationSome programs of study require extensive numbers of fieldwork hours in various types of settings (e.g., schools or clinics). If students in these programs are not fully vaccinated due to sincere religious or health issues, can they continue in those placements? And if so, under what circumstances or with what requir e ments (e.g., wearing additional PPE). Faculty Question General Complaint Why is there no option to comment anonymously on this controversial issue? Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 170 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Question Concerns about SafetyTo the administration: Thank you for this draft proposal and for the opportunity to provide feedback on it. I very strongly support requiring that people who will access campus be vaccinated against covid. However, given that the university has chosen to allow for both medical and religious exemptions to this policy, I beli eve that faculty, staff, and students should be notified if they will be in the presence of a nonvaccinated person who has received an exemption. This can be done while protecting exempted individuals' privacy. That is, if there is one non vaccinated person in my class, then everyone in that class sho uld be told, and we can then choose if we want to find an alternative way of meeting. The person's identity does not need to be revealed in order to tell others of the existence of that person. I have a child at home who cannot be vacc inated and I cannot risk being exposed to unvaccinated people. Thank you for your consideration of this feedback. Faculty Question Concerns about SafetyI suggest that the University consider be prepared by developing the following:1) an evidencebased summary statement about the efficacy of, need for, and justification of mandatory vaccination speci c to the collegeaged populaon; 2) a reply to those who may object on the basis that the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several SARSCoV2 vaccines, but the vaccines have not yet undergone the standard FDA review and approval process (I note that the draft policy states that enfo rcement will be delayed until the FDA \"approves/licenses for regular use at least one COVID19 (SARSCoV2) vaccine\", but such approval/licensure may not be achieved before the policy's specified deadlines, so at least at this point compliance could only be achieved with an EUA vaccine); 3) considera on of what the University's position will be regarding 'booster' vaccination, additional vaccination(s) for SARSCoV2 variants, and possible annual vaccinaons;4) considera on of what the University's position will be once the state achieves herd immunity (assuming that it does).I note the statement in the FAQ that, \"UNM supports the principle that all EUAauthorized vaccines are safe and very effective in preventing symptomatic COVID19 and in decreasing the odds of hospitalization and death. As stated by the CDC, the best vaccine is the one that you are eligible to recei v e and that you can get today.\" While unlikely, it is possible that additional safety concerns may emerge in the future, particularly as the number and diversity of vaccines increases. I wonder if it would be prudent for the FAQ to state isntead that vaccine selection should best be dete rmined in con sultation with the person's medical caregiver. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 171 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Question Concerns about EnforcementI am wondering if/how we will monitor if/who has been vaccinated across sta and faculty? Will there be a vaccine mandate at some point akin to our annual flu vaccine requirement at the HSC?Also, will virtual/hybrid work situaons that are working well connue to be permied? Sta are becoming very anxious anticipating they may be required to come back to offices as in the past and lose flexibility that has been quite functional for many, and, in some spaces has improved productivity and morale. I am hoping we will directly address this and allow for fle xibility in how folks do their work within our systems and with guidance to leaders.Thank you! Faculty Question Concerns about EnforcementFor students who work with preceptors at clinical education sites as part of their programs, do preceptors have to follow these guidelines? How will this be enforced? As the coordinator of clinical education for my program (athletic training), what resources are in place to help me manage this? Faculty Question Concerns about SafetyHow will the new policy affect graduate students coming to UNM this fall from other countries? Our department, for example, has just admitted a new PhD student from Spain, where the vaccine rollout is proceeding slowly and in a horribly disorganized way. What should we tell her? Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly support the new vaccination requirement as necessary to safely reopen the main campus and return to facetoface instruction. The allowances for health conditions and religious beliefs seem appropriate and sufficient to me. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Yes I would be in favor of a policy that requires faculty, staff and students to be fully vaccinated before being allowed to retrun to UNM in person. While it may seem that things are getting better and will open up more in the coming months, the circumstances and chan ces that there will still be unvaccinated individuals amongst our working environments and in our classes is still a very real possibility. Many of us who are faculty over 70 years of age and have spouses in our households with underlying health conditions continue to be at most risk from COVID. I would want som e assurance that my return to campus is not going to jeopardize my health or members of my household as well. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 172 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am strongly IN FAVOR of UNM mandating vaccines for faculty, staff, and students (with the only exceptions being for specific health condions).If UNM does this, it will save lives: more people will be vaccinated, and fewer will have Covid19. It will also prevent people who get Covid and survive from ending up with the chronic condions some suer aerward.I am a professor at UNMValencia. Valencia County is not doing well with vaccination rates as compared with the rest of the statewe have more vaccine hesitancy. This policy will help our county and our campus.Other bene ts: faculty will be more willing and able to teach in person. The campus will be safer. Students who might not otherwise have attended in person classes will choose to, knowing it is safer. It would be marvelous for UNM to choose to do this and thus show strong leadership in the state. It will also improve enrollment. But most importantly, it will save lives. Please do this. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As a UNM faculty member, I strongly support the vaccine policy as currently drafted. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am strongly in favor of UNM instituting a vaccine policy which requires students, faculty, and staff to be vaccinated before engaging in Fall 2021 academic duties. Not only is this an increasingly common requirement amongst universities, but it is also not without precedent since the university requires a set of other vaccin es prior to taking classes here (e.g., DDT, MMR, etc). As a faculty member I would be significantly less concerned about facetoface teaching if I knew that students, staff, and my fellow faculty members were vaccinated. I would hope that this policy also follows the evolving CDC guid ance over time e.g., requiring booster vaccines if this is decided to be necessary moving forward. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 173 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Part I.As a longme faculty member at UNM, who has also supervised both staff and students over the years, I would like to thank you for drafting this excellent and thoughtful policy regarding COVID19 vaccination and other protections. Thank you also for this opportunity to offer comments on the draft document and FAQs. General comments. My personal situaon is that I am at higherthanaverage risk for suffering severe health consequences if I contract COVID19. For this reason, I am continuing to shelter at home (groceries delivered, no travel, no takeout coffee or food, no inperson socializing) and teach rem otely, despite being fully vaccinated. My intention is to continue in this manner until community spread has dropped to isolated (and contacttraceable) incidents, as at the start of the pandemic in February 2020. As a scientist who has worked in genomics, cancer research, and related computational modeling, I am deeply c oncerned about the rise of variants, 'vaccine resistance,' and the long road ahead to something resembling herd immunity. The COVID19 risk in my neighborhood (a short walk from campus) remains \"high\". I have only been on campus three times since the start of the pandemic (to bring home plants from my office in March 2020 , an d bring my main laptop to IT for diagnosis and repair, then pick it up.) On the last occasion, during the height of the recent wave, I saw a person from Physical Plant driving around in an open cart without a mask (he waved). The re were numerous runners and cyclists crossing through campus also not wearing masks. With approximately 20% of the U.S. population currently having no plans to vaccinate, I am concerned that it will be a long time before the world returns to 'normal.' For this reason, I applaud the proposed draft policy. UNM is its own village and community. As such, I believe that the Univ ersity is entitled to maintain its own standards, embodying Lobo spirit and values. If a student, staff member, or faculty member is ardently opposed to vaccination for nonmedical reasons, they have the right to join a different community that shares their values. Arguments about civil liberties do not apply here. Setting aside the moral imperative and social contract to protect others' lives, consistent with Lobo values, those who resent the UNM requirement to vaccinate should remember that notwithstanding the Second Amendment, one cannot carry a gun onto an airplane. Every plane flight exists as its own, temporary 'small community' with its ow n rules of behavior, for the collective safety of that small community. Passengers who do not wish to adhere to those rules are free to seek other means of transportation. I believe that the same argument applies here.Religious exempon. I grew up in (and retain strong ties to) a deeplyreligious community in New York City that was initially, and in many cases continues to be, extremely resistant to notions of quarantine, masking, and social distancing. The advent of vaccination has changed the conversation: there remain st rong pockets of antivaxxers in this community, for diseases such as measles as well as for COVID19. While this community does not have representation at UNM, I cite it as an example that in many cases, requests for religious Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 174 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment exemption may be founded in antivaccination, government conspiracy, and political propaganda beliefs, rather than bona fide religious beliefs. Consequently, I believe that the bar for a religious exemption should be set very high. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I approve of the Vaccine Policy as written. I would be much more comfortable returning to the classroom next fall if I knew that all the students in the classroom were fully vaccinated. I appreciate the exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Historically we have required proof of vaccination for a variety of diseas es in the K 12 education system. I think this policy mirrors that system that has been in place for years. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Yes, please enforce the vaccine! We want to get back to F2F music making as soon as possible! Thank you! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am for the mandatory covid policy at UNM Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in favor of a vaccine requirement for everyone next fall. As a professor of voice and singing. This requirement would allow me and my colleagues in the voice, choral, and theatre areas of the College of Fine Arts to fully do their jobs. The masks really interfere with perf ormance and instruction. Having a vaccine requirement allows us to sing together in person which is invaluable in our field. Please make a vaccine requirement for the university so that we may get back to work in a complete way. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I would feel most comfortable if everyone is vaccinated as it is important for the voice area to return to singing without masks. This would only be possible in a safe manner, if a vaccine requirement was mandated. Thank you for your consideration! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support a university policy that requires full vaccination for students, faculty, and staff to return to campus. Understandably, those working under complete remote conditions, plus heath and religious concerns, are the exceptions. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 175 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Thank you for putting this policy forward. I strongly support it. If it moves forward I will feel much safer in the classroom. This will allow us to focus on educating our students instead of learning to navigate many quarantine situations for students and colleagues. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; We absolutely need a fullyvaccinated campus. We should require vaccinations of all UNM students, staff and faculty. We need to have their vaccination certificates on file Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in favor of requiring vaccination, allowing those with valid reasons to have an exception. This will result in a very high vaccination rate and something close to herd immunity on campus. It will minimize unnecessary risk. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support the university requiring vaccines for students, staff, and faculty on our campus. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; UNM should require vaccination for students who want inclass learning. Although there could be downside to this, it will also help increase the number of vaccinated population towards the goal of achieving herd immunity. My understanding is we are in a critical stage that vaccination rate will slow from this point on. UNM policy will help increase the rate. If the students are vaccinated, some skeptical family members could also be encouraged. In addition, considering shelf lives of the vaccines, UNM enforcement can help reduce waste of a crucial resource pretty much rest of the world desperately in need of. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Fully in favor of a vaccine requirement to keep all of UNM safe and healthy. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support the proposal to require returning students, as well as all UNM faculty staff, to be vaccinated before the beginning of the 20212022 academic year. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Thank you for the effort that was put into the Proposed COVID Vaccine Requirement policy. If implemented, this policy would not only reduce the risk of a COVID outbreak that is otherwise almost sure to occur, but will create a better learning environment because students (and instructors) returning to physical classrooms will not need to choose between attending class and placing themselves at risk. I wish you nothing but support in dealing with the inevitable backlash to what is a clearly sensible policy. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 177 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am 100% for a policy in which vaccinations are mandatory (except for few welldefined exceptions for people ho cannot be vaccinated for health reasons).Everything else is reckless and playing with people's lives. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in strong favor of the vaccination policy as outlined. Thanks for working to keep us safe! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Yes, anyone returning to work and study in Fall 2021 should offer proof of vaccination completion. I don't worry about myself (now vaccinated for several weeks now) but for my partner, who is immunocompromised and unable to mount an vaccineinduced immune response. I do not want to have to socially dist ance from my partner after each day when getting a vaccination is simple. So of course I understand that some UNM community members are unable to get the vaccine and that others have legitimate faith related concerns. These members of our community, I believe, should wear masks whenever they are outside a solitary space. Those who refuse to get vaccinated for other reasons simply need to do their work and learning enrely remotely. By August 2021, at least one of the vaccines will surely have received full approval (not just EUA) from the FDA (same as for measles or the flu). With hundreds of millions of vaccinations administered and responses closely monitored, there is no legitimate *me dicalsafety* excuse for refusing the vaccinaon. I know this is rough to say, but for those who are not interested in \"protecting the pack,\" they can reside on the outskirts of the pack. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Please require the vaccine for all. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Dear UNM Vaccine Coordinators, I feel strongly that vaccinaon should be mandatory for all faculty sta and students. I understand that some people might feel hesitant or even believe that it's not really necessary once things open up during the summer, but if it were a requirement they would go ahead and get the vax, and we would all be safer because of it. Although I am fully vaxxed, I still feel uncomfortable in crowded situations and enclosed classrooms. And I worry about the oncoming Covid variants which seem to be more vicious than the original. I plan to observe hygiene and social distancing as much as possibl e when we return to campus. These things must be kept persistently in peoples' minds, especially among younger students who may not truly understand the vulnerability we continue to face. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 178 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support the requirement that all students, faculty, and staff provide proof a vaccination before being allowed back on campus, and for a strict science based set of criteria for an exemption. I do not support any religious exemptions. I am not sure if I would be willing to te ach in person unless students in the classroom were all vaccinated, and those with a medical exemption wear a medical grade mask. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I STRONGLY support mandatory vaccination. As an institution of higher education, we must stand with science. The science is clear that vaccination the the best tool we have, and that everyone who can get the vaccination must do so in order to (1) protect those who are physically not able to or for whom the vaccine will no t be effective; (2) prevent/reduce the circulation of new strains; and (3) limit the development of new strains. We cannot rely on students to make good choices\u2014nor on citizens at large. This has become repeatedly clear over the past year (may I remind you that not lo ng ago, people put gasoline into plastic bags?). It is also clear that top down rules aligned to science affect everyday behaviors. In New Mexico, where we had scienceinformed policy, we saw much better adherence to mask wearing, compared to states where it was voluntary. UNM MUS T tak e a scienceinformed approach. Please do not prioritize (assumed) impacts on enrollments. Many universities have already committed to making the vaccine mandatory. Show that you respect the faculty, staff, and students by making the vaccine required. We still do not know the long term consequences of COVID, though early studies provide significant reasons to be concerned , as even those wi th mild cases show damage to their lungs, hearts, and brains. Other viruses, like chicken pox, stay in the body, resulting in potentially deadly and devastating cases of shingles. UNM should not treat COVID as if it is over, as if the danger has passed. Pay attention to warn igns from the WHO, not just the CDC. PLEASE do not attempt to place the UNM community in harms way, needlessly. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly support the draft policy of requiring faculty, staff and students to be fully vaccinated once the CDC gives final approval to one of the vaccines. Exceptions for health or deeply held religious beliefs should be allowed but with appropriate requirements such as wearing a mask on campus. We desperately need to be able to meet and teach face to face again, but without risking our health! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; It is crucial that UNM require vaccination of all students (with some exceptions of course). With the new Delta variant, not having our students vaccinated is a recipe for disaster. We are a community that must protect our own. It would be an ethical failure for the administration not to requir e vaccination. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 179 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Excellent policy. I recommend it without reservation. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; This seems like an excellent policy that addresses safety concerns for students, faculty, staff, and patients during this pandemic. Thank you. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support a mandatory vaccine policy for Fall 2021. Safety is a priority for all of us on campus faculty, students and administra on. If students are apprehensive to get vaccinated for whatever reason, we can make accommodations for them for a remote instruction. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I'm feeling very concerned about where it seems we're headed re: the pandemic and Fall semester. I'm being told that I need to teach in person for Fall. I'm also hearing (I think it was in one of the Provost's recent newsletters) that something like only 25% of students and 60 % of faculty and staff have been vaccinated, yet the plan is for no masks in the Fall. Also the news tells us of new variants that are spreading and that a fully vaccinated person has died after contracting one of them. We either need a vaccine policy (i.e., vaccination requ ired to come back to campus with a few specific exceptions) or we all need to be wearing masks. (Personally, I think the vaccination policy makes the most sense for the good of the community.) Yes, I can wear a mask, but I won't feel at all comfortable being in the mid st of 75% unvaccinated students or even 50% assuming that the number vaccinated increases. I have underlying health conditions and young kids at home. I'm urging the administration to take a conservative approach here. Thanks for considering this. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in full support of this policy asking people to be fully vaccinated before coming to campus unless they meet the exceptions (e.g., religion). I appreciate all the work that has gone into draing this policy.I imagine it will need to be updated once the science determines the schedule for booster shots or annual vaccinations. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think the policy is a great idea. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 181 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; This is an excellent policy and will allow UNM students, faculty, and staff to safely return to the inperson educational experience they want. This will be even more important for high contact programs like the music department where standard masking is not possible for all acvies. A queson that has come up is around students who arrive at UNM prior to becoming vaccinated due to lack of access. This could be a problem for international students. How will we accommodate these students during the 5 6 weeks of their vaccination period from first dose to full vaccination? Will th ey be allowed to participate in inperson activities during this time? What additional measures would be required for them to do so? Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; We should have mandatory vaccination of everyone on campus. This is a nobrainer.In our individualis c society, we forget that vaccines are a public health measure, meant to protect communities rather than individuals. Vaccination itself is not 100% effective for a single individual; it is only when the entire community vaccinates that a deadly disease can be eradicated. Thus, vaccination should be a safety meas ure required by the community like safe driving laws or the mandate against public defecation. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I read the draft vaccine policy and applaud UNM Leadership's position to require vaccinations for all UNM faculty, staff and students except in speci cally dened circumstances. The policy sends the message that we value science, and the safety of our community.Many thanks for this! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Everyone, without a valid medical reason to not be vaccinated,should be vaccinated.Given the known bene ts of other vaccinaons, why this is upfor debate is bewildering. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; It is important to send the message that vaccines are expected. I will feel much more comfortable teaching this Fall knowing that UNM has a policy in place, joining many other universities across the country. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think vaccination should be a mandatory part of safe return to campus. Vaccines should be required, and proof of status required. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Covid Vaccinations should absolutely be required in order for individuals to work and/or attend classes on the UNM campus. There are people who cannot benefit from immunization and depend on others to be vaccinated to limit transmission. Moreover, each time the virus is transmitted there is risk for mutati on and the develo pment of a variant that is either less or even not susceptible to the vaccines. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 182 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Please please please require vaccinations. It will make our community so much safer and I think is also a moral imperative given the inequitable impacts that COVID has had across our community. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I believe this policy is very necessary in order for classes to move forward as currently planned in Fall 2021. Personally, as a faculty member, I will not feel comfortable teaching in person without a vaccine requirement for all persons utilizing campus facilities. I hope that this would also apply to any bo oster shot that may become necessary to maximize immunity to COVID19. Currently, most of our classes are set up without any of the enrollment caps for capacity limits that correspond to CSPs for spaces. In case of an upswing, outbreak, or less than 100% vaccination rate for students registered in a class, it is unreasonable for instructors to be re quired to split up class sizes in order to safely teach in person this amounts to double the teaching load. I strongly urge you to pass this vaccinaon requirement.Thank you. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly believe that ongoing requirements for uptodate vaccination should be required of all faculty and staff. The future of the pandemic is uncertain in two respects: 1) the development of new and existing variants, 2) the longterm efficacy of the vaccine is still not well understood. Give n these uncertain and potentially precarious conditions, not to require uptodate vaccination would endanger the wellbeing of staff, faculty, students, and their families. Please set aside partisan issues and focus on doing whatever is most likely to safeguard the health and life of those who depend on this in stitution for their livelihood. Faculty Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda onS upport PolicyI fully support the vaccination policy. I believe this is a reasonable policy given the seriousness of COVID19 and the availability of vaccines. I trust the University to provide reasonable accommodations in accordance with CDC and other health guidelines.Thank you. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please implement this COVID vaccine requirement. The safer faculty and staff feel on campus the easier it will be to return to in person operations and the more face to face classes we will be able to hold.Most reluctance to get vaccines has no basis in science or facts. It is reasonable and important for UNM to take the path that many colleges and universities are following to require vaccination. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy As an instructor of classes with 150+ students, there is no other way I would feel safe returning to campus. Faculty, staff, and students on campus should be required to be vaccinated with only medical exemptions. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 183 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support the proposed policy on mandatory vaccinations. Any students, staff, or faculty who refuse to get vaccinated, for any reason, should be either denied physical access to UNM facilities or required to continue wearing masks and observing other COVID protocols. Maintaining a safe environment should always remai n a to p priority for our institution. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I cannot state strongly enough that vaccination is essential to protect our students, faculty, and staff. Moreover it protects our UNM community and our greater NM community. As a pulmonary/critical care physician, who has cared for the sickest of the sick, I feel there are very few if ANY excuses why someo n e should not be vaccinated. If they cannot be vaccinated, they should not be coming to campus. On a personal note, I feel that every person who rejects the vaccination is a slap in the face of every health care worker who has tried to save lives, in the face of every family who has lost someone, and every person who has died of COVID . Why have we become a society that does not value one another. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I personally will be excited to be back in the classroom, with more technology than ever. I feel rather confident if we are all vaccinated in the room, we should be healthy. It would be helpful if UNM could institute a mandatory vaccination for COVID requirement. Thank you! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I just wanted to state that I'm personally in favor of vaccine requirements. I don't think I can do another year of remote teaching 400level biochemistry courses to hundreds of students remotely, so for my own teaching efficacy and mental health, I really need classes to be back in perso n . Most of my students are not fairing well when forced to learn solely online. Additionally, academic integrity violations are rampant and the lengths an instructor needs to go to prevent cheating while still maintaining an equitable testing environment for all students are not reasonable nor sustainable for another year. And unfortunately, anecdotally, I've recently spoken to quite a few UNM students and their parents who really want to be back in person but have no intention of getting a vaccine unless forced to do so by UNM. I think preparing to require vaccination is a good idea, in case the minimu m voluntary vaccine threshold is not met by August. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I have read the draft policy on mandatory vaccinations, and I support it 100%. I am relieved and proud of our administration for being resolute in this matter. As a professor who teaches medium to large UG classes, this is exactly what I was hoping for. Over the past week s, I have followed news reports of other higher ed institutions across the country adopting mandatory vaccination policies, and I have been waiting for our university to follow suit. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 184 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully support the policy as stated in this document to require vaccination for all inperson services on UNM campus. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support the requirement of proof of vaccination to utilize oncampus facilities when they are open again. Major issues of public health like COVID19 are acceptable reasons to require such compliance considering that there is the opportunity to opt out for genuine medical reasons. It is those very reason s those who are immunocompromised, too young, or otherwise are incapable of taking the vaccine that makes refusing to get vaccinated unacceptable and dangerous. No one can choose to opt out of laws, rules of the road, or zoning codes due to political beliefs or misunderstandings of science, and therefor e no one should be able to opt out of taking the vaccine and still retaining the right to be on campus either. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy 1000% SUPPORT having ALL students, faculty and staff required to show proof of Covid vaccinaon. Please don't sopedal this by making it a 'recommendation'. For the good of all of us who have worked so hard to stay safe during this terrible. pandemic year, it should be mandatory. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 185 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Impact to EnrollmentI am happy to comply with a vaccine mandate. However, I do have questions about the effects, ethics, and logic of the proposed policy, as follows.Has the administra on considered the eect that this policy will have on enrollment? With poll data making clear that many young people (especially in the 1822 age group) are either hesitant or simply unwilling to be vaccinated, a non negligible number of students who may otherwise wish to atte nd UNM will simply choose another institution (and even if many institutions establish such a policy, we know many will not whether for ethical or practical reasons). As the administration knows, we cannot aord to lose students.The vaccines are currently only guaranteed to be effective for around six months. Does the administration envision a scenario in which vaccines \"expire\", as is currently suggested? If so, will it mandate renewed vaccinations? This is especially important as those vaccinated in February and March will already be nearing the end of their vaccine's proven ecacy in August and September. Those who have had proven cases of COVID19 and subsequent natural antibodies have been shown to have significant immunity and very low reinfection rates (better than the J&J vaccine, and apparently better than one shot of Pfizer/Moderna, based on current data). If an individual can prov e (via antibody test) th at they are positive for antibodies without proof of vaccination, will the administration not allow such a person to parcipate in campus acvies? Our goal as a campus is surely to reach herd immunity. However, we know that herd immunity never requires 100% immunity, or anything close. Between the large number of faculty and staff who will be voluntarily vaccinated by August (anecdotally, I would place that num ber be tween 70% and 80%) and others who have naturally occurring immunity, does the administration believe that the ethical issues inherent in mandating vaccinations (even for the unwilling) are worth the likely marginal increase in safety that such a mandate would bring?I want to spulate that I would feel very safe on a campus where four in every five people have significant protection. This is especially the case if the administration chooses to continue a mask mandate, as is currently rumored. I would also feel genuinely unhappy to learn that eve n one of my colleagues felt forced to be vaccinated simply to be allowed to perform their job on the campus of UNM. Faculty Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda on; Support Policy;I strongly support the proposed policy mandating vaccination against COVID19 for all students, faculty, and staff with limited documented exceptions for serious medical contraindications and religious prohibions. If the proposed policy is implemented, I recommend that the University provide access to COVID19 testing for the small number of individuals who may request and document a vaccination exception that does not impose a financial burden on the student or employee. Although I support a vaccination requirement, I do not sup port financially burdening any student or UNM employee with a documented vaccine exception with the cost of COVID19 testing. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 186 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support this proposed policy as written and am grateful UNM is going to make the vaccination mandatory. Faculty Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda onS upport PolicyUnless you have a health issue that means you are not able to get the vaccine, I strongly believe that vaccines should be mandatory to come onto campus. The vaccine is widely available and only has a short period in which you feel side effects. As someone who caught COVID19 in New York in March 2020, it is not worth risking the health of others. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy Fully support this commonsense policy, based on good science and best understanding of vaccines available. This is the way to protect all members of the UNM community, and thus get back to full intellectual life of the University as soon as possible. Requiring vaccinations to work live or study in perso n at UNM, with a re asonable accommodations available, violates no one's rights. Faculty Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda onR eligious Accommoda onSI fully support mandatory vaccination against COVID (except for the rare medical conditions where it is not indicated). I do recommend and request UNM also:require proof of other vaccines such as MMRclarify what the religious exempon is. Vanishingly few religions are against the vaccine, but some individuals have chosen to be against it (eg, I am Catholic and many Catholics are against it out of concern for fetal cells but Pope Francis disagrees and recommends vaccination). Faculty Supportive of Policy Concerns about SafetyAs I understand it, in order to require vaccinations for UNM students, staff, and faculty, the vaccines must receive full FDA approval (rather than the emergency FDA approval they have currently secured). That said, if/when that full approval is secured, UNM should absolutely require all students, staff, and faculty to get vacc inated, with exceptions for those who have rare medical condions, allergies, or the like.Keep UNM safe!Best,Evan Faculty Supportive of Policy Concerns about Process;Support Policy;Vaccination should be mandatory to protect the safety of others especially those who have medical conditions that put them at higher risk. Those with valid religious or medical reasons for not being vaccinated should be required to wear highquality masks not the valve masks that we sometimes see. All students facul ty sta ff etc. at this point should be wearing official identification. This identification should be clearly marked whether the individual is vaccinated or not and that way the people who are not will be clear that they need to be wearing face coverings at all times to protect the health of others.It is illogical to allow excepons for when people are eating or drinking. People take their masks off for prolonged periods of time when they do that and are exposing others. Masking should be required at all times when around other people and individuals will need to retreat to a private pla ce well away from others in order to eat or drink. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 187 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Concerns about Process;Support Policy;I support this proposed policy. I want to be back on campus. I do hope particular disciplines will have some latitude with respect to implementation of covid safe policies (including support for high quality clear masks such as bend shape makes for language teaching etc). Further I hope the university will provide guid ance toward interim policies for internships/practicum placements, again, while considering varieties of placements. I would be happy to meet with folks to discuss internship specific issues. Faculty Supportive of Policy Concerns about ProcessI am totally in favor of requiring staff, students and faculty to be fully vaccinated against Covid19. Bravo to the university for considering this measure! I hope that UNM will follow the example of other institutions who have adopted similar vaccination requirements. I feel that the requirement is necess ary to ens ure that UNM will be as safe an environment as possible for everyone. I also firmly believe that this does not constitute an infringement on anyone's personal freedom and that the need to protect people from the danger of contracting this virus far outweighs individual preferences. I do have quesons about what policies are being considering for visitors to campus. I teach in the Department of Music, and would like to know what requirements might be possible regarding audiences at concerts, for example. We also normally have programs for schoolage children in our facility on a regul a r basis and I would like to know whether vaccination protocols would be considered feasible for them and for the parents who accompany them to their lessons and classes. Faculty Supportive of Policy Concerns about Process CommentsYes, vaccinaons should be mandatory for all students, faculty, staff, etc that are on campus, with the rare medical exemptions. Require proof of vaccination, which should be easy for NM residents. No personal exempons should be allowed for anyone returning to campus. Personal choices should not endanger the rest of us and our families. The vaccines are safe and eecve, but only if enough of us get them. SuggesonsUNM will also need to monitor the data on booster shots too. We may need them every 13 years to keep us safeUNM should make it very easy for anyone needing a vaccine to get it on campus for free. Walkins welcome. Faculty Supportive of Policy Concerns about ProcessI have been hoping that UNM would make COVID vaccines mandatory and I think the draft sounds reasonable. My one caveat is that we should not wait until the FDA grants regular approval to do so. I have not heard one thing about the timeline of their doing so and I fear that it will no t be in time for the Fall semester. This Fall semester is probably the most important semester for tamping down spread of COVID on campus and in the community and any policy which does not allow for a vaccine requirement by then will not be nearly as effective. If the concern is a legal one, there are dozens of colleges and universities who have already made a vaccine requirement for Fall who obviously have received guidance that they are within their legal rights to do so, most notably the entire UC and Cal State systems. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 188 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am glad UNM is considering a policy requiring vaccination for students, staff and faculty. Students live and work in close quarters and have interactions with faculty and staff in close quarters and NM has done such good work limiting the transmission of the virus, that with a reopening of the unive rsity, I believe we need to have all precautions in place to be sure we can remain open and protect our community. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I agree with the policy and would add that students working in health related fields are required to have the vaccine in order to participate in clinical areas. Faculty Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda on; Religious Accommoda on;COVID vaccinations should be mandatory for all UNM students and employees, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons only. Thank you for asking. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am fully in favor of requiring vaccination of faculty, students, and staff to be vaccinated. We live in a state that unfortunately is underresourced when it comes to health care. We have done an AMAZING job managing the pandemic, recognizing our limitations. I believe that it is our reasonability to do everything we ca n to protect the state and mandatory vaccination is part of that strategy. Our reach into our communities is wide we interact with our families and friends. We send our children to schools throughout the area. We provide health care to people from throughout the state. By va ccinating all Lobos, we protect ourselves and this extended group of people. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support this policy, that EVERYONE accessing campus should be REQUIRED to be vaccinated except under only absolutely necessary and proven conditions requiring accommodation. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly support this proposed vaccination policy. It will be difficult for us to return to a degree of normalcy without it. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support UNM's proposed rule that all students, staff, and faculty on campus be fully vaccinated. With all the uncertainty regarding variants of the COVID virus and the possibilities of fresh outbreaks, it seems like a very sensible basic precaution, especially since some members or family members of our comm unity ca n not be vaccinated and are at risk from those around them. Perhaps UNM, like some other institutions, could develop a compensation plan as inducement to the vaccinehesitant. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 190 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am completely in favor of requiring vaccinations of all faculty, staff, and students. As a music professor and conductor of large ensembles I believe it is the only way we can return to normal operations. What we do, by nature of our activity, requires in person, group interacon, in relavely close proximity. Though our students accomplished good things in spite of having to rehearse outdoors, socially distanced, with special face masks, and in small groups, the problems of cold weather, wind, outdoor noise, occasional quarantine and reduced instructional time due to inclement weather compromised the quality of the mu sical experience for every music student. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I entirely support a vaccination mandate for anyone working in campus. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy YES! Thank you for making these wise decisions on vaccination policy for UNM! I strongly approve that everyone on campus should be required to be vaccinated to the full extent possible. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Yes, everyone should be required to be vaccinated. This helps ensure the safety of all of us, our families and loved ones, and community. It will also give an 'out' to those who might be being pressured to NOT get a vaccine or who might be on the fence . Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am glad to see the university is considering this option and support making COVID vaccinations required to be on campus (and frankly we probably need mandatory meningitis vaccinations for students too). Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Once the FDA approves and the vaccines are no longer considered experimental, and there are certain situations for which there are exemptions I am totally in favor of the requirement. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I will feel MUCH more comfortable spending time in a classroom with students knowing that everyone is vaccinated. I know that there are complications involved with creating and enforcing such a policy, but knowing that it is in place will allow me to focus on preparing to teach in person rathe r than worry (as much) about safety. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am in support of a CoVID vaccination policy that requires students and employees who wish to come to campus be vaccinated with exceptions for those who cannot receive any of the available vaccines for health reasons. There is no way to migate virus exposure within the diverse architecture and building age on campus. A buildingbybuilding policy would be too complex.Recently facilies suggested that we could open windows to improve airflow. I have two offices on campus. One office has no windows and the other has windows that cannot be opened.Thanks for your aenon. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 191 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I applaud UNM leadership on taking this step to ensure the safety of our students, sta, and faculty. Thank you.As the Execuve Director of the Health Sciences Library & Informatics Center, I know that our team is considering what reopening the campus might look like for us. We are the only publicly accessible academic health sciences library in New Mexico, and therefore, we wan t to make our resources available to our community. However, there is significant concern about the risk that allowing potentially unvaccinated community members into our space could entail. We would appreciate clear guidance from UNM on when and how it will be appropriate to reopen our doors to the public. As noted in the FAQ, it has not yet been decided whether vaccination will be required for visitors on our campus. I am personally in favor of this requirement, at least temporarily, as I believe it will help us both serve our mission to suppor t pub lic access to high quality health information and provide a level of safety for our UNM community. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am in full support of requiring a vaccine for COVID19 of all students, staff, and faculty. This is not a new requirement among universities. Given that UNM serves one of the largest populations of Native American students, staff, and faculty in the country, and that Native communities were hit th e hardest by this vaccine, I feel it is UNM's responsibility to ensure the protection and safety of our Native communities. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I just wanted to express my strong support for the proposed policy. I think that it is really important for faculty, staff, and students' health and safety, and I would feel much more comfortable teaching in person with this policy in eect.Thank you! Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy Policy looks good. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 192 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully support this proposed vaccinaon policy.Thank you for your efforts drafting it. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy Great policy. I fully support it. Vaccine should also be required to campus visitors Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support a UNM vaccination requirement for all members of the community without contraindications. It is our duty to protect the health and livelihood of our fellow UNM community members. As a Center Director I am hesitant to relax the current pandemic restrictions within my laboratories without such a poli cy. I thank all of the UNM Staff, Students and Faculty who have already been vaccinated and applaud the HSC community and other volunteers who have made the NM vaccine campaign a success. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support this measure. In a recent STATHarris Poll (March 1921), about 21% of Gen Z respondents said they won't get vaccinated, and 34% said they would \"wait awhile and see\" before getting a vaccine. The students and staff need the extra push and deadline to actually get vaccinated . As someone who will be in a room with 160 students twice a week next semester, I would feel much safer knowing that we had reached herd immunity by vaccine. I think UNM has the power to protect our community and city by helping us reach the vacci ne goal s that are needed to return to life as normal, and I strongly urge UNM to use that power. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully support a vaccination policy and am vaccinated. I would feel safer in an environment where all are vaccinated. However, if you are going to allow exceptions for religious observances/practices, it might be valuable to also include some exceptions for those in the Healing Arts (faculty and students) whose approach to healing modalities derive from nonwestern traditions and energy work, or whose life's work relies on homeop athy and a distrust of allopathy. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy The quicker UNM moves to required vaccinations, the better. More and more universities had made the announcement and UNM should not hesitate. Too much disruption was suffered for the good of all the campus community and not pushing vaccinations hard belies that success. Faculty Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a UNM physician, I am in strong support of mandatory vaccines on campus Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 194 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;Our son attends UNM. We have no interest in an experimental vaccine with no long term studies or trials that have been required of all other vaccines. If UNM requires the vaccine to attend then he will not be attending. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;not forcing my child to get an experimental vaccine Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;I do not think requiring an emergency auth vaccine is ethical for young people. As these are novel vaccines without detailed long term studies, making them a requirement for being on campus is irresponsible. I have no doubt that the UNM populaon will reach close to or even above a 60% vaccination rate without this overstep Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 198 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;During the pandemic, Professor Sucharit Bhakdi , an MD in infectious disease and immunology (Germany) came out of retirement to join 11 other proeminent scientists (including a former vicepresident of Pfizer)to write an open letter highlighting 7 chief concerns relating to the covid19 vaccines. The botto m line wa s that the danger of clot formation and developing clotting anomalies, especially in young people, had not been sufficiently considered. The covid19 virus usually penetrates the body through the nose and throat where the cells are renewed. It will replicate there unnoticed, providing a ground for your immune system to train itself. If the virus replicates to a higher extent than what the immune system is responding to, and if it gets into your lung s where the cells are not renewed all the time, then the immune system will come aack the infected cells. Says Dr. Bhakti, \u00ab By injecting the gene of the virus, you are meddling with the conductor and confusing the immune system. You are telling it that it should react against the virus part. And the problem with the immune system is that if you tra in them to play louder, they are going to play louder and louder everytime.\u00bb The vaccines introduce genes that will be make their way into your blood stream. These virus parts end up sitting in locations where the virus would have never reached, such as the vessel walls in your brai n. Once in the blood stream, it will never get out. The genes are taken up by the cells that line the blood vessels. The vaccine instructs the cells to produce spike proteins on their own. The danger of the spikes is twofold : the spike appearing on the cell's surf ace, and the waste produced. The spikes make that place on the vessel wall a place for clotting to occur. Spikes activate platelets (coagulation) just by touch and this produces clotting. Secondly, the lymphocytes will see the waste products produced by the cells and will try to attack the blood vessel wall cells prod ucing it. \u00ab This is too much of a good thing happening in a place where it should not be taking place (in the brain's blood vessels). \u00bb \u00ab You have a double path to the tragedy \u00bb , says dr. Bhakti. \u00ab I think we are heading for a catastrophe (...) it is screaming at us\u00bb. Reports started pouring in of clong problems following vaccination. Young and previously healthy people who were vaccinated are presenting with bleeding problems under the skin, splitting headaches, jerking and twitching over the whole body, vomiting, some people have gone blind, deaf and have lost speech. Many of these people have tried to have their stories hear d but have not found media attention. A facebook group of 200 000 people who had adverse effects was removed. In conversation, Robert Malone, Steve Kirsh, Bret Weinstein discuss how this prevents doctors from being alerted and recognizing adverse eects when they see them. 15 countries thereaer suspended the use of Astrazeneca vaccines. Apparently, it's not just the Astrazeneca vaccine which causes these problems. It happens with all genebased vaccines, whether MRNA or vector, because the genes are being introduced to the blood vessel walls at locations that are forbidden and whe re spikes are never produced (they are usually produced in the lungs). Many of the Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 199 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment people having important reactions are recovering. Dr. Bhakti warns however that if their understanding is correct, the immune system has been made overeactive to the virus parts. The scene is set so that when any virus ressembling covid will trigger an overly aggressive immune response whereby the lymphocytes will try to destr oy the cells that have spike that are now part of your own vessels everywhere. https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FpyP jAfNNAU%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1O0ogk1xz 5rIWduly 5QrjWjj08RS1kaz8WiILhzkRui8M LYwyvG2V6U&h=AT21BZ3thfzyZRi aR1Ie79nmP_5bc4nYLmjIdddF5rKrYCRzn8IZ12gmytHNbNO 6ubH4gc6PP58T5n8FGoEZOFstrdITI5ec8NdPDhS_S6B Parent of UN Opposed to Policy General Complaint Absolutely not. My student will be attending University of Georgia as a direct result of this policy. This is way over the line! Parent of UN Opposed to Policy General Complaint;There is no need to mandate a vaccine when there are treatments that reduce Covid severity and deaths. This American Journal of Therapeutics study just came out and it is peer reviewed. Ivermecn saves lives. Please do not mandate vaccines on young adults. The vaccine is doing more harm than good in this age demographic. https://journals.lww.com/american therapeutics/Abstract/9000/Ive rmectin_for_Prevention_a nd_Treatment_of.98040.aspx Parent of UN Opposed to Policy General Complaint;Current World Health Organization recommendations. Scroll down to their recommendations. This was last updated June 3rd. My child is currently still a minor and does not turn 18 until end of this year.hps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel coronavirus 2019/covid 19vaccines/advice Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID19. Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults. However, children should continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 200 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyThe so called vaccine for Covid I deem to be an invasion of my rights and my students rights. The so called vaccine has not completed the normal two to three trials and testing to determine its safety for long term aects on the human body. I feel the mandate is not in the best interest of the students, faculty or workers of the university. I do support the right of choice should an individual choose to take the vaccine but a mandate without the proven years of study just mak es the students and faculty guinea pigs in a governmental experiment. I nd it irresponsible of the university to jeopardize students education who have invested there me and money in aending the school.In addition, I would suggest the university evaluate closely the possible liability under such a forced mandate of a trial vaccine.A more logical approach of the school would be to provide if a student or faculty member chooses but DO NOT MANDATE. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceVaccination is a personal and family choice and should not be made mandatory for university attendance. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI will pay for my daughter to go to another university if you require mandatory vaccines. It is not up to you to choose what we decide to do with our health choices. It is an experimental vaccine and I do not agree to you forcing anyo ne to take it. I am highly opposed to this and will seek legal council if necessary to fight this. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI have had two children attend UNMLA and I have five more children that I was hoping could do the same. I am very disheartened by your proposed vaccine policy. I hope you reverse course and do not apply any vaccine restrictions. In addition, it make s no sense that your proposed policy does not at least include those who have acquired natural immunity. Natural immunity has always been superior to artificial immunity from a vaccine. You should not force or incentivize someone to make personal medical decisions. No one should be coerced to choose between an educatio n and full informed co nsent for medical decisions. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am against UNM requiring students to get the COVID vaccine in order to attend UNM. This goes against students to make health choices for themselves. The \"vaccine\" itself does not provide immunity to the infection, and it doesn't prevent one student who has been vaccinated from spreading the virus. Singling out students who choose not be vaccinated will discriminated against for their own personal health choice. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 202 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyPlease please please do NOT make the covid19 vaccine mandatory. We have absolutely zero idea of the longterm/latent implications of this vaccine because not enough time has passed. This is the greatest experiment performed on humans in the history of humanity and being an agency that denies bodily autonom y, will put us on a very very slippery slope toward removing bodily autonomy as well and putting our fate and our heath exclusively in the hands of pharmaceuticals and politicians. To assume that every single body/genetic difference etc. will handle the covid19 vaccine (or any vaccine for that matter) in the exact same way is to disregard critical thinking and common sense entirely. While it might make sense for some, it might also not make sense for others' bodies. Please honor bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thank you, Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyYour policy is a little contradictory and confusing. At one point you require all personnel to be fully vaccinated by no later than August 2, 2021 but then later you indicate enforcement will be delayed until the FDA approves regular use of at least one of the vaccines. We appreciate that you reco gnize the Federal law in this instance which makes it illegal to mandate an EAU vaccine. But what does delayed enforcement or no enforcement mean if no single vaccine is approved before the August 2 deadline or the fall semester begins? Do students have the opon to test for anbodies if they have already had a Covid infecon?Thank you. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Forcing students to get the vaccine does not seems like a wise path. The risks for each individual are very different. If someone believes that they are at a high risk from the virus then they should be able to choose to get the vaccine. Howe ver, it is also true that the vaccine comes with its own risks, and for young healthy people the risk from the virus is very low. People of a wide range in ages have been hospitalized for complications from the vaccine and many have died. Also when the CDC and WHO have open stat ed that they know little of the effects of the vaccine, I think it is best that the adult students at your university are allowed to choose what is best for their personal feelings and risks. Forcing people into what is still a medical trial is not a good look or safe idea. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;THE VACCINE SHOULD NOT BE FORCED OR ENCOURAGED ON ANYONE WITHOUT BEING FULLY FDA APPROVED. EUA IS NOT FDA APPROVAL. NO I DO NOT AGREE WITH IT BEING MANDATORY FOR ALL STUDENTS. IT SHOULD BE A CHOICE AND NO ONE SHOULD FACE ANY BACKLASH FOR REFUSING THIS VACCINE. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am very disappointed to see this information on the possibility of mandating a vaccine to attend UNM. Please reevaluate as this will cause harm to our city and state! We are not in any danger and this goes against human rights! I know many students that will seek out of state schools if this passes. Many valuable citizens are already exiting New Mexico this will add to the numbers. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 203 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Forcing a new and little time tested vaccine onto students and staff is a bad idea. There are risks for both and I think it is best that people's freedom of choice is preserved when it come to their own health. Each person has their own risks for both the vir us and the vaccine. For healthy, young individuals it is already proven by the CDC that the virus is a much lower risk, so why force people into a place of unknown risk with the vaccine. The CDC has the statistics for vaccine hospitalizations and they are not looking good. If some feels that they are at high risk if they get the virus, I think they should be free to get the vaccine to protect themselves, but it is not other people's duty to put themselves at risk with the vaccine to protect someone that has likely alre ady gotten it through free choice. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety Please do not require Covid vaccinaon for students.The vaccines are still in a phase three trial and there have been thousands of adverse affects and deaths. Participating in a trial is voluntary and everyone has the right to refuse. Healthy college students with low risk of death from Covid should not be forced to take an experimental never before used on humans vaccine. As a parent I would be devastated if my child took this vaccine to be able to go to college and then something bad happened. The pharmaceutical companies cannot be held liable for any injury from the vaccines.Check out VAERS and the reported incidents on the CDC website, which is updated every Friday. https://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 204 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;1227 North Peachtree Parkway, Suite 202. Peachtree City, GA 30269www.childrenshealthdefense.orgNOTICE FOR EMPLOYERS, UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONSMANDATING COVID19 MASKSApril 26, 2021This serves as notice that the mandate for any individual to wear a mask againstCOVID 19 for employment or aendance at a university or other instuon violatesfederal law. All COVID19 masks, whether surgical, N95 or other respirators, areauthorized, not approved or licensed, by the federal government; they are Emergency UseAuthoriza on (EUA) only. They merely states:Title 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360bbb 3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I III) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(FD&C Act) states:individuals to whom the product is administered are informed\u2014(I) that the Secretary has authorized the emergency use of the product;(II) of the signicant known and potential benefits and risks of such use, and of theextent to which such bene ts and risks are unknown; and(III) of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of theconsequences, if any, of refusing administra on of the product, and of thealterna ves to the product that are available and of their bene ts and risks.EUA products are by denion experimental and thus require the right to refuse. Underthe Nuremberg Code, the foundation of ethical medicine, no one may be coerced toparcipate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is \"absolutely essenal.\" Afederal court held that even the U.S. military could not mandate EUA vaccines to soldiers.Doe #1 v. Rumsfeld, 297 F.Supp.2d 119 (2003).In a leer dated April 24, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration stated that authorizedface masks must be labelled accurately and may not be labeled in a way that misrepresentsthe product's intended use as \"source control to help prevent the spread of SARSCoV2.\"The letter specifies that the labeling \"may not state or imply that the product is intendedfor anmicrobial or anviral protecon or related uses or is for use such as infeconpreven on or reduction.\" Any EUA mandate requiring individuals to wear face maskscon flicts with Secon 360bbb3(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I III), which provides that the person must beinformed of the opon to refuse to wear the device.Liability for forced parcipaon in a medical experiment, including possible injury, may beincalculable. Children's Health Defense urges U.S. employers, universities and otherinstuons to respect and uphold the rights of individuals to refuse to wear EUA masks. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 205 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Hello Everyone,I am wring you today to express my concern about the Vaccine Policy being proposed. I am the family member of a UNM employee of 7 years, as well as a parent of a 3 year UNM student. We love UNM dearly and want you all to know how upsetting this proposed policy is. My grave concerns are as follows:*Mandatory vaccinaons are discriminatory.*Mandatory tesng for people that receive exempons is unacceptable.*All people have the right to make their own medical choices.Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns about this disastrous policy,Jessica Lopez Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyThis is ridiculous! Students should have the right to choose whether or not they want to be vaccinated. The vaccine has not even been approved by FDA. They're are many studies that have shown it to be harmful. If this is mandated, we will pull our daughter from UNM and she will attend sc hool elsewhere. Is the August 2nd date a for sure date? We will make our decision about continuing education at UNM after the decision has been made by the university about mandating this vaccine. Parent of UN Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyAs a New Mexico resident and parent of a high schooler I'm completely against the proposed COVID Vaccine policy. 1) The COVID vaccines are for EUA only. It can not be mandatedthat's illegal.2) The COVID vaccines are not safe. The VAERS system reports more *DEATHS* from the COVID vaccines in the last 4 months compared to deaths from ALL other vaccines. 3) COVID test protocols (such as PCR and antigen tests) only have EUA. Asymptomatic surveillance of those with an exemption is discriminatory.4) My high schooler (and soontobe college freshman) is at littletono risk of dying from COVID. Statistically, the risks of an adverse reaction to the vaccine far outweigh the risk of dying from COVID.5) Any decision regarding the vaccine is between an individual and their physician. Not the government and not the University.If the University passes this vaccine policy we will not send our child to UNM for dualenrollment and will not send our child (tuon dollars) to your school. Addionally, if UNM *mandates* the vaccine UNM can and will be held liable for any adverse reactions of students/faculty NOT the vaccine manufacturers.Best regards, Parent of UN Question If my child is vaccinated by the fall semester, are all the restrictions going to be lifted (masks,in person classes,etc). Parent of UN Question I understand the policy will take affect for the Fall 2021 semester, but when will the final decision be made if this proposal passes? My son is not vaccinated yet and will need 6 weeks to be fully vaccinated. Ideally that means this decision will be made by early July so student s can schedule their shots. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 206 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Supportive of Policy Support Policy I'm a parent of two UNM students (undergraduate and graduate programs), as well as a nurse at UNM Hospital. I experienced first hand the impact COVID had on our ability to provide care to our community and believe we cannot risk having another setback in the fall. Havin g a well defined policy for mandatory COVID vaccination will continue to allow for progress in reaching herd immunity.I applaud UNM for considering this and truly hope the policy is adopted! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 208 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Parent of UN Supportive of Policy Concerns about Safety;Hi. I got an MS in Health Ed at UNM years ago and subsequently got aa Masters in Public Health Nursing so this topic is incredibly important to me. I am also bringing my daughter from Hawaii to aend UNM in August.I am so very appreciave of your transparency with the covid19 vaccine policy and the opportunity to provide feedback. Hawaii continues to have very strict guidelines in place, including indoor mask mandates. We had the unique opportunity to virtually stop traffic to the islands since everyone obviously has to travel by plane to get here. Anyway... I feel very strongly that my daughter (who was vaccinated) should not be exposed (in her residence hall, classrooms, other campus venues). I work as a nurse with Veterans and have been keenly aware that my choices and those of my family member s (i .e. distancing, mask wearing, etc) could mean the difference between life and death to my elderly patients. While I understand CDC, FDA, etc, are continuing to monitor risk and transmission with/ without vaccination, the stakes are still too high to take risks. As is the case with any vaccine, some in our mid st just can not get vaccinated and it is our moral imperative, in my opinion, to protect them.So...I would encourage you to consider revising your policy to:1) Move \"EXISTING POLICIES CONCERNING COVIDSAFE PRACTICES:\" to the beginning.. Reading this last part was reassuring but I didn't get to it until the end. Please consider reinforcing the steps you have already taken and then addressing these addional proposed policy components.2) Consider stronger language where it states, \"MAY BE required to adhere\". This makes the policy seem less meaningful and that there may be some subjective determination about who has to follow policies and who doesn't... very unlikely the intention, I realize. Can it state that these folks \"WILL BE\" or \"SHALL BE\" re quired with a caveat about when that would occur? a) Pg 1, paragraph 2 under \"Applicaon\"\"Individuals who are not vaccinated MAY BE required to participate in or implement additional CSPs to mitigate risk to others whenever they access University facilities, housing, services, programs or acvies in person\" CAN THIS READ SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, \"in the case such additional measures are necessary to reduce exposure to variant of the sars cov2 virus\" or \"if federal and/or state health officials determine such additional precautions are needed to reduce community spread...\" or something along those lines? b)Pg 2, ADA Accommoda on:\"A person who is granted a reasonable accommodation MAY BE required to adhere to additional safety measures to ensure the health and safety of the individual and the University community,....\" c)Pg 2 paragraph 1 under \"Religious\"A person who is granted a reasonable accommoda on MAY BE required to adhere to additional safety measures to ensure the health and safety of the individual and the University community...\"3) Pg 2:\"Students requiring accommoda ons in their academic environment must submit a request to the Accessibility Resource Center.\" How about adding, \"prior to start of any inperson classes or on campus employment\"?I AM NOT OKAY with my kid having an unvaccinated roommate in the dorms Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 209 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment and I think it is incredibly strange that students are being advised (in the faqs) not to ask each other about vaccination status. I think this may fuel anxiety in some cases...People can decline to answer but college is about free speech, learning to communicate respectfully with those who have differing views, etc.. This seem s to be a gr eat opportunity for Fall group discussions (i.e. guided by SW grad students & UNMH faculty?) regarding public health and so much more!\"there may be badge aachments, sckers, pins, or other indicators that vaccinated individuals may choose to use to show that they have received the vaccine. Be advised you should not ask other individuals if they are vaccinated.\" Parent of UN Supportive of Policy Support Policy; So glad to see you finally speaking out and at least contemplating a vaccine requirement. I think you should have done it months ago but \"beer late than never\" as they say. Please implement immediately and make sure the exception process isn't abused.Our son is an honor student at UNM and works on campus. Other family members work for other universities and all of them have long since announced they will require all faculty, staff and students to be vaccinated for Fall 2021. We'd have felt a lot more confident in UNM's leadership if you had done so too!We've asked our son for months if he knows what UNM will do and he just kept saying no. He got vaccinated as soon as he could, as did we. He deserves a safe environment for his work and studies, as do the other students, faculty and sta.I respect the fact that some may choose not to get vaccinated and that is their right but they DON'T have a right to infect others or spread C19. Kids are required to be vaccinated for the measles and a host of other disea ses that are less prevalent than C19 and generally less harmful. Part of being a citizen of a State or Nation is accepting certain constraints on individual behavior in order to facilitate collecve safety. Nobody shows up at their State Houses with guns or attacks Congress to argue that governments can't specify we drive on the right side of the road. Insisting citizens be vaccinated is no different. It follows from the same principles of philosophy and government. A State in which people claim a \"righ t\" to actions which spread C19 is no different than a State in which you can drive any way you want with no regard for the injuries you cause. That's not a State I want to live in even if some our neighbors do think it would be great. Kindest regards, Parent of UN Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I chose \"Parent of Student\" even though I am currently a student, undergraduate alumni and graduate alumni as of tomorrow. I think this is an excellent vaccine policy and I fully support it! Requiring vaccines for students, faculty, and staff means that UNM can get back to being the fine educational and research institution it is and oer students a quality learning experience. Public institutions have had policies that require proof of vaccinations for many decades now and the Covid19 vaccine should be no different. In the interest of public health requiring vaccines is a perfectly reasonable and commendable policy. Thank you!! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 210 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Retiree Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI totally disagree with any attempt to force the UNM community to be vaccinated against anything! Our health is not your responsibility nor subject to your decree. I'm so glad I'm no longer subject to this nonsense.Your policy proposal selects one hazard out of thousands. Are you going to dictate requirements for all flus? Polio? Smallpox? Any other potentially contagious disease?The university is a place for learning and opportunity, not communiststyle diktat. Provide knowledge and opportunity, not propaganda and commandments. You want people to get vaccinated? Use honey, not bayonets. Let those vaccinated live normal unmasked lives, and those who don't remain subject to statedictated limitations (with which I also disagree.) Retiree Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThere is no one that I know that feels like MANDATORY vaccinations OF ANY TYPE need to be a part of the USA and our rights according to Law.Please do everything you can to stop this CRAZINESS!!!! Retiree Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyTheir body their choice! Rush to produce and cax before FDA APPROVAL is unconscionable Retiree Opposed to Policy General Complaint;UNM has always been the champion of the marginalized. This policy creates a Marginalized Group within UNM's staff, students, faculty and community those who are not vaccinated. Retiree Question Concerns about EnforcementAs usual, retirees (I am a Professor Emeritus) seem to have been forgotten. I'd like to be able to come on campus and use the library and other resources. I have been fully vaccinated. How will the new policy apply to us?Thank you Retiree Question Concerns about Safety;As a former student, staff, and faculty member I am very anxious to return to campus and see everyone I've missed over the last 2 years of quaranne.I have also developed heart, lung, kidney, and diabetes complications due to several congenital conditions and am very medically fragile... I am completely vaccinated and will continue to practice masking/distance (etc...) for a long time to come!How does someone in my situaon protect themselves from the questionable motives and/or behaviors of antimaskers (antigovernment) protesters in the community? Retiree Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am a UNM Retiree & Alumnus. I strongly support the requiring of a vaccination for in person learning. I encourage UNM to set this policy. In fact I hope more organizaons will follow suit.Thank you for your time Retiree Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Yes, it looks good. Why shouldn't we.all have to protect themselves and others? thanks for asking........ Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 211 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Retiree Supportive of Policy Support Policy This is an excellent idea. Reasonable accommodations are included for those who have medical or religious qualifying exemptions, and there should be no other reason for not getting the vaccine. Thank you for instituting this policy, making UNM a safe campus for all. Retiree Supportive of Policy Support Policy HiI think it's a very reasonable policy to expect everyone to be vaccinated. This disease is so nasty that protecting everyone by requiring a vaccine is sound policy. You'll have detractors and they complain the loudest but I think remaining steadfast in your approach is a good idea. As we know, antivaxxers take a loud and unreasonable approach and the university will have to be strong in conviction. I hope you can protect most of us and not let th e minority rule over everyone. Retiree Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this policy is reasonable and carefully constructed. It is important for people on campus to commit to protecting themselves and each other by getting vaccinated. Only then can we have the confidence to return to the activities that make the UNM experience viable and valuable. I do hope that the responses to this call for comment will be positive and forward looking, and that nearly everyone will understand the importance of mandatory vaccinaon. Thank you for your considera on. Staff Neutral Concerns about Process;Concerns about Safety;My concern is safety, protocols, fairness, etc. I work in an office that the Dean allows two of the managers to work remotely (before the pandemic) and all hourly employees are not allowed. The moral in our office is horrible and I cannot imagine how it will be going back after this pa ndemic is over. Managers should not be allowed to work remotely if hourly employees cannot. We have ALL proven that we can do our jobs remotely this past year. The office I work in is not fair to all the employees and after this past year, that is a MUST. It will not be fair if som e employees are allowed to continue to work remotely and others are required to come into the office. This is critical and needs to be addressed. I worry about my safety in my office and worry that COVID protocols will NOT be follo wed. Than k yo u. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 212 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral General Complaint;\"The present assessment raises the question whether it would be necessary to rethink policies and use COVID19 vaccines more sparingly and with some discretion only in those that are willing to accept the risk because they feel more at risk from the true infection than the mock infection. Perhaps it might be neces sary to dampen the enthusiasm by sober facts? In our view, the EMA and national authorities should instigate a safety review into the safety database of COVID19 vaccines and governments should carefully consider their policies in light of these data. Ideally, independent scientists should carry out thorough case revi ews of the very severe cases, so that there can be evidencebased recommendations on who is likely to benefit from a SARSCoV2 vaccination and who is in danger of suffering from side effects. Currently, our estimates show that we have to accept four fatal and 16 serious side effects per 100 ,000 vaccinations in order to save the lives of 2-11 individuals per 100,000 vaccinations, placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude.\"h ps://www.mdpi.com/2076 393X/9/7/693/htm Staff Lepirsum.pdf Staff Neutral General Complaint;https://www.bitchute.com/video/biEzDLQ0Jp0r/ Staff Neutral General Complaint;What can be done to more adequately discourage critical thinking among those sectors opposed to mandatory vaccinaon?h ps://lockdownscep cs.org/2021/05/12/mit researchers findthatskepticsvaluedataliteracyand scientific rigour/hps://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1IUhyKVEAMWuDV?form at=jpg&name=900x900 Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 213 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral General Complaint;Some researchers have criticized a lack of adequate informed consent in relaon to certain risks (my emphasis):Aims of the study: Paent comprehension is a crical part of meeting medical ethics standards of informed consent in study designs. The aim of the study was to determine if sufficient literature exists to require clinicians to disclose the specific risk that COVID19 vac cines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulang virus.Methods used to conduct the study: Published literature was reviewed to idenfy preclinical and clinical evidence that COVID19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulang virus. Clinical trial protocols for COVID19 vaccines were reviewed to determine if risks were properly disclosed.Results of the study: COVID19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising anbodies may sensise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and tesng of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanis c concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the tradional approach (consisng of the unmodi ed or coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising anbodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID19 disease via antibodydependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviang truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.Conclusions drawn from the study and clinical implicaons: The speci c and signicant COVID19 risk of ADE should have been and should be prominently and independently disclosed to research subjects currently in vaccine trials, as well as those being recruited for the trials and future paents aer vaccine approval, in order to meet the medical ethics standard of paent comprehension for informed consent.Cardozo T, Veazey R.

Respected virologist Dr. Bill Gallaher, Ph.D., made excellent arguments as to why you would expect cross reaction. Due to beta sheet conformation similarities between spike proteins and syncyn1 and syncyn2. I have yet to see a single immunological study which disproves this. Despite the fact that it would literally take the manufacturers a single day to do these syncytin studies to ascertain this [once they had serum from vaccinated individuals]. It's been over a yea r since the assertions were first made that this [the body attacking its own syncytin proteins due to similarity in spike protein structure] could occur. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 215 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral General Complaint;By the end of May, nearly the entire establishment, including many health officials, came together to agree that while lockdowns and social distancing were essential, special exceptions could be made for mass protests (provided the cause was establishment supported) and politically charged funerals (but not the funerals of everyday, unknown people). This underscored the fundamental ly political nature of \"pandemic\" policy. Perhaps not coincidentally it was at this point, skepticism about Covid19 began to gain the upper hand with me.By early August, I was appealing to library administrators to reopen the library and return to normal, as soon as possible, not least because of the threat of the continuing lockdown to everyone's economic wellbeing.Meanwhile, many experts pointed out that lockdowns and masking had long been opposed by epidemiologists for combatting respiratory epidemics, and that existing pandemic plans excluded such recommendations. Suddenly all of this was overturned in 2020, and lockdowns and masking became unquestionable and holy\u2014The Science to which ever y knee must bow. The public health establishment decided to follow the example of China's totalitarian response to the virus, rather than following longestablished protocols for controlling airborne diseases. The Science also meant that we must continue quarantining returned books in the library and overusing disinfectant spray everywhere, despite research having pretty clearl y demonstrated by that point that surface transmission was praccally nonexistent.Over me, it became clear that the \"novel\" coronavirus was not as novel as all that. It behaved in some familiar ways, and human memory Tcells already provided some immunity to it, due to previous exposure to other types of coronaviruses. Also, the human immune system was alive and well , and had other lines of defense, especially among the healthy.Studies cast doubts on any number of non pharmaceutical interventions. The example of Sweden defied the prophecies of disaster that had resulted from its chosen policy of comparative openness. In the United States, dire predictions about the results of beach parties, mass gatherings, and eventually, the liing of lockdowns in certain states, failed to materialize.*I was never sold on the whole idea of Operation Warpspeed. As a Trump voter, it touches my heart that so many Trumphaters are willing to trust the Trump vaccines on faith, but I have been skeptical of them from day one. I do not see regulatio n, as such, as either all good or all bad. There are good reasons why vaccines, and medicines in general, should not be rolled out without extensive testing. Even when there has been testing, it often takes time for longterm side effects to emerge. Of course, it doesn' t help when pharmaceutical companies suppress their own research results that show things they would rather not see. It cannot be emphasized enough that the pharmaceutical industry is very big business indeed, and it uses its money to influence politicians and media. I thought this was something anyone remotely only the lef t usually had a grasp of.Also noteworthy are the complex es of Trump's \"vaccine czar\" to the pharmaceutical industry, including companies specifically involved in the manufacture of the Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 216 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment \"vaccine\":h ps://www.nymes.com/2020/05/20/health/corona virusvaccineczar.htmlTo make maers worse, these are not conventional vaccines. These \"vaccines\" use various mechanisms to instruct our bodies to produce spike proteins. There are serious questions about the risk of turning people's cells into spike protein generators. This mechanism comes with a number of risks. Staff Neutral Concerns about ChoiceWhile I am in favor of the vaccine and hope that most of the Staff/Students/Faculty at the university receive one, I hope that UNM leadership takes into account the many viewpoints and situations that our Lobos have. UNM prides itself on its diversity and inclusion, and I worry that divisive action, treating a soci al matter as right or wrong, will only cause further division among a country and a community that have been pushed to braking points over the past several years. There's clearly not an easy answer to the question, and there are seemingly countless variables and backgrounds that must be accou nted for and worked with, yet I hope that UNM leadership makes a decision that brings Lobos together again instead of farther apart. If I learned anything while studying at UNM, it's that with humans, there's always another variable. It's never this or that, there's always something on either peripher y. The safety of every Lobo is the university's top priority, and while I reside somewhere in the grey middle ground of either option on vaccine requirements, I hope that we can choose an option that unites, rather than divides. Staff Neutral General Complaint I don't feel that I can provide true feedback or present a comment unless it's anonymous. Staff Neutral Concerns about Safety;I am not comfortable returning to work with buildings at 75100% capacity unless UNM requires vaccines. It seems incredibly irresponsible to allow full operations knowing that COVID19 becomes more severe as it mutates in unvaccinated populations. Further, vaccines are not proven to offer a high level of protec tion for peop le who are immunecompromised. So the message seems to be that we are not willing to protect those members of the UNM community. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 217 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral Concerns about Choice; Greengs! While I am in favor of vaccinang our worlds population to help control pandemics and diseases, I am not sure requiring the COVID19 vaccine is a fair proposition because there will be those in our midst who refuse to be vaccinated simply because they do not trust the science behind the effort. Wouldn't we be making it more difficult for these individuals to exercise their freedom and choose how to live their lives? Now we would have to make accommodations for these folks to continue to do their jobs effectively and for some occupations this does not make sense. For example: a janitor. We may say, \"Just find some one else to do the job\", but this may have legal implications tantamount to discrimination. Just because someone earns a pauper's wage does not exclude them from the same rights as others who earn a living wage. For those who choose to not be vaccinated, simply force them to wear a mask and stay socially distant for the rest of their lives. I think you can see where this is going. Thanks for reading my response and have a great day! Staff Neutral Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Safety FYIThe two points of considera on regading this proposal being most talked about are:1.) Is the vaccine safe?2.) Is this proposed requirement legal?I oer these observaons in service to the community. I will continue to advocate for the use of the vaccine per the infromaon from the FDA and CDC. I would like to add...I have generally been very impressed with and thankful for the high degree of excellence illustrated by the actions of the UNM Administration, HSC and all ancillary positions of responsibility during these unprecedented mes!Good luck going forward. Best, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 218 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about Process Concerning the mandatory requirement for vaccines:1. It would be nice if UNM offers vaccine appointments directly with UNM students, faculty and staff. At this time, it is convenience, or rather inconvenience, that has me not being vaccinated. I live outside Albuquerque and many people in my area are being sent 4 hours awa y to get a shot. Also, I have been waiting for the oneshot vaccine to be more readily available. I know UNM was talking about setting up vaccine options for students, it would be nice to spread that to cover faculty and sta.2. I am not sure about the request for this to be mandatory, especially for younger healthy individuals. In reviewing the CDC website, they state that 80% of Covid19 deaths are in those over the age of 65, 95% in those older than 45. From what I have read an d been told by those who had Covid, younger healthy individuals are not affected that much a few bad days and then are fine. The 2nd shots, per the CDC, have similar affects: \"Side effects after your second shot may be more intense than the ones you experi enc ed after your first shot. These side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection and should go away within a few days.\" We had two younger people in our department who had to take sick leave after receiving their 2nd shot because of the side effects, one of which stat es he had been told to expect those effects by others who had their 2nd shot. The other queson that comes to mind is there are now discussions where regular booster shots will be needed in the future. Will this be mandatory every year? Is this something we really want UNM to be requiring for employment? Is this something UNM needs to require for normal operations? We do no t require the flu shot which does cause some to miss work every year. Just as those who are more vulnerable (older or with medical conditions) tend to get the flu shot, these same people will be geng the Covid19 vaccine. I believe this should be an individual choice, though making the vaccine more readily available to the UNM community would help those who haven't received it yet or those who are undecided. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 219 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral Support Policy; The first paragraph could be reworded to be more clear. It could be interpreted that the deadlines only apply to students, faculty and staff not currently working, living and learning on campus. If people ARE currently working, living or learning on campus, when do they need to be vaccinated by? \"As soon as possible\" is helpful, but it's not an enforceable deadline.If UNM will have a vaccination deadline, there should be a consistent deadline applied to all people coming to campus. It's not clear why faculty and students are given a later deadline than staff. Faculty and students could be on campus earlier than than August 23. Stude nts can ha ve movein week, early starting classes, orientation, etc. I'm sure faculty could come to campus early to do research, prep for classes, meet with their department staff and other faculty, etc. Also, staff can be students; students can be instructors. That creates some confusion as to which deadline applies. Most COVID vaccines take 12 weeks to reach full effectiveness. If a student gets vaccinated on August 20, they wouldn't be fully immune yet when starting their oncampus classes August 23. It seems like some consideration of the incubation time should be adde d to the policy. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 220 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Neutral General Complaint;After following the unfolding story of the SARSCoV2 virus in January and early February of last year, I started asking my supervisor and her supervisor questions about how the university was preparing for it. I made an agitated appeal to my boss's boss to start thinking about the issue, overenthusiastically claimi ng tha t the virus spread even more easily than the flu, and, of course, that asymptomatic transmission was a big issue with this virus. I'm not sure even the incorrect claims I had read from others ever went as far as to claim the virus was more easily spread than the flu. I ta lked with other staff members about the possibility of working remotely. By this point I had seen a lot of frightening videos of unknown provenance showing things like people collapsing in the street. Surely they couldn't all be fake? (Really? Was I that gullible?) It turns out many of thes e videos have since been identified as having nothing to do with Covid19. When I saw China's drastic response to the Covid19 outbreak, I assumed that it had to be a serious threat, because I didn't think China would hurt its economy so much over something minor. Also, gi ven the very plausible case that the virus might have emerged from the Wuhan lab where gain of function research was being carried out made the situation seem particularly highrisk. If this was some sort of bioweapon, who knows how bad it could be? (Of course, even if it was lab made, it was not necessa rily a bioweapon.) At the time, making the case that the virus might have escaped from the Wuhan lab was taboo, and quickly became the sort of thing that might get you banned from social media. If I recall correctly, Zero Hedge's Twitter feed was taken dow n as a result of their discussing that possibility, not even asserting it as proven fact. In May of 2021, speculation that the virus originated in a lab has become more mainstream. To return to 2020, I also was exposed to the quasiapocalyptic Covid19 predictions based on Neil Fergu son's infamously flawed model of the likely course of the disease. Many individuals outside the mainstream whose opinions I respected regarded Covid19 as a serious threat, leaning toward support for some of the direst predictions. Indeed, the theme of Covid19 as threat probably picked up steam more quickly in alternative than mainstream media. Given my biases against mainstream media, when sources such as the Washington Post dismissed concern with Covid19 in favor of emphasizing the threat of the flu, I was all the more prepared to believe the threat was serious. (I'm not saying this is what happened, but if yo u wanted to launch a psy op that would have me fooled for a while, you could do worse than have the mainstream media deny and dismiss claims, while flooding social media with reports of a growing catastrophe, while some government, the Chinese government in this case, appe ared to downplay the extent of it.)In March I was regreably one of many library employees to sign a letter petitioning UNM to temporarily close the libraries.I mostly avoided reading skepcal takes on Covid19, even in alternative media sites I normally followed, but eventually I became curious about what those skeptics had to say. When I started reading it, much of it made sense to me. Some experts, for example, were pointing out that Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 221 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment the virus was already following familiar seasonal patterns that appeared in different countries regardless of what non pharmaceutical interventions they had instituted. Staff Neutral Concerns about EnforcementI think it would be useful if people had to take their vaccination card to the Lobo Card office so that a marker could be put on their ID as to whether or not they are vaccinated. Then, EVERY entrance on campus buildings would require a Lobo ID swipe, and only those with the vaccin a ted marker on their ID are let in. I feel like this is the only realistic way to track those on campus who are vaccinated to allow them to use campus facilities.

And there have [also] been reports of impaired spermatogenesis and placental findings from both the natural infection, vaccinated, and syncytin knockout animal models that have similar placental pathology, implicating a syncytinmediated role in these outcomes.Addi onally, we have heard of mulple reports of menses irregularities in those vaccinated. These must be invesgated. We simply cannot put these [vaccines] in our children who are at .002% risk for Covid mortality, if infected, or any more of the childbearing age population without thoroughly invesgang this maer.[If we do], we could potenally sterilize an entire generation. Speculation that this will not occur and a few anecdotal reports of pregnancies within the trial are not sufficient proof that this is not impacting on a populationwide scale.Secondly, all of the gene therapies [Covid vaccines] are causing coagulopathy. [Coagulopathy when the body's blood clotting system is impaired.] This is not isolated to one manufacturer. And this is not isolated to one age group. As we are seeing coagulopathy deaths in healthy young adults with no secondary comorbidi es. There have been 795 reports related to blood clotting disorders as of April 9th in the VAERS reporting system, 338 of these being due to thrombocytopenia.There are forward and backward mechanistic principles for why this is happening. The natural infection is known to cause coagulopathy due to the spike protein. All gene therapy vaccines direct the body to make the spike protein. Zhang et al in [a scientific paper publish ed in the Journal of Hematology & Oncology] in September 2020 showed that if you infuse spike protein into mice that have humanized ACE2 receptors on blood platelets that you also get disseminated thrombosis. Spike protein incubated with human blood in vitro also caused blood clot development which was resistant to fibrinolysis. [Fibrinolysis is the body's process of breaking down blood clots]. The spike protein is causing thrombocytic events, which cannot be resolved through natural means. And all vaccines must be halted in the hope that they can be reformulated to guard against this adverse eect.The arcle continues with a continuation of her comment in written form (since her oral comment was interrupted due to time limits):Third, there is strong evidence for immune escape, and that inoculation under pandemic pressure with these leaky vaccines is driving the creation of more lethal mutants that are both newly infecting a younger age demographic, and causing more Covidrelated deaths across the population than would have occurred without intervention. That is, there is evidence th at the vaccines are making the pandemic worse.It is clear that we are seeing a temporal immune depression immediately following the inoculations [see World Meter Global Covid deaths counts following inoculation dates] and there are immunosuppressive regions on spike proteins, as well as Syn2, that could be likely causing this, through a Tcell med iated mech anism. If we do not stop this vaccine campaign until these issues can be investigated, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 224 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment we may see a phenomenon such as we see in chickens with Marek's disease.We have enough evidence now to see a clear correlation with increased Covid deaths and the vaccine campaigns.

Why is our university 's pres ident continuing to push these highrisk shots, when Covid19 results in no more than mild flulike symptoms in most people?\"Among the most crical tests, which must be performed prior to testing any drug or vaccines in a human being, is whether it can cause mutations in the DNA (genotoxicity), or whether it could cause problems with cells or tissues of the reproductive tract - including ovaries (repro ductive tox icity). In the case of the Pfizer COVID mRNA vaccine, these newly revealed documents raise additional questions about both the genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity risks of this product. Standard studies designed to assess these risks were not performed in compliance with accepted empirical research standards. Furthermore, in key studies designed to test whethe r the vaccine remains near the injection site or travels throughout the body, Pfizer did not even use the commercial vaccine (BNT162b2) but instead relied on a \"surrogate\" mRNA producing the luciferase protein.These new disclosures seem to indicate that the U.S. and other governments are conducting a massive vaccination program with an incompletely characterized experimental vaccine. It is certainly understandable why the vaccine was rushed into use as an experimental product under emergency use authority [BULLSHIT!], but these new findings suggest that routine quality tes ting issues were overlooked in the rush to authorize use. People are now receiving injections with an mRNA gene therapybased vaccine, which produces the SARSCoV 2 spike protein in their cells, and the vaccine may be also delivering the mRNA and producing spike protein in unintended organs and tissu es (which may include ovaries).

Another nding that is not being widely talked about is that both the delta variant and COVID 19 is infecting individuals that are FULLY vaccinated. Hospitalizations and rapid spread is occurring for fully vaccinated people. The \"vaccine\" is a permanent change in an individual's DNA and irreversible. The uni versity needs to be weary of making this mandatory for anyone as even the wording for mandatory could make them responsible for any adverse side effects or death. The CDC is accounting for the adverse side effects and deaths as a direct result of the \"vaccine\". I would not make this man datory as people are responsible for the side effects if it is their choice. If you do make it mandatory there needs to be exemptions and the exemptions need to be brought to everyone's attention and not hidden.

In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes in the spike antigen using a novel TCRbind ing alg orithm. The predicted epitopes induced robust in unexposed donors demonstrating preexisting CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity to SARSCoV2 antigen. The Tcell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the SpikeS1 and S2 peptide pools in the unexposed donors. A key finding of our stud y is that preexisting Tcell immunity to SARSCoV2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS CoV2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple publis hed studies in wh ich preexisting Tcell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARSCoV2 and other common coldcausing coronaviruses. However, our findings suggest that SARSCoV2 reactive Tcells are likely to be present in many individuals because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses.\"h ps://www.nature.com/ar cles/s41598 02192521 4Of course, I guess this won't mean anything to people who think they are \"following the science\" by dismissing the natural immunity of those who have had Covid19! If there is any give away that your proposal is not following the science, it is is your insistence that those who have already had the virus be vaccinated.A most unimpressive performance on your part, demonstrating a complete lack of rational leadership where health policy is concerned.

How bad do the adverse events have to become?\"Background: COVID19 vaccines have had expedited reviews without sufficient safety data. We wanted to compare risks and bene ts. Method: We calculated the number needed to vaccinate (NNTV) from a large Israeli field study to prevent one death. We accessed the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) database of the European Medicines Agency and of the Dutch National Register (lareb.nl) to extract the number of cases repo rting severe side effects and the number of cases with fatal side eects. Result: The NNTV is between 200-700 to prevent one case of COVID19 for the mRNA vaccine marketed by Pfizer, while the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9,000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate. The number of cases experiencing adverse reactions has been reported to be 70 0 per 100,000 vaccinations. Currently, we see 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations, and the number of fatal side effects is at 4.11 per 100,000 vaccinations. For three deaths prevented by vaccination, we have to accept one inflicted by vaccinaon. Conclusions: This lack of clear bene t should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.\"hps://lockdownscep cs.org/2021/06/24/oneperson diesforeverythreelivessavedsayspeerreviewed vaccine study/Incidentally, this has come closer to home in the past week.

Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 231 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;In a March, 22, 2021 editorial in the British Medical Journal, Idrani Roy (idened only as a scienst) writes:Here I would like to bring attention to an urgent and very important issue of its indirect effect. Apart from the direct side effect after vaccination, if any; the secondary effect that might be caused due to mutation of the virus after mass vaccination needs att ention too. After the initiation of vaccine programme, almost all countries experienced a sudden surge of transmission and most countries had to impose strict lockdown measures.Professor Paul Bieniasz from Rockefeller University, USA, expressed his concern that vaccines themselves can also drive viral mutations and hence COVID19 vaccines can add fuel to the evolution of mutation of Coronavirus. According to him the time between initial vaccination and the time of second shot to maximize the immune response migh t serve as a sort of breeding ground for the virus to acquire new mutations [1].A highly populated country India was having a steady decrease for five months. India did not have any lockdown. Though neighbouring countries Pakistan and Bangladesh experienced the 2nd wave this winter but India did not. India passed major festive seasons where social distancing was very difficult to be maintained, still cases and deaths continued to decline. Su rprisingly, vaccination started on 16th January and from around 16th February, India started showing a rise in cases. Now there is a steep rise in deaths too [2]. As India nearly managed the disease without any vaccine or lockdown, it attracted global attention. However, scientists failed to associate any ob vious cause for the sudden surge in the recent period when winter passed. India's neighbouring countries Pakistan and Bangladesh also started a rise in cases in recent period, after vaccination started, though they already experienced a 2nd wave last winter.For Brazil, vaccination started in midJanuary and a sharp rise in cases is observed since midFebruary. Such a steep rise in deaths in Brazil that happened for the last one month never happened in the whole period of pandemic. It already reached twice the height of prev ious peaks [3]. Globally, the cases started increasing after 5 weeks of a steady decline and coincidentally, the period of rise matches when major vaccination programmes were initiated worldwide. Some countries are now showing a decline, where lockdown and seasonal temperature are playing strong roles. Even for the UK and Israel, where ma ssive vaccination took place, the total deaths in the last three months after vaccination now reached the overall death of the past 10 months before vaccination [2].hps://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037/rr 20 Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 232 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;There have been many attempts to make viral vaccines in the past that ended in utter failure, which is why we did not have a coronavirus vaccine in 2020. In the 1960's, sciensts aempted to make an RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine for infants. In that study, they skipped animal trials because they weren't necessary back then. In the end, the vaccinated infants got much sicker than the unvaccinated infants when exposed to the virus in nature, with 80% of the vaccinated infants requiring hospitaliza on, and two of them died. Aer 2000, sciensts made many aempts to create coronavirus vaccines. For the past 20 years, all ended in failure because the animals in the clinical trials got very sick and many died, just like the children in the 1960's. You can read a summary of this history/science here. Or if you want to read the individual studies you can check out these links: In 2004 aempted vaccine produced hepas in ferrets In 2005 mice and civets became sick and more suscepble to coronaviruses aer being vaccinated In 2012 the ferrets became sick and died. And in this study mice and ferrets developed lung disease. In 2016 this study also produce lung disease in mice.The typical paern in the studies menoned above is that the children and the animals produced beautiful anbody responses aer being vaccinated.The manufacturers thought they hit the jackpot.The problem came when the children and animals were exposed to the wild version of the virus.When that happened, an unexplained phenomenon called Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) also known as Vaccine Enhanced Disease (VED) occurred where the immune system produced a \"cytokine storm\" (i.e. overwhelmingly attacked the body), and the children/animals died. Here's the lingering issue... The vaccine makers have no data to suggest their rushed vaccines have overcome that problem.The enre post is worth reading, in my opinion.

The vaccines are experimental by definition. They will remain in Phase 3 trials until 2023. Recipients are human subjects entitled to free informed consent under Nuremberg and other protections, including the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe's resolution 2361[43] and the FDA's terms of emergency use aut horisation[29]. With respect to safety data from Phase 1 and 2 trials, in spite of initially large sample sizes the journal Vaccine reports that, \"the vaccination strategy chosen for further development may have only been given to as few as 12 parcipants\"[32].With such extremely small sample sizes, the journal notes that, \"larger Phase 3 studies conducted over longer periods of time will be necessary\" to establish safety. The risks that remain to be evaluated in Phase 3 trials into 2023, with entire populations as subjects, include not only thrombosis and bleeding abno rmalities, but other autoimmune responses, allergic reactions, unknown tropisms (tissue destinations) of lipid nanoparticles[35], antibodydependent enhancement [4346] and the impact of rushed, questionably executed, poorly regulated[47] and reportedly inconsistent manufacturing methods, conferring risks of potentially harmful impurities such as uncontrolled DNA residues[48]. The vaccines are not safe, either for recipient s or for those who administer them or authorise their use.5. Inial experience might suggest that the adenovirus derived vaccines (AstraZeneca/Johnson & Johnson) cause graver adverse effects than the mRNA (Pfizer/Moderna) vaccines. However, upon repeated injection, the former will soon induce antibodies against the proteins of the adenovirus vector. These antibodies will then neutral ize most of the vaccine virus particles and cause their disposal before they can infect any cells, thereby limiting the intensity of ssue damage.In contrast, in the mRNA vaccines, there is no protein antigen for the antibodies to recognize. Thus, regardless of the existing degree of immunity, the vaccine mRNA is going to reach its target \u2014 the body cells. These will then express the spike protein and subsequently suffer the full onslaught of the immune system.With the mRNA vaccines, the risk of severe adverse events is virtually guaranteed to increase with every successive injection. In the long term, they are therefore even more dangerous than the vector vaccines. Their apparent preferment over the latter is concerning in the highest degree; these vaccines are not safe.Sorry for the absence of links to the sources referred to, but live links can be found in the original: https://off guardian.org/2021/05/05/covid vaccinesnecessity ecacyandsafety/Many of the companies pung out these vaccines have a record of serious safety violaons.Richard Gale and Dr. Gary Null have written the following article just on Johnson & Johnson's legal history.

Staff Opposed to Policy General Complaint; This is a good example of why I don't trust the CDC:\"Throughout the pandemic, CT values in excess of 35 have been the norm, with labs around the world going into the 40s.Essen ally labs were running as many cycles as necessary to achieve a positive result, despite experts warning that this was pointless (even Fauci himself said anything over 35 cycles is meaningless).But NOW, and only for fully vaccinated people, the CDC will only accept samples achieved from 28 cycles or fewer. That can only be a deliberate decision in order to decrease the number of 'breakthrough infecons' being ocially recorded.Secondly, asymptoma c or infecons will no longer be recorded as 'covid cases'.That's right. Even if a sample collected at the low CT value of 28 can be sequenced into the virus alleged to cause Covid19, the CDC will no longer be keeping records of breakthrough infections that don't result in hospitalisa on or death.\"hps://o guardian.org/2021/05/18/how thecdcismanipulating datato propupvaccineeecveness/But I'm sure there's a perfect good, benign, sciencebased reason for this policy discrepancy.

Interim data suggested high efficacy for both of these vaccines, which helped legitimize Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA. However, the exceptionally rapid movement of these vaccines throug h controlled trials and into mass deployment raises multiple safety concerns. In this review we first describe the technology underlying these vaccines in detail. We then review both components of and the intended biological response to these vaccines, including production of the spike protein itself, and their potential relationship to a wide ra nge of both acute and longterm induced pathologies, such as blood disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases. Among these potential induced pathologies, we discuss the relevance of prionprotein related amino acid sequences within the spike protein. We also present a brief review of studies supporting the potential for spi ke protein \"shedding\", transmission of the protein from a vaccinated to an unvaccinated person, resulting in symptoms induced in the latter. We finish by addressing a common point of debate, namely, whether or not these vaccines could modify the DNA of those receiving the vaccination. While there are no studies dem o nstrating definitively that this is happening, we provide a plausible scenario, supported by previously established pathways for transformation and transport of genetic material, whereby injected mRNA could ultimately be incorporated into germ cell DNA for transgenerational transmission. We conclude with our recommendations regarding surveillance that will help to clarify the longte rm effects of these experimental drugs and allow us to better assess the true risk/benefit ratio of these novel technologies.\"h ps://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/ar cle/view/ 23I'm sll working on it myself.

It is reported that Dr. Soumya Swaminathan deliberately ignored and suppressed the FLCCC and BIRD Panel's data regarding the effectiveness of the drug Ivermectin, with an intent to dissuade the people of India from using Ivermectin. Moreover, the nation of India has included ivermectin in their national protocol and, as TrialSite re cently reported, in states where the treatment is in wide use an unprecedented reduction of cases is now reported. Of course, it's difficult to prove a direct correlation without a designed study but the turnaround in cases in Uttar Pradesh, one of the states with a populat ionwide ivermectin regimen, is indeed striking.According to entries in the Indian media, the noce is based on the research and clinical trials carried out by 'Front Line COVID19 Critical Care Alliance' (FLCCC) and the British Ivermectin Recommendation Development (BIRD) Panel, who have presented enormous data that strengthen the case for the recommendation of Ivermectin in the prevention and treatment of COVID 19.However, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi have refused to accept her stand and have retained the recommendation for Ivermectin under 'May Do' category, for patients with mild symptoms and those in home isolation, as stated in 'The National Guidelines for COVID19 management' last updated on May 17, 2021.In order to stop Dr. Soumya Swaminathan from causing further damage to the life of citizens of this country, IBA has decided to initiate legal action against her and as part of the process, a legal notice has been served upon her.WHO Misinforma on Campaign?TrialSite has evidence that WHO is suppressing data as, recently reported, they issued a report on the significant local effort of the public health operation in Uttar Pradesh yet omitted a fundamental fact, that ivermectin is in fact in widespread use as part of the very initiative they repo rted on their website.

Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 242 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;New information on biodistribution of vaccines points in frightening direcon.\"Recent studies indicate the spike protein, itself, may potenally be harmful.Recent studies4 suggest that the spike protein produced in response to vaccination, may bind and interact with various cells throughout the body, via their ACE2 receptors, potentially resulting in damage to various tissues and organs. This risk, no matter how theoretical, must be investigated prior to the vaccinaon of children and adolescents.Health Canada authorized the COVID19 vaccines without biodistribution and pharmacokine c studies on the virus spike protein.Given the concerns about the spike protein, it is important that we fully understand: which cells are actually involved in the produc on of the spike protein, seeing that Pfizer's own study submitted to the Japanese authorities shows the deposition of vaccine nanoparcles in various ssues and organs5; whether the spike protein is gaining access to the circulatory system and, if so, for how long; whether the spike protein crosses the bloodbrain barrier; whether the spike protein interferes with semen producon or ovulaon, whether the spike protein crosses the placenta and impacts a developing baby, or whether the spike protein is excreted in the milk of lactang mothers.The same information is needed for the S1 subunit of the spike protein, which is the part that binds to ACE2 receptors; and which has also been detected in the plasma of individuals following mRNA1273 (Moderna) vaccinaon (Ogata et al., 2021).The toxicity studies conducted with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine do not allow for a safety assessment of the spike protein.Although Pzer BioNTech conducted toxicity studies, including a reproductive toxicity study, they used rats as their animal model. Although rats have ACE2 receptors, these receptors have a very low binding affinity for the spike protein. In fact, of 14 mammalian species evaluated6, ACE2 receptors of rats and mice ha d the lowest spike protein binding affinities, while ACE2 receptors in humans and rhesus monkeys had the highest. So, while the current toxicity studies have provided useful information on the vaccine components, they provide little value in understanding the safety of the spike protein they code for.\"les.catbox.moe/k2miut.pdfh ps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/33053430/h ps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sis1Sddzbq kNote that the lack of biodistribu on studies was called into question in this BMJ article: hps://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1244And to repeat a statement of the obvious from that article: \" [A]pproving a vaccine in order to legally support mandates or convince people of its safety arguably puts the cart before the horse.\"It's not too late to say: in light of new information, we cannot recommend these vaccines as safe (or particularly effective).

Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorl y defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP de livered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate.In summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses could stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for hum an vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this plaorm.\"hps://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04 .430128v1 Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;the COVID19 Vaccinations now available are all experimental with no longterm safety studies. As found in the OpenVaers.com data as of 5/21/21, there have been 4.201 reported deaths as result of these vaccines (and it's estimated that VAERS only represents 10% of the actual total number of deaths beca use most people are no aware of this reporting mechanism), 1273 cases of Bell's Palsy, > 1000 anaphylaxis reaction, 12, 625 hospitalization. and 29, 707 urgent care visits.Forcing students or employees to get any vaccine goes against the Nuremberg Code.You will be held liable for any and all reactions, deaths and permanent disabilities that result from forcing people to get vaccinated. IN 1976, the Swine Flu Vaccine caused 25 deaths and it was pulled o the market.As of 5/21/2021, 4,201 deaths have occurred as result of these vaccines and nothing has been done by the CDC or FDA. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 244 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI have read the draft policy and the FAQs. For those who believe it is there right, through the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of the US Constitution to determine what foreign bodies they will put into their body to have \"free exercise, thereof...\" what accommodation will be given to these in dividuals? This shot, that is not a vaccine, has not been fully tested and long term affects are not known. It has been proven to have fatal side effects for some, even those with no preexisting medical conditions, and the effectiveness is being challenged across the international medi cal commun ity. In light of the above, can individuals legally be held to this policy? I have grave concerns regarding implementation of this policy because of possible retribution of those who believe it is impinging on their rights and decline the shot. What recourse do individuals have based on the above? Ca n they sign a waiver? Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI do NOT agree with mandatory vaccinations. We live in America where we have the freedom to choose what is best for our household. Is the University going to be held financial responsible for individuals that experience side effects or death from the vaccine? I do realize these are very rare, but even 1 case again st the University could be financially disastrous. If students, staff, or faculty refuse to get vaccinated will they lose their job or be disenrolled from the University? Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyThank you for making feedback available to all UNM affiliates. I ask that UNM does not make the COVID19 shot mandatory. We are not all one size fits all when it comes to any vaccine. There are known risks, and known side eects. As we have seen in the past year, Operation Warp Speed has brought us several options of an experimental COVID19 shot that has had no long term studies or research. With this in mind, individuals should be able to make an informed decision about this hea lth procedure based upon the data that has been presented, their health history, concerns for future health issues, or even religious beliefs. I would hope that the decision makers in this process do realize that making vaccinations mandatory is discriminating. UNM is filled with a diverse population of students, faculty and staff that are different, and all of us should have a right to make our own medical cho ices. Thank you for your time and consideration in hearing my concerns. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI feel it is wrong to try and require a vaccine that does not have full FDA approval. APS opened back up and did not require everyone to be vaccinated. Geng the vaccine should be someone's personal choice and not be required to work or go to school Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 246 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyConcerns I have some concerns with making this mandatory for a number of different reasons. I understand the goal is to achieve heard immunity, however the vaccine does not protect community members from transmitting the virus and or contracting the virus. Similar to the Flu vaccine it only reduces symptoms. It prov ides a false sense of security. Mandang community members to put something inside their body is fundamentally wrong, global pandemic or not. Will the University accept responsibility for any future side effects related to the vaccines? Even with potential FDA approval, trials have been limited. Staff was not and have not been requi red to provide immunization records when hired or in the past. Will UNM also mandate the measles vaccine and or other such vaccines that have been the source of prior pandemics? Are they not equally as dangerous? Regarding inclusivity: Students, staff or faculty that decide not to get the vaccine for whatever reason will no longer be allowed to use publicly funded facilities? Contractors and vendors will be allowed on campus without the vaccine but student, staff and faculty will not? That's hardly inclusi ve. Visitors vaccination status is unknown but may or may not be allowed to use publicly funded facilities? Students pay to use these facilies but now will be barred? Members of the campus community will not be allowed to use facilities while unvaccinated, but the general public will be good to go? Is this designed to vaccine shame members of the community for their personal choices? Allowing members of the community to wear items on their uniform, badge or other items stating they have been vaccinated is problematic. Yes, it is their free speech, however if unvaccinated members are banned from using campus facilities and vaccinated members are allowed to display their status, it is a form of vacci ne sham ing. You are now encouraging a rhetoric of division amongst community members. I thought this was an instuon built on inclusivity.I nd this whole proposal very disturbing and an overreach on the part of the University. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 247 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceMy understanding is that you cannot require an individual to get a vaccine that is being distributed under an EUA, opposed to a full license this vaccine is not approved by the FDA. This would potentially delay Covid19 mandates until the FDA approves the first vaccine under a biolo gics license. While UNM can certainly encourage their staff, students and faculty to be vaccinated, the Federal Law prohibits that, at least until the vaccine is licensed, individuals must have the option to accept or decline to be vaccinated. Knowing what an organization can or cannot do with respec t to Covid19 vaccines can help them keep employees and also save the organization from costly and timeconsuming litigation.. Dr. Amanda Cohn, the executive secretary of the CDC's Advisory committee was asked if Covid19 vaccinations can be required she responded \" that under an EUA vaccines are not all owed to me mandatory. So, early in this vaccination phase, individuals will have to be consented and they won't be able to be mandatory\". She affirmed this applies to all organizations, including hospitals.NM state law prohibits employers retaliang against an employee for refusing to participate in a violation of federal law. Organizations that require Covid19 vaccination in violation federal law. Organizations are free to encourage vaccination thru internal communications to urge their employees to be vaccinated. They can take these measures as lon g as : (1) they are not viewed as coercive, (2) the organization makes clear the decision regarding whether to receive the vaccine is voluntary, and (3) the measures comply with the requirements in the EUAs and the related regulaons for the products.I am sending my response hoping this will help with the decision on making a EUA vaccine mandatory or requirement of employment. I am hoping this response will be held in the utmost confidence and I am not retaliated against in any way shape or form for expre s sing my opinion on the vaccine. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI'm against this plan. I prefer making my own medical decisions. I believe this is a violation of my body. I don't want anyone giving me a shot without my consent. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs a staff member, I absolutely disagree with mandatory vaccinations. I would 100% look for employment elsewhere. I do not think it's ethical to ask for mandatory vaccinations. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 248 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyHealth AccommodationFrom what I have been reading on the Covid19 vaccines is the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not a typical vaccine but are synthetic gene therapy. The technology is new and there is no long term safety data to back up claims that it is safe.Another thing that I have read from multiple sources is that there are proven treatments and cures for Covid which makes a vaccine not necessary.I have an autoimmune condion that will not allow me to get the vaccine (gene therapy). The mRNA in the vaccine (gene therapy) are coated with a PEGlipid coating. The autoimmune condition I have attacks lipids and causes blood clots. I suffered bilateral pulmonary embolism four years ago due to this condi tion. If I get the vaccine (gene therapy) I am afraid that it will cause massive clong and I will not make it.This whole situaon is so confusing. People get vaccinated to protect themselves from getting sick. In the past there was no mandatory vaccination. If someone was vaccinated they need not worry if someone else is not. Why is Covid different? Again, in the past, herd immuni ty was sought after as quickly as possible and people were not forced to lock down.To add to the confusion Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, the World Health Organization, and the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna have stated that the vaccine is not going to be enough. There will probably need to be a third dose, a booster, or even a new, more potent vaccine to help stop the sprea d of the virus. Masks and social distancing will not be going away any time soon. Joe Biden has even said that there will be another pandemic.Below are some of the websites I visited to learn more about the vaccines Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am appalled by this forced vaccination policy. What next? Mandatory chip by the antichrist? I don't think you have the right to do this and I see a very large class action lawsuit in the future against UNM. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 250 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyImpact to I write to express my opposition to UNM's proposed vaccination policy. I object for the following reasons:1.Even though the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for three COVID19 vaccines, they are not FDA approved to treat, cure or prevent any disease at this time. Clinical trials will continue for at least two years before the FDA can even consider approval of these vaccines as ef fective and safe. All people currently taking the vaccine are part of the phase 3 trials, which is explicitly stated in the vaccine information provided at the time of vaccination. As such neither the federal government, nor the state, nor a state agency can mandate that an employee must tak e the vaccine as a condition of employment. It is a violation of basic civil liberties and opens any agency that requires the vaccination up to potential lawsuits.2.As the largest public university in the state if UNM required vaccination it would violate the civil rights of students as well. The requirement for vaccination would become an obstacle for attendance for students who are already underserved, and would again open the University up to potential lawsuits about inequality of access to educaon.3.Normal vaccine trials take years to determine the longterm safety and side effects of the product. None of the vaccines developed in the last year have existed long enough to determine their longterm effects. The potential longterm effects to health are a significant concern to canc er sur vivors, such as myself, and violate our ability to make informed decisions about our own health care. The ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act, requires \"reasonable accommodations,\" be provided based on an individual's own unique health situation. This includes rejection of an experimental vaccine intervention which may exacerbate known health problems and thereby cause harm4.Young adults are a healthy and immunologically competent and vibrant group that is at, \"extraordinary low risk for COVID19 morbidity and mortality.\" In fact most healthy adults under the age of 65 are at low risk of complicaons from Covid19.5.College and University students, however, are under significant mental health strain already from COVID19 fears, circumstances, distance learning problems and the imposion of government health policy restricons.6.College age women may be at unique risk for adverse events following administration of the experimental COVID vaccinations currently available. According to the CDC, all cases of lifethreatening blood clots, subsequent to receiving the J&J vaccine, reported so far in the United States, occur red in younge r women. The vast majority of cases of anaphylaxis have also occurred in women. In addition, \"women are reporting having irregular menstrual cycles after getting the coronavirus vaccine,\" and 95 miscarriages have been reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID vaccination as of April 24, 2021.7.Students and their families may jusably believe these policies discriminate against individuals who aren't candidates for this vaccine, have preexisting conditions, previous COVID19 disease, cite religious objections, or are otherwise exercising their freewill choosing not to participate in this optional vaccine Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 251 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment experiment. Refer to the Nuremberg code from WWII, which requires individuals, \"to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervenon of any element of force ...\"8.Colleges and Universities should consider whether they might be liable for damages, poor health outcomes, and loss of life due to mandatory COVID19 vaccinaon policies.9.Informed consent is the standard for all medical interventions. The FDA factsheet for the healthcare provider reads, \"The recipient or their caregiver has the option to accept or refuse (PfizerBioNTech) vaccine.\" Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 252 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;The article goes on to mention support from another scientist (one of many who have made similar claims):Stephanie Sene, Ph.D., an expert in protein synthesis, believes that Dr. Lindsay's hypothesis is correct. \"I absolutely share these concerns,\" Dr. Seneff, who is a senior research scientist at MIT, wrote to me in a sobering email. \"The potenal for blood clong disorders and the potential for sterilization are only part of the story. There are other potential longterm effects of these vaccines as well, such as autoimmune disease and immune escape, whereby the vaccines administered to immunecompromised people accelerate the mutation rate of the virus so as to render both natural ly acquired and vaccineinduced anbodies no longer eecve.\"Like Dr. Lindsay, Dr. Seneff believes we need to immediately halt Covid vaccine campaigns. \"This massive clinical trial on the general population could have devastating and irreversible effects on a huge number of people,\" Sene explains.Former Pzer vice president Mike Yeadon has made similar claims. See, for example, this video, while it lasts on Youtube, before it's taken down to protect us:hps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6fPJQcsP9sSucharit Bhakdi, MD and the group he is associated with called Doctors for Covid Ethics have raised similar issues. In an open letter from this group, they have written the following about the dangers of the vaccine (my emphasis):1. Just as smoking could be and was predicted to cause lung cancer based on first principles, all gene based vaccines can be expected to cause blood clotting and bleeding disorders [33], based on their molecular mechanisms of action. Consistent with this, diseases of this kind have been observed acros s age groups, lea ding to temporary vaccine suspensions around the world: The vaccines are not safe.2. Contrary to claims that blood disorders postvaccination are \"rare\", many common vaccine side effects (headaches, nausea, vomiting and haematoma like \"rashes\" over the body) may indicate thrombosis and other severe abnormalities. Moreover, vaccine induced diffuse microthromboses in the lungs can mimic pneumon ia an d may be misdiagnosed as COVID19. Clotting events currently receiving media attention are likely just the \"tip of a huge iceberg\"[34]: The vaccines are not safe.3. Due to immunological priming, risks of clotting, bleeding and other adverse events can be expected to increase with each revaccination and each intervening coronavirus exposure. Over time, whether months or years[35], this renders both vaccination and coronaviruses dangerous to young and healthy age groups, for whom with out vaccination COVID19 poses no substantive risk. Since vaccine roll out, COVID19 incidence has risen in numerous areas with high vaccinaon rates[3638].Furthermore, mulple series of COVID 19 fatalities have occurred shortly after the onset vaccinations in senior homes[39,40]. These cases may have been due not only to antibodydependent enhancement but also to a general immunosuppressive effect of the vaccines, which is suggested by the increased occurrence of Herpe s zoster in certain paents[41].Immunosuppression may have caused a previously Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 253 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment asymptomatic infection to become clinically manifest. Regardless of the exact mechanism responsible for these reported deaths, we must expect that the vaccines will increase rather than decrease lethality of COVID19 \u2014 the vaccines are not safe. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I do not think it is necessary or ethical to require any kind of vaccine in order to return to work, just like we encourage the flu vaccine but do not require it. This is especially true since the covid vaccines are not yet fully FDA approved only approve d under an eme rgency status. I believe that we should fully reopen with no masks or vaccines being required. Since the university is planning to require the covid vaccines, would the university be held liable if there are any adverse reactions to the vaccine?Wouldn't it be a HIPAA violaon to require any sort of proof of vaccination? Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Is this being done so our lovely tyrannical governor can brag about how many New Mexicans she has gotten vaccinated? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 254 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I am extremely disappointed and dismayed about the recent events of late, in our state, in our community and now the University. I am uncomfortable with inquiries about vaccination status, it puts people in an awkward position, not knowing what the \"right answer\" is. It seems any answer le ads to having to defend either way, their personal decisions, It leads to fear. I feel that whether or not you choose to take the vaccine is a personal choice, a private choice, a choice that should be respected either way. It is the principal of invasion of privacy to inquire about vaccinaon status. Also I believe that it is an act of coercion to be sending out notices, advertising, and crafting policies that require or strongly suggest a person should get vaccinated, because if they choose not to then what does mean? Isn't that a form of discrimination? There seems to be an underlyin g impli cation. Even worse people feel pressured to do something that goes against what they feel is personally correct, conforming to policy out of fear. Isn't it our constitutional right to make a choice about our personal health and well being while being respectful of other people's decisions to do the same? Isn' t this putting people who don't take the vaccine into a realm of being discriminated against? In addion, a person shouldn't have to provide a reason as to why they are making a personal decision about their own health and what they choose or don't choose to put into their bodies. Coercion is persuading someone to do something by using force or threats. I consider the policies and inquiries to have an underlying threat, if you don't get the vaccine then... I understand that we need to keep each other safe and practice good hygiene and take precautions, shouldn't that exist COVID or not? A vaccine is not a cure nor does it prevent the spread. It protects the individual who takes it only. I believe it to be too soon to adapt certain policies. And under no circumstances should there be a mandate for vaccination. We have only just begun to understand COVID and the long term effects of vaccine or no vaccine. Our current environment is sensive. Policies for the University should strongly consider rights of individuals to make personal choice regarding their health. Adapt by providing alternative choices and allow individuals to feel safe and respected. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 255 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I have a lot to say, I'm going to be levelheaded and try to be as rational in my feedback. Please give it all a read, it'd mean so much to know my voice is heard. I sincerely thank you for your time. This isn't any kind of political talk or antivaccine talk even. Those who have a less than 95% chance of surviving Covid should be the ones with the vaccine. If the ones who are at risk are vaccinated, then there's no risk to anyone's health in the community. Sure, the virus can spread but it can still be spread even with the vaccine. Now to get personal, next school year will be my 6th year here at UNM. I've built a great education for myself, landed a great job where I get my masters paid for and all of these were things that I worked for and built myself. If you require this vaccine, you'll have des troyed everything I've done here. I'll be out of a job, out of a home, and have to search for a university that supports me.I want to give praise to UNM, you all have been this great place for me to start building the foundations of my life. The opportunities, the faculty, students are all another family to me. I'll always have a special place in my heart for the Lobos. Wh en I heard the news that you may be requiring this vaccine, it broke my heart. It just didn't seem like the \"Everyone's a Lobo\" kind of mentality, it feels more like if you're not us then you're not welcome. But now my emotions are getting the better of me. What happened to freedoms of choice? Or looking at the statistics? Everybody is different, everyone is unique and everyone should get to choose to get something injected into your arm. Some numbers from the CDC: ag es 2050 which is about the age of college students have a >99% chance of making it through Covid. The best vaccine is only 95% eecve. I'm just asking you to please look more closely at the numbers, don't listen to the politics that have absorbed this virus, and please please be thinking of your fellow Lobos. I'm sure theres so many more like me who are either afraid to speak out on this and feel the same way I do. Please try and advertise for both sides, everything I'm seeing is \"Go get the vaccine\" not \"Do research and make your own educated decision\" which is what I thought college was all about. I hope I get to connue my life here at UNM. Thanks for reading all of this. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;The Nazis forced Jews in Germany to wear yellow badges, which meant they were excluded from society. From this point on, it was forbidden for Jews to appear in public without a yellow badge. Anyone who tried to hide the star with a scarf, for example was harshly pen alized by the Gestapo, who monitored the visibility of the badge. When did we turn into Nazi, Germany? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 256 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;As a staff member this is concerning. Is it okay to force someone to take a vaccine? Staff are not forced to take a flu vaccine; therefore, this should be the case with the COVID19 vaccine. I am not opposed to the vaccine but it should be my choice as to when I recei ve it. The information on the effects of the vaccine is too new to consider putting something like this in my body. I would prefer to work from home as I have been this entire time or be required to wear PPE. I truly hope this does not become a requireme nt as I an d many of my colleagues risk losing their job which in entirely unfair. I've been a loyal employee for over 20 years and feel that my livelihood is being threatened. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Hello,I personally believe that vaccinaon should not be a requirement but a choice of each individual. I don't agree with forcing everyone to get vaccinated. Let each person decide what is best for them. Thank you. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;The way the COVID virus has been handled has been backwards. Lockdowns did not help with herd immunity and the fear factor was pushed relentlessly which has caused a lot of people psychological problems. People are so afraid of the virus that even a so called vaccine will not subdu e the fear . How is it that people who have received the so called vaccine are afraid of those who have chosen not to receive it? I have noticed the fear in many of the quesons that have been asked the University. The idea of requiring the so called vaccine for everyone returning to campus is totally unconstitutional and, in some ways, it is discriminatory. People need to do their own research and come to grips with the situation. Does it not raise a red flag that there is a relentless push fo r vaccination? What other virus or bacteria has received such aenon?Please read the following arcle:hps://undercurrents7239496 20.wordpress.com/2021/0 3/16/covid 19vaccinesaregenetherapy/ Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Human's will/right cannot and should not be forced. Thus, it is up to each individual's decision whether he/she wants to be vaccinated. The purpose of vaccinated is to be protected and will not be infected even when surrounding people who are not vaccinated. Otherwise, the vaccine is only politically out there just to be called \"vaccine\", and does not work the way it supposes to be. UNM's mission and primary goal is all about educaonal oriented, and thus should not be involved with political related. UNM should not and must stands up against political control. Please take my feedback seriously. Thank you! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 257 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Hello,In my opinion, the beer way to approach this would be to allow more time for other vaccine options that use different technology than MRNA and viral vector to be available before you implement this vaccine policy. It is most likely other COVID vaccines will soon be available that are more acceptable to thos e who are currently resistant to the COVID vaccine. In addition, waiting until Fall 2022 will give more time for those individuals to evaluate which vaccine is right for them.

Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceReligious AccommodationI am an employee at UNM and I feel that if they mandate this vaccine they will be violating my religious beliefs and rights. Their are others that feel the same, so will it be an easy process to get accommodations so that we don't have to be vaccinated. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;As an employee of UNM, I have to express my deep concern for the conversation to mandate the vaccine. First, I'd like to mention that as an advocate of youth, women, and all individuals seeking guidance; I do not believe taking the right for individuals to choose is acce ptable. I am not for OR against the vaccine, however when you propose to enforce something that should be a choice, that is something that should be frowned upon. I think it's important to protect the health and safety of all staff, patients, and faculty etc; however, I believe there are steps tha t could be put in place to ensure everyone is able to maintain their current status with the university: 1. For those not seeking to get the vaccine at this time, they could be subject to periodic covid testing that seems suitable. 2. A mask should be enforced when on campus at all mes. 3. All individuals should stay home when sick.4. If the job title enables employees to work off campus and only attend the office/campus for mandatory purposes\u2014it should be discussed with the direct supervisor of the department and allowed. I am passionate about my right to choose what I want or need in my body and I am in no rush to get the vaccine. I feel like if my right to choose what I want for my body is frowned upon, I woul d not wa nt to associate myself with an organization that sees differently. I hope that you really think about the option to mandate this vaccine and exhaust all other available resources to try and accommodate all individuals in this maer. I love my job and would hate to have to leave or dismiss myself for not \"falling in line\" with the force of putting something in my body that I choose not to. Be blessed. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 258 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think it's absurd that you can make a health decision for people. Tables turned, imagine if I tried to require you to do something that you don't believe is safe. Everyone should be allowed to make their own decisions when it comes to their personal bodies. It's only righ t. Some doctors espouse a false definition of \"herd immunity.\" Vaccines have never conferred herd immunity. Herd immunity only occurs after a population contracts a disease (and recovers). The effects of fevers and soreness to additives to rash, itching, fever, and joint pains (and these are the mild effec ts, not men tioning dire effects that have happened) from a vaccine isn't worth the risk of a virus that is 98% survivable. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI strongly encourage the University to reconsider making vaccinaon a requirement. Even though you allow for religious and medical exemptions this does not take into consideration those people who do not believe in vaccinations and/or do not do well (physically) after getting a vaccination but still don't qualify for medical exempons. Realizing the vaccine is currently considered safe, no long term studies have been completed to understand any potential long term effects, or effect to pregnant women or women who want to become pregnant. By making it a requirement and forcing everyone to take it, you remove their freedom of choice. By removing choice, you could potential open the university up to significant legal ramifications should any health risk be identified in the future (simply watch some late night TV and th e trial lawyer commercials to understand, medical \"soluons\" somemes create unintended consequences).If you believe the science, those who want to, and receive the vaccine, are protected from any serious COVID related health concerns. Those who choose not to take the vaccine understand their risks.Please allow us to make our own choices. Forcing a medical treatment on an entire community is immoral and potentially illegal. An alternative/compromise process must be addressed.Thank you for the considera on. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceReligious AccommodationI have major concerns about the University of New Mexico mandating employees and students to get a covid19 vaccine. I am a believer and follower of Jesus Christ. I feel the University will violate my beliefs by mandating such a policy. I \"DO NOT\" believe in vaccines because I am protec ted and saved by the sa crifice of Jesus Christ. I am also a student. I feel this policy will take away my opportunity to further my education. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI have very serious and steadfast concerns about UNM or any other entity REQUIRING me to put anything into my body and showing proof to said entity that I did. Whether or not I do, is of no business to UNM regardless of what \"safety\" concerns you cite.I urge you NOT to mandate this and instead, ask those of us within the UNM Community to please consider being vaccinated if we've not already been. We are all adults and capable of making adult decisions on what we ulmately decide to do.I appreciate your consideration of my views and do not plan on disclosing what I do to UNM regardless of what you do and do not \"mandate.\" Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 260 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EmploymentIt is appreciated that you have already included a few reasonable exemptions to being vaccinated. As a person that is still hesitant about the vaccine for a multitude of reasons I am not yet comfortable taking it and would rather use the Covid19 safe practices that have been used this whole ti me and would gladly adhere to said practices until I might take the vaccine. Forcing individuals to take something they do not want and threatening their employment is a violation of many basic rights. Public health safety is important. However, I feel that society will look back on these da ys and understand that many human rights were violated and trampled on due to unnecessary fear. They will look back and wonder how can corporations unjustly bully people into doing something they don't want to do? In the end can places of business really threaten employment and violate the constitutional righ ts of their employees? You must allow employees an alternative to the vaccine. I myself would be more than happy to wear a mask, have a temperature check and perform a daily COVID screening the rest of my employment. In the end isn't the vaccine supposed to protect the indivi dual that has received it? If an indiv idual is that worried about getting the virus they should get the vaccine. The virus will not be eradicated by 100% vaccination. It has already mutated and they are coming out with booster vaccines. It is just like the flu and they will need yearly vaccines. I wil l not get the flu shot and I am not getting the Covid19 vaccine Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choicethis vaccine should NOT be mandatory! it should be up to the person on whether or not they want to receive this. this infringes on the freedom to make personal decisions and forcing a vaccine on someone is unethical. the flu vaccine is not required, so the covid vacc ine shouldn't be either!! be smart UNM. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceGarnett, if you do move forward on this Covaids VaXXX requirement, make sure you find yourself a good lawyer! Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Hello,My name is and I would like to say that I don't believe that the Proposed mandatory vaccine policy is a good idea, New Mexico is steadily improving with its Covid numbers and many counties are either in the green or moving in that direction. This is no longer a state of emergen cy, and I believe that we can still practice Covid safe practice without the requirement of all students and faculty being mandated to receive the vaccine.Thank you very much Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am against the mandate of the vaccine. No other immunizations are required to enter campus and the COVID vaccine should follow suit. It is up to the individual whether they choose to disclose their immunization records. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 261 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth Just a comment: I do not believe we should be required to take the vaccination. I, unfortunately, know of several people who have had very bad side effects from the vaccination. Is UNM going to take responsibility for those issues? It seems like a huge liability for UNM. Also, my reaso n for not gett ing the vaccination could be a medical reason, which is considered confidential. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;This is long but you should listen thoroughly if you're making life decisions for other people: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= _NNTVJzqtY Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Hi,I don't think you can require vaccinaons for all UNM faculty/staff/students, and I would definitely question the legality of applying such a policy to longtime, vested employees. As your writeup points out, none of the vaccines even have FULL FDA approval yet. None of them. Typically, vaccines take several years of test ing to perfect, not several months. We have no longterm studies on these vaccines, since they have not existed yet \"long term.\"Albuquerque Public Schools and school districts around the State opened up last month, and they had no vaccine requirement, so why do it at UNM? I believe the University should recommend vaccines, but NOT require them. I am completely opposed to a vaccine requirement. You are asking for a huge, public legal battle/class action lawsuit if you require vaccines. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;this policy would be bad for the employees that can not get the vax do to health, medical problems or employees who don't believe in it. If this Policy is to be used a lot of employees would lose their job. Forcing people to take an experimental vax goes against the Nurem b erg Code. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI do not support a mandatory vaccination requirement. This is on account of what happened to my daughter who is now 25. When she was 18 months old she could talk in almost complete sentences. Coincident with her getting her MMR shot that stopped. She became unintelligible. We spend an enormous am ount of time, effort, & money over the next decade to get her to be able to talk again. Out of pocket costs after insurance were $56,000 annually. I spent enough time on the phone with my insurance company that I ended up with the direct number for their regional claims rep. Once I came to UNM, I was appalled to find out that UNM's health insurance refused to cover my child's speech therapy needs. Therefore I ended up as a so that I could maybe prevent others from going through the financial and bureaucratic mess that we had to. In short, a mandatory vaccinaon requirement may be a case to prompt my resignation. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 262 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety I have quesons and a comment. Quesons:1) I have concerns related to the untested nature of the \"vaccine\" and its possible affect on our DNA based on the RNA components of the vaccine. What evidence is there that the vaccine is safe as I have heard that the deaths from the various form s of vaccine number in the thousands?2) Is the University taking nancial responsibility for my health/life should the vaccine cause the loss of mobility or life?Comment: I am against the mandatory inoculaon of anyone or forced testing or blacklisting of anyone who declines the vaccination Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI don't think you should make this a requirement. I'm breastfeeding and my plan is to get the vaccine next year when I'm done breaseeding. I am sure there are others who would not feel comfortable with this requirement. Please take that into consideration. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI am both a staff and student at UNM main campus. I do not feel it is in the best interest of the UNM community to require a vaccine. In my personal life I am a believer of Jesus Christ, a christian and feel that by requiring me to get the vacci ne you are violating my religious freedoms and beliefs. Aside from that I am a nursing mother and have hopes of getting pregnant again soon. I do not feel that medically the university should require me to get the vaccine that I have no idea how it will affect my future un born children and my infant that I am currently nursing. The University has no understanding as to what each individuals circumstances are and this is mine. I will not get the Covid 19 vaccine even if it is required by the university. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI feel its my body, my choice. I am concerned with taking the vaccination as it has its side effects such as blood clots amongst others. I've heard reports of individuals dying after taking the shot, obtaining COVID after the shot and the vaccine only valid for up to 6 mont hs after taken. This is similar to the flu in regards to the multiple strands of the COVID virus. The flu shot isn't required and the shot is not guaranteed to prevent the flu (strands) and there is no guarantee that COVID vaccine prevents COVID. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Privacy;While I do not have any problem sharing my vaccination status, a key member of my team has flatly told me s/he WILL NOT provide this information in any form. S/he is already uncomfortable reporting symptom status every day. S/he has threatened to leave the university if reporting vacc ination status or vaccinations becomes mandatory.I honestly don't know her/his status. It is her/his business. But we should be aware that there will be more people like her/him. There MUST be accommodations made for people with strong beliefs against medical information reporting. We should NOT be forcing people to choose between their privacy and their jobs. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 263 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about PrivacyI feel making a policy like this is a violation of our HIPAA protective rights. Something like this cannot be administered and regulated in a fair and unbiased manner which will only lead to disparate impact and a prelude for prejudice and discrimination. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about PrivacyI am concerned about my personal medical information being stored, how it is stored, and who has access to this information. I would prefer that the University not store my personal medical information, and instead forms a system that keeps our community safe but also does not potentially violate my privacy. Th e policy is extremely brief as to how this information will be acquired, stored, and generally handled. I believe that for me to feel comfortable sharing this information, I would need to see very detailed information about how this private medical data will be handled by UNM. How will it be en crypted and held safe if it is required? Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Enforcement; Con cerns about Process;NO MASKS FOR THE UNVACCINATED EITHER!

Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Impact to Employment;I have had my vaccines, so will not be affected either way, but I think it is a terrible idea to require individuals to be vaccinated as a condition of employment.

Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Impact to Employment;As an OnCall Retiree, I have been working remotely, and that seems to be successful. I am also immunocompromised and do not want to take this vaccine. Also, I believe the vaccine rollout was accomplished in record time as compared to previous illness outbreaks, such as SARS, etc. I'm not anti vaccine, but I do not trust any of these vaccines that have been rolled out, and have adopted a waitandsee approach. When is the FDA Decision expected to be made?What \"consequences\" will be enforced if one refuses the vaccine, other than being banned from stepping foot on UNM Campuses, or their facilities? Can an employee be discharged for noncompliance? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 264 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;General Complaint;Do you have any concern about violating the Nuremberg Code?\"Permissible Medical ExperimentsThe great weight of the evidence before us to effect that certain types of medical experiments on human beings, when kept within reasonably well defined bounds, conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally. The protagonists of the practice of human experimentation justify their views on the basis that such experi ment s yield results for the good of society that are unprocurable by other methods or means of study. All agree, however, that certain basic principles must be observed in order to sasfy moral, ethical and legal concepts: The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, dur ess, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experi mental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his parcipaon in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.\" Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; I am opposed to any \"mandatory\" vaccines. I have been on campus through 2020, and working around other people with no problems.I believe spread of the virus was through poor personal hygiene and lack of sanitaon in high use areas.I believe if you work at the hospital with direct contact with people this would apply.since most sta have no direct contact with people on campus this is too much. I believe in personal responsibility and keeping myself healthy. I am not responsible for other peoples health.I have not seen any documents showing spread in an outside seng or through passing by another person.I think continued sanitation of common areas is a better solution than forcing us to have an unproven vaccine. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 265 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; Dear, President Stokes and all,I aended the Town Hall Meeng and have read the communications related to UNM potentially requiring the COVID19 vaccine as a term of employment. This has been weighing heavily on my thoughts and in my concerns. I have done significant research on the vaccines and many doctors have co me forward in speaking out against the vaccinations based on their knowledge, research, and based on the effects they have seen in their vaccinated patients. This information is not receiving mainstream media coverage. There have also been cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and through med i a streams (including some in the mainstream media) and these eects are concerning. We all need our jobs but we should not be made to choose between our livelihood and our lives. We should be allowed to make informed decisions regarding our health and our employment should not be made contingent on being vaccinated. If vaccinations do what we have been told they do an d are effective against the spread of COVID19 or the new variant, then why do we need to force everyone to take the vaccine? If it works and people have taken it, as it was communicated in the Town Hall that many of our emplo yees have, the n there should not be an issue with faculty, staff, and students being unvaccinated. If the vaccine is a health protective measure, similar to a seat belt if you will, and protects the wearer of the seat belt, how is the seat beltwearer affected by someone else not wear ing a seat belt? If someone is wearing a seat belt and they still are at risk of the same injuries or outcomes as not wearing a seat belt, then why are they wearing a seat belt?Who protects the vaccinated? By default, no one as Congress passed a law in 1986 that protects vaccine manufacturers from being sued in civil personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits from vaccine injuries. So should anything happen to us, we shall have to live (or die) wi th the consequences. How can a vaccine be truly effective or how can we have any idea of the consequences, both short and long term, when the illness and those that have taken the vaccines have not been around long enough to have had this information collected and understood? Is there ever an ything good that comes from something that is so heavily pushed by so many avenues? Has history showed that anything good comes from that? Looking at our own lives, what examples come to mind of things that were heavily encouraged or forced from many avenues that ende d well? Ev en if we did not run a risk in putting something experimental into our bodies, we should have the right to make informed health decisions. Vaccines are not a \"one size ts all\" soluon. They never have been. We are not guinea pigs and the Nuremberg Code was an effort to maintain human rights in our history of human experimentation. There is a lot of fear related to COVID19 and fear often leads to the remo val of ou r rights but if we take pause, this IS human experimentation. UNM should not have a part in that part of history and in that part of the present. Thank you for your consideration. Please do not make these vaccinations required for employment and study. Very truly,A Concerned UNM Employee Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 266 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 267 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;This is going to be lengthy, or at least I hope so, as I have quite a bit to say. So let me offer some key points upfront. I could not be any more opposed to UNM requiring students and employees to take the rushed, experimental Covid19 \"vaccines.\" Even if these \"vaccines\" had gone through the normal testing and approval process I would want to wait and see what sort of effects emerge longterm. Plenty of fully approved drugs have led to health disasters further down the line. But these \"vaccines,\" using a technology which is new to actual application, even if it ha s been in research for many years, have not gone through a normal approval process. They were given emergency use authorization. And what is the emergency? The emergency is a socalled pandemic which has an over 99% survival rate in the general population, and for whic h effectiv e treatments alrea dy exist in the form of the well established drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, with budesonide as a possible addition, apparently most effective in combination with vitamins and supplements like vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and quercetin. There has been a concerted effort to suppress the use or even discussion of thes e treatments in the United States, despite their widespread success in treating Covid 19 here and around the world. So why are we having a rushed vaccine, offered under emergency use authorization, forced upon us? It certainly appears that available Covid19 treatments were suppressed for the sake of push ing this \"vaccine.\" Why? And why should I trust the same authorities that strongly discouraged even the discussion of existing treatments? Why should I trust any establishment health authorities (and particularly anyone with ties to the pharmaceutical industry), when the entire course of the \"pandemic\" has been marked by official lies and dece p tion, and massive censorship on social media? Why should I trust establishment health authorities when the WHO quietly redefines \"herd immunity\" to exclude natural immunity and only refer to vaccine enhanced immunity?What about the pandemic itself? I do not want to dismiss the deaths and suffering which have occurred due to Covid19, but I entirely oppose the idea that the pandemic has occurred on a scale that justifies the extreme actions which have been taken in response. The Covid19 survi val rate is over 99%, and even higher for younger age brackets than it is for the entire population. The more familiar flu is a greater threat to the young than Covid19. It's also crucial to note that the official number of Covid19 cases and deaths have been inflated. PCR tes ting has intentionally been done at cycles that will produce false positives. Meanwhile, Covid19 death numbers have additionally been inflated by counting many deaths as death from Covid19 when they were clearly, at best, deaths with Covid19. (And due to the unreliable PCR tests, some of those deaths might not even be gen uine deaths with Covid19.) Even the official number of deaths gives us a figure lower than past epidemics which we survived without the extreme measures that were put in place for Covid19, and without attempts to force experimental \"vaccines\" on our populaon.I need to add something else upfront. I resent having to hurriedly try to pull together over a year's worth of what I've Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 268 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment learned following the Covid19 story, in my attempt to argue against the \"vaccine\" mandate. I bitterly resent UNM hanging this threat over my head. This is not a battle any of us should have to be fighting. Imposing a \"vaccine\" requirement would undermine UNM's avowed mystical, dialectical pluralism (or however you want to de scribe the \"Each of us defines all of us\" slogan): \"We're a community of unique perspectives embracing divergence - unafraid to let our colors run and blend - letting the very things that divide us become the things that connect us to each other.\" Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;You totalitarian administrators who think you have the right to even consider forcing an experimental \"vaccine\" on your student body and your employees need to watch this:hps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxqC9SiRh8You have no business dictating to us what risks we should take regarding our health. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 269 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Privacy;I do not agree with mandated vaccinations for the following reasons.1. Violaon of condenality and autonomous choice. Requiring staff to openly discuss vaccination choices interferes with HIPAA regulations. Medical choices require informed decision making, removing the decisive nature of obtaining a vaccine is unethical and unlawful. Requiring staff to obtain a vaccine forces them into coercion rather than consent, and may force some employees from being able to remain gainfully employed if they are not able to comply for personal or medical choices. 2. Lack of medical evidence. mRNA vaccinations are new technology without sufficient time to prove efficacy, complications, or known long term effects. All COVID19 vaccines are only authorized under Emergency Use Authorization due to lack of evidence, safety and trials. The riskbenefit ratio is not full y determined and may force people into risk greater than benefit situation. Most COVID19 vaccines are in stage I or stage II trials. All COVID19 vaccinations stage III trials will take at least 14 years to be complete and the same amount of time for stag e IV trials. Typically medical safety cannot be fully determined until after 1015 years of robust evaluation and data collection. All COVID19 vaccinations have been available to the public for less than 1 year, without adequate trials and testing to prove full efficacy, side effects and long term co nsequences. Mandating people to be vaccinated with a substance that may have long term, detrimental consequences, which may include functional impairment, poor quality of life, increased mortality and morbidity; is gravely unethical. 3. Poor evidence of efficacy. A growing number of people who have been vaccinated have still contracted and exhibited symptoms of COVID 19. It is unknown how effective the vaccine will be against additional strains, how long it is effective, nor what boosters may be required . Many people taking immunosuppressive medications may be not be fully inoculated for a sufficient protection, even as simple as a person taking ibuprofen or tylenol for postvaccination symptom management. This is discussed in vaccine information and CDC website. Protection is adequate and scientifically high with social distancing, hand hygiene and mask wearing; which carries much less unknown or long term risk potenal. 4. Low mortality rate. Although COVID19 has high transmissibility, the American mortality rate is 1.8% per Johns Hopkins data. This showing a 98.2% survival rate if contracting the virus. The World Health Organization indicates that up to 80% of COVID19 positive person s are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms; not requiring hospitaliza on. I chose to wear a mask, socially distance and comply to good hand hygiene to protect myself, my family, my colleagues and my community. I chose confidential, evidence based medical decision making, and allowing the science and technology time to provide adequate data to support my decisions based on risks and benef i ts. I value my partner who is a medical provider working in the hospital and caring for COVID19 positive patients, who shares these concerns and choses not be vaccinated either. I hope that considering potential legal and ethical consequences, supporting autonomy and evidence, and protecting Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 270 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment staff rights and health will encourage reconsidering a vaccination mandate. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Privacy;Concerns If the university decides to make the vaccine a requirement and give punishments to those that choose not to be vaccinated the university is setting itself up for major lawsuits. First it is against the law on many levels to require Anyone to take a substance that is not FDA approved. All va ccines are in the trial period and therefore cannot be mandatory. Second, under HIPAA you cannot force an individual to disclose their medical status. Maybe they can disclose it to UNM health for their occupation but forcing individuals to wear a marker or wear a mask inevitably is disclosing protec ted st atuses to everyone around them and is illegal. The university will then be responsible for the discrimination and hostile work environment that it has created. Thirdly, if the university is an advocate for individuals making decisions about their body for the benefit of their own health why is this situation any diff erent? Why are individuals without measles vaccine labeled and forced to wear protective clothing? Or individuals with STDs forced to wear masks and wear markers expressing their status to the world? It is because their statuses are protected under many laws and the university would be sued. This is the same situat ion an d the outcome would be the same. Lastly, forcing individuals to produce documentation before they enter buildings or stores is a clear violation of HIPAA and many other protected statuses. Dr.Fauci has stated that the only people that unvaccinated people pose a risk to is themselves. The vaccine will protect th e user. If the vaccine is as effective as you are claiming the individuals that have taken it are protected from everyone else. Everyone should have a choice. My body my choice. It works with everything else in the liberal agenda. Why not here? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 271 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Privacy;Health Dear Dr. Stokes, I am wring to express my concerns as an individual with disabilities who also works in the field. My concerns are twofold. One has to do with the practical issues surrounding health and education, and the other has to do with the issue of the right to privacy that our republ ican form of government is obligated by our Constitution to provide. I will begin with this second concern, and then address the issue of praccality. As an individual with disability, I have experienced the loss of privacy and the contradictions of a medicalized existence that claims to protect my privacy while simultaneously violating it. These violations are undertaken to marginalize and discipline individuals with disability and organize them into an othe re d group identity, where we are subjected to the gaze and the full power of governmentalities invented to manage us, and to make our unruly bodies fit into the societal norm. These practices violate our fundamental right to the security of our property, persons, and papers from the institutional ga ze. Truly, the threat from those institutions is far more consequential than the threat of a random individual happening upon some private piece of our information. It is the institutional gaze that has the power to fundamentally destroy our privacy and threaten our rights. You are threatening exclusion from the public i nstitutions that we finance should we choose not to disclose to the university whether we have taken a vaccination or contracted an illness or not. You also threaten sanctions in the form of visible marks of our right to refuse with physical tokens such as masks and isolation from the socalled healthy population. This also indicates your lack of faith in the efficacy of the vaccinations your office is promoting. There is a real contradiction here, as well as one between the commitment to HIPPA and FERPA and the demand for private information so that students and citizens can be present on a campus that we own. On a praccal level, I believe that you will see a reaction to this on the part of students and their parents determining to take their business elsewhere. It is a fact that Universities like UNM have very large overhead. Beautiful and expensive buildings, housi ng, grounds, gymnasiums these are costly. The university also has highly paid faculty and administration housed in the workspaces of the university. These things exact a high price. It is paid not only by the taxpaying citizens, but also by the students and their parents. They pay twice to experience a type of educati on that we believe the y cannot get from online universities. They may not agree. I suspect that many students, natural rebels that they are, may balk at paying the high tuition it takes to provide such an education if they are also confronted with forced vaccinations and disclosure of vacc ination status to obtain it. They may choose many of the less expensive online universities that streamline higher education to provide minimal liberal arts and a straight path to employment at a lower cost so that they can avoid the threat to their dignity and privacy the university proposes to impose on healthy people. I hope that you will consider that perfect safety in unobtainable in the real world, and that there are other values that the university can promote to help form independent, healthy, and happy citizens.

A recent peer reviews study concluded the following:A crical appraisal of phase III clinical trial data for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2 and Moderna vaccine mRNA 1273 shows that absolute risk reduction measures are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Yet, the manufacturers failed to report absolute risk reduction measures in publicly released documents. As well, the U.S FDA Adv isory Committee (VRBPAC) did not follow FDA published guidelines for communicating risks and benefits to the public, and the committee failed Medicina 2021, 57, 199 7 of 8 to report absolute risk reduction measures in authorizing the BNT162b2 and mRNA1273 vaccines for emergency use. Such examples of outcome repor ting bias mislead and distort the public's interpretation of COVID19 mRNA vaccine efficacy and violate the ethical and legal obligations of informed consent.Ronald B.

I refuse to take this dubious \"vaccine,\" but now I am threatened with the potential loss of my job if I don't. I have worked for UNM for almost twelve years. I am 55. My pension is all that I have in place for retirement, aside from social secur i ty. I might well have to cash out that retirement to survive losing my current position. I have been dealing with lifechanging chronic health issues for eighteen years. I relocated to New Mexico solely to get away from the mold which was causing me severe symptoms in Philadelphia. (There wer e other relocation options, however, and I did prefer New Mexico to the alternatives, at the time, for various reasons.) After twelve years of working at UNM, I am still making a few thousand less than I was making working a similar, although not quite equivalent, job in Philadelphia in 2008 . I have not been building wealth in New Mexico! My health issues have created extra expenses as I have experimented with alternative treatments, and herbs and supplements, out of pocket, since my MDs have been unable to solve my health problems.I cannot afford to make less money than I am already making. I have debt, not savings. The fatigue\u2014an immense shrinkage in the number of hours in the day when I have what had been my normal energy level, before the downturn in my health\u2014would make it that mu ch harder to deal with suddenly having to start a new job. Ideally, at this point, I would like to relocate out of New Mexico, to a state with leadership that has more respect for basic rights and freedoms. But moving out and finding a new job would be doubl y challenging, especially in such a hurry. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 274 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I have worked in person at SHAC since the start of the pandemic, even when the majority of UNM staff worked from home. I feel very strongly that what I put in my body is my choice. I am not afraid of COVID19, but I am very afraid of the unknowns and the long term side effects of a vaccine that was quickly put in place and not properly tested. Also, I can't imagine that UNM has adequate resources and technology in place to implement this. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;My experience with chronic health issues leaves me all the more averse to taking risks with an untrustworthy \"vaccine.\" I do not want to take on further health problems. UNM has created an unnecessary emergency situation for me, which is now making me lose sleep as my mind races in the middle of the night, trying to figure out how to deal with it. I had already felt trapped in my situation, with few options. Due to th e current threat of a \"vaccine\" requirement, I feel even more trapped. The fact that I work for UNM does not mean I am UNM's slave. UNM does not own my body.In the bigger picture, if UNM supports required Covid19 vaccination of its students and staff, it is helping to pave the way for the even more totalitarian regime of digital vaccine passports. The \"pandemic\" was used to promote any number of totalitarian agendas, and to transfer wealth to the already superwealthy, crushin g small business while boosting the power of megacorporations such as Amazon. I do not think the powers that be will stop until they receive a lot more pushback than they are currently getting. I say \"No!\" to the experimental Covid19 \"vaccines.\"[Was not expecng such limited space for comment, obviously!] Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 275 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; I don't see a point to this: UNM covid reporng shows 28,882 people were surveyed, 573 positive cases. We're over a year into the pandemic now. How many deaths have we had? Let me guess: zero, or really close to it. Consider more draconian measures when we reach, oh, maybe y. Big picturewise. The news advertises some 500 600 thousand deaths from this. The fact is the vast majority of those deaths were people dying of old age anyhow. People 85+ account for somewhere around 80 90% of the deaths. Most the rest are 75 84 years old who were also on deaths door. By and large, hardly any young health people died of covid whatsoever. There is no significant increase in total number of deaths over a full year of the disease being released into the public. This is hardly a menace. (info based on USA) People can get the vaccine if they want. Should one person be forced to get the vaccine to make another person feel safe? If the person who wants to feel safe received the vaccine, why don't they feel safe? If it works, they should be fine. If it doesn't work, why make someone take it?Mandatory is a strong word. There should be some respect given to people who don't want some foreign substance in their system. UNM is a research University. Why be so hasty to do this? Maybe start by having some scientists reverse engineer these vaccines and see what they're made of. Many folks don't trust these substances. To the best of my knowledge, these vaccines are relatively new. Think back over the last several decades. People were told DDT was safe. People were told asbestos was safe. The list goes on. Are we making the same mistakes again? You plan on forcing this on people? TLDR: these are draconian measures for what's been proven to be a minor threat compared to the advertisements. Sure, some people are scared but nobody's telling them not to get the vaccine. Don't make people do this. At a liberal university I've heard the mantra \"my body , my choice\" th ousands of times. Practice what you preach. Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;It is ethically, morally, and physically concerning to require vaccinations for students, faculty, and staff. The vaccine is still currently an experimental therapy approved under emergency use status and there has not been enough time or studies to see how it will affect us and to know what effects it will have. The lon gterm effects of this vaccine are not known or understood, and it is those that take the vaccine that will have to live with its outcomes. It is also concerning to be taking away individuals' health sovereignty and right to make informed medical health decisions by requi ring it for emp loyment and by requiring it for study/career/professional development. People should have the right to make informed medical health decisions and it is not ethically, morally, or physically right to require this. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 276 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I agree in keeping all UNM Staff, Students and Faculty at the University of New Mexico safe and healthy with certain measures and protection, however, making the vaccine mandatory/required in order to attend or work for UNM does not sit well with me. This new proposed policy will turn away many students, sta ff and faulty as it challenges their choice to decide what is best for their bodies. I personally am overwhelmed/stressed and pressured to choose between my career or my ethical beliefs/decisions based on what I feel is best for me and my family. This new policy violets FERPA and emplo yee rights etc. And will most likely lead to many law suites. How many people will lose jobs, schooling etc. if this new policy is put in place. I hope this policy is not made mandatory but rather highly encouraged. I would hope that UNM Students Staff and Faculty have the right to choose what is best for them. With of course ample education on how to keep themselves and others safe. I take what is happening arou nd the world and here in NM my home very serious and understand the need to protect everyone! but how can we do this without having to choose between ethical beliefs and free choice. I do not want to feel forced or misunderstood for choosing what is best for me. Thank you, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 277 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I have already sent a very long response about my objection to UNM's proposal for requiring the COVID vaccine. But I responded as a student, now I'm responding as sta. I think it would be wise for UNM to fully consider the ramifications of what they are doing and read this short article: https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/resources federal lawprohibitsmandates emergency usecovidvaccinestests masks/ However, in case you don't click on it here is the most important part: The boom line is this: mandang products authorized for Emergency Use Authorization status (EUA) violates federal law as detailed in the following legal nocaons.All COVID vaccines, COVID PCR and antigen tests, and masks are merely EUAauthorized, not approved or licensed, by the federal government. Longterm safety and efficacy have not been proven.EUA products are by denion experimental, which requires people be given the right to refuse them. Under the Nuremberg Code, the foundation of ethical medicine, no one may be coerced to participate in a medical experiment. Consent of the individual is \"absolutely essenal.\"Does UNM really want to potentially be in violation of the Nuremberg Code? The code we have because the Nazi's experimented on the Jews? You know, that lead to the single greatest genocide in world history? The administration should seriously consider what they are doing. We are already seeing that thes e vaccines are having very serious adverse eects, do you want to be party to that? Make it a choice. Encourage, don't mandate. Make masks a choice. And let our community get back to normal. We are all adults. You don't need to lord it over us. We are fully capable of making our own decisions and keeping oursel ves and our community safe. And this has nothing to do with politics. I know an African American man who is a full Biden supporter but he is refusing the vaccine because he knows what happened with the Tuskegee experiment. Are you willing to discriminate against someone else who feels the same way ? Because how can you be a basin of minority rights and representation when you are potentially telling an African American student that they will be barred from any university activity or building because they made a personal decision about their health? Don't open that door. UNM is a decent university, do n't lose that standing and allow the community the freedom to make their own decisions about their health. And also maybe don't potentially break a code that was established because an authoritarian government took it upon themselves to exterminate 6 million people. Because they were different. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 278 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;The provost says: \"It's pretty simple. Get vaccinated. We have planned a largely inperson fall semester, and it's only possible with vaccinaon.\"Nonsense. Asymptoma c transmission is essentially nonexistent, and presymptomatic transmission is minimal. Many people already have naturally acquired immunity. Even many of those who have not had Covid19 will have cross immunity thanks to previous exposure to coronaviruses.Regardless, there is no juscaon for turning everything upside down for the sake of a virus with such a high survival rate, particularly when there are effective treatments that can increase the chances of surviving and even quickly getting through symptoms.Watch as universies in \"Neanderthal\" states fully resume inperson education, without any disasters following as a result.Meanwhile, \"adverse events\" are being reported to VAERS on a scale beyond what has been received for previous vaccines, probably because this isn't a vaccine in the normal sense, but an experimental gene therapy drug which was rushed into use without adequate testing. Why should young people with such a low risk fr om Covid19 be required to take an experimental \"vaccine?\" How can you jusfy this?The health establishment has done nothing but lie and mislead for over a year. Why should we trust it? Staff Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I absolutely do not agree with the enforcement of the Covid 19 vaccination proposed policy. I am a new mother and am breastfeeding my child and do not feel safe receiving the vaccination until I am done Breast feeing ( I breastfed my 1st child for 3 years). I really do not feel saf e with the vaccine until more research or observations has occured.. What If I was one for the women who developed clots and could no longer take care of my children?I have my own personal/religious beliefs that will interfere with this proposed enforced rule.I have predominantly worked from home before the pandemic and will occasionally need access to campus during off hour times to scan or file needed documents. I am willing to undergo any extra measures needed to be considered exempt... I have taken every measure to be safe and I am super lucky that my current supervisor has been accommoda ng to me as a mother.I am fearful that i will loose my Job not from my Supervisors stand point but from UNM Policy if I do not adhere to the vaccination policy. I believe that I have the right to choose what goes in my body. UNM is a public institution and i am wondering how they will be sure that Non Students, Non Faculty, and Non Staff will adhere to this as well since there is large foot trac on campus. Thank you for allowing my time and I hope that my comments/feedback does not place my job in jeopardy. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 279 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Question Concerns about Enforcement;Con cerns about Safety;Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback. I find this a challenging policy both as an administrator and an individual. As an administrator, the idea of policing this policy is daunting and the consequences on morale and employment challenging. I also am concerned about the culture and environment this will create in the instuon. I understand and appreciate the need to nd a safe path for returning to some sort of normal for students, staff, and the University as a whole. However, I think that there are valid concerns. Environment and culture. I am concerned about the culture this will create one of social pressure, stigma, and forced selfdisclosure. People with legitimate concerns and even qualified exemptions will feel stigmatized and under constant pressure to explain, selfdisclose and justify why they are not vaccinated. People will feel pressure to self disclose personal information that they may not otherwise choose to share. I think this has the potenal to create a negave culture. As an individual, I have concerns. I believe in the value and importance of vaccines. My husband is vaccinated for Covid. I have always taken additional vaccines prior to traveling out of country. However, I personally feel uncomfortable at this time with the Covid va ccine. I read the published research and am informed. No vaccines are without risk but are valuable for the common good. However, when you are part of the small percentage in the statistics that experience the side effects, it is different. My daughter had a severe adverse reaction to the Gardisil HPV vaccine when she was in middle school. Years later as an adult, she stil l suffers from lifelong neurological issues as a result. She now also has an autoimmune disease. I also have been diagnosed this year with an autoimmune disorder. There is some limited literature that suggests that people with my disorder are doing ok with the vaccine, but there are not specific studies targeting this population. Much is antidotal at this time. I am hesitant becau se of this risk. I believe that there are those with legimate concerns that make them hesitant to take the vaccine at this time. They may not \"qualify\" for exemption but still have legitimate concerns. How will decide if the concerns that some raises qualify for exemption? What will be the basis for this decision? To force peo ple with legitimate concerns to take the vaccine as a condition of employment or being able to return to work, is concerning. I am not sure that this is the culture and environment that we want to create as an institution. We can lead the way with safety and even vaccine numbers without creating this punitive and pressured environment. Thank you for the opportunity to share feedback. Staff Question Will applicants for posted positions need to provide proof of vaccination with their application materials? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 280 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Question Concerns about EnforcementI have lifelong SEVERE reactions to different types of medications so I am afraid to get the vaccine. Will this hinder my employment? Staff Question Concerns about ProcessHow does the leave policy compare to President Binden's time off to get vaccine and not feeling well the day after the 2nd vaccine. https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing Staff Question Impact to EmploymentWhat will happen if an employee chooses not to get vaccinated once this policy is in effect? Will their employment be terminated? Staff Question Concerns about EnforcementUnder faqs, it state that staff \"may face consequences.\" What are those consequences? Also, clinical trials for the vaccines will not be completed until 2023. Will this policy take effect after clinical trials have been completed? Staff Question Concerns about EnforcementThough I am currently vaccinated, I registered and received the vaccine on my own accord. As in medical care and treatment, I believe vaccinations are a personal choice not just limited to religion or culture. The expediency of the vaccine also draws concern for many as there are no true longterm studies wh ich potentially opens the university to liability. It is reported by the CDC and NMDOH that the vaccine does not prevent the spread of covid, it only reduces the chance of being infected or reinfected. So, an unvaccinated person is doing no harm to a vaccina ted person , only possibly to him/herself by making a personal choice. There is current discussion for a booster for those already vaccinated and even a biannual shot which would further make tracking and enforcement of this policy impossible. Additionally, the policy cannot be unilaterally enforced considering UNM is an open campus where there ar e many events and activities open to the public, and there are many vendors and contractors constantly on UNM properties. Would visitors and prospective students be required to be vaccinated prior to coming on campus? Would vendors and contractors be required to be vaccinated prior to bidding a job? Would those who atte nd a sporting event, play, or concert be required to be vaccinated before buying a ticket for the event? And what of the UNM golf courses that are open to the public? Adherence to existing covidsafe policies and the proper use of PPE and taking universal precautions to avoid inf ection seems to work just fine as the state is nearly reopened with few exceptions and some restrictions in place. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 281 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Question Concerns about Enforcement;Con cerns about Privacy;The Vaccination Status Reporting form does not indicate your previous response nor does it check for any logic, for example, if I already submitted an answer that I got my first shot, that should not be an option, etc... The design seems amateurish at best. I suggest at least to have a list of pr evious responses available.The informaon on covid vaccinaon is private so I'd expect it to be in the same area as my W2, health insurance info, etc. not on a separate system. Can it be part of the Employee Dashboard?Finally, does the University plan to coordinate any enforcement of vaccination with NM DOH? As of now, this relies on an honor system (I say I'm vaccinated but did not provide a copy of my card to UNM). I certainly hope that at least 90% of people working in my building and vicinity will be truly vaccinated! Staff Question Concerns about Enforcement; Hea lth Accommoda on;Can you please define what are considered additional safety measures and asymptomatic surveillance and symptomatic tesng? If reasonable accommoda on is requested and approved, will staff be required to wear a mask even if the mask mandate from the Governor is released? Staff Question Concerns about ProcessMy department area provides customer support to students, employees and retirees. Often, my team addresses planned and unplanned visits from such individuals to obtain information from one of our team members. It is not uncommon request for them to request that we accommodate including their spouse/partner/friend, and sometimes children in these meetings . Wi ll there be a vaccination visitors' policy (family, friend or otherwise) for coming on campus? If we prohibit employees from coming on campus, how will visitors be addressed? Will the UNM retiree population need be required to follow these vaccination rules to come on campus? Staff Question Concerns about ProcessQuestion: Will this be added to the UNM Administrative Policies and Procedures Manual? Staff Question Concerns about Safety;If the policy is approved and goes into effect, workers compensation/UNM will provide support to the employees who experience an adverse reaction to the vaccine (especially of long term consequence), correct?Thank you for your considera on. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 283 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Question Concerns about Choice;It is wrong to force a person to either inject something into their body or lose their job (if no medical/religious/etc. condition is met but simply free will). A big mantra these days is \"my body, my choice.\" Where did that belief go?What about people who have already had the virus and now have antibodies? Would they be required to vaccinate?If masks work, why enforce vaccinaons that are not even FDA approved?If vaccinaons work, then why continue the use of masks and social distancing (as written in the dra policy)?There are many freedoms that must be handed over in order to keep food on the table with such a policy. Will those not vaccinated one day be forced to wear a scarlet letter on their apparel to signify their deance?What is wrong with personal choice? I believe those who vaccinate and those who don't are making their own personal decision. Shaming people into geng vaccinated is barbaric.Yes, I'm vaccinated. I also believe in free will.Thank you for your me. Staff Question Health AccommodationWill vaccination exceptions/accommodations be made for pregnant women? Will vaccination exceptions/accommodations be made for nursing/breastfeeding mothers? The CDC currently states that vaccinations are a \"personal choice\" for pregnant women. It also states that although the vaccinations are thought to be safe in lactating women, there are currently no studies in this popula tion. In addition, due to the newness of the vaccinations, no longterm studies exist in these populations. I personally would be uncomfortable getting the vaccine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding due to the unknown potential longterm effects. I want to keep myself, my family and my coworkers safe, of course. I'd be open to getting the vaccine at the conclusion of nursing/breastfeeding. Where is the line going to be drawn? Some mothers breastfeed for years. Is there going to be a time limit of 1 year since the American Pediatric Association recommends breastfeeding for at least the first year? If the work can be reasonably done remotely, will this be allowed? Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns and answer my questions. Staff Question General Complaint;Is UNM able to provide a discount or credit on UNM health insurance policies for those who have been vaccinated? Is this being considered? Staff Question General Complaint;I cannot make an informed decision about working remotely or going back to the office until UNM has decided on the vaccine requirement. Your decision effects my decision. As I'm sure it does for others. An update on when you will be deciding would be helpful. Thanks. Staff Question Concerns about Process;How will the proposed policy affect the operations of programs that are offered by UNM Departments to minors (UNM Music Prep School, UNM String Lab School, Continuing Education, etc)? How will these programs be expected to obtain and store this information? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 284 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Question General Complaint Hello there, We head up the UNM Event Coordinators Committee which is made up of folks from across Academic and Student Affairs, Enrollment Management, Popejoy, UNM Bookstores, and Athletics who plan events for their departments/divisions. We would be interested in bringing someone from the Vaccine Policy committee to our next meeting on Wednesday, May 19th at 11a m to gather feedback and hear quesons/comments from the group. The members of this committee plan most of the events on campus and would be a helpful resource for the Vaccine Policy committee. I believe we can provide important logiscal quesons to consider. Thanks! UNM Stude nt Acvies Center Staff Question General Complaint;A number of the herbs and supplements I regularly use, like NAC, which the FDA suddenly wants to pull from the market after an exceptional sixty year safety record*, are probably helpful in boosting my immunity to SARSCoV2. These supplements get expensive, and are not covered by my prescription plan. In app reciation of my efforts to take care of my own health, while working on the frontlines, on campus since late January, I would appreciate if UNM would refund those purchases.*Can't have anything that will compete with pharmaceutical profits! Staff Question Concerns about Safety; Hello,I'm extremely worried about the venlaon in our very old building and office. It's very bad during regular times and the ventilation is a major concerned. Also seeing students, faculty, and staff as they walk into our office regularly. This is a major concern since I will not know where they have been, if they are sick, etc. Th ey are told to come back to my office without knowing anything about them. How can I feel safe? I cannot feel safe having strangers in my oce with a pandemic going on.I am worried the office will not follow COVID protocols as hourly employees in my office have received no information. The office I work in hasn't been communicating very well during this past year and I'm very worried about communication when we return. So many issue s to resolve in just a very short me period. How is UNM going to keep us safe from others who are sick? This is a major concern. Our office only has one women's bathroom for many women. How are we supposed to feel safe from COVID? Thanks. Staff Question Concerns about Safety;What if the women is pregnant and didn't get vaccinated, can she have access to the UNM facilities? Staff Question Concerns about SafetyGeneral Complaint Is it legal?Whether legal or not, if UNM were to require vaccination as a condition of employment or attendance, would the state be at risk of having to compensate affected individuals or classes for any resulting damages (allergic reactions, car crashes, deaths, infertility, tolerance/reduced effectiveness to vaccines of future strains, mutagenic reactions, etc.)? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 285 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Question Concerns about SafetyI am very glad that there will be a policy in place to address this concern. However, it is not clear how the university defines \"sincerely held belief.\" I worry that this ambiguity will create a loophole through which any uninformed, selfish antivaccination zealot can apply for exemption, thus risking the health and saf ety of the UNM community. How are these beliefs defined, and how are they documented and verified? Will people who are exempt from the vaccination requirement be required to wear masks when on campus? This would certainly go a long way in sorting the people who genuinely are not able to take the vaccines from the people who want to die on thi s ideological hill (along with the vulnerable people they'll likely infect along the way). Staff Question Health AccommodationGood Morning I would like this to be defined more. \"A person who is granted a reasonable accommodation may be required to adhere to additional safety measures to ensure the health and safety of the individual and the University community, including but not limited to asymptomatic surveillance and symptomatic tesng.\" 1. Does this mean the person would need to get frequently tested?2. Could this possibly cause a person to be targeted since they are not vaccinated? 3. Would what need to be submitted for a reasonable accommodation? Such as a doctor note?Also I am classi ed a sta/student so my quesons are being considered for both aliaons. Thank you. Staff Question Concerns about Process;What if you have already been vaccinated? Are we required to show proof to UNM? Staff Question General Complaint Is there a way to submit anonymous feedback? Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am fully in favor of requiring Covid vaccination of all persons who learn or work on UNM's campus, unless the individual has a medical exempon.Thank you for draing the policy and for seeking feedback. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I believe that it is perfectly reasonable to require vaccinations for all our students. Of course, there can be the two most widely agreedupon exceptions: that of a medical exemption & and that of a religious (an established religion with published doctrine) exemption. In my experience I believe the vast majority of stude nts and parents would agree and feel much more comfortable about returning to, or starng college at UNM. Thank You services Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 286 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Thank you for doing this. My feedback is that all who step on campus must be vaccinated. To keep the campus population safe (which in turn keeps our family and loved ones safe at home), we all must work together and all be vaccinated. Those that are not vacci nated should not be given the option/luxury to work from home either (unless it is for health purposes with doctors written notice). Either you are part of the team/community or you are not. Again, thank you for all you are doing to Bring Back the Pack! Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I work at Residence Life and Student Housing. I am currently managing the designated isolation spaces on campus. Because of this, I have direct knowledge of the planning and expense necessary as well as the vital importance of adhering to protocol, when managing isolation spaces. Additionally, I have a basic underst anding of the vast efforts UNM has taken to combat COVID and protect its community, and of the success it has reaped due to this eort. Personally, I am in favor of all responsible measures taken towards COVID migaon. Because each member of the UNM community has their own opinion regarding the existence of COVID and the efficacy of the vaccine, this opinion affects their level of adherence, whether conscious or unconscious, to the UNM policies put in place to protect us all. I believe that the establishment of a mandatory vaccine requirement at UNM is necessary and prudent. Instuonal standards, when reinforced, can and do become societal standards. As an institution of higher learning, we have a responsibility to lead by example, reinforcing the principles of science and fact. In this case, the fact is that COVID is very real, and in way too many cases, lethal. But li ke polio, MMR, and other deadly diseases, COVID can be contained and migated through vaccinaon. While an enforced requirement may be the deciding factor for some few not to attend, I believe it will be the opposite for many, many more, and could posively aect enrollment for years to come. I hope that UNM will lead by example and accept this responsibility, joining other universities in protecting their communities through a mandatory vaccine requirement. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to voice our views. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I would support a vaccine requirement.If there is not a requirement, I would support a strong recommendation, and an explicit policy affirming that being vaccinated is an important contribution to good citizenship at UNM, the USA, and the world. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Vaccination of staff, faculty and students should be mandatory for everyone's safety. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly support requiring vaccinations and having a waiver review process for those that have legitimate reasons not to vaccinate. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 287 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support requiring all students, faculty and staff to be vaccinated. COVID19 is a horrible virus with horrendous consequences. Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in support for a mandatory vaccination policy to return to working in person on campus or remote locations for UNM divisions. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I'm in favor of the vaccine policy, mandate vaccination if you choose to work in the office. I fear that many will be against it for many reasons some legitimate others to get out of work. I think you should make sure you listen to every reason that is against it to assure they feel they are heard. Those voices are the loudest and would create the most disruption. My opinion is for those that choose to stay home should have some sort of way to be accountable to be working during their workday. This may add cost of havin g a system like this. Maybe asking each department, space, division to come up with their way of that system. Our university is not set up to be an online university so we should do what is possible to bring everyone back safely. The mask requirement should be enforced. Through the feedba ck request, I don't think you would get enough feedback. I think there are many people that will not fill it out. I would suggest that you ask departments and units to also collect their staff feelings towards this. This can be simple as collecting opinions through a google doc or one drive do c. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; An alternative to the mandate could be incentives for staff and students to choose to get vaccinate. The University of Tulsa is giving all staff who get vaccinated an additional day of paid leave, which is a great way to motivate folks who are on the fence or have simply pu t it off. Similarly, out of state and international students who are vaccinated coming to campus in August will not need to quarantine. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think now that the CDC has said it's safe for vaccinated people to be indoors without a mask, it is more important to make vaccines mandatory. I work at Valencia Campus and the people in Valencia County are more hesitant to get vaccinated so there is higher risk of sprea d here. Vaccinations are important for the safety of our campus and our community. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support the proposed requirement to require staff returning to on site work locations be fully vaccinated from COVID 19 prior to returning. I will feel safer returning to my shared work space knowing that my coworkers are vaccinated. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support requiring vaccinations to return to the office. I would not be at all comfortable sharing office space with unvaccinated people. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 288 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As a staff member of UNM for nearly 20 years I feel that implementing this policy is greatly needed. I would be more inclined to return to campus knowing that the people next to me, walking from one building to the next, in front of me and behind me in line get ting coffee, etc. have all been vaccinated. I have family who are of elderly age, my son is not of age to receive the COVID vaccine so knowing that anyone on campus has been vaccinated will ease my mind. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Thank you for seeking comments on the proposed Vaccine Policy. I strongly support a requirement that faculty, staff, and students be fully vaccinated against COVID19 before returning to campus in any capacity. I also support exceptions for the reasons included in the policy.My only concern about the dra policy is that it does not provide adequate protections when a person is granted an exception or exemption. The policy does not require unvaccinated individuals to participate in or implement additional CSPs to mitigate risk before coming to campus. Throughout the policy, \"may\" should be changed to \"shall\" so that unvaccinated individuals are required to take appropriate safety precautions before coming to campus. If they are unable or unwilling to take those precautions, they should not be allowed to access campus facilities, housing, services, programs or activities in person. Thank you. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support this Policy Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support the proposed vaccine policy. I hope UNM will offer vaccination on campus if we need boosters in the future. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Hold a vaccination event on campus, like the ones for flu shots. That way students, faculty, and staff don't have to search for a way or place to get vaccines. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in full support of requiring students/faculty/staff to be fully vaccinated in order to access inperson services on campus. As an advisor who works in a very small office, social distancing is not really a possibility in our spaces. If we are expected to return to our regular inperson serv ices, I would feel much more comfortable if there was a vaccination policy in place to ensure the spread of COVID is minimized even in these nonideal spaces. I appreciate the upper administration taking feedback on this and am hopeful there will be some kind of vaccination policy in place prior to returning to inperson operaons this fall. Thank you! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 289 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Just do it. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I believe it should be required. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; People are dying and we don't want that to be our coworkers, students, friends or family. It is simply the responsible thing to do to make vaccines required for those to whom it is safe to take them. After all, we require vaccines for students to enroll, particip a te in sports, etc. Why would we not do the same for a global pandemic that is killing people? Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I have been fully vaccinated, my first shot was on February 24, 2021, my second shot was on March 17, 2021. I believe that UNM should mandate that all Faculty and Staff including students should be fully vaccinated when the Fall Semester starts in August 2021, so that we are all on the same playin g field if you will. I understand that people may not want to take the vaccination because of either political beliefs or religious beliefs. This Pandemic has sidelined every aspect of our lives. So, regardless of political or religious beliefs, this is a health issue that affec ts al l of us. This virus has no political affiliation or religious belief it is a health issue for all of us. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As someone living with someone who is unable to be vaccinated, and with elderly family who are unable to be vaccinated due to certain health conditions, I am intensely uncomfortable with the notion that fellow staff/faculty/visitors will not be required to get the vaccine. I continue to do curbside pick up and online ordering, and have made minimal (less than five) trips into stores/public spaces since the start of the pandemic for the reasons above. When I read that masks will not be required and I may be required to be around people in office (vaccinated or not), it is terrif ying. I abso lutely feel that vaccines should be required for anyone entering a UNM space/building, whether located on or off campus. Thank you for considering a variety of viewpoints. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; We require other vaccinations (MMR, dTAP) for incoming students. I strongly agree to require COVID vaccination to be on campus. It's not enough to \"bring back the pack\", we have to actively work to keep the pack healthy and strong. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 290 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am Staff and Parent of a student. Please require vaccinations of all faculty, staff & students as a condition of \"Bringing Back the Pack.\"Please add the vaccinaon queson to the daily checkin quesonnaires. Please encourage departments to SLOWLY phase back over the summer. Some management want to rush back fully as of July 1 with with no clear justification for this expediency. Thank.you. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; THANK YOU!I believe UNM can be a strong model and leader in the vaccinaon mission.This required protecon will extend past the UNM community (those working/studying) to their families, friends, and the community at large. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I don't want to come work or interact with anyone who isn't vaccinated. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I agree with the draft policy. I believe all students, faculty and staff should be fully vaccinated before coming onto any UNM campus for any reason. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Just expressing my appreciation for this policy, and urging decisionmakers to hold a firm line on limiting exceptions and on robustly enforcing the policy. I am so desperately looking forward to returning to campus, and a policy like this one will make it easier to do so with peace of mind and safety fo r all, including my asyet unvaccinated young children. It is heartening to see UNM following a policy that supports public health and safety in this important way. Thank you! Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Although it would be preferable to require everyone on campus to be vaccinated, I do see that the policy states that those that are not vaccinated will have restricted access to certain facilities. This is good because it concerns me in regards to large classrooms, the gym, the SUB, and Popejo y. Also, would if a wind instrument musician is not vaccinated how can they participate? Just thinking. I highly encourage that those who do not vaccinate based on religious or health reasons submit an official waiver and be required to wear masks. There are some who are vaccinated who will continue to wear masks in large groups, like me, who do not feel comfortable with those who choose not to vaccinate in my place of work. I say this especially when the Delta Variant is consistently escalating by at least 5% a week with positive Covid tested people. This is frightening and I think UNM should let everyone know that the vaccine helps against the Delta Variant, health officials have warned that you ng, unvaccinated residents are at the highest risk of contracting the Delta variant. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 291 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I feel strongly that vaccinations should be a requirement and that proof must be on record; those unvaccinated cannot be around others. There are still too many vulnerable people who are children, immunecompromised, etc. unable to get the vaccine. The variants, how they spread and how practices impact them is still unk nown. Just this morning, I am reading that some places are reinstating indoor mask wearing because of the unknowns. I don't think restrictions should be relaxed so quickly, including indoors. There will be a stigma for those fearful who continue to wear masks to protect themselves and oth ers. Remember early in the pandemic when they mistakenly said that masks weren't necessary only to find that they are a huge protector? Being forced to return to the office, then care for my unvaccinated baby is unjust and unfair and especially as a single mom what else are my choice s? UMM has spent the last year thanking and trusting employees, and now suddenly its hypocritically exclaiming that employees can't properly work from home? Not everyone benefits from office 'culture' and in fact many find it to be another daily example of inequity and injustice. This is more of the same. I also see ma ny who privately convey on social media that they don't believe in masks or vaccines, and are fine with lying that they have been vaccinated. There is a lot of trauma from the past year and UNM policies seem to be heading that direction to create even more . Please listen to your staff, who are by nature of the hierarchy, already on the receiving end of inequitable treatment. You know, when they might get a 1.5% increase while some faculty are getting a $30k increase equivalent to the annual salary of some positions? After a year of equity discussions, there is a lot bei ng missed in the current dialogue and vaccines, pay, remote work, culture and opportunities are getting jumbled. Please think of all you preached and were so grateful for during the past year and ask yourselves if you are indeed on the right track. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am strongly in favor of the draft vaccination policy as it is written. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; UNM should consider the community around the university and not just the welfare of students, faculty, and staff. Universities have a tendency to think they live in their own little world, but UNM is right in the middle of Albuquerque. Having a stronger policy that does not include FDA ap proval would be better for Albuquerque overall.Also, UNM should take into account its demographics. First, the age group of students falls into a demographic with a very low vaccination rate. Also, Hispanics/Latinos fall into a demographic, again, with a very low vaccination rate. These rates need to be considered when thinking about the policy. Statistically, UNM is a delta variant away fro m causing a local outbreak in Albuquerque. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 293 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think the draft policy is fantastic and we would be very well served by requiring everyone who possibly can, to get vaccinated. The delta variant proves both that vaccinated people are not 100% safe (but the more there are, the safer everyone is), and that we as an instit ution need to leverage our voice and power to help ensure that a greater percentage of the population gets vaccinated. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly feel that anyone who works in a patient oriented department should be required to be vaccinated. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Please keep an eye on the variant ball. From Friday's Wall Street Journal: \"TEL AVIV\u2014About half of adults infected in an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid19 in Israel were fully inoculated with the Pfizer Inc. vaccine, prompting the government to reimpose an indoor mask requirement and other measures to contain the highly transmissible strain.\"We are experiencing a tremendous influx of visitors from neighboring states with low vaccination rates, increasing the risk of community spread of variants. Folks showingup to campus unvaccinated can seed microoutbreaks on campus and in the community. As a staff/faculty member who is also the caregiver of a vulnerable elder, I am very concerne d about the data coming out last week showing reduced immunity in folks. Also as recent as Friday, the WHO urged everyone on the planet to sustain public health precautions even if vaccinated (distancing, masking, etc). It feels like we are playing a game of Russia n rou lette to open campus and classrooms without: a) a way to confirmation vaccination; and b) to ensure unvaccinated individuals comply with requirements. I'm very concerned for my family that I teach eighthour days in classrooms with no windows. And how do we do this with campus visitors?? The 'honor system' is not a public health approach to ensure safety in a global pandemic.Thanks for considering. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am all here for a vaccination Policy. I believe that UNM and especially on my side of the campus HSC need to lead the pack on being responsible for our health. This would give UNM a chance to be a good role model to our community, school and place of work. Perhaps an incentive can also be given to those who are still apprehensive of getting vaccinated. Could be monetary, a day of annual leave for employees, a credit in lobo cash, a meal, UNM Loot, care package after getting the shot [pain reliever, ice pack, gator aid, snack etc] or some sort of discounted service et c. that would not negatively effect the budget. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Thank you so much for drafting a policy that requires all personnel at UNM to be fully vaccinated before returning to campus. This is the only way I will feel safe to return to campus full time. I think the drafted policy is great. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 294 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As Professor Holloway wrote in a recent academic dispatch, \" immunity protects your community\" so requiring the vaccine should be an easy decision given there are no legal complications. A minority, although potentially vocal, should not compromise our communal right to safety. As a research university, UNM should be tak ing a lead in the state and joining the now 361 colleges and universities that currently require vaccination (https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/live coronavirus updates/heres alistofcollegesthatwillrequirestudents tobevaccinated againstcovid19). If UNM does not, they should at least take the following steps until our community is closer to immunity from Covid19. Register those who have been vaccinated with proof and find a way to securely identify vaccinated status. Allow those vaccinated to choose whether they will mask indoors.Require those who are not vaccinated to wear masks. Choices have consequences, and people who simply choose not to get vaccinated should not endanger those who are immunocompromised or allergic to vaccination or who have under 12 year old children at home. Hospitals have had similar proced ures for staff who do no t get an annual flu vaccine so there are models in place.Ulmately, requiring vaccinaons for the UNM community will be easier and better for New Mexico overall. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I generally support this policy. It might be prudent to incorporate UNM's position on the need to get vaccine booster's, should the emerging medical literature determine that such boosters are warranted for continued efficacy against COVID19. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I want to express my support for UNM requiring vaccinations for everyone to return safely in person in the Fall. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I fully support the idea of UNM requiring all students, staff, and faculty to be vaccinated. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; In agreement with a mandatory vaccination policy. The needs of the many should absolutely outweigh the objections of the few. As a university, we should stand with science and databacked conclusions. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 295 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I have been impressed with UNMs proactive approach to the pandemic from the very beginning. While if felt as though the community/state/nation was slow to acknowledge the potential seriousness and implement steps to mitigate the path we were heading down, UNM got right to task with setting up strategies to keep it s employees, patients, and communities safe. Even when some of these methods were not popular. It has been an enormous commitment, effort, and work. Thank you. It made me feel safe to continue to come into work and take care of our cancer patients. And though my site is located in southern New Mexico, our Medical Director is UNM Faculty and vigilantly monitored the latest data/recommendations coming out of UNM to direct how our facility was being run down here. So, yes again to what the UNM policy will be as things open up. They are smart and I support them. And thank you for caring about our community. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think that vaccinations should be required. The schools require vaccinations in the elementary schools, why can't colleges required them as well. I support having vaccinations required for faculty, staff and students. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in full support of a fully vaccinated campus. I also support reasonable accommodation and adherence to safety measures as a requirement for those who are not vaccinated. Campus health is a priority. UNM is an open campus, so we are also at risk for guests and fellow Lobos who trav el. Just as we had to show our vaccination records before attending K12 schools, so should be doing the same as we enter PostCovid. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; The policy, now in draft form, seems a highly reasonable policy. I am in agreement with a vaccine mandate. Given the huge global impact with devastating losses across all facets of human life such a policy is the most rational approach for the public good. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I absolutely think the vaccine should be required this fall for all students and staff. It's just the reasonable thing to do. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly support a mandatory vaccine requirement. Other universities are making it mandatory. The no mask requirement based on the \"honor system\" for those vaccinated is a bad idea. We all know this honor system will not work. I suggest UNM either mandate the vaccine or keep the mask requirement. I am vacci nated but certainly do not feel safe on campus under the current policy especially when the campus will be teaming again this fall. While we value individual rights, the university has to consider the safety of the entire pack. One's right ends where another's begins. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 296 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; It is vital that UNM requires UNM affiliates physically returning to campus this fall to be fully vaccinated. Yes, there are a select few who for medical or religious reasons can get an accommodation, but the overwhelming majority need to be vaccinated fully to return for the safety of the pac k. This will also allow easier justification for going maskless in buildings and easing up on social distancing policies. There are precedents regarding Universities requiring vaccinations of students/staff/faculty such as the 1960s and on requirements for MMR vaccinations. I am a frontline worker and interact with students, staff, and faculty daily from all arou nd campus. I hope that UNM cares enough about the pack to require vaccinations. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I agree with the draft policy and thank you all for proposing it.One note: I don't think it denes \"fully vaccinated,\" and it probably should. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly approve of a policy that requires all students/staff/faculty to be full vaccinated in order to return to campus. I hope that UNM views any possible exceptions through a very narrow lens. Thank you for making the giving of feedback on the policy so easy. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Thank you so much for creating a vaccine policy and I do hope it will be implemented. As a public facing employee (staff) in CULLS, we've had to work throughout this pandemic with the public in our buildings. This gives me piece of mind that I and my coworkers will be protected with the vaccine requirement. I don't have any questions regarding this, but wanted to provide positive feedback about the implementation of a vaccine requirement. Staff Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda on; Support Policy;I support this effort 100%, I would like for our lives to return back to normal even if its the new normal. For those who cannot get the vaccine for whatever reason, I believe its fair to ask them to provide the proper paperwork for an exempon.I hope this becomes part of the normal policy, we cannot let another virus bring us down again! Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy This draft policy and related FAQs seem to be well thought out and realistic. I would support this policy, and believe many of my staff would as well, based on the questions and comments I have received over the last few weeks. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am an academic advisor who has 30minute, facetoface appointments with students in a small, poorly ventilated office. Enacting this policy would make me feel more confident in my safety as we are asked to resume inperson services. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 297 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am very glad to see that the University is planning to require vaccination! This past year has been full of uncertainty and honestly I'm concerned at how things are reopening considering New Mexico's COVID numbers are as bad at they were last Summer (at least according to covidactnow.org) and ther e are more concerns about variants every day. This policy will put my mind much more at ease as we return to campus. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am very pleased to see that you are looking to require vaccines, it makes me feel much more comfortable with the idea of coming to campus in person again. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a Staff member and a student, I greatly appreciate this safety measure being taken for all students/faculty/staff. As someone in an area that is very customer facing, it provides a level of security that makes me feel more comfortable about the safety of my family. I hope that as considera tio ns move forward, we continue to implement a strict mask policy for areas (like the Bookstore or the SUB) that see traffic from people who are not students/faculty/staff, to ensure the safety of the students and staff that work in those public areas. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy This policy looks well thought out. I appreciate you all doing what is best for the UNM community be requiring us all to receive the covid vaccine! Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Thank you for implementing a firm vaccine policy. This both helps me feel safer at the prospect of returning to work in person, and sends a clear message about the importance of getting vaccinated. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 298 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Vaccination of staff, faculty and student should be a requirement for opening operations in Fall (of course, expect for those with medical conditions). Specially making vaccination a requirement for incoming instate and outofstates students. According to scientists, heard immunity can be reached with 70% and 90% of vaccinated population, this includes adults and children. All of our campuses are part of the larger community in NM, therefore we are responsible for exposing the rest of the communi ty to pot ential transmission of highly contagious variants through the potential flow of students. We have to consider that surrounding states have not had effective public health measures, and incoming students may hold views regarding the pandemic that may have them resist our measures on campus and the state. In most instance in which college campuses have opened before the vaccine or without vaccina tio n requirement, transmission increased and the campuses eventually closed to contain the outbreak. A strong anvaccine or vaccinaon hesitancy campaign is necessary, and provide vaccination on campus for incoming students, staff and faculty. This could be coordinated with state and other higher ed instuons in the state. Sta should maintain a flexible, hybrid schedule that still reduces the contact with each other and others on campus. Also, we have to have contingency plans regarding staff and faculty having child care issues if outbreaks occur in local schools as districts ope n up in Fall. ID cards should somehow indicate the vaccination status in order to move through campus, while the pandemic is still uncontrolled. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Thank you for this and I hope this goes into affect. Largely requiring the vaccine, and requiring surveillance testing for those who don't get it, seems like the right approach. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about Safety;Support Policy;I would fully support a vaccination policy for return to in person activitiesbut there needs to be space for REAL medical exemptions (people with lowered immunity, chronic disease, etc, not anything ridiculous). Those people who can't get the vaccine for REAL reasons shouldn't have to stay away from school to accom modate morons. Maintaining high quality online options is a great way for deniers to participate and also great for participation for students with other challenges.I think this would be more challenging before the vaccine has full FDA approval and without herd immunity, or approval, I do NOT support \"you don't have to wear a mask if you're vaccinated!\" plans. Because we all know that the people who won't get vaccinated will absolutely lie about it and risk vu lnerable people's lives so that they can feel \"free.\" I don't think there should be very large gatherings indoors (400 people lectures?) without masks until we have herd immunity and death levels approximating that of seasonal flu. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 299 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Totally in favor of requiring Covid vaccinations for faculty and students before they return to campus! As well as nursing students before they go on their clinical excursions....Thank you! Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think a vaccine policy is a good idea and one that will help protect our UNM community and the community at large. I would like to see this move forward. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy This may be the right opportunity to review how UNM can enforce the policy that requires the MMR vaccine for all students entering UNM. During the past few year, the medical community world wide has seen an increase infection rate due to this important highly infectious but vaccine preventabl e di sease. We are entering a new era of infectious diseases we must prepare accordingly. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Yes, we should have a vaccine mandate. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Great idea! I approve of this policy Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this policy is appropriate and necessary. I appreciate the continued attention to the safety of the UNM community Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support the vaccine requirement and feel it is essential to provide a safe environment for a return to normalcy. Although I respect the need to be fair and just in allowing for exemptions on the basis of religion, I do fear that this will allow too many people to si mply state \"I don't believe in vaccines\" and therefore avoid the policy. I understand it may not be legally feasible, but I think this language should be strengthened and there should be a greater burden to obtaining exemption based on belief. We're an institute of higher learning with a worldcl ass Health Sciences Center. We should function on the tenants of science and proven interventions, not antivax dogma. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly support the proposed policy and feel it would greatly contribute to safety to campus to have those guidelines in place, especially when in close indoor proximity with others. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 300 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am a staff member and a student, please require all UNM personnel including students to be fully vaccinated. I take care of a public venue (the Bio Dept Greenhouse) and will not feel comfortable opening the greenhouse to students unless there is a policy requiring students to be vaccinated. In addition, it is a kn own factor that students come to class sick because they will miss subject material. I fully anticipate students who have been given a positive COVID test will still come to class. Implementing a required vaccine will reduce the number of students coming to class sick. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about Enforcement Supp ort PolicyI wholeheartedly support this policy. As someone who manages the Lobo Prevention Pack for our campus and has been actively involved in creating the #VaxThePack campaign, I have seen many people on campus fail to take the precautionary measures needed. While we continue to work on this, the requirement for vacc ination will not only assist our students in the education and advocacy they continue to provide, but also shows the stance that \"Each Lobo, Protects all Lobos\". Public health matters and we as an institution need to take a greater stance on prevention on our campus. Fortunately, we are not alone in drafting thes e policies, today the American College Health Association send out the notification below advising college to do just this!(hps://www.acha.org/ACHA/About/ACHA_News/ACHA_Re commends_COVID 19_Vaccina on_Requirements_for_Fall_2021.aspx) With that being said, I noticed the policy starts off with the \"requirement\" of this vaccine in the first paragraph, this then transitions to \"highly recommend\" in the second paragraph. I feel that this can be confusing. Also, it is my understanding that there is no plan for enforcement in place, therefo re how wi ll we ensure that our campus community is vaccinated? There seems to be no repercussions menoned in the policy. Thank you for allowing this to be a discussion with our campus community. Kudos, to UNM for putting this forth and providing a healthier and safer campus for all. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Barring legitimate medical or religious reasons, I believe every UNM staff, student and faculty member should be vaccinated against COVID19. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 301 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyAlthough I 110% support vaccinating everyone (and I am fully vaccinated already), I do not believe it is a wise decision to mandate, via a policy, a rule of 'vaccinate or you can't come to campus.' I believe that will damage morale campuswide and create a 'us against them' men tal ity. Those walking around with a mask on under this policy could be shunned or discriminated against, or even worse harmed for their choice. I believe it infringes on each person's right to chose, just as many parents (although not me) chose not to vaccinate their children. It is a persona l decision whether or not to get injected with that vaccine and a University policy mandating it creates an undue burden on the person.I do believe all nonvaccinated persons should be required to maintain CSP and wear masks on campus, but I do not believe it is fair to them to require them to take any additional measures above and beyond that. Nor do I believe it's medically necessary to have them take extra st eps to protect others. The current steps we are taking are working and we've flattened the curve. Anything above current CSP's would be unreasonable.I support vaccination immensely, and encourage all those around me to vaccinate, but I do not believe it is a wise decision to have a University Policy mandating something that should be a choice. Not allowing the antivaccinators on campus would create great hostil ity within Departments and the Campus. I'd go as far as to say that I know many staff and faculty would quit over a policy such as this. We are coming into a world of hybrid telecommuting options and I know people would look for a job elsewhere if they were not allow ed on campu s . Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementI believe the policy is a sound one but there needs to be clear description of policy enforcement. Given the language about waiting until the CDC I am concerned that the policy is toothless, and will remain toothless, for most of the academic year. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementWhile I am glad to see that such a policy is being considered in order to make all staff, faculty, and students safer and to help prevent any potential future outbreaks at UNM, I am wondering: if this is not going to be *enforced* until the FDA approv es of one or mo re of the vaccines, then is it really *required*? In other words, is it really a requirement for all to be vaccinated in order to be on campus if, when people go against policy on this, nothing is/can be done to the violator?Again, I am fully in support of a policy truly *requiring* vaccinations (and I myself am thankfully fully vaccinated against COVID19); but I am just wondering if anything is going to actually be done to those whom do not comply, before that point in time when the FDA approves a vaccine, in order to give this potenal policy any strength at all unl then? Thank you! Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementI believe that this policy should be implemented, as it is in the best interest of public health.I like that the policy includes steps that must be taken by nonvaccinated individuals to ensure health safety (including but not limited to asymptomatic and symptomatic tesng).How will this policy be enforced? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 302 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementLOVE this SO MUCH, thank you for continuing to take reasonable and prudent positions that expose you to static but are the right thing to do and protect us all. I could not be prouder of this university and its leadership for the way you have stepped up to the plate an d steered us through these terrible times. So many times it would have been easier for you to duck and take the easy way out and you never have. Thank you for protecting me so that I can focus on doing my job!One minor queson on the policy: In the second paragraph it says \" Enforcement of the policy will be delayed until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves/licenses forregular use at least one COVID19 (SARS CoV2) vaccine.\" Aren't there already 3 vaccines approved? Or are we waiting for something else? If this had been written last year this would make sense but since the date on this document is May 2021 it's very confusing. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementA COVID vaccine requirement for students and staff is a great move and helps provide a safe campus. The University will need to provide administrative support for monitoring/enforcement. Databases will need to be available to check vaccine status for out ofstate students, since they will not be in NM State Immunization Information System and cards documenting COVID vaccination are easy to forge. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about Enforcement Conc erns about ProcessThank you for developing this policy. I support a vaccination requirement for everyone in the campus community, with appropriate ADA exempons. Here are my quesons If a student or employee refuses to comply, is it likely that that individual would face some kind of disciplinary action? I work in the libraries, and we have had to use the ban process through the Dean of Students Office for individuals (UNM and comm unit y) who have severely or repeatedly violated various campus policies. Is escalating to a campus ban a likely outcome in this scenario for students? If it's an employee, would the supervisor be looped in to the conversation, and at what point? Would supervisors have to provide remote work for employees who refuse a vacci ne without a medical exemption? Or does it become a disciplinary action? What recourse would an employee have? People will have reasons other than medical for deciding not to be vaccinated. If, or more likely, when, a booster shot is available for the current vaccines, do you anticipate UNM providing shot clinics, as we do for the flu shot? It's so helpful, and I appreciate that access. But I realize the scale of the vaccination cam paign may make it more challenging to facilitate a booster shot for SARSCoV2. I have some other questions about the phased return to campus so I hope there will be a similar way to submit questions! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 303 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda on; Support Policy;I agree with the requirement, however I have several employees that have medical concerns. I would like to be sure we clarify what the requirements will be for those with exemptions so they can make the best decisions for themselves.I will likely lose one employee in a key area due to this possible requirement, but I believe that this is due to a lot of paranoia surrounding the vaccines. Possibly some accurate information sent out reiterating the safety from UNM may help.Thank you, rounds Manager Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementHeal th Accommoda onRI strongly support this policy. I do not support personal exceptions for any reason other than medical or legitimate religious reasons (not made up religions). I have questions about enforcement, and about how we will know if the people in our sphere have been vaccinated. I believe I have a right to not be willingly expos e d at work by someone who has chosen not to be vaccinated, and that I have a right to know who around me is not vaccinated and may be a vector so that I can avoid being in person with them. Staff Supportive of Policy Health Accommoda on; Religious Accommoda on;I support a University vaccination requirement 100%. I am curious though what accommodations will be given to those who choose not to get vaccinations due to medical or religious beliefs. I support their reasons not to....but that still puts others at risk. Can you discuss how that will be managed please? Will those indivi duals all work/attend classes remotely? Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about Enforcement Supp ort PolicyI am happy to see UNM draft a policy that mandates vaccination. I think that it will go a long way to assure community members that it is \"safe\" to return to campus. I have many staff members that are nervous and this will quell some concerns. I look forward to explanaons of monitoring of compliance. This is a brave statement and it is much appreciated. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about PrivacySupport Policy(I am staff and student) I would feel much safer, in both work and class, if this policy is enacted. Please make sure that whatever method is used to collect vaccine proof from the UNM community is secure, as this is HIPAAprotected data. BTW the site where we are supposed to submit our current vaccine status doesn't provide information about where that data is going or who has access to it people might be more inclined to selfdisclose if they knew those things. This was raised in the HR forum yesterda y . Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 304 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about Privacy;Support Policy;I am a UNM Staff employee who works at the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center in the infusion suite. We care for the most severely immunocompromised patients possible. That is not hyperbole. We actively perform stem cell transplantation on this unit. That involves annihilation of the patient's bone marrow with chemotherapy, whic h wou ld ordinarily kill a person, and then \"rescuing\" them with the stem cell transplant. The rooms in which this procedure takes place on the opposite side of the wall from the 4th floor employee break room, where unvaccinated employees are authorized to unmask and eat, during a respiratory pandemic. Is the HVAC syste m suc h that none of this air is shared? Additionally, this breakroom environment of mixing vaccinated and unvaccinated staff is exposing the vaccinated staff to possible infecon, and endangering our paents. The science is showing more and more that this can be/is an airborne transmitted virus. Since we keep treating our patients as customers, I feel that our patients should be made fully aware of the vaccination status of the staff of the UNMCCC; to be perfectly clear, all our patients should be informed that vaccines are not required of UNMCCC staff during all appointment reminder calls, posted on the wal ls, etc. This way, our cancer patients can make a truly informed choice about where they choose to receive their oncology care. Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about ProcessThank you for proposing mandatory vaccination for UNM. I FULLY SUPPORT MANDATORY VACCINATIONS! I'm the Operaons Manager at KUNM Radio, I oversee about 100 community volunteers who currently produce their music and public affairs programming from home due to COVID, but will eventually return to live, instudio broadcasting. As part of our \"bringing back the KUNM pack\" set to start in early Jun e, we've decided to mandate proof of full vaccination for all our DJs wishing to broadcast live from our studios in Building 156. I see language pertaining to \"UNM personnel\" for people who will be required to be vaccinated, but it would be nice to include language from the FAQ section that indicates volunteers will be included in this too so I can point to this language if there is any pushback fro m our volunteers. As the sta member who will be in charge of verifying vaccine status for our volunteers, any additional support and guidance for safe return to operations will be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 305 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about ProcessSupport PolicyI fully support the implementation of this requirement, which would explicitly recognize that comprehensive COVID19 vaccination is the most effective way for UNM to return to a safe, robust oncampus experience for students this fall semester. Without it we will have two categories of students with very different risk profiles and limited ability to differentiate between them when needed, such as for exposures to positive cases. Also, current CDC recommendations for COVID Safe Practices are different for the two groups, and can reasonably be expected to connue this way for the foreseeable future. A COVID19 vaccination requirement will require significant new administrative processes that currently do not exist in order to verify vaccination status and to ensure compliance (including processes for opting out). Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about ProcessSupport PolicyI think we should absolutely require all employees to get the vaccination (and like HSC/Health System requiring flu shot) require proof and tracking. It will be difficult to make employees that are coming back to feel comfortable being around those who may not be vaccinated. Staff Supportive of Policy Religious Accommoda onS upport PolicyIn order to further reduce the abuse of the religious exception policy, the university can require a letter discussing their beliefs from the individual's religious leader. Outside of a very small selection of groups, there are no objections by any major religious group. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 306 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about SafetyI *am* encouraged by the fact that a Vaccine is required, but I am also incredibly troubled by the fact when someone is granted an excepon it's kept condenal... I understand the need for privacy, but bear in mind that this comes at the cost of increased potential exposure for folks that are still at risk even after receiving the Vaccine (the risk is greatly lowered, yes, but that's not the point). I have type 1 diabetes and along with that I am immunocomprised (tends to be alongside type 1). It's not uncommon for a flu, pneumonia or even a 'bad' cold to put my life at risk (I wish that was an overstatement). I also understand that not vaccinating is a *choice* and my medical condition is not... some folks don't appreciate the dierence. If UNM is going to allow for anonymous exceptions to receiving the vaccine, please consider taking some sort of effort along side it to notify any folks that may be at higher risk of being near an area where unvaccinated folks are present (and offer them a remote optio n where possible). Please nd a balance: I understand people don't want their unvaccinated status known, but I don't want to die because someone else's preference to not vaccinate, so I need to keep away from anyone that's unvaccinated. I *will* ask and I *will* tell folks they may not approach me closer than 6 feet and even then it beer be *with* a mask. Maybe a badge indicator meaning \"don't approach unless vaccinated\" would be appropriate... again, I'd like to point out that I do not have a choice in having type 1 diabetes, BUT it is a choice a person can make to not be vaccinated. My life maers to me. Please, don't make me choose between my life and my job. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I love it, let's do it Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 307 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Concerns about EnforcementConc erns about ProcessHealth I am an academic advisor. I have a small office with poor venlaon and no windows that open. I have been very fortunate that UNM has been so flexible allowing staff to work from home in this time. Technology has allowed me to continue to meet with my students with little interruption. I hope flexibility is continued. As a working parent, I hope I will be allowe d to work from home if my son has an exposure and his school or classroom closes. I am very nervous to return to work, in general. In typical times, I meet with upwards of 12 students a day. Not to mention other staff and faculty coming and going from our office. Considering how often advisors get colds and other minor illnesses from students coming to appointments ill, I am concerned abou t students (and others) bringing in COVID. Vaccinaons and other practices are the only way to return to the office, in my view. As long as there are robust avenues for those that cannot get vaccines and those with other credible reasons for not getting the vaccine, I support the mandate. I also hope that ma sks and outside or remote appointments and meengs are embraced. In addion, while I have only just received my second dose, for some, they are nearing 6 months, and it will be past 6 months by August. I hope there is research being conducted and plans being made for those that are concerned that their vaccine bene ts have worn o. I wonder how buildings will be monitored? In typical times our building is open to the public. Perhaps badge access only? And potenal students can make Zoom appointments. Thank you for the courage to put out a policy that puts the wellness of the pack above the rants of the few. I hope it is approved. Staff Supportive of Policy Religious Accommodation;I fully support a COVID19 vaccination mandate at UNM and all its facilities. I do not, however, agree with religious exemptions, but do agree with exemptions for those who are immunocompromised or have other types of legitimate medical excuses. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe this policy to be an excellent idea. Setting up appointments and receiving the vaccine is readily abundant and available for free, and promoting herd immunity at UNM shows an initiative towards the security and health of all those who attend UNM. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I just wanted to submit my STRONG SUPPORT for this policy. I appreciate UNM taking a stance to protect the staff, faculty, and students. I appreciate not leaving it up to each individual. I think this is the best policy to make sure we don't have outbreaks on campu s and to ensure the sa fety of our families and loved ones who are too young to access the vaccines. I STRONGLY support this policy and will happily show my vaccine card on campus as needed. :) Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Everyone needs to be vaccinated. Thank you Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 308 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Sounds like a wonderful idea to keep all Lobos safe. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I love the draft vaccine policy. Please vote on it and enforce it. I want all students, faculty, staff, volunteers, contractors, EVERYONE setting foot on campus to be fully vaccinated. This includes children once the vaccine is approved for ages 2+. Thank you for drafting the policy. The FAQs are exc ellent as well. You 100% have my support in this endeavor. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I appreciate the wellthought approach the President and her leadership team are taking to \"bring back the pack\" in as safe a way as possible while respecting privacy, individual choice and providing accommodations. Given the significant healthrisk to other individuals, I am in favor of the prop osed policy. My hus band is immune compromised and as our oncologist said yesterday, while we are both vaccinated, the level of protection he may receive from the vaccine is unknown and initial research is showing it can be minimal or none for some people who have a compromised immune system. So, the best protection he can ha ve is that COVID is reduced to very minimal transmission. COVID is like secondhand smoke if someone chooses to smoke and I have to be in that environment to work or go to school, I can't completely eliminate the impact of someone else's choice on myself an d in this case, in exposing my husband to a virus that could be lifethreatening. So, while I understand there will and should be reasonable accommodations, in this instance, I think the health risk to all individuals of people not getting vaccinated outweighs the individual choice. Thank you for taking the time to put the policy out for comment and using it to guide the University's decision. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I support vaccination being required for our campus community. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think that this is a good policy. However, I also believe that UNM should be using soft influence tools such as rebates on student fees and education to encourage students and staff to get vaccinated over the summer. The way in which this policy was rolled out seems to use mostl y the stick and not so much carrot. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think having a mandatory vaccine requirement is an excellent plan and really shows UNM cares about it's community. COVID19 has been devastating to so many people, and having a mandatory vaccine requirement will help keep the community safe. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 309 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Dear President Stokes and upper administra on, I line up on the side of vaccine advocacy. As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I saw what life is like without easy access to healthcare that we in the U.S. take for granted, and it's not great. There are many things that employers require of their staff. For example, when we drive UNM vehicles, we must wear our seat belts and drive carefully. When we work in an office, we act professionally to create a constructive work environment for everyone. There are certai n protocols and procedures that ensure that our production is sustainable and improves the campus for living, working, and scholarship. Generally speaking I fall on the side of educaon and encouragement for health goals. We do not require flu shots, but we make the case for them and make it easy to get them. We do not require folks to quit tobacco, eat healthy, exercise, and keep our work and our personal li fe balanced, but we encourage this by role modeling, the benefits UNM offers, and general atmosphere. Peer pressure goes a long way. Incentives work too. For something that is so critical as a highly infectious, unpredictably dangerous disease, I personally feel it should be a requirement of UNM employment to either have a full set of Covid 19 immunizations, or a note from a healthcare practitioner that that person cannot or should not be immunized. The UNM Campus is porous so in some ways it would be ineffective to require all the campus community to have themselves vaccinated. We are not safe until every human on the planet is immune to Covid19. But it's a start, and it's a reasonable place to make a stand. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think it is a great idea to require the COVID vaccination. With so many people interacting on a daily basis it makes the most sense to keep people safe. I fear without this requirement, many areas/classes will have to shut down for various periods of time due to small outbreaks of those who are unvaccinated. The re is a small portion of the population who cannot get the vaccine and we should require vaccinations for those who can so that small portion that cannot will be protected as well. The vaccine is proven to be safe. Please require it. I will feel muc h safer coming back to work. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 311 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support a vaccine requirement, for students, faculty and staff. However, the requirement alone is not sufficient to mitigate risks. We need to retain social distancing, and masking inside, and reinforce measures such as cleaning oces.The risk points include, For example,1 it is easy to counterfeit covid shot results, at present. So if I, as a higher risk individual, relay on others honesty in providing covid shots records I am still at risk.2 Due to privacy statements, we sta, in close quarters, will have no idea who works in close proximity to us, who is not vaccinated. In my case, a coworker who has documented medical reaction to other vaccines, works a couple feet from my desk. I am high risk, and this additiona l expo sure is scary to me. I will continue to wear my mask, but since it is proven to be airborne, and we do not use / have shields, this is part of the answer, not all the answer.3 Vaccine expiraon and boosters who is going to keep up with whether staff, students and faculty follow guidance and meline for boosters?4 Oce air flow Our building is known for terrible air handling. Nothing has been done to address this risk, which CDC has highlighted repeatedly. I do not have a window that opens, and neither do most of my coworkers.5 Business continuity concerns with my staff also in offices with shared and poor air florw as well as myself and my coworkers and close proximity to each others, and to many resident students who come in and out of the building daily to assure busine ss continuity there should be some thoughtful alternating of staff who work \"in\" and staff that work \"out\" of the office, day to day. I could lose multiple people due to one exposure due to our poor air handling.6 Cleaning I currently go in to the oce at least once per week. It is not clean. The oxiver that used to be in the office for voluntary use by office occupants disappeared and was not replaced. And noone is checking, or cares. I brought this to admin attention. The garbage in our offices is not emptied nor the r ecycling overflowing in the copy room for many weeks which tells me, the suite and office are not being cleaned or wiped down.7. Mandatory vax for resident students would make me feel better, except I will not be informed of the % of residents who are not vaccined, but wander in and out of buildings un masked.8. We have some sta who rounely cheat with when or how to wear their mask, who want to give hugs, who are not vaccinated and just don't get it.9 Many students do not believe the science of COVID and actively \"cheat\" . They are young, not the best judgment or risk takers, and, understandably tired of their isolation, and that is a stronger motivator, than following the safety guidelines to protect others. And not even believ ing their own po sitive tests, and acting as they should. But that increases risks around them.10. Unl me has elapsed enough for science to have more data that is honestly provided and followed, I want to continue to not work all day near multiple other staff, not interact with large quantities of students in person, and alternate who is in the office. I have seen eno ugh to know it is a risk to rely on the judgement or honor of people around me on campus. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 312 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a member of a vulnerable health population, I appreciate this effort. I see students and attend classes with them, so I would like Vaccines to be required until they have a reasonable exemption. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I agree and support this proposal, I believe this naturally falls in line with how well NM as a whole (UNM included) has been managing the pandemic. It also will ensure that we as a University Community keep the whole pack safe and healthy, seng standards for others to follow. If K12 schools can require vaccines, why can't we? Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this is prudent. We need to be aggressive controlling COVID 19. I'm glad to see this. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Hello,I would like to have an addional provision be made upon those who are granted ADA or Religious Accommodation and are approved to return to campus unvaccinated. For the safety of fellow colleagues who are and are not vaccinated, I would like to recommend that those who are unvaccinated must follow masking protoco l w hile on campus and it should be stated in the policy in an eort to keep our enre Pack safe and healthy. Thank You, Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this is a good idea.It keeps all lobos and their families safe. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly recommend and support requiring the Covid 19 vaccine for everyone who plans to be on campus in the Fall 2021 semester (or sooner). Many of our students, staff, and faculty have people in their lives who can't get the vaccine (for medical reasons or because of age). In addition to protec ting those who can't get the vacc ine, the more bodies available for this virus, the more mutations we will see. If a vaccine requirement encourages students, staff, and faculty to get the vaccine, we are all safer as a community. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I support a COVID Vaccination Policy that requires vaccination. I recognize this vaccine was approved under emergency conditions and the consequences of that. That said, in order to register and attend public school in NM and the nation, children must show proof of immunization. This would be a similar policy. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 313 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am also a student. I am in full support of requiring vaccinations for the return to campus. You are going to get some very loud and obnoxious pushback. Please ignore it. This semester my term project was on vaccine hesitancy, and it's going to take requiring the vaccine to make sure enough peo ple get it to ensure everyone's safety. This vaccine is safe and effective. I suggest partnerships with HSC to provide town halls where pro vaccine docs and nurses can answer questions and concerns from students who may be misinformed. Even though I am vaccinated, I would not feel comfortable retur ning to campus as a staff member or a student if vaccines are not required. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy As someone who is both staff and a student, I would like to say how appreciative I am of the efforts by the University to keep our community safe. I do have a preschooler who (at this time) is not able to be vaccinated against COVID19, so these steps to mitiga te the chances that I could unknowingly transmit the virus to him are essential to me being able to comfortably work in an office with other people again. I also appreciate that additional safety precautions will be required of those who are not able to receive the vaccine for medical or religious reasons. I applaud UNM for the po licies and procedures put in place (and with so little notice) which I feel have helped to keep our students, staff, and faculty safe even when those decisions might not have been welcomed by many. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy Hi:I'm also a student at UNM.I don't have any problems requiring students, faculty, staff or vendors to be vaccinated for COVID. I think it's prudent policy, and embodies the U's mission of enacng datadrive n bes t pracces Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am vaccinated and hope that UNM will be able to require vaccinations of all students, staff, and faculty, only allowing those with a medical or religious reason to decline. For those who do decline, I hope that UNM will required weekly COVID19 tests and that there would be a discipli na ry penalty for those who do not meet the requirement. My staff work in all the buildings on campus and should continue to be protected from this deadly disease.Thank you Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am a healthcare provider at SHAC. I STRONGLY agree with the policy of requiring covid vaccination for students attending any in person classes, living in dorms/student housing affiliated with UNM, athletics, staff and faculty. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I really think everyone should be vaccinated except if medical conditions don't allow. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 314 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think it's a smart move on the University's part although I'm sure quite a few people are making a fuss otherwise. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I agree with the policy. I would be leery of returning to work knowing that there may be other staff members who may not be vaccinated.I had never received the flu vaccinaon unl a few years ago when it became a job requirement in a prior position. People can still get COVID even if they are vaccinated so it would put those people who are vaccinated at risk. I did not receive the vaccination right when it wa s administered at UNM. I was hesitant but then I began to worry about my safety around those people who had received the vaccine. There are still many unknowns with the vaccine but I believe the risk out ways the overall safety for those who have received the vaccine. We should be able to return to work confident that it is safe. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am in full agreement of the vaccine requirement. I have been directly involved with the rapid response team at UNM, Medical Director at SHAC, and involvement with Lobo Athletics, this would allow in person classes to return to normal. It alleviates time spent contact tracing and unnecessary time spe nt in quarantine if a close contact. It will make travel with athletic teams much easier and practices within teams to return to normal. Thank you all for considering this mandatory vaccine! Go Lobos! Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I completely support this policy. As a public health professional who researches in the Department of Emergency Medicine, I recognize that we are in an unprecedented pandemic. We must do everything we can to ensure the health and safety not only of the UNMaffiliated community, but of all New Mexicans and wo rld citizens. It makes a great deal of sense to me to require full vaccination for any person using UNM facilities. If a person cannot be vaccinated due to religious affiliation or disability, although no contraindications to the vaccines have been found in current research, they should be required to unde rgo additional testing and monitoring. Given that the newly identified SARSCoV2 variants are even more contagious than the original SARSCoV2 that created the pandemic, it is responsible to do whatever necessary to limit the spread of the virus. A policy requiring vaccination and/or testing and mon it oring is the responsible course of actions for all institutions, such as UNM, that bring people together. Thank you for drafting the policy. I look forward to it going into effect. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 315 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am a proud UNM alumnus and staff member. I strongly support the effort to require vaccination for all students, staff, and faculty at UNM. Vaccination is our most powerful tool to fight the pandemic and prevent the emergence of even more dangerous variants. We are incredibly fortunate to have access to saf e, effective vaccines that are currently out of reach for most people around the world. With crucial exemptions in place for people who cannot be vaccinated due to ability/health status or religious beliefs, this policy will maximize opportunities for a safe return to campus. UNM must do our part to encoura g e widespread vaccination as much as possible, both because of our responsibility to protect the health and safety of our UNM community and our civic duty as an institution to the State of New Mexico and the USA as a whole. This policy is a powerful tool to set the expe c tation that vaccination is the norm (with reasonable exceptions) and serves to protect not just oneself but others. This policy imposes a reasonable burden on individuals to do their part in fighting the pandemic in order to access University facilities and services. Please adopt the proposed mandatory vaccination policy as written . Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I support this policy because if everyone who can be vaccinated is, it means that people who cannot be vaccinated for medical or religious reasons are going to be better protected (as well as the full campus community). Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I personally am glad to see such a policy. It makes me feel more comfortable about returning to campus from remote work. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am also a student. A vaccine requirement is not unheard of or unreasonable. As the only Level 1 trauma center for hundreds of miles, the premier children's hospital in New Mexico and the main treatment xenter for cancer patients in the area, it is our responsibility as healthy citize ns to protect the immunocomprimised through our ability to vaccinate. Any other argument puts others at risk on the basis of antiscience political rhetoric. Please maintain the goal of education and do not ignore our own alumni's research. Staff Supportive of Policy Support Policy This is an amazing idea! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 316 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Neutral General Complaint;What plans does UNM have in place to mitigate the spread of the Delta variant? The WHO has recently recommended that vaccinated people continue to wear masks, as fully vaccinated folks in the U.K. and other nations are contracting the variant and are still experiencing serious complications. New Mexico has not reach ed herd immunity, and the Delta poses an even graver risk to the unvaccinated population than did the original virus. Additionally, disabled and immunocompromised UNM community members are at incredibly high risk of being harmed by this variant, and that risk needs to be addressed and accommodated. As we have seen with the devasta tion experienced by the Navajo Nation, this pandemic is exacerbated along racial and class lines, and this new Delta variant poses a serious risk to the lives of various marginalized communities. As a campus that claims to pride its diversity, it needs to be a leader in mitigating the dama ge of th e Delta variant that will disproportionately target this campus's populations. Student Neutral General Complaint;Why are staff, faculty and students being required to adhere to face covering, social distancing if vaccinated as well as the state is 100% open on July 1st,2021. If you're following NMDOH guidance than vaccinated individuals should not be required to have face coverings or social distance. The current policy states if vacci nated masks are optional. Student Neutral Support Policy; In all honesty, I think it's a little weird that you want to require COVID vaccines, when you never required MMR vaccines or other communicable diseases like meningitis. I would argue that MMR is far more deadly than COVID, so I don't really like this idea of cherrypicking which vaccines you want us to have. I'm no t opposed to the new rules, but if you really care about the well being and safety of your students and staff, you'd maybe do a little more than require us the get the COVID vaccine when no other (to my knowledge) vaccine was ever re quired for us to attend in person school. Student Neutral Health AccommodationAfter seeing the policy and frequent questions I still feel uncomfortable going back to campus. I understand and support the policy but I'm concern on accommodations. I don't feel conformable knowing that some people would not have the vaccine due to the fact that classes are too small to practice social dista ncing. There is also a lack on a cleaning policy for UNM. I don't feel safe because UNM can assure I would not be spreading more germs if I use the common areas or even the classroom facilities. Even though the vaccine policy is good I would be feeling more confo rtable if UNM made a bigger effort on assuring the cleaning on the school facilities, dorms, classrooms and common areas. I'm specially concern on the fact that dorms' parties could still be a thing and people can spread the virus and get accommodated students sick. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 317 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Neutral General Complaint;Dear Lobo family who are in charge of making the final decision on whether to mandate the vaccines for students to be able to fulfill our educaon at UNM.We are a group of concerned students, some of us have had the vaccine and some of us haven't.We wrote a letter, but this feedback form would not allow us to put it here so we are sending you a link to a google document:h ps://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHIsPxM36lpu BqjyYIRvdSfyq5bbDzwjLArSHNN5QYw/edit?usp=sharingPlease let us know if you are able to open it and read the leer, If you are not able to do it, could you kindly let us know where we can send this leer?Thank you Student Neutral General Complaint UNM should remain online next semester. To require all students to be vaccinated in this timeframe is unreasonable. Student Neutral General Complaint I'm sure my opinion is vastly different than the majority on staff and at UNM as a whole. I'm sure it will fall on deaf ears because my opinions are not very popular with many in this day and age. Being almost 50 years old, my life experience is seen as less valid by many I've encountered at UNM, but that's okay. I feel my opinion is based on solid facts and concerns. Student Neutral Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyImpact to I think if you go through with this proposal you will lose many students and staff at all UNM facilities. You cannot force people to take a rushed vaccine that has proven no benefit, seeing as how people still get and spread COVID19 after the fact as well as the Johns on & J ohnson recall. This isn't fair to the students who have already signed leases or registered for classes. Student Neutral Concerns about ChoiceI dont have a lot to say except that I feel as thought the people who want to get the vaccine that is up to them, for for those who dont want to get them that is also up to them as well... and I wish for UNM to respect that and peoples freedom of choice. Thanks... Student Neutral Concerns about ChoiceThank you for the chance to offer feedback on this policy. Personally I am not interested in receiving a Covid vaccine, however I do think it is important for those that are predisposed to receive it. I think that is the choice of the individual, I believe the institution has and should prom ote the va ccine but not require it. I believe that is an overstep of personal freedom and privacy. The argument that it's not for me I don't feel applies, however if you do then the fact you promote abortion despite the child's life it's hypocrisy. I sincerely hope that you wou ld take value in others ability to choose. Student Neutral Concerns about SafetyThis is a very strict new policy, and I would feel a lot more comfortable with it if there was more time before we are required to be fully vaccinated. I want to wait before I get my vaccine because it is so new and there are many unknown facto rs. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 318 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I don't think the vaccine should be required. I have my own rights and reasons as to why I don't want to get the vaccine. I really hope that you can respect my rights and my privacy and not make it a requirement. I pay a lot of mon ey for my educa tion at UNM and the last thing I need right now is to be forced to get the vaccine. I hope that you can understand. Thank you for allowing me to provide feedback on this. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I believe that this is a violation of HIPPA laws and my rights as an American citizen. I do not want to reveal private medical information with the university or anyone else other than my doctors. If individuals wish to social distance, or still wear masks they should be allowed to do so. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Trust is a choice. When I give my trust to someone or something, I am choosing to give that trust. If I don't trust someone or something, then I choose not to bestow my trust on that person or thing. No external entity, that being the mayor, the gove rnor , the University of New Mexico, or any person, has any right whatsoever to force me to bestow my trust on any person or thing. Trust is an internal and personal choice. If I do not trust that the vaccines are indeed 100% safe, then I choose not to bestow my trust on the vacc ines. Therefore, the University of New Mexico has no right whatsoever to force it's students and faculty to bestow their trust on the vaccines and I therefore submit that students and faculty should not be required to be vaccinated. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Are you offering online classes for those who don't want to vaccinate? are you going to provide transportation for those who cant? Your policy feels forced on students and sta. Have you considered why some don't want to get vaccinated? trust in the vaccine and public health concern from past government mistreang people who look like them? A lot of people lack trust in the vaccine because of past events. have you tried to understand this? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;While I understand the intention behind the policy of trying to keep the campus COVID free, I do not think this method is the best option. I know there are many people who have not received the vaccine for different reasons, and I fear that blocking people from access ing education due to the vaccine will only increase already existing tensions and will not be fair. I do not see anything wrong with encouraging people to get the vaccine, but I think making it mandatory is not a good decision. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 319 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I know full well my opinion alone won't sway y'all, but you asked and shall receive.As far as others go, I completely understand why they'd want it! Many have weaker immune systems already and I support their decision. But as far as I go, I know that my lack of vaccination vs. their partaking of it will not change their quality of life (i.e. their body should be able to fight the virus more effi ciently whether or not I give them a strain), nor will it change mine... proof being I haven't dropped dead from the flu after 6 years of being unvaccinated.And no, I suppose I don't know everything. I do, however, know many within the medical industry who aren't very fond of the vaccine just yet. I dislike this possibly being a \"requirement\". I also am uncomfortable knowing we are guinea pigs in a grandscale experiment. You may say I am wary of the rumors, and despite who is right, there simply isn't enough informaon to prove one way or the other.I will refrain from the vaccine until we know more about short/long term eects.I am prepared to abide by what the school decides. I hope whoever needs the vaccine will take it and be thankful. TL/DR:Please just know I will not partake of the vaccine unl there is more information gained on its short/longterm effects. Thank you! Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Seeing as there are different risks for both the virus and the vaccine and there are relatively large numbers of people being hospitalized due to both, I think it is better to let people make their own choice based on their own personalized risks. As a young, healthy young person, I do not th ink that the risks of getting the virus outweighs the risks of the vaccine. The vaccine was also produced very quickly, a feat of modern medicine, but, that also means that we know little about it. Not to mention that in order to get the vaccine you are part icipating in a signed medical trial. Forcing students to participate in a medical trial is not a good idea especially when elsewhere it is a personal choice based on personal risks. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyGeneral ComplaintRequiring a vaccine when it isnt a year old is really silly in my opinion. I am planming to get it after it turns a year old. I dont like that UNM is requiring it for the fall. I have no problem if it is required by fall 2022, but fall 2021 is very ru shed. Please reconsider. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I feel that mandating the vaccine goes against our individual rights. I think that we should be allowed to make our choice freely. If masks are required of un vaccinated students than that is a choice that individual will have to weigh on themselves. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I don't agree with making this a mandatory policy. I work at the department of health and it's not mandated. I wear an N95 mask and get tested regularly. I would suggest doing something along these lines that way people have a choice with what to do with their bo dies. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 320 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I think it's very unnecessary for UNM to forcefully impose this vaccine upon its students. Let those who want the vaccine get it and they will be protected. If others don't want it, that's their choice. Can't say I would continue my undergrad at UNM if this was for ced. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 321 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; (Picked up from 2nd comment)I will conclude with a brief statement about the benefits of preserving free choice in this area. First, and most critically, it upholds the right to bodily autonomy for everyone at the university. It leaves everyone, from the youngest freshman to the oldest professor, free to consider the situatio n on their own from al l sides, take into account all the available information, and make their own decision on the matter without any kind of looming pressure in the background. There should be no threats of impaired education by online classes or reduced experience in teaching or research labs that impact s medical decisions. These should be made solely based on an individual's own risk assessment, since all the consequences of that treatment, whether good or ill, will ultimately fall on him. It accommodates those who aren't necessarily opposed to the vaccine outofhand, but who have adopted a \"waitandse e\" attitude. Freedom honors the intelligence of humanity.Manda ng any medical procedure fails completely at all of this. The decision is made for everyone, regardless of personal situation or concern, simply because someone else said so. No attempt is made to change the mind of the reluctant or concerned. They must simply conform, or else. Mandates are what you give to slaves, not to ci tizens. Mandates are tools of oppressors to crush the oppressed simply for disagreement.Freedom is also fundamentally, inherently fair. If I were to reject this vaccine, contract SARSCoV2, and die of it, then I'm reaping the consequences of my actions. A vaccinated person likely wouldn't have died from that exposure, but the causeand effect pathway is clear: I rejected the vaccine, I got the disease, I died . Even in the case of a person who voluntarily took the vaccine, this holds up: I took the vaccine, I contracted the disease anyway, I died. Alternatively, in the case of an adverse reaction: I took the vaccine, I suffered a negative reaction, and I died from it . This is still fair, because in this example, there is no second party involved.Where this fails is when a mandate from a second party is involved. Now, suddenly, it's: You threatened my education or livelihood if I didn't take the vaccine, so I took the vaccine, suffered an adverse reaction to it, and died. That negative consequence is no longer applied directly to the perso n taking the shot. Th at's on you now, because you thought you knew better than the person getting the needle put in her arm, and you were so convinced of your position that you were willing to threaten your population and insult their intelligence.As a side note, to again cut o a potential counterargument for a second party being involved in the case of a vaccinated person being infected: If it is possible for a person who has received the vaccine to contract the disease, present symptoms, and succumb to the illness, then it is equal ly possible that they acquired the disease from another vaccinated person in the same situation in the first place. In effect, this argument asks everyone to get a vaccine by appealing to the poor efficacy of the vaccine, and I find it more selfdefeating than compelling.(Concluded in 4th comment) Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 322 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I do not think that the vaccination should be a requirement. If someone wants the vaccination let them get it, if they do not they shouldn't be forced or penalized for their decision. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Health Accommodation;I would not recommend requiring vaccinations. The University should still strongly recommend COVID19 vaccinations along with scientific explanation and education. Requiring vaccinations or other medical interventions for students, facility, and/or staff to participate in the University community can be viewed as discriminatory. I greatly admire the University of New Mexi co for its dive rsity and inclusion initiatives. Requiring vaccinations would go against this.An analogy of this may include that persons above a certain BMI or persons with preexisting health conditions should not be allowed to participate in campus life because they are unhealthy and more likely to acquire and transmit illness or disease. The University of New Mexico should connue to ght against any type of discrimination and continue to move towards equality and inclusion. This equality and inclusion should include persons that are unvaccinated regardless of their reasoning. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 323 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; Page 2You ma y think that because I am presenng not mainstream media news articles that I consider them to be \"fake news.\" That is neither here nor there. It should concern everyone that news networks and newspapers are not covering every aspect of this issue. Is it not their duty to present all the facts and le t the public decide? We should not be told what to do, we should be able to make our own decisions and be allowed to weigh in on all the options. If all of these reports were false, would it not make more sense for the mains tream media to be ridiculing and presenting irrefutable data that would convince us that we need this vaccine? Because it's been a year and we all know that this virus has a 99.97% survival rate. If these alternative news sites are presenting \"fake news\" why are they being censured rathe r tha n laughed at? Because I would be more inclined to believe outlets like CNN if they were doing that than watch Mayor Bill de Blasio awkwardly eat a hamburger and trying to persuade NYC that if they get vaccinated, they too can have a free burger. If this vaccine were truly so safe and effect ive, I wo uld not need to be threatened or bribed. Also, if this vaccine was meant to completely protect the receiver, why did Bill Maher (leftwing political activist and comedian) contract Covid after getting both doses as well as six players of the NYC baseball team?hps://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2021/05/15/bill mahertestspositiveforcovid19coronavirus andisfully vaccinated/?sh=12e100837ebfNow let us move on to Dr. Fauci. Not two days after Senator Paul Rand crossexamined Dr. Fauci and it came to light that not only was Fauci's lab funding the Wuhan Virology Lab (corroborated by their chief scientist Dr. Shi Zhengli) over half of his own staff have not received the vacc ine and yet are allowed to continue working despite this.hps://nypost.com/2020/04/29/dr faucibacked controversialwuhanlab studying coronavirus/h ps://twi er.com/kerpen/status/13930227313739 73504So, you would potenally require this of me and my family members, but Dr. Fauci's own employees are safe from this requirement? Both of these issues should give us pause. This response is already too long, but Fauci has contradicted himself, gone back on his word, and made an overall mess of this entir e situ ation. On top of this, the evidence is clear: Texas' cases continue to fall now that they have fully opened and removed their mask mandate. Why is that? Why are they doing so well? I doubt it is because the entire population of Texas suddenly got a vaccine. And why has Florid a done so mu ch better than NY this entire time despite almost never locking down and never having a mask mandate? Numbers can be scarier note, there are two instances that I would like to bring to your attention. One is that of a Texas State Senate Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 324 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment hearing about the tests that were run on the vaccines before they were released to the public. I will link both hearings here. I HIGHLY suggest that these hearings be prioritized above everything else I have shared. It is very disturbing.h ps://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?clip _id=15926h ps://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?clip_i d=15934 Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 325 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; Page 42)Wha t about those who cannot physically get the vaccine? Will UNM condemn them to a life of online isolation and treat them like a pariah whenever they go to campus? Will you discriminate against them? If those people are not afraid and willing to take that risk, should it not be up to them whethe r or not they engage with so ciety? Or will UNM take a paternalist approach and treat them like uneducated children and decide for them what's best for them? Because I thought when the Conquistadors did that with the Native populations in the 1600s that was considered a bad thing.3)Why did UNM not require a vaccine (which Bill Gates did develop) in 2007 with the outbreak of HIN1, which the CDC has stated as being far worse than Covid? Dr. Drew, who got the virus and treated it, has to this day, stuck to his stance that the media has cr eated a false narrative of hysteria that does not justify any of these extrema measures to that was considered healthy. (FYI Fauci and the CDC have both confirmed there is no such thing as an asymptomatic spread.)h ps://www.israelna onalnews.com/News/News.aspx/ 286920 One nal issue that I am going to bring up is how those who will submit the religious exemption paperwork. Plain and simple, UNM has no right to forcibly quarantine me or test me against my will. It's illegal and you know it. Public health emergency does not equal law. There is no law stating that you have the ri ght to do this. Let me ask this: is UNM going to start forcibly testing students for STDs regularly? STDs can lead to HIV, which is a HORRIBLE way to live and eventually die. Will you start monitoring student's sexual activity? If you open up this door , where does it stop? At what point does UNM say, ok that's outside our authority? If I start feeling like I was coming down with something, I will stay home. Just like I would with any other flu or virus. Getting sick is an excuse to stay in bed and watch movies all day. Why would I come to campus and potentially spread anything? Does UNM not think I'm capable of being an adult? We also all know now that masks make no difference in limiting the spread see link below.hps://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20 6817The mainstream media is also censuring this report. So, there must be something credible in that study about how useless masks are. UNM is creating an atmosphere of modernday segregation by separating vaccinated and nonvaccinated. UNM is one of the better universities when it comes to inclusion and being sensitive to diverse backgroun ds. What if a large portion of Latino students or Native students do not get it for their own personal reasons? Are you willing to open yourselves up to the claims of discrimina on? Because you know that will happen.I am a Ph.D. I have been at UNM since 2012. I cannot express what this university means to me. I received a dual bachelor's and a master's here. And now I am trying to get a degree that less than .5% of the Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 326 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I am against UNM making the C19 vaccine mandatory. If UNM does, I will be withdrawing from my Ph.D. program. This is an invasion of our medical privacy as well as reckless, dangerous, and irresponsible. On their website, OSHA has updated their guidelines to state that if anyone is seriously inju red or dies because an employer required them to get the vaccine, that company is liable, not the pharmaceutical company. If anyone (God forbid) died under UNM's policy or was seriously injured, UNM would be open to a lawsuit. Also, I would hope that UMN knows that it is illegal to re quire a vaccine that has been distributed under a EUA and designated for emergency use only. The FDA has not approved any of these vaccines so potentially UNM would violate the law. If even one life was lost, would that not be one too many? It has been repo rted during a very recent Texas Senate hearing (https://tlcsenate.granicus.co m/MediaPlayer.php?clip_id=15926) that there have been an estimated 4k deaths from the covid vaccines. Does UNM want to add to that number? What about all of the countries worldwide that have paused AstraZeneca because of the blood clotting issue? It is unacceptable and scary to think that UN M would require something that could potentially be more deadly than a virus with a 99.97% survival rate. Also, if this vaccine were truly so safe and effective, I would not need to be threatened or bribed; Mayor Bill de Blasio awkwardly eating a hamburger did not pers uade me I need this shot. And why did Bill Mahar contract it after receiving both shots? It has recently come to light that possibly the manufacturers of the vaccine could potentially be violating the Nuremberg Codes. Doctors in Canada have signed a declaration stating that they are being threatened with the loss of the ir jobs if they discuss informed consent with their patients (https://canadianphysicians.org). Now let us move on to Dr. Fauci. Not two days after Senator Paul Rand crossexamined Dr. Fauci and it came to light that not only was Fauci's lab funding the Wuhan Virology Lab (corrobor ated by their chief scienti st Dr. Shi Zhengli) over half of his staff have not received the vaccine and yet are allowed to continue working despite this. So, you would potentially require this of me and my family members, but Dr. Fauci's employees are safe from this requirement? Also, Fauci has stated th at the masks were never necessary and that it was all political theater. If we are following his lead, then UNM has no right to enforce a mask mandate. Additionally, if masks were effective why has Texas just reported no deaths since they lifted their mandate two months ago? Should not have everyo ne died if they're not wearing masks? A few closing thoughts: if an African American student declines the vaccine because of the history of the Tuskegee Experiment, will you be willing to open yourselves to claims of discrimination? Because that is precisely what UNM would be doing, by \"othe ring\" thos e who don't--and in some cases CANNOT get a shot due to medical reasons--get the vaccine. Discriminating. Why did UNM not require a vaccine in 2007 for H1N1 (which Bill Gates did develop)? When did \"Asymptomatic\" become \"sick\"? In 2019 that was considered healthy. (FYI Fauci and the CDC have both confirme d the re is no such thing as a Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 328 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment symptomatic spread.) One final issue: UNM's proposal of how it will single out and discriminate against those who will submit the religious exemption paperwork. Plain and simple, UNM has no right to forcibly quarantine me or test me against my will. That's illegal and you know it. This is modernday segregation. Public health emer gency does not equal law. There is no law stating that you have the right to do this. Do not treat us like children; paternalism is bad. Give us the freedom to choose what we think is best for our own health. We are capable of taking care of ourselves and th e community. If you infringe on our community, this will hurt UNM. Bottom line. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;Texas and Florida have clearly shown that the whole covid lockdown and masks and mandatory vaccinations do nothing, because they required none of that and opened back up and they have low rates of infection and texas has already reported days with zero covid deaths. I have no idea how you think you can mandate a nonapproved vaccine with a very high VAERS reporting rate. If this was actually a pandemic, would the death rate have changed ZERO? no. If you don't mandate the flu vaccine, which is FDA approved and causes serio us il lness including in people of college age, unlike Covid which has a 99.97% survivability in people under 65, why would you mandate a covid vaccine? You're playing politics with our health, and withholding our education from us if we don't comply. Thats not equitable. Thats not inclusive. That's bullying. This policy is junk. It does not include a philosophical objection. why is that? because someone having power over there own bo dy to make their own choices is somehow wrong, but a religious exemption is okay? Do you understand how backwards this policy is? Whatever happened to \"my body my choice\"? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I think that requiring vaccinations is a safety threat to young adults and infringes on a persons rights to informed consent, this is a major step in the wrong direction. I do not consent to being a test subject of big pharma who have repeatedly shown a lack of concer n for the safety of the public. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;As an incoming transfer student, I am scared that the vaccine will be mandatory for everybody.I do not appreciate someone telling me what to inject into my body. Let it be my choice if I want to get vaccinated or not. Especially since this vaccine has only been FDA authorized. If UNM makes it mandatory for student and staff members to get the COVID19 vaccine , I will reconsider attending UNM. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 329 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;UNM should not require students to be vaccinated in order to return to class. This is extremely illogical and an all around bad idea. If an individual feels that they are at risk of covid complications, or that their life is in danger, nobody is stopping them from getting the vacc ine. If you say anything otherwise, you are contradicting yourself, because if the vaccine won't protect people who have it then it is not effective at all (that's the logical sequence I am following). I have had the virus, and I did not have a single side effect. Because the vaccine is so new, and the long term effects have not been studied, I would prefer to stand my natural immune chance against a virus that felt less impactful to my body than allergies. I am wring to request that you please not require (FORCE) individuals to be vaccinated upon return to campus. If you don't want it, you should not be required to get it; if you feel at risk or would like that vaccine, then just get it. I would prefe r to keep the medi cal dec isions I make, to myself. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 330 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; To UNM Administra on:First of all, I want to extend a hearty thankyou to UNM's administration for providing an opportunity for feedback on the proposed vaccination policy. Considering the opinions and concerns of your staff, students, and faculty instead of making a unilateral decision with no chance for discourse, debate, or opposition is to be comme nded . Because of this, I will make an effort to extend the same courtesy to you. Bear in mind that what I'm about to say may be uncomfortable to read. It's intended to be uncomfortable, but it is my heart's desire to deliver my thoughts to you on this in a way that is devoid of malice or ill will.I want to preclude my comments on this statement, rst of all, by telling you what I'm not going to say. I'm not going to cite any statistics about vaccine efficacy, or rate of adverse reaction, or the effect of masks at preventing transmission, or anything along those lines. Nor am I going to invoke an y legal argumentation, so there will be no court decisions referenced, no statute numbers, or anything of that nature. The reason for this is the widespread conflict and dispute over the statistics concerning this issue, and the fluid legal situation concerning mandates like this, both in this stat e and in others. Instead, I will focus primarily on the ethical question, which, I think, is the root of the problem. I will refer to the Patient's Bill of Rights, as it is used to provide guidelines for ethical treatment of paents.The Paent's Bill of Rights speci es the right of the patient to refuse treatment, which is closely tied to the necessity of informed consent before treatment can begin. This means that a doctor presents a treatment option that he believes will be effective for the patient and must include the ben efits, costs, risks, and side effects that may arise from the treatment. It is then up to the patient to decide whether or not he wishes to partake of this treatment, if he wants a second opinion to see if treatment is even necessary, or if he wants to explore al ternative treatments. This holds up a high principle among human ethics; namely, the right to bodily autonomy. It is not the doctor's decision what happens to the body of his patient. The patient must first agree, because it's her body, and she has ultimate jurisdiction over what happens to it. It is particularly unethical to coerce someone into accepting a medical treatment. If you consult your dictionary, you will find the verb \"coerce\" defined in the following manner: \"to compel by force, intimidation, or authority, especially without regard for individual desire or volition\". UNM administration, let me be as blunt as I possib ly can: restricting access to campus facilities for unvaccinated people is a form of coercion. If you commit to the proposed draft policy, you will have effectively held the education, and by extension, the future, of your students in jeopardy. You link their medical condition directly and inextri c ably to their education. This is a decidedly unethical way to practice medicine, as you have added nonhealthrelated factors to a decision that is primarily focused on the health of the patient in the first place. You use your authority to threaten the education of your students who are rel uctant to be vaccinated, and you completely override their say in the matter, despite the fact that it's not your body to make a Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 331 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment decision over. On top of that, I remind you that you are in no position of authority over your students, staff, or faculty that overrides their own bodily autonomy. You are not the parent of these people. You are not the owner or slavemaster of these people. You are not even the doctor of the se people. Based on this, I have two questions: first, does \"my body, my choice\" no longer apply? Under what conditions is the right to bodily autonomy suspended? (Continued in second comment response) Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I do not think it will be in the best interest of the school to publicly mandate vaccines to all students. Many people have differing views regarding the vaccine and forcing everyone associated with the University of New Mexico to take the COVID 19 vaccine should not be the place of an instituti o n of higher learning such as UNM, where people of different beliefs, races, experiences etc can come together to promote learning and knowledge with another one. It is controversial to mandate the vaccines to everyone who wants to go to school and will make it harder on tho se who do not want to take the vaccine for their own reasons (medical, religious, personal, etc) to pursue their education in peace. Please consider. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 332 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;Religious Page 3Both are ve ry long, but there are two main things that I hope very much UNM will take under advisement when considering their policy on this vaccine requirement. 1) The animal test was discontinued when the animals started DYING. They stopped all testing and then turned the vaccine out to the public when the animals were dyin g. The doctors (all medical doctors, these aren't just average Joes off the street) said they'd never seen a clinical trial stopped when the animal test subjects started dying and then be turned out to the general public. As the Texas legislature accurately says, \"The Am erican people are now the guinea pigs. This is the test program that is going on. They didn't do the human testing and they stopped the animal tests because the animals were dying. And then they turned it out for the public.\" HOW IS THAT OK? Is UNM truly going to partak e in this test ing phase? 2) I will just quote the Texas Senator: \"As of 2021 we've had more Covid 19 experimental vaccine deaths than all the vaccine deaths for the 15 years between 1997 and 2013 . . . In 1976 over 45 million people were vaccinated for the swin e flu a mere 15 peop le died . . . but the program was immediately halted because it was considered too risky. . . We've had approaching 4000 [deaths] with the Covid [vaccines].\" That should be an unacceptable number. UNM is potentially going to require something that has killed that many peop le? Are you willing to add to that number potenally? And remember, UNM will be liable for those deaths.Another issue that goes hand in hand with this hearing is a medical Declaration signed on 30 April 2021 by a group of Canadian physicians that, among MANY other things stated that because the vaccines are being pushed and patients are not encouraged to give their informed consent before receiving it, the compa n ies, as well as those who administer them, may violate the Nuremberg Codes. Which in case it's not clear what that means I will quote them here: \"The Nuremberg Code, drafted in the aftermath of the atrocities perpetrated within the Nazi concentration camps--where horrific medical experiments were performed on inmates without cons ent--expressly forbids the imposition of any kind of intervention without informed consent.\"These Canadian doctors claim that they are being threatened if they attempt to discuss all of the pros and cons of the vaccine with their patients they will be fired. I can't imagine what would happen to institutes like UNM if it did come to light that the manufactures of these vaccines were in violation of codes that were put in place after one of the worst genocides in human history. Let that sink in. The full article, as well as the Great Barrington Delectation which spoke out against lockdowns and vaccines for this virus, can be found here:hps://canadianphysicians.orghps://canadianphysicians.o rg/wp content/uploads/2021/05/Great_Barrington_Declara on.pdfThe re are other issues that only menon in brief:1)The Tuskegee Experiment: will UNM be willing to discriminate against an African American student that submits the religious exemption paperwork because they are nervous about getting something that Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 333 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment could potentially repeat that horrible moment in history? Will you be willing to force them to become \"other\" because they do not want to get an experimental shot? Because that is precisely what you will be doing. Discriminating. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 334 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; Picked up from previous response:And second, if this right can be suspended, what could possibly give you specifically the right to supersede it with a vaccine mandate, which, by design, is intended to have effects that extend far into the future? Again, I remind you, you are neither parent, owner, or doctor of the peop le tha t attend this university, so from where do you derive your authority to mandate\u2014not recommend, not suggest, not even strongly encourage\u2014but mandate a medical procedure for your entire population? Even if we forfeit the principle of bodily autonomy under certain conditions, what right do you have to mandate an ything related to your population's medical conditions, since, to the best of my knowledge, you lack a license to practice medicine?Now, I will cut o the counterargument here, namely, that \"my body, my choice\" doesn't apply when there are other people involved. In other words, if I am not vaccinated, then I could infect someone else, so therefore, the mandate is justified. This is true, but the critical component of the sentence here is the word could. I could do a lot of things. I could infect someone else if I'm not vaccinated, and that person could become critically ill and die. But, by the same token, I could get in a car accident one day while I'm driving to or from campus next semester . It's possible. It hasn't happened yet, but it could, right? Your vaccine mandate's logic would dictate that this possibility be treated in the same way, and that I would need to show my driver's license to a police officer before I get in my car every morning, but even that do esn't remove the possibility of death by traffic accident. This is effectively the same as jailing people before they've committed a crime out of the fear that they might do so one day. It's unjust and unethical. Now, someone might choose to live a life cut off from soci ety as much as possible out of the fear that they might commit a crime, or choose to drive as little as possible to avoid getting in an accident, or choose to take a vaccine to avoid infecting others, but these are all decisions made by an individual person with his own part icular scruples and concerns. You might consider them a little strange, sure, but it honors the innate dignity of all human beings to make their own decisions without duress. The proposed mandate does not do this. It presumes that you, the university administration, know what's best for every single stude nt. Agai n, I will be as blunt as I possibly can: you do not know what is better for your population's lives than they do, and to assume that you do is blatantly fascistic and tyrannical. In the case of requiring a long lasting or permanent medical procedure from them, it is also incr edibly unethical, as described above. I understand that you are moved by a desire to keep the people at your university safe, and I applaud your sentiments, but ultimately, the safety of your students, staff, and faculty is not up to you. These are adults that you are dealing with, not ch ildren. They are capable of performing a risk analysis for themselves, based on their own information, their own research, and most importantly, their own conscience. Treat them with the respect that they deserve, and let them make their own decision. (Concluded in 3rd response) Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 335 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Impact to Enrollment;I think it is wrong to require a shot that causes so many people anxiety and worry. We are all about my body, my choice until now. Many would be happy to continue wearing a mask and social distancing and are much more comfortable with that than a shot that is not FDA approved or that has gone through long term studies. I worry attendance rates will drop dramatically at UNM... Especially when other states are not requiring the vaccine at public universities. Will all classes be offered in person and online to accommodate those who refuse the shot? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Impact to Enrollment;I don't think it is a good idea to require this vaccine to participate in normal student activities. This decision would isolate so many students who aren't comfortable with getting it for whatever non medical or religious reason. Not all classes that students need would be offered online as well, so those students may need to come in pe rson. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Religious Accommodation;I respectfully express my strongest disagreement with the proposed policy of mandatory vaccination requirements to attend class. This is based on personal, religious, beliefs, and the disregarding of individual rights. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Religious Accommodation;Students should have a choice. If they do not have the covid shot they should have to option to wear masks. This is unfair to those students and faculty members who refuse the shot due to religious beliefs. Covid Vaccine should not be mandatory to aend college courses. Student Opposed to Policy Religious Accommodation;If it's against my religious beliefs to be vaccinated, will I still be forced? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 336 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I already submitted feedback, but recent data for adolescents is alarming and also makes it clear that the FDA should not be trusted. We all know that the virus is not deadly to anyone who is in remotely moderately good health under 40 or even 50. But let me make my case with some more recent data.Trials in adolescents 1215 years old found 4 or 5 serious adverse (they did not disclose what exactly those were) reactions to Pfizer while only 1 in the trial group had such a reaction and only a little over 1000 kids were in each group. Addi tiona lly, 35 of the Pfizer group had fevers of 102103, and one over 104. A total of 3 placebo participants had fevers of 102103, and none above that. 41 of the Pfizer group reported \"severe\" fatigue, compared to only 12 in the placebo group. Similarly, 25 of the Pfizer group reporte d \"sever e\" chills, and only 2 in the placbeo group did. And what did the FDA do? They approved its use for 1215 year olds, despite no public briefing book or real safety data otherwise to speak of. Why? Can you show me anywhere that young adolescents, close to the age grou p of UNM, are high transmitters of COVID? Or that they're likely to have major symptoms themselves? And why should we trust the FDA's judgments at all when they're making decisions like this?Tell me what more data you need on this to show this requirement is a terrible idea for college students. Faculty over 50? Sure. Let them get it and their symptoms will be significantly lessened, and the side effect profile for the older demographics appear to be much better. The immune systems of college age students, however, are more than enough to 1) defeat COVID easily, and 2) cause heavy side effects from an experimental treatment. For those who have a deficiency in their immune system, let them get the vaccine on their own as they most likely already have.Everyone truly at risk who wants the vaccine has gotten it and has protection therefore, the only people this requirement applies to are those who the vaccine poses a far greater risk than COVID. You might say \"they can spread it\" to who exactly? Most of their fellow students aren't at any risk, bu t some definitely might, and those who are at risk would be my concern as well but they're most all vaccinated now (and certainly would be by the start of the fall) and can deal with COVID safely. \"We don't know they can deal with COVID,\" you might say so the n why require the vaccine if its effectiveness is so questionable that someone who's gotten the vaccine might not have any protection? \"It's mostly effective, but a few people don't get that protection\" who are these few people, and are they really more valuable or numerous than the people who will suffer major si de effects as a result of the vaccine? (Please let me know if the words in quotes don't accurately represent the thought process of the Board of Regents and President Stokes I don't want to strawman.)The President's Weekly Perspecve that just came out said that \"if you wanted to meet at the Duck Pond, or on Johnson Field, you were in masks, sitting six feet apart.\" Honest question have any of you actually been on campus over the past 68 months? Because nobody has followed any sort of so cial distancing protocol since last summer. Well over half of people I Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 337 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment see on campus aren't wearing masks. And guess what we haven't had an outbreak or a death as far as I know. Because we know that life does not revolve around COVID any more than it revolves around colds or the flu. This past year has not just \"happened to us\" it was because of us. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety; DO NOT PASS THIS POLICY .This is a ridiculous policy. This is sll an extremely experimental vaccine. It is ridiculous that a brand new vaccine that is not FDA approved is being so heavily pushed on otherwise completely healthy young people anyway. To withhold the right for students to attend classes, visit the bookstore, study at the library, or even receive basic assistance from any UNM program JUST because they have chosen caution is completely ridiculous. Do not discriminate against a healthy minority who refuse to take this risk.This policy is unacceptable. DO NOT PASS THIS POLICY. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 338 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Privacy;Concerns I strongly oppose the adoption of a proposed policy of MANDATORY COVID19 vaccinations by the University of New Mexico on a number of grounds. To begin, all of the COVID19 mRNA injections or vaccines have received only an authorization of emergency use (EUA) by the Health and Human Services (HHS) Secr etary and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Under an EUA, individuals must be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not to receive the product, i.e., \"consent.\" Furthermore, much remains unknown about the safety and efficacy of these vaccines, and even though clinical trials that the FDA will rely on to license th ese vaccines are presently underway, these trials are designed to last for approximately two (2) years in order to collect adequate data to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these products, i.e., \"informed.\" For an employer, or in this case, an educational institution, to adopt a policy of MANDATIN G that the ir employees/students receive an EUA COVID19 injection/vaccine is in direct violation of the Nuremberg Code of 1947, which states that \"informed\" and voluntary \"consent\" is an absolutely essential condition of an \"experiment\" on a person, and that the \"experiment\" should be based upon data obtained in labora tory studies on animals, combined with knowledge obtained of the history of the development of the disease or other related/connected issues. Since these injections/vaccines are not yet fully approved by the FDA, individuals MUST have the option to accept or decline the drug. To require, i.e., \"MANDATE,\" that employees/students must receive an \"experimental\" vacci ne as a condition of their continued employment or education is coercion and is not permitted under the Nuremberg Code, which is recognized by and is enforceable in U.S. courts. Finally, it is also of great concern that because of this \"MANDATE,\" people will be required to divulge person al med ical information, which is not permitted under HIPPA law. While I fully support a recommendation that employees/students receive the vaccine, the choice of whether or not to partake of the drug MUST remain with the individual, based on professional, ethical, and lawful standards and regulations that are already set in place. Thank you for your time. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 339 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice; From 3rd comment:Finally, I will remind you of one more complexity in this scenario: all laws or mandates are ultimately backed by threat of violence, up to and including the death of the perpetrator. Consider the following: you implement this vaccine mandate. One of the students at your university ignores it and comes on campus anyway . You find out about this. What do you do? Disenroll him? He comes in anyway. Send campus police after him? He refuses to cooperate, citing his bodily autonomy, and that being a student at a university does not rob him of that right. Do you arrest him? Wha t crime has he committed? Who has he hurt? What damage has he done? Yes, you've made your mandate, but is it a just mandate? If his sentence were to make restuon, who would he have to repay?What if he resists arrest, and dies because of it? Simply because he held to his bodily autonomy? What if he's a person of color, killed by white police officers simply because he believed he had a right to come to a school that he paid for without surrendering his right to control what happens to his own body?Is that something you're prepared to face? Is that a speech you're prepared to give? That the black man is dead because he wouldn't follow the mandate that you put on him?Free choice carries none of this concern. It simply allows people to choose as they will, and deal with the consequences of their actions. You as the administration are immune to any of the implications of your students choosing as they see fit, since you played no role in those decisi ons one way or the other.Therefore, you stand upon the edge of a knife. Presented before you are two options: preserve the freedom of everyone who comes to your school, respect their individual decisions, and uphold the right of every human being to make their own medical decisions without outside coercion, or sacrifice the bodily autonomy of thousands of your fell ow human beings \"just to make sure everybody is safe\" and plunge your institution into a fascistic, authoritarian mockery of medical ethics and human dignity.How would you prefer to be remembered? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 340 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Concerns about Safety;I want to highly object to this policy. From my understanding, if/when a vaccine is FDA approved or licensed I'll be penalized for not getting one.(Per the FQA \"barred from inperson access... , and may experience consequences as a result.\")While I understand that keeping cases down is the goal, you are asking students to make a fundamental and life altering decision go through with a vaccine with unknown repercussions (20, 30, 40+ years down the line) or get a higher education. Universities are already 'out of reach ' for some in the sense that they have to choose between taking loans that could cripple them financially for years should they not be as successful as predicted or going straight into the work force. Considering that there isn't any true idea what this will do to the body over the long term studen ts and faculty are risking being potentially severely disabled from vaccine sideeffects that are yet to present themselves. The vaccine alters the DNA to specifically target aspects of the Covid19 virus it messes with one's biology and that is all but impossible to predict accurately becau s e of the many factors that influence how one's body will react to certain treatments and situations. If someone isn't 100% certain on their decision to receive one, or doesn't want to get one, it isn't anyone's right to force someone into that decision. The whole idea of human rights is that some one else's rights stop when they're impeding on others'.It also pushes students toward lying as a result. If someone (like myself) who is uncomfortable with getting the/a vaccine, desperately wants to go to University but doesn't fit into a 'reasonable accommodation' category, they'll be pushed toward claiming beliefs or attempting to get falsely diagnosed with a qualify ing disa bility to receive approval. That is opening the door to scholarship fraud, academic fraud and all kinds of other lies.As it stands, the grand majority (precovid) of classes were inperson. There were very limited, near none, or flat out no online options. The only way for this proposal to work in my opinion is to have the classes be online as well. As an art major, my classes are rarely if ev er offered online this proposal the way it is would be catastrophic to my education. Even if students have extra work to be online vs in person that would work out for every one. Not only would it allow for the college to take more students in rem ote learning, but those who are vaccinated and are in agreement with the proposal still get the most important aspect (limiting/keeping nonvaccinated students o campus) of the proposal implemented.Something like having the teachers livestream/zoom the lectures for those off campus, then having those students somehow document what would be the rest of the in class time (such as for art, recording or periodically taking pictures with a mestamp to turn in).Being 100% blunt and honest, there is nothing in this world that could force me into the decision to take the vaccine. Nothing. As it stands, I refuse to be one of what are essentially test subjects for a vaccine that has unknown side effects; tho se that are known are more than enough to turn me away. (changes in vision, anaphylactic shock in some cases, and so on.) My career doesn't require a degree, I'm simply taking classes to quicker learn Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 341 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety; Hi,I'm sure many people have brought up this concern, but what if there are long term side effects to some of the vaccines? It's not possible to know if in a few years it may begin causing issues. I recognize the odds are low but the goal is risk mitigation. There is a large perc entage of people getting vaccinated and I think it is important to recognize that this is essentially a large scale human experiment, and whether someone chooses to get the vaccine or not it is a gamble either way. In this \"pick your poison\" scenario I'd personally be more likely to get the vacci ne if it's not required. I think there is value in allowing people to take the risk they are most comfortable with, because again they are gambling with their future. Thanks for your considera on Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;As a student of UNM, I am deeply concerned for the viable enforcement and utility of this vaccination policy for both Sta/Faculty members as well as students like myself. I would like to highlight in the Draft Policies' second paragraph under the headline Purpose: \"Enforcement of the policy will be delayed until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves/licenses regular use of at least one Covid 19 (SarsCoV2) vaccine.\" While there is much debate around these treatments these days, I would like to call upon the integrity of UNM's medical department to consider this matter. Recognized UNM's own decision proposal, there has been no trustworthy regulation set in place by the FDA for the use of th e various vaccine treatments for Covid 19. Maintaining all educational standards with rigorous attention to the likelihood of success of UNM's students, I am disappointed to see UNM loose their integrity with their students by this proposed vaccine requirement. Without integrity to trust students to make decisi ons about their own health, their community's health, and their own doctors' advisement, how will UNM maintain integrity in New Mexico through this requirement placed on students to get access to their education? While appeals are graciously allowed in ADA Accommodation, \"If a covered individual cannot receive the Covid 19 vacc ine due to a qualifying disability/serious medical condition or medical contraindications or precautions recognized by the FDA or CDC...\" May I emphasize, as stated previously, according to UNM's own recognized standards, that the FDA has not approved or licensed any vaccine for regular use. If the FDA can not appro ve of any va ccine for regular use at this moment, may I ask how students, faculty, and staff, can put their trust in any vaccine? If any individual can not put their trust in these vaccines available, how can we put our trust in the University of New Mexico's decision to restrict access to educati on and job stability by way of a vaccine requirement?I would ask UNM to reconsider the impact and actions of this policy decision. I would ask UNM to consider the long term credibility they will hold with current students, prospective students, and their current and future staff if this policy would go into effect. This is not the New Mexico way, and this is not the standard for th e University of New Mexico. Consider doing better, for New Mexico, and for our communities' trust. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 343 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;I am apprehensive about a mandatory vaccine as a requirement for in person learning. I am approaching graduation, and most of my classes would not be offered on line as well as in person. I am reluctant to get the vaccine until such things as FDA appr oval and more inf ormation about its safety are brought forward, and I do not want my personal health concerns to affect my academic life if possible. The purpose of a vaccination is to artificially create herd immunity. This can be done without 100% involvement. I would begrudgingly get vaccinated to complete my degree, but I ask you to rec onsider making a vaccination a requirement instead of a strong recommenda on. Thank you Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;As a future UNM student for the upcoming fall semester, I am adamantly against a COVID vaccine mandate for a number of reasons. I will not, under any circumstances, be taking the vaccine, and a vaccine mandate is currently a major factor on whether or not I will attend UNM. I ha ve a family history of severe autoimmune diseases and I have my own immune diseases in the form of several severe allergies which I fear may be worsened by a largely untested vaccine. Furthermore, current research on the vaccine from multiple sources has revealed that there are risks to my age gr oup that may outweigh the benefits. An Israeli study observed that the vaccine may be linked to myocarditis among males 16 to 19 years old, which the CDC has recently confirmed (the committee has acknowledged 1200 cases in 1624 year olds). The World Health Organization recomm ends that young peop le not take the vaccine at all. According to the VAERS, as of June 11 there have been 352,386 adverse events and 5,993 deaths following vaccination. And as the vaccine is a fairly recent development, no one actually knows what the longterm consequences will be. Frankly, as an 18yearold in good health , I'm at a pretty low risk of suffering from COVID should I contract it and as most officials are unsure of whether the vaccine would prevent the virus's spread, I see no point to getting the vaccine at all. And finally, I don't like the though t of not having a choice in whether or not I take any substance (recommended or otherwise), a sentiment supported by the Right to Refuse stated in the first principle of the Nuremberg Code. I hope you reconsider your stance on forcing people to take vaccines that they do not want. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;As I understand it, religious exemptions may be applied. How is this process accommodated for by students wishing to attend classes in person? Are these students going to be segregated? On line only?What is the policy on keeping a students medical history private. Are students to present their vac card everywhere they go? That is a violation of privacy. How are you going to prove vaccinated vs not. My personal preference is that it not be mandatory. Vaccinations are not mandatory for kids to be in school and religious exemptions apply and are accommodated. Students aren't singled out for their preferences. I feel any policy of this sort leads to discrimination and would hope UNM would serio usly reconsider this as many other universities have. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 344 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;I am hesitant to submit this because it is not something I enjoy talking about or acknowledging, but here I am. My family has /very/ strong feelings about the COVID vaccine.I live at home with my parents and am not in a situation where I can comfortably move out (moving out would involve me using my college money.) They are very against the vaccine, so much so that I am under the impression I would be kicke d out if I went and got the vacci ne an d they found out. (I am also closeted so this is another thing I am avoiding them finding out about and thus probably getting kicked out over.)I understand the importance of the vaccine, but if I were to get it, I believe I would be kicked out. If it is mandated at UNM, they would unenroll me from UNM and have me get a full time job or go to college elsewhere. (Or this would be the point where I would have to nd a way to move out myself.)I am aware that I have a unique case (at least I believe) and that I am revealing a lot of personal information to UNM, but I just wanted to express my situation instead of sitting here waiting to see what UNM decide s to do. I'm also aware that I am a fullblown adult and that my parents should not affect me to the extent that they do, but living in their house does, unfortunately, limit a lot. I wanted to put my case out there, I doubt anyone else is in the same situation I am, but maybe other people are and are also scared to speak up about their situation. I hope you guys have enjoyed my oversharing of my persona l life and wi ll consider that maybe some people out there are in tight situations that don't allow them to get the vaccine without turning their entire life upside down and over a cliff. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint Having a covid vaccine requirement is just ridiculous. Hope you can't actually just force every faculty member at UNM to take it. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint I do not support mandatory vaccinations. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 345 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint The vaccine is not FDA approved. EUA is not approval. EAU is not approval and again EAU is not approval. How in the world could you mandate a nonapproved medication for everyone? Do you have religious or contenous objecons?The vaccine is rushed, VAERS reporting shows severe issues across the population and using the CDC's own numbers even if I get Covid19, I have a 99.997 chance of surviving it. Look at the numbers the states with the highest rate of vaccination have the highest rate of inf ection and deaths. States like Texas and Florida have decline rates and ZERO mandates. This is all just aside from the fact that the drug companies made the gov shield them from liability. Look at how many fines (deep in the billions) they have paid, a lot of them punitive based on wanton and grossly negligent behavior. They poisioned baby powder for 40 years before finally admitt ing th ey knew for a long time that it caused cancer. This is just cigarette science 2.0. This is media driven fear. I could type a 100 page sources cited dissertation on this but we all know UNM is just going to follow lock step in with what MLG and her handlers want. sincerely, Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint Requiring vaccines is really awful. We are not science experiments we are people. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint This guidelines are ridiculous and should be illegal Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyImpact to EnrollmentUNM, I will not be receiving the vaccination, and I do not support the motion to make it a requirement for oncampus enrollment. This vaccination is NOT FDA approved. An EUA by the CDC is not the same thing as FDA approval. As a woman in her early 20s, not know ing how this vaccination will affect things like fertility, is nerve wracking. Not nearly enough research has been done on it regarding things like ferlity. I can tell you that you will be losing enrollment, not only by me, if this is enacted, and I know that you have been losing it already. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint If you make me get the vaccination I will not attend UNM for graduate school. I will head out to Florida. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI do not feel comfortable being administered a vaccine that has been around less than a year. In my opinion not having an option to receive the vaccine is wrong especially because there is no long term research on it. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 346 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint Do you really think it is safe to force a community to take a vaccine that would be deemed illegal to the CDC if we aren't in a \"crisis\". There is a reason as to why an mRNA vaccine has never been passed by the CDC and I think it is ridic ulous that this policy has to even come up. Also, the people pushing for this policy clearly have not read anything about how the vaccine works. Even if you are vaccinated you can still transmit the virus so what the point of pushing for a vaccine that will only help people who have terrible immune systems. You should be pushing for a healthier lifestyle, not a drug that could cause longterm harm to the users. If this policy passes and students are forced to take a vaccine against their will, you should at least implement an immunity pass for students who don't feel comfortable or are clearly more than healthy enough to go without the vaccine. And since i didn't include any actual data in this post, I wanted to compare covid deaths to murder deaths in ABQ. More people in the state of New Mexico are murdered each year co mpared to covid deaths. But I don't see a mandate for bulletproof vests, or any sort of action to decrease crime in our state from UNM. This policy is clearly not about saving lives or protecting others, all this policy will do is show how much leverage a nongovernment entity has over citiz ens. It's not UNM's place to force this upon students, if our government forces us to then so be it but UNM has no place in this matter. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint Hello,I am a current graduate student at the university. I am unable to take the classes that are needed to obtain my degree online. If there is no offer to take all the same classes online as there was during the height of the pandemic, then there should not be a force to be vaccin ated. All the students who want to continue their education in programs that they started before the implementation of this policy will be forced to get a vaccine or delay their degrees because UNM is not offering an alternative to the facetoface classes that are needed to obtain a degr ee. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint;It is wrong if there is no peer review. As a medical research university, there should be more than blindly following others. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint;I am vaccinated personally but don't think students should be required to be vaccinated. The University should recommend unvaccinated (or not fully vaccinated) students and employees where face coverings. Making vaccinations a requirement will definitely minimize the number of students enrolled at UNM. In general students are typically young and not within an atrisk categ ory, e.g. where the covid 19 virus could result in death. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 347 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Health AccommodationI recently had a medical issue and I worry that this puts me at risk for side effects and other health problems related to the vaccine. I have already had issues with the ARC association on campus being less than helpful. Would my inability or aversion to getting the vacci ne prevent me from getting access to school events, and facilities? I do not want my disability to be the reason I have to switch schools Student Opposed to Policy Impact to EnrollmentI was looking forward to attending the main campus in the Fall, but no longer. I will now be applying to NMSU, and hopefully, they will choose not to require a covid vaccine. Student Opposed to Policy Impact to Enrollment Religio us AccommodationI will not be getting the vaccine just so I can attend school, it does against my religious views and my rights as a US citizen. If it becomes mandatory I will transfer to a different school. Getting the vaccine should stay a choice for all students and staff and no one shou ld fe el pressured or threatened to getting this vaccine. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 348 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Impact to Enrollment;I wrote in over the weekend, but hit the character count. My main 'gripe' I did not get to address previously is with the FAQ moreso that the policy itself and if one refuses to participate. It states: \"Efforts would be made to encourage participation by receiving education and either receiving the vaccine or declining the vaccine after receiving an approved exception or medical exemption. Those who, following these efforts, fail to participate entirely, would be barred from inperson access to university facilities and programs, and may experience consequences as a result.\"The main piece of this that is bothering me is the 'encourage participation by receiving education'. Going to college comes with the expectation that one is going to be getting that. It is no different than saying one is encouraged to work by getting a week ly pay che ck that is the expectation and (un) spoken agreement. Students go through an entry process and PAY on the expectations and agreement that they'll be receiving an education once accepted. Universities are made solely for that purpose there is nothing else that a student can recieve that is fractionally close in value to what they are being asked to spend.There is no other way to look at the situation than a student's education being held hostage (which they're paying for) if they disagree and being forced to take a vaccine unless they can get one of the few 'reasonable accommoda ons' that has been listed.The other part is the word/phrasing of \"may experience consequences as a result\". Consequences is 'a result or an effect of actions' usually with a negative connotation. Here in this context the usage of consequences reads as a threat of \"Do what we say or else\". In conjunc tion with education being used as an item of encouragement, that leads to the conclusion that students won't be given what they have/are/are being asked to pay unless they obey. Students would then be penalized multiple times over not being allowed on campus (especially if their classes are in person only ), being denied the education they're paying for, along with whatever other unnamed consequences are to come up should the policy pass.It is forcing the students into the posion of either: being forced to take a vaccine they don't want (if they don't meet a 'reasonable accommodation'), lying to get into one of those categories, going to another school (and being forced to pay extra in housing and travel if they applied to UNM as their local university), dropping out, or completely forgoing college/university if they are fresh out of high school. None of those options are ideal for anyone especially not the colleges/universities. Like I mentioned in my other submission, that opens the door to fraud, but also to a drop in enro llmen t . That drop in enrollment would impact the programs' funding and availablity should the drop on enrollment be statistically significant which being barred from in person programs was one of the specifically listed consequences of refusing.The main summary of this is that this is such a huge policy change for something that will (hopefully) be something under relative control in the near future. If there aren't any accommodations considered or put into place for those who don't Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 349 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment wish to participate, the school is unfairly forcing students into a corner and only giving regards to the fraction of the student body who wish to abide by these guidelines. Student Opposed to Policy Religious AccommodationAs someone who was living in shelters throughout high school and had no family or home outside of the dorms, someone who is devout in his religion because it was one of the ways he coped with not having this family or position of privilege getting into university l, you can imagine how alarming it is to hear about it all being threatened to being taken away over a covid vaccine when I've followed every single other requirement and safety protocol. It's quite insulting to hear that we essentially have no choice and if my accommodations paperwork gets rejected I would lose e verything. You guys should reconsider this policy because it's really worrying as someone who doesn't have a home outside of the university.\"just taking the shot\" is tantamount to saying that the religion I lean heavily on for my well being and mental health throughout eating disorders and losing my family is not worth anything to me, only some shot is. Student Opposed to Policy Religious Accommodation;I am Messianic (that is, my faith combines Christian beliefs with Jewish practices) and, as such, I am strongly opposed to this policy. Some Christians believe that COVID vaccine is the mark of the beast. While I, myself, am unsure one way or the other, the fact that I am unsure makes me want to avo id it at all costs since I would rather be safe than sorry. I do recognize that \"not\" taking a vaccine leads to a different kind of risk: namely, catching COVID. But, on a balance, I would rather risk getting sick here on earth than risk going to hell for eternity, since eternity is a lot longer than the me here on earth. I have already applied for religious exemption against that vaccine, in case the policy would get passed, and I am really hoping they will grant it for me. However, the fact that there is no guarantee that I will get the exemption that I requested, and also the fact that it might not cross everyone's mind to apply for one, I believe that this policy is unfair because it infringes on religious freedom of people on campus. So I really hope that yo u will not enact this policy and leave the vaccine to be on voluntary basis. Since enough people are willing to take that vaccine voluntary, one might argue that the herd immunity can be reached without making it mandatory. The other option is to give people a choice between wearing a mask and getting a vaccine, so that the people that are opposed to vaccine can simply connue to wear the mask.I really hope you will consider either these or some other options, in order to protect the religious freedom of Christian students on campus. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 350 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAbsolutely not! If this becomes a requirement I will be withdrawing from the university and receiving my education elsewhere. Me not having a vaccination does not impede on others who have it and want to. The vaccine works by giving immunity to those who wish to have it. By me not having it doesn' t lessen those who do's immunity to the virus. Along with taking my education elsewhere, once I receive my degree, my skills will be taken to a different community and will not serve the one who impeded on my rights from the start. I'm honestly disgus ted that this is even a thought. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;I do not think that UNM should require anyone to be vaccinated. That would violate the rights of citizens to not be able to decide for themselves if vaccination is right/wrong for them. In turn, to not allow the students/staff to attend classes is just denying people the oppo rtuni ty to seek higher education. Student Opposed to Policy General Complaint UNM should not mandate vaccines until vaccines are FDA approved. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI disagree with this policy it's not fair to force this vaccine on anyone it's not FDA approved. No student should be punished for not wanting to take the vaccine. This vaccine does not protect anyone from getting the virus or transmitting it. The gas not been enough time to insure the safety of this vaccine. What if a student dies because they were forced to take the vaccine? Are you going to pay the students family for pain and suffering? I disagree with this policy and don't think I should have to move schools because UNM can't respects someo n es decision on this. Especially being a student for 5 years. If want to keep the students safe make them wear a mask and social distance. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about EnforcementConc erns about ProcessImpact to I couldn't disagree more with forced vaccinations of students. I agree that vaccinations are a good thing however forcing them on people is removing a freedom from the students. If this bill goes through how will UNM track vaccination status? The logistics alone seem ludicrous and I could easily see UNM fur ther raising tuition to put needed infrastructure in place. I don't believe many students will respond well to this bill and it will only act as a reason to NOT attend UNM.If you want to diminish the already decreasing student population this bill is the way to go. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about PrivacyI do not want to share any of my medical information including which vaccines I have taken with this university, and as such entirely reject any requirement to be vaccinated to be on campus, as enforcement of these requirements will require disclosure of such information. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 351 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Privacy;It violates student and faculty HIPPA rights to require anyone to be fully vaccinated to attend school. I am a fully vaccinated student but it is unbelievabibly wrong to demand people get vaccinated to recieve a higher education. I would be shocked and would start to consider a different schoo l if this goes throu gh because this completly violates our rights to choose to get vaccinated and HIPPA rights. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Privacy;I have a problem with showing my vaccine status to the University of New Mexico, but I will do so under protest. I think that we should do as much as we can to protect the privacy of our Lobo Pack. To me, the demand to see our vaccine cards shows a fear on the side of the University of their students, faculty, and staff. Because, if a person is already vaccinated, then there is a unlikely chance of contacting Covid19 or obtaining a severe case of it. This is also the same of those who have had thei r influenza vaccine. My elderly aunt, several years ago, did get her flu vaccine, but got a mild case of the flu later in the season. I personally feel confident being on campus with Covid19 because I am sure about my vaccine status. And I have been on campus throughout the whole pandemic with out problems. I am a graduate student and I have performed human research for my graduate work and I have been through the Institute Research Board training. I feel that conducting research on your student body and staff is the same as human research to investigate a medical question that you, the univers ity , might have. By demanding that we publicly show our private medical information, the University might lose its accreditation from the Human Research Protection Programs. The University of New Mexico is a Research University. The University requires that professors, graduate students and staff conduct research. We do much of our research on human subjec ts and we need to protect any new human subject research we do in the future.Please reconsider demanding to your students, faculty, and staff to show our medical information for the Covid19 virus.Thank you for your considera on Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 352 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment every person on this planet a liar, or is there some truth to these claims? But what I want UNM to consider is this: is one destroyed life worth you mandating something that I know a large portion of the population is against? What if (God forbid) a young person died? Or what if they experi en ced such physical damage that they couldn't carry on with school? Not one of these companies is liable if anything adverse happens. UNM would be. Again, see the OSHA link above. No amount of money could ever undo such damage, however, parents or family members would be open to a lawsui t against the university. Seeing as UNM is already a struggling school, that does not seem like an issue that the university would want to potentially face. But more so, the loss of even one life should be enough to make you rethink this policy. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ProcessWhat is the legal basis for requiring vaccinations? Isn't this a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and federal law as the University accepts federal funding? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyThe COVID 19 vaccine is classified by the CDC as an experimental, there is no evidence to prove it's safe long term. Given this vaccine is experimental, I don't believe it is ethical to make it mandatory for staff, faculty and students. I believe everyone should have the right to choose whether or not they want to vaccinate. If this policy goes into eect, will there be online options for students who do not want to get the vaccine? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyFor this being such a new vaccine with no idea what the long term affects are, how in the world is it appropriate to make it mandatory? A person should not be \"required\" to obtain this vaccine if they want to further their education. Especially a vaccine that is not FDA approved. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyYou shouldn't require a vaccine to resume in person classes.. especially one that's only emergency use authorized and not even fully approved by the FDA. Not every student at the university subscribes to Western medicine and a university comprised of our demographic should be aware of that. Faculty should learn to be sens itive and accepting of alternative modes of health. Besides, as of the CDC website at this current moment, the only thing the CDC can assert is that the vaccine reduces symptoms but there's insufficient evidence at this moment that states that the vaccine prevents Covid. Let your stude nts ex ercise freedom of choice while their government still allows them to do so. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyHow can the University or any institution require vaccinations when they are listed as EUA? I understand we have a global pandemic, but seems very experimental to require one at this point, especially with billion dollar companies being exempt from any lawsuits should their product be proven defective. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 354 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety To Whom It May Concern,I am a student and research assistant at the University. UNM's proposal to force students and staff to take the experimental COVID vaccine concerns me. Should this become the policy, I plan to discontinue my assistantship and graduate studies. Three of my younger siblings are currently at the Univ ersit y or plan to study at the University, and they would find a different school if the experimental vaccine were mandatory. Medical choices are personal. Individuals should feel free to make these decisions without fear of discrimination or discontinuation of their education. It should be the right of each individual to partake or decline in the experimental COVID vaccine.Thank you for your considera on.Sincerely, Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI don't think the vaccine should be mandatory because we don't know enough about it yet and there still a chance it'll be a yearly required vaccine. I'm fine with masks for now but if I have to I will get the vaccine. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety;I am currently a freshman and soon to be sophomore. I wasn't able to physically go to school at UNM and I am very excited for August because I will be able to finally get the full college experience. There is one hold back, the requirement for the vaccine . The long term c onsequences are not yet known and I don't feel comfortable putting the vaccine in my body. This is my body, I feel as thought this requirement is going against my rights. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI would be heavily opposed to having the vaccine as a requirement. Having a history of bad reactions to past vaccines. I'm not comfortable taking the vaccine that hasn't been out at least 12 months. I believe unm should have a heavy mask requirement of course and have guidelines of social di stancing just like restaurants and stores have . I know many people who are uncomfortable with getting the vaccine so soon and would be devastated if we were to not be allowed to attend UNM and finish our degree if we didn't have the vaccine. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about EnforcementI do not believe that this should be a requirement for inperson learning if all other vaccinations do not require proof as well. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI am against mandatory vaccine. The primary reason is that these vaccines have emergency authroizations. When these are lifted by FDA and when they are approved after following their normal procedure, I will be more confident. I dont want to be the puppets where these vaccines get tested. I under stand that there exi sts a pandemic and I am doing my part by social distancing anf wearing a mask. If you want I can take classes from home since I am not vacvinated. But this should not be made mandatory. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 355 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Safety This fall will be my last semester at UNM.I don't believe any vaccine should be made mandatory at all, especially not until it is approved by the FDA. There are few legal protections in the case of a vaccine injury, so it is a high risk in taking something that legally protects corporatio ns, not in dividuals. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyThis policy is absolutely ridiculous. You cannot require students to get a vaccine that is still new and we don't know the long term requirements. They should not even need a reason beyond \"I do not trust it yet\" as an excuse. Do you require everyone to get a flu shot ? Didn't think so. This is completely unnecessary and many kids will be attending online instead of you want to employ this absolutely ridiculous policy. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyThis is a absolutely wrong and goes against bodily autonomy. As a former student pursuing a nursing degree, UNM will not be my primary choice of school. This vaccine has not been FDA approved, it is experimental, and still in trials. It has had over 2,000 deaths and thous ands of adverse reactions reported to VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System). For this to be a requirement is shameful. If anything should happen to students or faculty for UNM requiring this, I hope you all are held liable. Shame on you all and I will never pay tuition/support this. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI do not feel comfortable with this proposal. There has not been nearly enough research on this vaccine. So how am I suppose to get an education if I can't even go to school . This is ridiculous. I have never taken the flu shot and have never had the flu . If it is such a problem and the vaccine works so well then other people getting the vaccine should be enough. It doesn't make sense, even if a person does get the shot they can still contract the virus. I do not think it is fair for those who do not feel taking the vaccine. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyI don't think it's fair to require students to get the vaccine in order to get an education. I've already had COVID19 and I'm fine and I just want to go to school to get my education. For one it's not even approved by the FDA yet and it hasn 't ev en been in testing for that long and I don't know what kind of long term affects it's going to have. It's my body and it's my choice and if UNM is going to require me to get the vaccine to get an education then I am more than wi lling to take my money to another college. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 357 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyAs a student I personally feel as if I should not be subjected to getting a vaccination that has most definitely not been around long enough for us to understand the possiblity towards later life side effects. I understand the desire to want everyone to be safe and trust me I agree. But I per sonally do not feel comfortable with the vaccine just yet, and I feel as if it should be up to me when I want to get it without my education being at risk. Especially due to the fact that attending a university is not free. I have to pay for it wi th my own money, and it makes me feel really nervous about the entire situation. I am a person who practices social distancing (especially in environments where there are people who I do not know), and I wear a mask in any store/restaurant/etc., that I go into. I personally find it should not be forced. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyHow to y'all expect to mandate a vaccine that is not even approved by the FDA? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about SafetyMy son has accepted a Woodward scholarship and plans to enroll in the engineering dept in fall of 2019. However, upon hearing that UNM is considering a vaccine mandate for enrollment, our family is considering cancelling his acceptance and enrolling in a school that will not mandate the current covid vaccines. We consider the vaccines to still be experimental, due to the fact that their longterm effects are still not known. Our family has a history of severe autoimmune diseases and immune issues, with my son having multiple food allergies (he's anaphylactic) with asthma , but the se conditions are still not considered contraindications of receiving the vaccines by the CDC. In fact, the CDC website only states that \"no data are currently available on the safety of COVID 19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions\". The UNM vaccine policy draft as currently worded will not allow him to be medically exempted from geng the vaccine. The naonal VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) database has recorded 3,544 deaths and 12,619 serious injuries between Dec 14, 2020 and April 23, 2021 due to the covid vaccines. Although this is a small fraction of the millions who have received the vacci ne, we do not wish to take the chance of being one of the few who may be at risk of suffering these irreversible and lifelong adverse effects. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 358 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Hello, I am a rstyear student here at UNM and am now looking to leave UNM. I am looking to leave UNM because of discriminatory policy of mandatory vaccination. I believe in the freedom to choose my own health care actions and by enforcing this policy you are infringing on my right to choose. I was lookin g to get a master's degree in mechanical engineering at UNM, and now, do not know if I want to pursue even a bachelors at a school that is so far gone to their own agenda and pushing for less freedom in the student body. I am di sappointed that those that push for \"my body my choice\" and are now not allowing for me to make the same decision. It is my body and therefore my choice to decide whether to receive a vaccination or not. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI feel as though this proposal is a violation of a UNM student's right to have free choice of their body and health. There are a variety of reasons for a student to be wary of, or medically incapable, to get the vaccination. Though the draft proposal states that the re would be no need for students to display their vaccination status there is alot of verbage in the proposal that indicates that students who are not vaccinated would be at risk of having another year of college experience taken away. This seems to imply an ultimatum that students who are, for whatever rea son, wary of the vacine (medical or personal) must decide between putting their lives or their educaiton at risk. This concern cannot be understated and seems like a violation of students ability to make thier own health decisions. I love this university and do not want to be forc ed to leave and seek a college experience somewhere else because of this proposition inhibiting my ability to enjoy college and my health. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI personally hope that the COVID19 vaccine will not be required. Majority of the student body has received the vaccination, while the other either has had the virus or has a healthy immune system. I fall into the group of has already had the virus therefore making it equiv alent to reviving the vaccine while the virus has been through my blood stream. Many students are like me and are against the vaccination, because we already have the antibodies to fight the virus if we were to catch it once again. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI do not think it's fair to mandate vaccine requirements. You guys have absolutely no idea if there will be side effects in 510 years. Hopefully there won't be, but if there is, if this causes infertility or any other long term side effect, people could potentially su ffer because you mandated a vaccine. The flu vaccination is not mandatory, covid vaccination shouldn't be either. For those who feel comfortable getting the vaccination, and if masks and vaccinations work, then why should those people be worried about contracting covid? I absolutely am not getting vaccinated, I also alread y had covid in April 2021. I will leave UNM if this becomes a requirement and exceptions are not made. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 359 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choicegetting the vaccine should never be required to attend classes. that's taking away the right to a students education, for someone who does not want to get the vaccine. someone like me, i would never get the vaccine even if a school required it Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI believe the vaccine should not be mandated. The University of New Mexico is already facing lower enrollment rates every year and mandating the vaccine will exacerbate that trend. I also believe the overwhelming majority of New Mexicans are on pace to be vaccinated, therefore, encouraging the vaccine but still all owing freedom of personal choice is best practice. It aligns with, \"My body, my choice.\" movement ideals. Taking a less forceful approach and focusing on a more positive educational approach seems more appealing. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI absolutely do not approve of the requirement of vaccines on campus. I believe that there will be high percentages of student and faculty vaccinated by the fall semester. Placing any requirements on vaccines is taking away peoples right to their body, and as a campus I believe we are ab ove that. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choicewhile i understand i have gotten other vaccines in the past as a baby, those vaccines took years to develop to be effective and safe and i am now 18+ and believe it is my body my choice of what goes in it. i will do everything else, (mask up , social distance and quarantine, etc)in my ability to stop the spread of covid with out getting the vaccine. i am not comfortable putting it into my body with out adequate amount of research in my opinion. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThe Covid19 vaccine should NOT be a mandatory requirement. COVID19 has less than a 1% mortality rate. As a public university, UNM should not be limiting the rights of students and staff. Everyone should have the right to make their own choice to receive the vaccine. How dare this university violate this freedom. How dare this instuon force anything on an individual. The mandating of this vaccine is immoral and dangerous. The movaons of UNM are not trustworthy.Even if an individual receives an accommodation based on \"religion\" they will have to be under surveillance and testing and possibly even more \"safety\" requirements? This is discrimination. Period. This is retaliation against those who plead their religious constitutional right. Bullying will occur to these individuals. Unfortunately this mandate is where I draw the line. If this proposal passes it will be my deal breaker. I will not further my education here. I will not get my Masters here. I do not recommend UNM to anyone because they are abusing their role as a publi c university. They do not care about education. Please go to a community college, out of state, NMSU, or NMT. Not everyone is a lobo. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 360 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI don't think vaccines should be mandatory to attend in person. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think that it should be up to each individual person whether or not they chose to get the vaccine. Making it mandatory to pursue your education should not be up to the school but each student. I understand that making it mandatory would help protect many student who go to UNM . But I pers onally have a few anaphilactic allergies to medications and have been recommended by my doctor to not get the covid vaccine because it could induce anaphylaxis even on the first dose which could mean I risk my own life for the vaccine and still not be able to finish both shots and actually be vaccinated. I am still attempting to continue my education at UNM but if the covid vaccine becomes mandatory in order to attend I may change schools. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI do not agree with making the vaccine mandatory for students, staff, or facility. It is very important to uphold personal choice. If this mandate goes into effect it will affect minorities' higher education. Please take this into consideration. I recommend sending all students a survey too! Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceWhile my personal opinion is that everyone should get vaccinated, I do not think the requirement should happen. I think people need to do their own research and come to their own decisions about getting the vaccine. I do not think a public university should be able to dictate a person's he alth choices. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThis policy would violate our constitutional rights to bodily autonomy. As is preceded in the Supreme Court cases Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), McFall v. Shrimp (1978), and Roe v. Wade (1973), an individual's rights to bodily autonomy are protected within the U.S. As was also decided in the court case Cruzan v. Di rector (1990), a competent adult has the legal right to refuse medical treatment. I strongly oppose this policy on the primary basis that I am the sole person who decides what health care I receive, not an academic institution. I am in no way an antiva xxer, I know vaccines are effective at safely preventing diseases. However, the decision of heath care is not one for a university to make. The University needs to back up, take a seat, and shut your mouth because you don't own our bodies and you don't get to make health care decision s for us. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIf UNM goes forward with the proposal to mandate the Covid vaccine in order for students to return to learning, then I will unfortunately have to look elsewhere to finish my studies. It is unethical to mandate a vaccine onto students and the faculty as a whole. No one should be fo rced to get a vaccine that they do not want or cannot get. Please do not mandate this vaccine! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 361 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI love the diversity of the University of New Mexico. The diversity of New Mexico in general is something that makes this state the state I love. I believe that requiring one to get a vaccine to attend the University of New Mexico is unfair and inconsiderate to those who have st rong beliefs against getting the vaccine especially in today's fragile climate. I am all for wearing masks and being socially distanced and with my job I have to enforce it every day, but I believe that something that is injected into your body should be a perso nal choice based on ones own beliefs, not ba sed on whether or not they can be able to attend in person schooling. Furthermore, students pay thousands of dollars a year to attend this University, and giving those same students an option to not be forced to inject their body with something just to get an in person co llege education should be taken into heavy consideration. I am so proud of how we have handled covid19 so far, but this proposed vaccine requirement is a step in the wrong direction. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI don't think we should have to choose between getting the vaccine or taking classes online or else where. It's hard for some people to get the vaccine because they don't know how it's going to affect them like if they have lip injections it doesn't work well and ca uses irritation and inflammation in those parts of the body as well as it can hurt the chances of somebody wanting to become pregnant or is pregnant and could cause a loss of a child and I don't think it's fair that you're forcing this on us when it should be our ch oice and we shouldn't have to change schools because we chose not to get the vaccine. For as much money as we pay for tuition we shouldn't be forced to take classes online if we chose not to get the vaccine. Even some medical professionals are also advising peop le not to get the vaccine. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think requiring vaccines for students and staff is an abuse of individual rights that are protected by the law. In my opinion, it is not the university's business whether or not someone chooses to receive a vaccine. If vaccines become required, expect to lose students. Flu vaccines have never been ma ndated and Covid vaccines do not need to be mandated either. I believe this to be a huge overstep by the UNM leadership to control people and their lives. I personally will be transferring if this goes into effect. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Do not enforce this policy. This who have chosen not to receive the vaccine due to personal concerns, caution, or otherwise do not deserve to be discriminated against and refused services. Those who have refused to receive the vaccine do so at their own health risk and do not pose a risk to other vaccinated persons. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 362 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs both a senior student and current staff, I would not continue with my schooling semester at UNM if this policy was approved. I will not be forced to take a vaccine I fundamentally disagree with. I will find a different place to graduate/work if this happens. I strong ly suggest you don't make it mandatory, this is still a free country and this is not an action a truly free country would enact on. This may be a blue state but there are still plenty of conservatives and republicans that WILL NOT get this vaccine by choice. Definitely not by for ce. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceNo, I will not attend if vaccination is a requirement. No, a public institution may not require such a medical procedure as a condition of service. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceDo NOT forcibly require students get this vaccine \"or else they can't learn for the school they pay for.\" Students pay for this school to operate through tuition and fees and we don't even get a say about what we inject in our bodies for a flu that has a 0.00 5% chance of mortality for people aged 1829? I'm more likely to get hit in crosswalk on campus. If this follows through, I will not be going to grad school here at UNM, I will gladly go somewhere else. Let people who want to be vaccinated take it, and they will be protec ted. Let the people who don't assume the VERY LOW risk of even contracting it. What happened to \"my body, my choice\" Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoicePlease do not make this vaccine a requirement, there are people with religious, cultural, and health related issues that go against this vaccine. I for one can't get the vaccine because I have been prescribed an epipen, people with those are among the population who are recommended not to get the shot. I can't keep doing this online, it's too difficult, I'm really struggling, I really need to be back on campus. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 363 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs a student at UNM, I STRONGLY OPPOSE the idea of a mandatory COVID vaccine for students. First of all, it's inconsistent with the science behind virus's which is that they are constantly mutating to become resistant, making continual new vaccines for each strain necessary for full protection. Just as the flu virus is a vaccine th at must be taken each year, the COVID vaccine will need to be redeveloped and readministered on a semiregular basis to be effective. Second of all, the COVID pandemic is moving towards a model similar to the flu in which the threat to society is present but easily manageable. Making this vaccine mandatory is not necessary. Third of all, the COVID vaccine is a relatively new technology that currently requires a double set of shots and can cause severe adverse reactions. For individuals such as myself with extreme phobias of needles and inje ctions, this is a very mentally challenging situation. I personally am waiting for a vaccine to be developed that can safely be administered in one dose with no major side affects. Until this is is possible, I will not be receiving the vaccine because of my severe phobias. Fourth of all, assuming eve ryone can get the vaccine is extremely classist. Even in New Mexico where the vaccine is readily available for adults, simple issues like transportation or having the financial stability to take off work for a whole day to recover from the vaccine can inhibit a person's ability to receive it. Fifth of all, I believe that an indi vidual has a right to chose what happens to their body. Bodily autonomy is an issue of great importance to me, and I as well as most other people value having autonomy over their own bodies. This would be a breach of the Univeri sty 's rights to our bodies. I know that I as well as many other students feel extremely uncomfortable with the mandatory COVID vaccine proposition. Personally, if the University decides to make this mandatory I will be transferring schools. This makes me uncomfortable. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThis is one of the most asinine policies that I have read throughout this pandemic. I am not an antivaxxer, I am quite the opposite of it actually. I fully support the state and countries effort to get as many vaccines into the arms of people who want them as pos sible. With that being said, I DO NOT support the vaccine being a mandatory requirement for attending classes or having the ability to access university facilities. The age group of most students on campus is the least likely to develop severe complications from the virus unless a student has seve re health conditions, and those students were some of the first on the priority list to be vaccinated earlier this year. This potential policy strips peoples ability to choose what they want to put in their bodies, and shames those who would like to wait to see if there are any long term he alth effects from the vaccine before they get it. A policy like this strips people of their constitutional right to make decisions for their own body, and forces them to comply with an institutional policy that many people will not agree with. I am frankly disgusted that thi s is being proposed, and you all should be ashamed of yourselves. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 364 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI absolutely do NOT think there should be a vaccine policy. It is ridiculous to require students to take a new vaccine (if had been around a while, then maybe). Some students, like myself, will feel coerced into taking the vaccine rather than forfeit our education (or resort to strictly online) . Th is policy is the wrong decision for UNM. I understand that health and safety is important to the University, but this is not the best way to go about it. Those that want the vaccine can get it, and those that don't should not be coerced into getting it. Also think ab out those who cannot take the vaccine for health related reasons. Is the university really going to pry into their medical history? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI absolutely disagree with this draft. I don't think that anyone should be required to get a vaccine to be able to attend school in person. For many classes the inperson aspect is essential for quality education and to force someone to put something into their body to attain that is wro ng. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceREQUIRING vaccination is a violation of a student's civil rights and would cause students to drop school and impede on their graduation or disrupt them from completing their final semester(s) of classes. It defies common sense. If a person is ill they simply do not attend school. We have some how gotten into a bizarre habit of punishing healthy people that take care of themselves and have following protocols (even masks that hundreds of science study show simply do not stop the transmission). Students that prefer not to take the vaccine for any reason will be denied their right to finish schoo l and the college experience which transcends studies. Let's hope UNM does the right thing and does not violate civil rights. There will be lawsuits that will probably demand UNM reimburse them for all costs related to college since they would be denied. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice I am against requiring the Covid19 vaccine. It is sll not FDA approved and the J&J vaccine that is approved may go against some students religious beliefs because of the aborted fetal cell line.This age group is not at high risk.The people that feel they are high risk should get the vaccine and protect themselves. There is a 98%survival rate.We live in America and we should have freedom to choose what is best for ourselves. Thank you Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 365 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI do not believe students should be required to get the covid vaccine in order to return to in person classes in the Fall 2021 semester. It is against students, facility, staff, and all persons rights. This should be a personal choice, if someone would like to get the vaccine, do the resea r ch and get it. If they choose not to get the vaccine, do the research and don't get it. Students and other persons choose this school for the academics, not to be forced to get by a vaccine. As a member of the science community, having a ba chelor's degree in biology, I do not believe people should be forced to get a vaccine. Those who do not get the vaccine and decide to go back to in person classes also should not be discriminated against by being surveillanced. The draft states that persons can reject the vaccine for religious reasons, but would be monitored. This is discrimination, a person should be able to reject the vaccine even without religious reasons, that is their right. If you will not monitor those who receive the vaccines, then you have no right to single out others and constantly monitor those who decide not to tak e the vaccine. A person has the right to decide what they put into their bodies, food, drinks, drugs, and even vaccines. If a woman has the right to abortion, then every person had the right to take a vaccine or not to. My body, my choice . Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI do not think that it should be mandatory to get the vaccine. I believe that just sounds bad to some people. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about EnforcementConcUNM should NOT require anyone to be vaccinated to attend in person classes especially if there are no online classes offered for specific courses. The courses I am registered for in Fall 2021 (graduate classes) do not have an online option, I had to choose the inperson option. If UNM is going to have necessary precaution s in place (social distancing, masks, limited capacity), why is the vaccine necessary? Will UNM require everyone to get the booster vaccine every year like these vaccine companies are recommending? We were not required to get the flu shot or any other vaccine to attend campus in previous years. This is taking away the freedom of the students who want to pursue hi gher educaon and the faculty who are employed. Are there HIPAA concerns in forcing students/faculty to prove vaccination records? Will refunds be issued to students who already paid for classes if they are not vaccinated?Will faculty be terminated if they are not vaccinated?Will more online classes be available for students who are not vaccinated? Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;Getting a vaccine is a choice. Requiring it is a form of control and should not be implemented. Those who need the vaccine should get it, however those who do not want the vaccine should not be required to get it. Not being able to attend school due to not bein g vaccinated is not okay. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 366 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThis vaccine should be optional. Especially being that it is not fully approved just as an emergency authorization. Students that are healthy should not be expected to get something that they do not believe that they need. Getting the vaccine does not make people immune to this virus so if some one believes that they do not need the vaccine their actions only affect them and no on else. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI do not feel that it is ethical to force individuals to get the vaccine. It should be the individuals choice. It is not morally right to force people to get a vaccine that is new and has shown harmful side effects to individuals. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceIf the vaccine does not prevent someone from getting it, prevent someone from spreading it, still requires the person to wear a mask and social distance then what is the point of requiring the vaccine? I understand recommending it but I don't think the requirement is necessary. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think a better way to encourage full vaccination on campus would be to increase outreach and education about the vaccine along with incenves. An oncampus COVID vaccine drive, similar to a flu vaccine drive may bring out more people because of how easy vaccine drives are compared to making an appointment. If rules/laws allow, students and staff could report if they got the vaccine or not to the University. If they have not gotte n it, pestering emails and calls could help persuade them or address their concerns. These emails and calls should have relevant information addressing religious, health, and political concerns, and show how easy it is to get vaccinated. Incenves could include free stuff from the SUB or Bookstore or fun events exclusively for vaccinated people. Unvaccinated students/staff would be missing out on deals and excluded from social events that their friends may be going to, hopefully persuading them to get vaccinated. I don't believe someone's quality of educaon, and thus future, should be in jeopardy because they are too misinformed, brainwashed, or stupid to get a vaccine. UNM shouldn't punish people because they have been lied to. We need to remember that the point of vaccinating people is reaching herd immun i ty, which does not require 100% vaccination. There is no reason to punish a few idiots just to get to 100% when that isn't even necessary. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think it is not fair for UNM to force vaccines on anyone, including students. The university should consider giving students the OPTION of staying online in Fall 2021 or facetoface instead of forcing facetoface classes on everyone and then requiring them to get vaccinated. I do no t agree with UNM's Vaccine Policy in any way, shape, or form. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 367 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am registered to attend 2 inperson classes for the Fall 2021 semester. However, I do not want to receive the COVID19 vaccine. If the vaccines become mandatory, will there be online classes that will be offered so that I can take those instead? I only have 1 more yea r of college left and I don't want this vaccine requirement to affect my graduation date. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAs a UNM student I am disgusted in your new proposed policy. This shouldn't even be a thing that is considered. My health should be my business. I am paying a lot of money to get an education, and I am very capable in taking care of my own health. Sta and students shouldn't be coerced or practically forced into getting vaccines or being subjected to geng tested. People can have enough common sense to stay home if they are sick. What you should be offering is continued online learning for students who wish to pursue that option instead of going back and dealing with this nonsense.Enough is enough already. I never thought my education would end up in a quid pro quo situation. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think forcing anyone to take a risky vaccine that has not been fully tested and has been shown to have extremely debilitating side effects for some people is immoral and wrong. I am not anti vaccine in the slightest but forcing us to take a vaccine for a virus that ha s a 99 percent and up survival rate is foolish. Also the vaccine has not been fully tested in all regards such as long term effects and that to me is very important. Also if people want the vaccine then thats fine but I don't understand why I shoul d be for ced to get it if it doesn't even provide a complete immunity. i would hope you revaluate your decisions on forcing people to take a potentially dangerous vaccine if you truly care about the well being of the students. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Looking at it another way...Worldwide, in 2019 (a one year me span), there were 523 million cases of heart disease and 18.6 million deaths. This is a yearly occurrence, with numbers doubling over the last 30 years. No one has ever shown any interest in these death rates or in prevenng these deaths. In a one year me span, there have been only 150 million cases of Covid19 and 3.2 million deaths worldwide. This is approximately only onefifth (1/5) of the yearly heart disease cases and onesixth (1/6) of the yearly heart disease deaths.To hold individuals' future educaon over their heads and threaten them by saying they can't attend a university if they don't get a Covid19 vaccine (for an illness with a 98% recovery rate) is truly insulting and a clear violation of one's human rights.As an instuon of higher educaon and a source of knowledge, universities should be empowering individuals with the knowledge and critical thinking skills to freely make their own decisions instead of forcing them to conform to the misguided informaon provided to the masses. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 368 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceOur human body is the most sacred thing that God has given us. Our body has to do with dignity. If we cannot make an informed and personal decision about our bodies, I think our dignity as human being is violated. Please reconsider mandatory vaccines policies. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceDon't discriminate on the basis of private medical information. I don't want to be treated differently because of my personal beliefs. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice Hello, I am emailing you today regarding your aempt at making the covid19 vaccine a requirement for students and staff. Mandatory vaccination is discriminatory and as human beings, we have the right to make our own medical choices. Forcing a vaccine is comparable to forcing someone to practice medicine without havi ng a license. Is this what UNM is encouraging? What about individuals who have already had the virus and have natural immunity? Aren't we all entitled to make our own choices for our own health as we see t? As an individual who has family who attends school at UNM and someone who has been considering furthering my education at UNM, I am strongly petitioning against a move like this. This policy would lead me to disenroll and cause us to not participate in supp orting UNM in any way. Please consider the personal choice and decisions of others and the affect your decision will have on our community and our local economy. Thank you for your consideration. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI do not believe forcing students to receive the vaccine is the way the university should take. 60% of New Mexico will be vaccinated by June or July, meaning when classes start, the state has decided to relax any and all restrictions. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceNo. I think the vaccine should be highly recommended but not forced upon students to return back to school. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceHello. Respectfully, I am writing to please ask that the vaccine not be required, at the very least not for students who are commuting to campus and do not use campus housing. I understand recommending that people get the vaccine but I do not see how anyone can forc e someone to get a very new vaccine with little research on its long term effects. I do not personally feel comfortable getting the vaccine right now because there is limited research on it. I think It is against good American values and doesn't even seem legal that someone can be forced to get a vacci ne. You are discriminating by whether someone has injected something in their arm or not. I ask that you please respect my choice and others choices and respect their confidential medical history by not allowing this proposal to go through. Whether or not I got a shot that may or may not preve nt me from spreading COVID19. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 369 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think that the vaccine should not be required and that we should be able to decide ourselves if we want to get vaccinated. Those who want to be protected will go get the vaccine and that is fine but it should not be forced on everyone. Thank you fo r your time and consideration. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAbsolutely terrible idea. If you require the covid vaccine, you MUST require ALL vaccines. There is no \"fairness\" in this. Flu shot needs to be mandatory as well as polio/tdap/hep b/etc. you're proposing to take away health freedoms from those who pay to be there. If you end up requiring it, you need to lower tuition costs for those who make the choice to attend online. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI believe that because this university is government funded and willing fully takes federal grants which are meant represent the entire population of students and staff, it is unethical to force every member of the community to get vaccinated in order to earn an education or maintain a job. By doing this not ever y community member's beliefs and personal life choices of how they chose to care for their own body is represented or even given considera on; \"My Body My Choice\". This policy states \"eorts would be made to encourage participation by receiving education\". From this line, in its simplest form, this university is stating that even though the state of New Mexico and the U.S. Federal Government are not requiring each citizen get vaccinated (it is of their own volition if they ch ose to), for paying students to continue to receive their education and work towards their diploma they must bend to the will of the university; and if they don't oh well too bad you are no longer allowed on our campus and your countless hours and hard earned money spent here are wasted.If the university proceeds with a mass mandate requiring every member of the community to receive a vaccination (with the only counter arguments being medical or religious conflicts) or their job and diploma are on the line, then this institution is not worthy of government funding or accreditation. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI will not and do not want to take the vaccine. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 370 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThank you, UNM for your efforts in trying to keep all student, faculty and staff safe. I write to express my opposition to the proposed COVID Vaccine requirement. I believe that the decision to get vaccinated is one that each individual must make on their own without commandee r ing from the university. I believe a much safer alternative would be to offer students the opportunity to decide between coming to campus or remaining remote. (We have been remote for a year, I believe we can continue to be remote). My desire to remain remote stems from my understanding that co vid19 strands continue to mutate and while there is a vaccine known to be somewhat safe and effective, this vaccine is not one known to protect us from future variants. Let's not put our guard down just yet. Thank you for reading my comment. Thank you also for caring for our health and safety. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about Choice;As we all know, this past year has been one I think we would all love to forget. Covid has effected us in ways we never would have thought. I am pleased to see the university taking action to make sure campus is as safe as possible. With that being said, I stro ngly disagree with the proposed mandate to require vaccines to attend in person classes for the fall semester. I believe that recommending them and trying to be as safe as possible is smart in this time, but forcing someone to have a shot for covid goes agai nst the freedoms of the staff and students on campus. The university does not require a flu shot to aend classes. Additionally, if this proposal is passed, it is only reasonable to have the university waive the online fee for classes, so that the students that do not wish to get the vaccine, have an alternative that will make everyone feel safer in the end. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI would hope UNM takes into consideration peoples personal rights on what they put into their own body. Everyone attending UNM knows the risks into entering in person learning. The fact of the matter is we DO NOT know any long term effects on the body. I have been following a study on how the vaccine is effecting women's menstrual cycles that was never previously reported as a symptom. I am begging you do not make the vaccines mandatory. The state is expecting 60% vaccinations by June and the state to open so doing this makes no sense for Fall semester in Augu st. Keep masks mandated as it does not enter into your body and alternate anything. Thanks. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 373 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyWhile I understand the impulse to require vaccination to return to \"inperson classes,\" I would ask that some restraint be shown in this area. Considering UNM has not required any vaccine to simply attend school in the past, this is an unprecedented move that has potenally alienang consequences. I am not an anvaxxer, I am not a right wing conspiracy theorist. I do believe in science. Because I believe in science, I recognize that the COVID19 vaccines are potentially miraculous, as they are a development of new technology. That being said, this new technology has no t gone through anything close to long term studies on the affects it might have. No matter what our institutions tell us, this is a fundamental part of drug research and glossing over this is irresponsible. There are many students here at the UNM who will consider the risks of not knowing the long term data of taking the vaccine and take it anyways, and that is perfectly okay. There are other students who will consider the risks and want to wait out of caution, and that should be okay too. Many will do so for personal reasons, religious reas ons, and skeptical reasons. Let us not forget the history minorities in this country have with government promoted \"medical\" treatments, which understandably cause many to rethink their trust. Denying the student body access to education and enriching their future should they choose not take a vaccine that they may not be comfo rt able with is wrong, and I feel compelled to call it as such. If what our instuons are telling us is true, that the vaccine is highly effective at both preventing the spread of the virus as well as contracting the virus, we should encourage those who would like to get it, to get it, and allow those who ar e not comfortable with it, to wait for the time being. I ask that the University of New Mexico show respect for bodily autonomy in the sea of confusion. Thank you. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyGiven the multitude of uncertainties about the vaccine, I, alongside many others especially female, are very nervous to take the vaccine with the major contender being the shockingly high risk of sterilization. While the campus needs to be at a healthy vaccinated population, I think the vaccine should still be encoura ged but not mandatory Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 374 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHow can you attempt a mandate for an unlicensed biologic? Under OSHA's updated COVID vaccine policy, you requiring the vaccine makes any adverse event or reaction to the shot a reportable event under the CFR. Will you put in writing that you are responsible for all legal and medical costs if there is an advers e reaction? The vaccine inserts are also blank, so there is no true informed consent. This is coercion in a sense for students who have no choice, but to live on campus, have scholarships or faculty who need to keep their job. There is no reason to requi re this immun ization or make students request for accommodating courses when many courses aren't offered online. I have one semester left and will be withdrawing formally and attending another institution of this is the case. Regardless of 'exemption' options this is completely unnecessary. You could teach proper health/nutrition and hygiene instead of mandating an unteste d/unlicensed biologic that has proven to be ineffective. From personal experience I have family & friends who have gotten covid after being fully vaccinated. I highly encourage you to reconsider. This segregates students & cheats many out of the already overpriced state education you offer. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 376 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyThis vaccine policy is well written and presented. However, there are several considerations that should be made prior to enforcing this. I am a student who attends this university, and I am also currently working as a licensed nurse in the state of New Mexico. While the safety and health of the studen t s, faculty, and community are important, this vaccine should not be a requirement. There are obvious benefits to getting this vaccine, however, I am very hesitant to get it. I think that vaccines are incredibly important and necessary, but I do not feel comfortable with the idea of getting this vacc ine. I do not feel there is enough research and data that would make me feel confident in getting it. I feel like there is a lot of unknown about the virus itself and the potential long term effects of this vaccine. I am not saying that I would never get this vaccine, however, until there is more data, research, and knowledge on this particular virus and vaccine, I will not be putting myself at risk. I am still very young and have a long life ahead of me. I do not feel that the benefit of this vaccine outwe i ghs the risk for me at this point. If I were older or had more serious health conditions, then I would get the vaccine. This is not the case though. This is just my personal belief. While there are several students and members of the community who have received the vaccine, there are sti ll many people who do not wish to be vaccinated yet. I believe that this is something that people need to consider based on their own circumstances, rather than be forced into something they may or may not be comfortable with. This should be a personal choice not a requirement. I und erstand the desire of getting back to \"normal\" and \"bringing the pack back.\" I want this as well, but I will not put myself in a situation that I am not comfortable with because it's a requirement to do so. I think it is acceptable to encourage people to get vacci nate d and follow the CDC's guidelines, but it is not acceptable to require the vaccine. Whether or not this requirement is passed, I will remain responsible. I will continue the Covid screening process, wear a mask, get tested if symptoms or exposure occurs, and remain at home if symptoms or exposure occu rs. I very strongly feel that this should not and cannot be required. If I am not required to get the vaccine as a healthcare professional, then I should be required to get the vaccine to attend school. Here's another way to think about this situation. If I am not required to get the flu vaccine to attend school, then I should not be required to get the Covid vaccine to attend school. I realize that most people may be on board with this policy, but I know that there are many out there who are not. Please take this int o consideration before moving forward with this decision. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI cant state this enough I don't feel safe going back to campus even with forcing everybody taking the vaccine. I believe that is wrong in many ways our body our choice and we can choose to either take or wait on taking the vaccine. For my example I am still wait ing on my doctor to set a appointment to get my allergies tested and see if It is safe for me to take the vaccine because even before I have had many different allergy reactions to medication. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 377 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI don't think that it should be required to attend school. There is belief by the CDC that Herd Immunity will come into play if enough of the population gets vaccinated. It is a very new virus and new vaccine that we do not have sufficient information on long term effec ts. It's a new type of vaccine that very well could be better for us but we do not know how long it will last or the effects it will have after a year. I think that it's unfair to require a vaccine when normal vaccines like the flu or HPV when medical vacci natio n status is not required to attend the school before this. I understand that a lot of people are getting sick but college age kids are not the most compromised. We should be able to choose to be vaccinated and not be deprived of traditional education. Thank you for listening. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI must voice my opposition to requiring a vaccine to finish my degree at UNM. These vaccines are not FDA approved vaccines and I am unwilling to risk my health on an experimental mrna therapy. The vaccines do not prevent the spread of the virus. There have already been adverse side effects of the va ccine to members of my family including blood clots and pneumonia. The vaccine is also a result of abortion sourced stem cells which violates my religious conscious. If UNM adopts such a policy I will not comply. I am not opposed to vaccines in general but this on e is not safe yet. When it has passed the normal fda protocols I will be willing to take it. If the choice is a degree or my health, I choose my health. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth While I understand the University wants to be as safe as possible, I do not think that there should be a vaccine requirement policy in order for students, staff, and faculty to go back to in person. The vaccine is not even a year old and should not be required if a student wants to resume in pers on classes. We shouldn't force students to have to take a vaccine in order to experience the college life. There are also some people who cannot take the vaccines for a specific reason and we would be discriminating against those individuals by putting this policy into place . No on e is required to take the flu vaccine even though globally so many people die from it. I do want UNM to continue to be as safe as possible, but requiring a vaccine is not the way to go. I honestly think we can resume to in person classes st arting Fall 2021 by maintaining the mask mandate and having a one seat separation of social distancing while not requiring anyone to take a vaccine and discriminating against those who cannot take the vaccine. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 378 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth My son was accepted by UNM in engineering and plans to enroll this Fall. However, in light of UNM considering mandating a vaccine approved by the FDA only for emergency use authorization (EUA), we are reconsidering the University of Utah as Utah has passed a law to prevent vaccine mandates.Our family has a history of autoimmune diseases including my son. However, his conditions and our family history would not exempt him based on the current (and often changing) CDC recommendations. The CDC website admits that \"no data are currently available on the safety of COVID19 va ccines for people with autoimmune conditions\" As I read the proposed UNM policy we could not exempt our son.While all of the vaccines have been rushed into use due to the pandemic, the mRNA vaccines are very new technology and there has been no time to study the long term effects on a large sample size. That experiment is being conducted on the public this year, and it is unethical to manda te it (and perhaps illegal to mandate as EUA drug). A family friend developed narcolepsy after an H1N1 flu vaccine, which disabled him. While such reactions are very rare they are life altering. Those under the age of 25 are in more danger from the flu than COVID19, and we see no reason for my son to bear the ri sks of vaccination given his risk from COVID is so low. Those who are at greater risk can voluntarily get vaccinated. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyHealth I attended UNM for 4 years and had plans to return this coming year. I think that the proposed covid19 vaccine is absolutely ludicrous, unlawful, discriminatory, and all around completely wrong. I do not support this proposal, and rather I STRONGLY disagree that this is the way forward towards health as a commun ity. To withhold an educ ation from people who may have medical, religious, personal or genetic reasons to not receive this vaccine is so disheartening and messed up. To receive any medical treatment someone must be informed to its risks and side affects. This is such a new vaccine there is no way to predict the side af fects in the long term, and there have already been documented tens of thousands of negative and adverse reactions. People may not want to risk their life, or long term health over an experimental procedure and they should not be vilified, discriminated against or disr egarded for doing what they feel is best for their own bodies amd health. Even were the FDA to approve this \"vaccine\" to require it directly contradicts a persons privacy in regards to HIPAA and directly disregards the Nueremberg Code. I DO NOT CONSENT. I STRONGLY disagree with the universities proposal. I urge you to stand in solidarity with ALL individuals and leave it up to each individual to make their own choice if they do or do not want to receive the jab. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 379 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyRequiring a vaccine for students especially this early into the vaccine cycle is unconstitutional, and infringes on the rights of everyone that does not want to be vaccinated. To say it is required by everyone to remain safe is absolutely false. This would be a massive mistake, and a step in the wron g direction for co mmunities. The government should allow people to make up their own minds in choosing to be vaccinated, and now college institutions are forcing whoever does not want to take the vaccine into to submission based on inclusion alone. With policies like this, there is now no choice for regular people. In example, I myself have been exposed directly to the virus. I have taken care of multiple people who have had corona and have been in close proximity and absolute direct contact with people who got sick and tested positive for corona. I have never gotten sick, never had symptoms, and never tested positive for corona despite constant testing when I was in contact. My personal opinion is that I don't need a vaccine for a sickness that I have been in direct contact with and has no issue. I am also someone who has never had the Flu, and as a result, never taken a Flu shot. No need. Despite my personal experiences and beliefs, my university is going to force me to get a vaccine if I want to participate in ANYTHING. This is criminal. No government, institution, or private business should have the power to make this decision for people. The thousands and thousands of dollars that I have invested in my education at UNM holds me hostage to, even if this proposal passes, but this is something I would seriously consider dropping out over. On behalf of a student body working hard, earning higher education degrees, and smart and capable enough to make our own decision, let us make OUR OWN DECISIONS. No mandate is necessary for the vast majority of students to be vaccinated. This will happen without such a proposal. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentBefore I registered for Fall classes, UNM stated that they would not require the covid vaccine for inperson students. Now, I am reeling from the news that they are considering making it a requirement. I am faced with making a major decision whether to adhere to my personal beliefs or being forc ed to put something in my body that I don't agree with just so I can finish my education. Unfortunately, I must now consider alternate routes if UNM makes the vaccine a requirement. I feel blindsided by an institution that I have given my last 3 years to. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI think this is a violation of human rights and freedom of one's body. I am opposed to this policy and will not continue at UNM it is something that does get passed and is mandatory. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 380 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentI'm currently a student at the University of New Mexico. I find it very unfair that students who have their vaccine can come back to campus and students who don't aren't back allowed. I think implementing the right process and procedures would allow for everyone to possibly come back. I WILL NOT ATTEND THE UNIV ERSITY FOR GRAD SCHOOL IF THIS IS IMPLEMENTED. I don't mind wearing a mask and social distancing but I will not step down to discrimination of my medical rights. Please hear the voice of students who refuse to get a vaccine that is not FDA approved. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyReligious Hello, I hope that this feedback of mine will be taken in consideration. I am of the opinion that requiring to be fully vaccinated is not correct. First of all no institution has the right to violate the fundamental right if a human being to be vaccinated or not. Second, there are numerous civil rights attorneys who are ma king Colleges in USA aware of the implications of violating these fundamental rights by the administration and regents body of universities. Third if you read the results from VAERS or VEARs that is the institution elected by the CDC to keep statistical record of issues with va ccines (it is public records you can go an read it yourself) there are almost 4,000 covid19 related death after administration of the 3 vaccines brands. Fourth in lieu of this I really hope that this university is not going to force and obligate people to aend school. Fih, there is no emergency anymore. Not even the president is talking and congress is passing this up anymore. In medicine heard immunity is reached when 30% is vaccinated. Is the school reached that already? I think so. Sixth, i have a blood disorder called deficiency of factor V. Instead of clotting i bleed. Now the vaccines sides effects are bleeding in the brain, blood clothing by the reaction of plasma towards the spike protein injected with the vaccine, strokes and heart disease so you can imagine how concerned I am if i get forced to do this. I hope to be exempt from. I was an I am an essenal worker and not inly i never got COViD19 (i get tested at work every 2 weeks) but I not required to get the vaccine by Walmart either now nor by Avis Budget Group before so I want to hope that this school now wil l let go this idea of forcing a vaccine.I am graduang in spring 2021 and it will be upsetting if I will not be granted access to my final term by this body of school ocials. Please let people decide by themself. Each and one of us have the best interest for this upcoming term. Do not force something that is in violation of the state statue and the constitution. I am sure the school doesn't like the idea of a class action law sui ts for civil right violation when in NM there is NO law that mandates vaccines.I like my school. I like being here in NM. As an immigrant i would like to hope that this school will abandon this socialistic ideas. I escape Europe because of ideas like this and definetly I wouldn't expect to find it here now.Sincerely, Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 382 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentI believe requiring a vaccine in order to attend class here at UNM is not only a infringement on our medical privacy, but it would also drastically limit the number of people who would attend classes on campus. Our age group is by far one of most safe from Covid19 and arou nd the country high school and colleges are allowing students back without the need of a vaccine. It is unfair that some universities and school require the vaccine while others do not. One of the best preventions of Covid19 is to be an healthy individual who regularly exercises, spends time outdoors, and eats healthy foods. During the spring and fall semesters of 2020 and 2021 the University of New Mexico encouraged behavior that was opposite of this; by encouraging students to stay indoors, limiting thei r access to fitness centers, and drastically limiting healthy and alternative meal opportunities for students. These actions have put UNM students at a greater risk for Covid19.In summery, I believe no student should have to provide any proof of a Covid19 vaccination to the university as it is a direct violation of our medical privacy, I also believe The University wrongfully pushed for action around campus that put students at a greater risk fo r Covid 19 and action should be taken to correct these wrongs Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 383 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceHealth Accommoda onR eligious This proposal is creating a slippery slope of an \"us and them\" environment. Everything I have ever had to read as an employee of UNM, as an instructor or as a member of the clinical staff at the EMSA and UNMH in my previous career, was always about inclusion, equality, equity, nondi scriminatory behaviors etc. Now, as a student, retired from a career of 24 years, a disabled veteran, pursuing a second career, I read the same things in every email, syllabus, and classroom. I'm forced to endure rants from instructors about social justice issues that in no way have anythi ng to do wi th the subject matter at hand. Yet the message is always the same; equality, justice, equity, etc. Much of these rants and \"discussions\" create yet another environment of \"us and them.\" Which in my opinion, is contrary to everything UNM claims to be about. This proposed policy, with the few excepons does not allow for someone to simply decline a \"vaccine\" for the simple sake of their right to autonomy. Much like the seasonal flu vaccine, it is a choice someone makes for what THEY feel is the right choice for THEM. There is current ly no pol icy that mandates students with the exception of the HSC to provide proof of vaccinations. I know as a student when I enrolled at UNM I did not have to provide any sort of proof of the \"recommended\" vaccines such as MMR, etc. The same applies to CNM as a student there. What happ ens to someone's right to choose what medical procedures or so called therapeutics they want performed or administered? I spent a career in healthcare. I know first hand of the legal implications regarding consent, refusals, etc. So how can someone making a choice for their own health be discrim i nated against? Forced vaccination for the sake of accessing a PUBLIC university is pushing the line of medical tyranny. When TB killed roughly 1.4 million people in 2019, I didn't hear anyone calling for mandatory testing, chest Xrays, etc. yet given NM's native population and the prevalence of IV drug users , ther e is a fairly large population of TB patients here in NM to include many of the homeless. But the biggest issue is a persons right to body autonomy. The prochoice community has used that model for decades now. Making an INFORMED decision based on facts, data, and logic is how we solve matters using the scientific method is it not? Well, given the demographic of the student body at UNM, say, 1829, nationally there has only been 2097 deaths from SARSCov2. In NM, a total of 49 in that same demographic. In contrast, in the age bra cket 15 24, there were 6031 deaths by accidents in 2019 nationally. Any death is tragic, I know more so than many, however, is that enough to take away someone's right to choose what's right for them and for them to not be discriminated against? I hate to say it, but the ide a of buttons or any sort of other identifying devices to show who has been vaccinated is just as bad as identifying someone who hasn't been. Again, an \"us and them\" environment could easily be seen as an \"us VERSUS them\" environment. UNM is a public university which receives state and federal dollars to function. If the state is not mandating any sort of \"vaccine passport\" then how can UNM? If the federal government is not pursing, at least at the moment, any sort of \"vaccine passport\" Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 384 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment then how can a public university? Who makes the decision on who receives the exemption and who doesn't? If someone has a religious reason yet the person evaluating the exemption application differs in opinion or ideological point of view and believes everyone NEEDS the vaccine regardless of their reason to not receiving it, is it their righ ts or the person's seeking the exempon? I believe safety of the student body and sta is paramount. However, there is the major issue of someone's right of autonomy. Autonomy is not trumped by what someone else feels is best for another. This is a difficult concept for many to grasp, but it's fact. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceHealth AccommodationWhat is UNM doing for students who do not want to be vaccinated? If you are going to force students to be vaccinated to return to campus, then every single class should be offered online. There are students who do not want to be vaccinated such as myself and feel that UNM is enti rely taking away our individual freedom to make that choice. Thanks! Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceReligious AccommodationIt remains a very concerning fact that the University is trying to regulate our bodies. For religious reasons I have opted to not be vaccinated. The university is overstepping by requiring such a vaccine, it hasn't even been in circulation for 2 years. We have no idea the long term side effec ts , this is a very irresponsible choice to be making. I am now considering transferring to another university. This university clearly has no concern over what could happen to students in the long run. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceGeneral ComplaintI don't think vaccines should be mandatory just as I don't believe going in person should be mandatory. Some still do not feel comfortable taking the vaccine. I also don't feel comfortable going back in person either. Vaccines do not guarantee not getting sick and going back in person may increase the risk of COVI D bein g in the classrooms and getting the virus. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyIt's not fair to require vaccines. I don't trust it nor do I want to take it. I hope UNM doesn't make it required. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceImpact to EnrollmentThe right to decide whether or not to take any sort of vaccine should never be infringed and should be 100% up to the person who will recieve the vaccine. Making it a requirement to get the vaccine in order to attend UNM will be a terrible decision and may result the loss of many gr eat students who value their freedom and choices over a degree from this university. If this policy passes I will no longer support this university and what it stands for. I value my health and freedoms too much to allow any school to determine what I do to myse lf and my body . I do not support this policy proposal in any way, shape, or form. I strongly encourage the board to rethink this policy and what negative effects may come from passing such a terrible rule. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 385 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI STRONGLY disagree with the proposed draft of to require a COVID19 vaccination to access UNM's facilities. This is for several reasons. They are:1.) This untested atypical vaccine was pushed thru with an emergency exemption, and therefore may have many side eects that are unknown2.) This vaccine is of a new MRNA type, which is more of a DNA therapy and has never been used before in this capacity on a naonal level.3.) The COVID19 \"pandemic\" has a slighty higher death rate then the common flu, with similer risks based on the age of the person, state of health, and if they are immuno compromised already.5.) Coronovirus's have been around for a long time, and we have not let that stop us from experiancing a full and free life with people and getting our needs met for love, connection, and free expression.6.) If people are vaccinated, then they should be be protected from COVID19, and shouldn't have to worry about catching it7.) If there is any instuon that should be encouraging young people to fully explore and express themselves in their pursuit of higher learning (i.e personal automony over their own bodies and what goes into it), it should be the universies8.) I WILL NOT attend a college nor help fund one that requires it's students to take an untested vaccine, paving the way for \"vaccine passports\" and a very orwellian future where this will be used a tool to control people even more and have them \"living\" in a constant state of fear.9.) I believe that aer all is said and done. we will find more people have died from more a lack of connection due to this \"pandemic\" then the actual cure itself; i.e. the cure does more harm then the good it's supposed to do.10.) People's need for connection and meeting their emotional needs is more important then this false sense of \"safety\", and requiring a policy where people have to worry about \"the other\" more then they do already will create a fear based atmosphere not conducive to learning, connecon, and free expression.In closing, I strongly disagree with this draft. I also feel symptomatic testing for those who are not vaccinated is very invasive and an overkill response .Thanks for your me, Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyUnm students and staff should not be forced to disclose private health data in order to protect their employment or education. The desission to get the vaccine should be one that its personal and private because an arbitrary decision from a governing body cannot possibly take into account the finer details of the decision. People have the personal responsibility for their own health and no one, including this university, should take that right away. I myself believe that everyone should get the vaccine but it is not my place, nor anyone elses, to push that upon anyone else who may disagree. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 387 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI strongly disagree with the mandate for all students and faculty to be required to be vaccinated. I think it is unfair to pressure people into getting a vaccine because they are pursuing their education especially when research is still coming out about the safety and efficacy of su ch vaccines. I don't think it is an institutions place to determine such choices for people. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI don't think we should be required to get the vaccine. That feels like discrimination. I as a student work hard and pay for my school and telling me I need a vaccine to attend feels like discrimination and I don't feel like discriminating othes on health choices is the Lobo way. To make people get vaccinations is not legal just so they can attend school and learn. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceThat is absolutely ridiculous, I should not be forced to be vaccinated just so I can go to school in person again. What happened to \"my body my choice\" or does that not apply here for some reason? Please do not make this a real thing, I want to go back to sc hool in person, and to force people to have to get a vaccination is unfair, and quite frankly unethical. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI strongly disagree with implementation of this proposed vaccine policy. With the information provided, newly updated, and currently available from UNM, CDC, and Department of Health for students and those to whom this would apply, they are informed and capable take decisive action which is in their best interest. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI absolutely will not be receiving the Covid19 vaccine under any circumstances, and I will not be forced to. Here at the University of New Mexico, we students are educated and mature adults who can make decisions for themselves and do not need to be forced to do anything. Students who are af raid of the virus can choose to stay home, I do not support or think that the University has the right to take away the other student's learning experiences who are happy to return, simply without a vaccine. Should the University chose to implement this infringing policy, I may have to start considering another school willing to support me on my academic journey, and the decisions that I make for myself. I hope this comment is met with open mindedness, and considera on for appeal to this prop o sed policy The University of New Mexico Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI feel this is unfair as some of us prefer not to be vaccinated for personal reasons that are not included in your draft. It may not be for medical, or religious, it is a personal preference \"such as my body , my choice.\" You're trying to mandate this in order to be ab le to attend in person classes. I feel it goes against all ethical issues Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 388 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI don't think it is wise to require everyone to get a vaccine that requires that recipient to sign a paper giving consent to a medical trial. If the vaccine was fully tested and not still in the trail phase, I think having everyone getting the vaccine would be reasonable. However, with how thing stand right now not knowing the long term effects of all of the vaccines, I believe it would be better to let people decide based on their own situation and weigh the risks themselves. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceI feel like we should all have an option to get the vaccine and it is not fair to the students trying to get an education that they be under these laws. Even though it hasn't been approved yet its my right as an individual to choose something for my healt h. I want to continue school and it's so hard when there are terms placed on us like this one. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceAny individual that does not get a vaccine will at the very most, only increase the potential that they, and others who have opted to not be vaccinated, could get covid19 in other words, each and every individual that DOES NOT want to get covid19 will have had the opportunity to become vaccinated, thereby eliminating their chances of being infected. As such, implemen ng the proposed vaccination policy will only be infringing on those that do not wish to be vaccinated, while providing no benefit to those who do not wish to be infected. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyIt is disgusting for force students to get a vaccine. It should be recommended or heavily recommended but not required for students or faculty to get a vaccine. The time line for students to get the vaccine is not realistic and causes stress and anxiety for students to be pressured to get a vaccine or they can't par ticipate in any on campus activities. This is harmful to mental health as it is a big deal for some students to put foreign substance in their bodies, especially for religious reasons. If it is still too soon to fully open, then a hybrid inclass and onl ine option should be provided. If students are paying thousands they should be able to attend class if inperson is offered. The vaccine is not a 100% guarantee from the virus and should not be forced on students. Reduce tuition for those that are not able to attend class in pers on. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyPlease do not take away our constitutional rights and force us to get a vaccine that is still in the testing phases!! Our body, our choice!! Let us return and just like the flu, let us decide whether we want the vaccine. My whole family already had covid and we had mild symptoms. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 389 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyAs a student I see the requirement of returning to campus vaccinated by this fall as a type of discrimination. This vaccine has not been FDA approved and even if it was it does not guarantee complete immunity from COVID19. College is a service I pay and work for. The universit y is not paying me to go to school, I am paying the university through scholarships, awarded to me due to good grades and work ethic, my own money and government funded aid. When we went online due to the pandemic we still had to pay full tuition even though we were not receiving the sa me types of services provided by the university, such as, hands on learning, face to face teaching, interaction with professors, access to facilities that is included in our tuition, and much more. This did take a toll on my learning and education, however, I have learned to adapt to the changes. Therefore, the university should offer an online learning option for all students who do not feel safe getting the vaccine. We have been having online platforms for all classes during this time and paying full tuition, why not offer that option to those who do not feel comf ortable getting vaccinated? If the university does require mandatory vaccinations without FDA approval and promise of full immunity from the virus, then it will be seen as discrimination in my eyes and I suspect there will be peaceful protest in response. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceUNM should not require students to get the vaccine to attend. It is people's choice whether or not to get it, just like it isn't for other vaccines. Yes, I got the vaccine myself, but that was my personal decision for me. UNM should not and cannot force studen ts to do that. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyI don't believe that it's fair to impose a required vaccination mandate for students attending classes in the fall. If I am accepted and attending school and paying my dues I don't believe that it is fair for the school to require something that doesn't benefit the school in the long run. Oth er colleges and universities across the United States are not requiring this so to be a strict outlier will only push people and students away. Along with their tuition payments. This is a violation of my constitutional rights, HIPAA privacy laws (as I am not legally required to show you proo f if I have rec eived it or not) and my rights as an American Citizen. Please reconsider and try to remain open minded for all people and try not to serve only one mentality. Thank you for your time. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyRequiring vaccinations that we don't know longterm health effects for seems irresponsible. Getting a vaccine should be a person's own personal choice and should not affect whether or not they get an education or can use the university's resources. (This is coming from someone who got both doses of the COVID vacci ne!) Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 390 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyThere is no point in requiring students, the far and away vast majority of whom are at no risk for COVID anyway, to get an experimental treatment that should be considered gene therapy rather than a standard vaccine. Considering longterm effects are completely unknown of any kind of mRNA injection, much le ss this particular one that hasn't even been around for a year, the school is endangering far more students than the few who are at risk. Further, how would this policy work if (as we seem to be heading in this direction) COVID shots require regular boosters? Nobody re quires flu shots every year to be back on campus on in an office. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about SafetyI think if the vaccine gets approval beyond the FDA's emergency use, it will be okay to require the vaccine. Otherwise, I don't think it's fair to require it. Also, what are the school's current requirements for other vaccines? I'm not aware of any. I know it's unprecedented times and all, but to have not cared ab out vaccine status for other diseases before makes it more difficult to justify requiring a vaccine now. I definitely prefer that everyone's vaccinated, as I'm vaccinated myself, it's just a difficult issue. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 391 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about ProcessI believe it is unfair to require the COVID vaccination to go on campus. You don't require students to get the flu vaccine every flu season so why require the COVID vaccination? According the the New York Times in New Mexico we had 199,054 total cases and only 4,091 deaths (May 7th 2021 ). That's a 2% mortality rate and a 98% recovery rate. You shouldn't have the power to force students and staff to get vaccinated to go back to campus when the threat truly isn't there. Also if the governor wants to open New Mexico up and lift restrictions once the popula tion reaches 60% vaccinated, then you shouldn't be able to further impose any sort of restriction. Wearing a mask is one thing but forcing a population to vaccinate themselves on a non FDA approved vaccine seems cruel best. Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyImpact to There are so many reasons why this should NOT happen. Each human being should have the right to make their own health decisions without coercion or force. It's really as simple as that. All consenting and informed adults should have the choice. I am a sovereign being, and I should get to deci de what does or does not get put into my body. Whatever I choose is my personal decision and it should be recognized and respected as such. When we give up our medical freedom and our privacy, we are giving up the right to make educated decisions in our best interest. UNM, I love and re spect you but this is a terrible idea. The vaccines being administered right now are experimental. Moderna has never ever had an FDA approved product. We do not know long term effects and those companies are not liable if anything goes wrong. Additionally, the vaccines were not tested on pregnant or lactati n g women (it's in the reports), so you would be putting many students and their children at risk.If it's about the money for you, take a moment to think about how your enrollment will decrease significantly. There is also a great legal risk in requiring vaccines, and many colleges and universities have been sued already as a result of their mandate. Please do not take away our medical freedom, our privacy, or our right to make our own health decisions. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 393 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyConcerns With the increasing complications seen with the available vaccinations, I think it unwise for a university to require such sweeping regulations for their students. Johnson and Johnson is evidence that the available vaccines, while very much useful, are not infallible and therefore the school should not require them. Unless the school is willing to provide re assurance or financial compensation for any adverse effects it is not reasonable to force students to take the vaccine. And yes, it is forcing. This is not as much a choice as many might think. For students who have already spent tens of thousands of dollars for an education, online courses have prov en to lessen our lear ning ability and increased the strain mentally and emotionally already present from being away from family and friends. Also, transferring is difficult in the current school climate and a student who is, in all other cases, happy with the university experience should not have to weigh whether to give up th eir education or their safety. This decree also comes at a weird time. Why not require it sooner when the issue is still present? Why require it as it is going away? Were masks and social distancing not proven effective by the last year and a half of scho o ling? And if not effective how come we were required to do it? I am all for promoting vaccination and requesting that students get it. However, the university is toeing a fine line when it comes to requiring it. I think more effort should be put into findin g a work around that doesn't require individuals to divulge personal information after already being placed into a legally binding agreement with a corporation. I am eager for your reply Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 394 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyConcerns I understand that we are in a global pandemic, but this proposed plan is ridiculous. First, if I understand this correctly, this policy would enforce everyone to get a vaccine but would not change any of the preceding safety standards? By these guidelines, some classes already won't be able to attend in person anywa y s. This semester, I had multiple classes that wanted to be in person. Due to the social distancing of the classroom, there were not enough seats for the students. The social distancing of the classroom will make it impossible for classes larger than 10 to attend in person. Unless ev ery class is held in an enormous lecture hall. If the entire class is vaccinated, why would there be a need for these safety precautions? Secondly, how does the school plan on keeping students information HIPPA compliant when we will have to where a signal that we are vaccinated? Requiring those vaccin a ted to where a badge, sticker, pin, or other signage seems that does the actual opposite. I say again, I understand that we are in a global pandemic and you are doing your best to keep the community safe. That does not mean that the best way to keep us safe is to implement these tyrannical polic ies. If we are not supposed to ask other students if they are vaccinated, then why make us where signage to notify everyone around us of that answer? This will lead to a new form of discrimination that has yet to be seen. And I fear that this dis crimination will be tolerated and enforced in order to obtain \"safety\" for everyone. If I have a class that does not have an online option, then I am either forced to not take that class or forced to get the vaccine against my will. It is not the place of a public uni versity to implement and enforce such rules governing what the students do with their own body. A global pandemic does not excuse logic nor the rights of a human being. Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyConcerns While requiring other vaccines may be legal, this vaccine has only been approved by the FDA under an emergency situation. Having those who have received the vaccine wear buttons or stickers, while the University says this would be optional, would be a violation of HIPAA's privacy rule that protects \"all individually identi fiable health information\" especially if the university hands out stickers or in any way tries to encourage people to wear them. It is unethical to make medical decisions for other people. It is my body, and my choice. My medical decisions should be my own, and private. If UNM puts this policy into eect, I will be disenrolling and looking into my legal options. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 395 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Opposed to Policy Concerns about ChoiceConcerns about PrivacyConcerns I respecully request that no such policy be implemented. A mandatory vaccination that may pose undue risks is completely unnecessary and unacceptable. People should be allowed to choose their own level of risk and weigh the risks of different choices. Some vaccines have been known to make people sterile, others have opened people up to autoi mmune deficiencies, and still others may make people more susceptible to disease or other side effects instead of protecting them. Additionally, vaccines rarely protect people from mutant variations and in some cases may even cause mutations as the viruses try to find a way around the vaccine. The Covid vaccines have not been around lo ng enough to know all of the risks involved. There are also many other ways of building one's immune system. Some people choose to be vaccinated instead and that is their right. But those who prefer to build their immune systems using natural, reliable and time tested methods should be allowed to continue to do so. Such a policy of woul d be discriminatory against those who are already immune to this Coronavirus by other means.Addi onally, given the current level of fear and ostracization towards those who do not choose to be vaccinated for coronavirus, I believe that one's Covid vaccination status should be considered Protected Health Information and as such, not allowed to be shared without someone's express permission under HIPAA laws.For all of these reasons and more, I am strongly against a mandatory vaccine policy. Student Question Health Accommodation; Good Aernoon,What will the policy be for students who are unable to receive the Covid19 vaccine due to a preexisting health condion that would be triggered by the vaccine? Will students be allowed to attend class inperson or will there be requirements to take courses online only? Regards, Student Question General Complaint Would mask wearing still be required if everyone was fully vaccinated? Student Question General Complaint What if we are not vaccinated, will we still be able to attend in person? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 396 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Question General Complaint;Approaching my last semester at UNM after the pandemic is difficult and I have elected to take my classes online. I have to take one hybrid class and that concerns me. How is the University going to ensure that COVID safe practices are being upheld in classrooms that are constantly being used for multiple different class es. The perfect example of this would be the Language Learning Center. These classrooms aren't large and multiple different language classes in them, each day. How are cleaning and sanitizing/ social distancing going to be upheld in these situations? How can students contact trace if you are in con stant contact with others?Addi onally, I suggest that for classes oering hybridity, to also allow the option for full online. If a class has the capacity to be online at least half the time, students should be able to chose to stay home 100% of the time in the name of personal safety, while not missing course content. This is a large concern, as the only course offered to complete my second degree is hybrid. I, as a student, do not feel comfortable coming in, even one day a week if the concerns enumerated in the above paragraphs aren't addressed. Student Question General Complaint Is this a proposal for a policy, or does this policy actually exist? What I mean is does this policy have to pass through legislature, or is it already in place? Student Question Health Accommoda on; Religious Accommodation;What would qualify as an exemption from getting the COVID vaccine? Student Question Impact to EnrollmentWill there be options available for those who would like to finish their degree but are not vaccinated? I am a few classes away from completing my MBA. The remaining classes I have left are only offered in person. What will my options be to complete this if vaccination is required? Student Question Will the University supply antibody tests as an alternative to three various vaccines? How often will boosters be required? Will this new policy start to include other previously voluntary vaccines? Will boosters need to be updated every time there is a newly discovered variant? Will the vaccine producers continue to be exempt from restitution in the (curre ntly rare/uncommon) event of adverse reactions? Student Question Impact to EnrollmentI will be coming to UNM as an international student in August on an exchange programme. I hope to be fully vaccinated by then, but this is not certain. Will I be treated differently if I am not able to get the vaccine by this time? It would be very upsetting if I missed out on welcome events, me eting new friends and inperson classes due to this policy. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 397 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Question Concerns about Safety;Will you take into consideration that none of the COVID19 vaccines have received approval from the FDA and still are under the designation of emergency use authorization in your decision? Student Question I am an incoming freshman, currently live abroad. I am planning to come to the main campus by Aug 14, 2021. I have received AstraZenca Oxford vaccine which is not approved by the CDC yet. What should I do? Student Question Support Policy If UNM students and faculty reach a 60% or more vaccination rate, will that satisfy this proposed policy plan? Student Question Concerns about Process;I'm a new international student for Master's at UNM (Fall 2021) and I have an important question regarding Covid19 vaccination. Is it mandatory for me to be vaccinated before attending UNM? In my country, vaccinations are given only after 3 months after recovery from Covid. I have recovered from Covid in the first we ek of May and I could not get vaccinated in my country as per the rules. Student Question Concerns about ChoiceWill there still be the option to take the classes completely virtually or is everyone who doesn't want to get a vaccine just not allowed to take classes? What is an example of a reasonable accommodation and who gets to decide if it is reasonable? Student Question Concerns about ChoiceI have a few questions regarding the vaccine mandate that UNM wants to implement for the upcoming Fall 2021 semester: 1) Since I've had COVID19 at the beginning of this year, not as bad as a lot of people have been making it, since my body has produced antibodies, why should I have to take the vaccine? Shouldn't my antibodies be enough? If th e answer is no, why isn't my antibodies enough? It would be the same as if I got the vaccine, correct? 2) If you are vaccinated, are you sll going to require students, faculty, and staff to wear a mask? If the answer is yes, then what is the purpose of getting the vaccine if you still have to continue to wear your mask? Since the CDC supposedly says that masks protects ever yone from the virus, the vaccine shouldn't be necessary, right? Basically, that's a double standard. I just feel like that this mandate is stripping my rights and freedoms away as a student as well as a citizen. I should be able to make the choice if I want to get the vaccine or not rather then someone forcing me to take it. Thanks for your me! Student Question Concerns about Choice;If vaccination becomes a requirement for in person learning at UNM, will you be offering online curriculum in pursuit of degree programs to support a student's individual and personal choice of whether or not to receive the vaccine? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 398 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Question Concerns about EnforcementAm I reading the draft correctly? The draft states this policy cannot go into effect until the FDA has approved one of the COVID19 vaccinations for regular use. My question exactly If Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson & Johnson transition from \"emergency use\" to having the FDA's full appr oval, that is wh en the policy will go into eect? What happens to the students if they do not show proof of vaccination? Will they be expelled from the program? Will they receive reimbursement for tuition paid? Will they be allowed time to begin the process of getting vaccinated, if appropriate? Student Question Concerns about EnforcementConc erns about Process(1) How will UNM account for those that have acquired natural immunity to COVID19?(2) Seeing, as of now, that the vaccination only affords 2 to 3 months of protection, how many times a year would UNM expect students and faculty to receive the vaccine?(3) Regarding queson (2) above, how are students and faculty supposed to keep up with lectures and school work every me they get sick as a result of the vaccinaon?(4) How would constant/weekly Covid19 tests even be helpful, considering the high false posive rates these tests have?(5) Would this requirement only take effect if the vaccine is FDA approved (which technically should take YEARS to do) and not under EUA status as it is now to allow individuals to choose whether or not they want to be vaccinated?(6) Is it even legal for a state institution/university that receives state funds to require vaccinations in order for individuals to attend? Student Question Concerns about Enforcement;I am an incoming math PhD student with a teaching assistantship, so I will have to arrive by 11th August. As I will be flying in from the uk (Northern Ireland) I will not be expecting my first vaccination until late July or early August. This is because the NHS is deploying vaccinations to the most vulnerable groups first and as I am under 30 years old I wil l not expect to receive mine until this me. Thus I may or may not have my rst vaccine by the me of travelling to ABQ and I believe as a TA my unm health insurance holds retroactively to 17th August. What can I do to get fully vaccinated by the proposed 2nd August? Student Question Concerns about ProcessWill we have to wear masks even though everybody will be vaccinated and protected? Student Question Concerns about ProcessI currently live abroad, and I'm planning to come on campus this Fall 2021. I have received the AstraZeneca oxford vaccine which isn't approved by the CDC yet. What should I do? Student Question Concerns about ProcessI take online classes, but if I wanted to attend my graduation after I finished in fall 2021 would so need to be vaccinated? Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 399 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Question Concerns about EnforcementFeedback: I am confused on the verbiage. Many of the FAQ's state 'will be asked to participate in the program'. Yet under \"How would enforcement work for failure to participate in the program\" has very finite language, stating \"those who fail to participate would be barred from in perso n access an d may experience consequences as a result\". Yes, these are trying times and I completely understand the consideration for proof of vaccination. However, the language needs to be consistent and not threatening. Many are still unsure of the safety of the vaccines and 'forcing' someone to have it in order to avoid 'consequences' is not an appropriate nor eecve approach. Quesons: Will those who choose not to participate have access to online instruction? How does the University plan on enforcing this policy with the general public? Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Please enact this policy. I do not have a problem with any of it. I am a PhD student and I would feel much much safer teaching in person classes and returning to my office and lab in the fall if this policy was in place. Thank you for solicing feedback. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I want to thank UNM and its leadership for developing this policy. I think the proposed policy follows accepted scientific data, research, best practices, and seeks to protect the community all of us! Your policy still provides some leeway for those within our community who cannot or choose not to participate in vacci nation. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that being vaccinated leads to any kind of detrimental or longterm side effects and I applaud you for standing strong during this public health crisis. We need to take care of each other and this proposed policy does just that.On a side note...I personally am not concerned or fearful of the virus. Regardless, getting vaccinated and following the public health orders are essential to our wellbeing as a society. I cannot in good conscience put my own individual needs, desires, and beliefs ahead of anyone else's. Plus, qu ite honestly, the science is clear as of now. Continue in this vein. I applaud your leadership and fairness. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully support mandating COVID19 vaccination to attend and teach and work at UNM. We need to protect all Lobos! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think a mandator vaccine policy would be amazing and would make me feel much more protected and safe while attending in person classes. Vaccines have been mandatory to attend school before so what makes the covid vaccine any different. I support 100% thank you! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I wholeheartedly agree with this policy. Vaccination is the only way to ensure everyone's safety, and we should not let conspiracy theories overtake common sense. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 400 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think the proposed plan is great! I have felt a lot of anxiety about everything returning back to normal due to a fear of people lying about their vaccination status or refusing to wear masks. I am in full support of UNM requiring the vaccine in order to use inperso n fa cilities, this will not only keep everyone safe but it will also make me feel more comfortable in class. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think everyone who will be on campus should be fully vaccinated (if medically/religiously able) and should have to provide proof of vaccination. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please make vaccinations mandatory so we can all feel safe at school Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I appreciate and support the policy. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am in full support of a mandatory COVID19 vaccination policy for UNM students and staff. I believe that this policy will serve to protect not only the UNM community, but also the Albuquerque community. As New Mexico's flagship university, I believe it is UNM's responsibility to set a good exam ple for our community and the state of New Mexico. We can do this by placing a developed understanding of science and public health at the forefront of a mandatory vaccination policy, as this draft policy does. A mandatory vaccination policy will help life at UNM return to normal as qu ickly as possible, and I'm looking forward to that as much as the next person! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; This is absolutely necessary and I believe UNM should implement this policy. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I would feel much safer to be a student and work as a GA/TA if vaccinations were mandatory. I have spent the last 3 years working in Manzanita Counseling Center and our clients are often of vulnerable populations, such as houseless, elderly, disabled folks, as well as children. Mandatin g vacc ination for oncampus students, staff, and faculty would help ensure our counseling clients are safe on campus. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think it is good. People have their opinions, but if they want to return to campus that is what they will have to do. Enough people have died and got sick from this pandemic. UNM is doing what it has to do to keep students, faculty and, employees safe. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 401 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe that being fully vaccinated should be required for those who want to attend on campus classes. In order for students and staff to be as safe as they can be, the vaccination is the best option. Classes are too big in quantity to be adequately \"social dista nc ing\" in rooms that aren't big enough. If you choose to not get the vaccine, there are online class options. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I have no problem requiring all students and faculty be vaccinated in order to return to inperson learning in the fall. It really shouldn't even be a question. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Requiring a \"COVID passport\" is in the best interest for our campus and is in line with the university's mission. Students are meant to learn about civic duty, cooperation, and community all while understanding research and scientific methods. Excuses for not to getting the free, widely available vaccine are few and fa r between. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; The University of New Mexico should ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE* vaccinaons for anyone coming onto any UNM campus.*Except documented medical exemptions Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe UNM, is making the right step towards creating and enforcing vaccine policy for the wellbeing of its staff and students attending UNM. I hope that the enforcement and creation of this policy will create a closer inperson learning environment and a safe atmosphere for all who visit the cam pus regularly and or vising. My only concern is addressing the demand of receiving a vaccine if there would be one oncampus inculcation to make it convenient and comfortable for all. Thank you! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 402 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I agree that UNM should require a student to be FULLY vaccinated before returning to campus and inperson classes. My reasoning behind this is that we cannot limit the individual to what they do in their personal life such as eating indoors at restaurants, going to entertainment places, etc wher e they could potentially cat ch COVID. If they're vaccinated, they have a greater chance at fighting it than spreading it. As someone who takes this pandemic seriously, I would want the people i am around indoors for hours at a time to be vaccinated. I go home to my parents, my grandpa rents, and my siblings who I do not want to give the virus to. Another reason I would want the vaccine required is due to the struggles of online learning. These past 3 semesters have been chaotic and stressful. Learning hasn't been the best and most times, our questions do not get answered. We have a chance of returning to in person classes where we will be able to get the quality education we are paying for. I do not understand why UNM would jeopardize moving forward and returning to normal. Lastly, UNM has the obligation to keep students, faculty, and staff safe on the campus. Not requiring a vaccine where a deadly virus could spread around campus does not sound like a safe environment. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am so glad you are requiring that inperson personnel be fully vaccinated for COVID19. Thank you for caring about the UNM community's health and safety. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I strongly support the proposed vaccine policy. As someone who graduated from UNM with their 4year degree and as a current master's program student I would feel far safer and more comfortable being on campus for classes and to access resources if I knew that the majority of people around me are also vacci nated. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Vaccine should be mandatory for in class. This will give classes less likelihood of having an outbreak. I would feel much safer. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this policy is really important to implement. This policy would set an example in Albuquerque and protect the current residents. People around the country come UNM and as far as I am aware New Mexico is opening up more and more because we have been taking COVID safety seri ously. The return to face to face classes will attract out of state students and potentially spread the virus. Also, there is a science to the vaccine and those seeking a higher education should know that. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 403 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I like the proposal. Classes should have hybrid options for those who refuse the vaccine, but they shouldn't be allowed in to class. If you were to allow anyone into class, that forces the responsible students to choose between removing themselves from the learning environment (punishment for being responsibl e) or to suc k it up and put themselves in danger around unvaccinated ppl. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a graduate student at UNM, I fully support the proposed plan for my personal safety and the safety of my peers and colleagues. I must work in several labs on campus in order to conduct my research and complete my degree. I will also be teaching an in person cour se this fall. I do not fe el comfortable interacting with peers or students that are not fully vaccinated. I know this pandemic and vaccine have been heavily politicized. I am proud UNM is considering this policy, as it is the only way to ensure the safety of all students, staff, and faculty. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this is a great policy to help stop the spread and a safer way to return to face to face classes. However my concern is that a percentage of people that visit UNM are non students/staff will people be required to be vaccinated if visiting UNM campus and cafeteria? Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I am very strongly in favor of this policy. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Hello,I am a Ph.D. student in the Biology department at UNM, and I am in full support of the UNM Proposed COVID vaccine requirement. As a graduate student, I conduct my research on campus and will be taking inperson classes this fall. I also travel for fieldwork, and volunteer with the UNMaffiliated Bosque Ecosystem Monitoring Program. Requiring the vaccine for students, staff, and faculty is the most effective way to ensure my own safety as well as the safety of th ose I interact with in these dierent sengs.I am proud that UNM has been and connues to priorize the safety of its students and employees. Thank you for the opportunity to subm i t feedback, Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a student I am 100% behind the suggested policy. It provides significant peace of mind to know that my fellow students, staff, and faculty will be safe and not contributing to a public health risk. I thank you for your efforts to keep our pack safe and sound! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Having a mandatory vaccine is a great idea. It will help to keep faculty and other students safe, and to ensure that we reduce the spread as much as possible. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 404 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I approve and support the measures to ensure that every person on campus is vaccinated. However, additional language may be considered to include what constitutes \"vaccinated\" status, as most COVID19 vaccines require more than one dose to be effective and might also require booster shots. Thank you for the eff orts in this policy. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully believe that everyone should be vaccinated IF they want to be in person. They have the option of being online so if they don't care enough to stop the spread then they should stay at home. The vaccine is the only thing, right now, that is helping slow down Covi d and would be very beneficial for in person. Honestly a lot of students don't feel comfortable for the school to open up without everyone being vaccinate, and I agree. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think the vaccine should definitely be required to return to campus. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I would feel much safer returning to campus with this policy in place. If vaccines weren't mandatory I might reevaluate my choice to take inperson classes in the fall and instead take only online classes in order to protect an immunocompromised family member. I am anxious about the large number of people who seem to be refusing vaccines, which would make me very hesitant to attend classes if they weren't required. I approve of the proposed vaccine policy. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I absolutely think UNM should instate a vaccine mandate. I would not feel comfortable returning to inperson instruction, particularly as a graduate instructor myself, without the assurance that my peers and students were protected against the virus. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I would feel more comfortable being a teaching assistant this Fall if I could assume that my students were vaccinated. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please make the vaccine mandatory. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Thank you so much for putting this policy into place. There are already many required vaccines to attend universities and work at medical facilities so I am tired of people complaining about this nonsense. I appreciate your care for our well being and I feel so much safer going back to classes if the vaccine is required. Thank you again. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 405 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I would think that it's a great idea for all students to be vaccinated so we could all be back to normal and all safe in the process. I'm not very worried either way but I think it would be a great idea Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I am in full support of the vaccination requirement. As a student, I should feel comfortable going to classes without having to worry about contracting COVID from someone who chose not to get vaccinated. I decided to get vaccinated vaccinated because I don't want to be a vector trans mitting the viru s to others. With a vaccinated population, these chances are less likely, and I would feel much more comfortable attending inperson classes and conducting research. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I really hope this gets implemented and passed. I would feel safer, oncampus knowing everyone requires a vaccine, and also student life will be more fun without a mask on! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I believe it is a great idea to require COVID19 vaccines for on campus attendance Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Yes! I absolutely love this. This will help us engage on campus while staying safe and not transmitting the virus (recent research is showing vaccinated folks don't shed the spiked protein and therefore do not transmit the virus!) I am happy y'all are considering this, as it makes me feel safer to come back in pers on on campus. Science doesn't lie <3 Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support mandatory vaccinations. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Please please please require everyone to be vaccinated in order to attend UNM. This will help make sure more people in general are vaccinated which is very important, and will also help protect people who are too immune compromised to get the vaccine themselves. I understand people will be upset about this, but it re ally comes down to the safety of the community. UNM has a great opportunity to help save more lives by requiring the vaccine.

Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 406 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As a Registered Nurse and Grad student apart of the MSN Program I would recommend that it be required for others to recieve their vaccinations to attend class. Everyone being vaccinated keeps our community safe, and boost vaccination records for the state that will only help us to increase our stat es ability to open up. Thank you for being transparent about your decision making process and giving students a voice about Campus policy. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think that making the vaccine mandatory for the UNM campus is a great idea that will not only keep staff, faculty, and students safe, but will also allow for a more comfortable maskfree learning environment. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think making the COVID vaccine mandatory is the best health measure the university can take to make sure everyone is safe and not in risk of getting the virus from another person. I also think the policy for mask wearing on campus facilities and buildings should be added to the proposed poli cy. If it will be optional, it would be good to add it as well to the draft. We are a big university with a big student, faculty, and staff population and if the vaccine is not required I would be scared to return to campus full time in perso n as I have va rious vulnerable family members. So, I totally agree with the measures and the whole policy. I really like that even though is a risk, the university is still respecting other people's religion or practice. Although I would prefer for the vaccine to be required for everyone, I do admi re this given respect to people of certain religions or backgrounds to be given an accommodation. However, I would explain what is a reasonable accommodation that will be granted. Thank you! Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about Enforcement; Con cerns about Process;Support I support this policy.I would like to know how individuals will prove that they have been vaccinated. Will UNM accept purchased(fake) vaccine cards or will there be other methods of vericaon?Visitors should be required to show proof of vaccinaon, also. If the government lis the mask mandate for vaccinated individuals, I also think it would feel nice to allow vaccinated students to return to school unmasked. :) Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I completely support this plan. I want school to go back to in person as much as possible, but frankly I would not be comfortable without a vaccine requirement. I want to know that I will not be sent home part way through the semester. I have been vaccinated for quite awhi le, and with the new mask policy I am seeing just how many people are not vaccinated but walk around without masks. The amount of people I see without masks does not match up to the data. I do not want to be on a college campus that has that ki nd of environment, and I fear that without a vaccine policy this will be the case. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Great idea for a requirement. Lets not let idiots who are stubborn and ignorant set back our progress. We need everyone in this together Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 407 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I believe that a requirement for vaccinations among all students, faculty, and staff is the best method for controlling the spread of the virus. Vaccinations come at no cost to the individual and vaccination sites are very common. I can understand if there are excepons that could be applied for. This would also make me feel much safer at campus, since masks do not protect the wearer, only people around the wearer. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think this draft is perfect and makes me feel completely safe returning to campus considering they go through with the proposed plan. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think requiring the vaccine is great. I personally feel like the state should mandate everyone get vaccinated so I support this. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I support a mandatory vaccine for anyone who is inperson on campus, whether aending classes, working and/or living there. I think our community has suffered enough from Covid19 and having nonvaccinated people allowed to congregate indoors is a terrible idea that will lead to more suffering. I personally do not want to attend inperson classes with unvaccinated people. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I think this is a great idea, and that barring religious, health, or other real and justified exemptions, everyone who is on campus regularly should be required to have their vaccination for covid. This just seems like the only logical thing that anywhere, but even more so a place of learni ng, could do to help keep all of us ahead of covid. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; A vaccine requirement policy makes sense and will encourage hesitant students to make the right decision. NM has sufficient vaccine supply to meet demand. The next step is for public institutions to promote public health with sensible measures. Many colleges in Colorado have already announced a mandatory vaccination policy, somet hing whic h is overwhelmingly common on the East Coast and in California. New Mexico should not be slow in delivering a strong and effective message about vaccination. UNM must implement a vaccine requirement. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Requiring UNM students and staff be vaccinated before returning to campus would greatly reduce my anxieties about attending in person classes. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 408 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Overall, I am really happy to see these are the steps being taken by UNM! It's important to create a healthy space and I think this policy also does a good job of not pointing fingers or making any moral/political statements about the vaccine that could dissuade someone from geng the vaccine. However, in regards to those who cannot get the vaccine for any valid reason, I think it would have been better to offer a wider variety of online or hybrid courses. I felt like we suddenly had almost no options, which kind of forces people to return to campus even if they are not comfortable with that yet, either because they are high risk or live with people who are or any other reason. Since the vaccine is not 100% guaranteed to provide safety, especially to those with severe underlying health conditions, I feel like we should have been presented with more online or hybrid opons. One other thing is that I feel like people who cannot get vaccinated/who seek accommodations should have to wear a mask on campus, because I know I want to minimize contact and closeness with those who cannot be vaccinated just because I live with two high risk , older individuals, and I want to prevent as much exposure for them as possible. But! Overall, I think this is great, and I am really proud to be a Lobo and to be part of this community. I feel as though the UNM community is predominantly made of compassionate, empathetic, and courteous people, and I am honored to be part of that group especially during these ti mes. Thank you for potentially implementing this and for reaching out for community feedback! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Absolutely, it should be required that students, faculty, staff, and everyone else should be vaccinated before 100% inperson activities resume Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 410 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I strongly approve of the proposed vaccine policy and disapprove of the decision to allow vaccinated students to not wear masks in the classroom and dormitories. Not requiring all students to wear masks provides an opportunity for \"antimask\" \"antivax\" folks to get away with not wearing their masks without consequence, unless there is a concrete system in place to confirm vaccination status. We know that people who are not interested in foll owing these rules will take advantage of this policy. This directly affects and endangers immunocompromised people, folks with allergies to specific ingredients, and those who abstain from medical care for religious purposes. All of these people deserve to live just as those of us who can be vaccinated. I personally was excited to return to school in the fall with mask requirements in place, however, I will be reevaluating my decision if masks and vaccination are not required, as frankly, I do not feel safe in an environment with unvaccina ted peop le who will not be wearing masks. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I feel the 'honor system' that we traditionally utilized, if you are not feeling well stay home, which prior to COVID19 was used for the common cold, flu, etc. would be the best practice for UNM. We have seen through Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, it is possible to have simu ltaneous online and inperson learning options for students teachers have the ability to live stream and catalog lectures. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; YES! Please do this Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 412 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; As a student who is still questioning if they want the COVID vaccine, I would still like to return back onto campus. I am not opposed to the idea of getting the vaccine; I would like to learn more about the vaccine before I do get it. I need to know bot h pros and cons from qualified doctors about the vaccine before making my final decision. However, I am still very cautious about my safety. I continuously wear two masks, I do not feel comfortable with people wearing masks incorrectly, I am cautious who I'm around and where I am, I clean up aft er myself, wash my hands very oen, so on and so forth. I feel like restricng students and staff who do not have this vaccine would do more harm than good. Going to school full time online is more challenging academically. Multiple peers of mine feel like having school online did not validate our work. We woul d put our time into an assignment just for little to no feedback and receive an automatic high grade; with some peers of purposely not performing at all and still receiving the same grade! Again, we do not feel like our work online is not being validated, we feel like we are not lear ning, and we are hardly retaining any informaon we're taught. With that in mind, I was fortunate enough to go to UNM in person prior to the pandemic, and I feel like learning in person fulfilled my academic needs and wants rather than online. School online only made me question my knowledge and took away multiple opportunities. Opp ortunities such as lab work, clinical observations, outside studies, and more. Overall, I think making the vaccine mandatory would effect the overall performance at UNM in a negative manner. We are all there to improve ourselves and help each other learn, having that divide and restriction would hinder the success of multiple people, including myself. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 413 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Everything looks fine to me on the vaccination policy. I have already been vaccinated, and I feel like it would be best for the community if everyone is. While I hate to see anyone forced to get a shot, I feel like at this point the evidence is overwhelming that the vacc ines are safe and effective, and that they are really our only way out of this thing. Personally, I will be aending graduate classes in a little room in the Speech and Hearing Sciences clinic that has no windows, and so little ventilation. Even with masks, any case of covid is sure to spread amongst the unvaccinated, and possibly create some break throug h cases in th e vaccinated. I'm not sure yet what we will be doing with clients at the clinic who are children or often adults with not only speech & language issues, but often medically fragile as well. We really can't risk some of them getting covid, or they will have little chanc e of surviving. We have a responsibility to create as safe an environment as possible for them, and I believe that necessitates everyone, sta and students, being vaccinated.My only concern is that the vaccination cards we received can be reproduced. I could do it myself with time and effort. There are no embossed seals, holographic images, or anything else that would require special equipment and advanced skills to reproduce. Hopefully the DOH can verify or something. Thank you. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; Please implement this policy. This would make me feel safer and much more comfortable in returning to campus. I would ask that UNM not allow unvaccinated people on campus as they pose as huge risk to everyone working at UNM or attending classes. We have been stuck in this pandem ic for ov er a year and this is in large part to the people who don't want to do their part. How is any of this going to change if UNM allows them to run around on campus and risking the lives of others? Please ignore the naysayers. There is no real reason NOT to manda te vaccines. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy This policy could protect students who can't get the shots due to medical reasons. It should be approved. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully believe in mandatory vaccine requirements. I am fully vaccinated and definitely recommend it. There's nothing more important than the health of students, faculty, employees, and everyone on campus. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy As an immunocompromised individual I approve of the draft for this requirement and hope that there is a vaccine requirement Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 414 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I full support the requirement of the students and faculty being fully vaccinated before returning to campus. I (fully vaccinated) would still not want to come to campus or attend an in person class if vaccinaons were not required. Queson: If I don't feel comfortable coming back to in person learning will there be an option to have online classes? Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy The proposed policy is a commonsense measure to promote the safety and security of all campus members. Vaccination is a responsibility to each other person we interact with as a community. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think that it should be a requirement for everyone on campus to be vaccinated. Without this in place, there will be fear placed on the mental health of students. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think that all students and staff that would like to attend completely in person/on campus classes should be fully vaccinated. Those who chose not to be vaccinated can continue with online education as we all have been doing this school year. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy A required vaccination to be on campus is the safest way to return. As someone that is vaccinated, it is important to me that people remember it does not provide 100% protection. I would rather not be in enclosed spaces with students that are not also vaccinated. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think requiring the Vaccine is a good idea. I would much rather have a safe community than to coddle those who have succomed to propaganda. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy i think requiring people to be fully vaccinated to be on campus is an excellent idea and a necessary one for the safety of the students and teachers. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think mandating a vaccine to use university services and facilities is a great idea. I don't think it's fair for any Lobo to simply choose not to get it when so many have. We have already endured so much as a community in the last year; this is a fantastic way to get bac k to normal. To reach normalcy, everyone has to do their part. It's not unusual or unreasonable to require the vaccine for the safety of everyone on campus. I will say that for religious exceptions, the university should pay close attention to those requests. I know many will clai m that it goes against their religion when really it just goes against their politics. Of course, some will be honest, but I think it's a good idea to really evaluate who is genuine in those exception requests. It's really no different from the flushot (I have not turned in to a monster) and quite frankly, universities have the right to require it. Other illnesses like measles and chickenpox have been eradicated because of vaccines, and I think this one will do the same. Again, everyone needs to do their part! Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 415 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please do this, it would make so many students and families feel safer. Many other state schools are already requiring it. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I'm in favor of a vaccine requirement for on campus students and staff. In a effort to return to normal as soon as possible, and protect those using campus facilities, I feel a vaccine mandate is appropriate. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy As an upcoming student, I would definitely feel safer living on campus if everyone was full vaccinated. There are other vaccines that are required to attend public schools, let alone college. It's not required to go to college unlike K12. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think that requiring all student who wish to be apart of in person classes to have been vaccinated against SARSCOVID19 is a fantastic idea. It makes me feel valued as a student and that the university I attend cares for the well being and safety of all of its students an d faculty. Please push for making this idea a reality for all those who want to stay safe on UNM's campus. This is a matter of personal safety and well being for all of UNM'a students whether they believe in the vaccine, or covid in general, or not and I think th at requiring vaccinations with legitimate proof of vaccination should be enforced 100%. Thank you for caring for your students. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I have gotten my vaccine and I would appreciate if the UNM committee overseeing this would estate a mandatory vaccination policy for in person classes. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy A vaccine requirement is the best decision! I fully agree and support this. Vaccines should be required. Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about Safety;I agree with the proposed mandate about vaccination, to protect every one of us. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Hi there, I believe that in order to have classes in the fall it should be a requirement for students and staff to get the vaccine. I personally have already gotten the vaccine, but I worry about attending class facetoface in the fall if not a majority but al l of the campus is vaccinated by then. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I fully support the vaccine policy. Thank you for being proactive with the health and safety of everyone on campus. I'm proud to be a Lobo. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 416 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy; I wholeheartedly support this statement and proposed requirement. I would not like to be on campus with some students, staff, and faculty remaining unvaccinated. For those that cannot for religious or medical reasons, a facemask should suffice. I did wonder about the enforcement: the policy says enforcement is delay e d until at least one passes FDA approval, for those that received a different vaccine, will that be sufficient? I think it sort of says that but I think it could be clari ed. Thank you, Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about ChoiceI am comfortable with the with the vaccine protocol. I would urge you to consider keeping a close eye on the protocol for religious exceptions, as these can be dangerous and can get out of hand. Thank you for taking a firm stance for vaccines. Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about ChoiceThis is a fantastic proposal that should absolutely be implemented to make sure that COVID19 does not surge again on campus or within the state. Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about Enforcement;I think if the university is going to require vaccinations, they need to be incredibly transparent on what will get an individual exempt from the requirement. I also find it incredibly concerning that other vaccines like MMR or meningitis are not required, as these vaccinations are incredibly impor tant, es pecially in close contact spaces like university campuses. Overall, the vaccine policy is an important issue, and either way there will be individuals who are not happy. As long as there are support systems in place for all individuals, I think this could benefit the university. Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about Enforcement;Hea lth Accommoda on;I think vaccinations should be required for faculty, staff, students, etc. accessing any place on campus (with the appropriate exceptions for medical and religious reasons). I do wonder about how that can be enforced to make sure everyone on campus has been vaccinated, but it should be a requirement. Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about Safety;Above everything, UNM as an institution has a responsibility to protect its faculty, staff, and students who are utilizing/accessing its facilities. I don't see the requirement of a COVID19 vaccine as any different from requiring an array of immunizations for toddlers before entering the publicschool system. Thou g h I recognize how historical violence in health sciences and polarization among party lines over a vaccine have led to distrust, UNM should lead with science and ensure that safety is top priority. Student Supportive of Policy Concerns about Safety;Support Policy;I agree with the fact that everyone on campus should be vaccinated. I am unsure about the no masks required policy. I think it may be a little too soon for that, but perhaps I will feel dierently in August. I also hope that moving forwards, we sll learn to utilizes online resources in our classes, because they do still have their positives even when we are in person. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 417 of 425 Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I definitely agree with the proposed vaccine policy. I am an Oregon based transfer student. I have been fully vaccinated since March, but I would be much more comfortable attending UNM with the vaccine policy. I really hope this policy will be implemented. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy i think mandatory vaccines are 100% the way to go. we have to be vaccinated against meningitis, chicken pox, etc. to attend public schools and covid should be no different. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this is great to make it mandatory to get the vaccination to attend sessions in person. I personally would not feel comfortable being on campus or in classrooms with anyone who has not been vaccinated.I had a severe case of COVID19 in December and was hospitalized for it following weekly antibodies infusions at the hospital and oxygen for a month. Being that this is a life threatening illness I would not like to experience again, it makes me feel at ease knowing I'll be in attending school with other students and fac ulty who are vaccinated as well. No one knows everything about this virus and I'd rather do everything I could in prevention of getting it again. Making this mandatory will ensure my health safety for myself as well as my family who lives with me. I wou ld not attend school if this is not mandatory and will seek online classes or other alternatives of not being on campus at all for any in person involvement. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Students shouldn't be required to take the Covid Vaccine in order to return to school in the Fall. If getting the Vaccine goes against the students morals, then UNM will be losing a student. And all the work the student has done to get to UNM will be forfeited just becau se of the proposed requirement. I say No! It shouldn't be a requirement. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please for the safety and success of this university and its members, implement the vaccinaon policy. I live, sleep, eat, work, and study on campus. This is home. One of us defines all of us, and I pray UNM is represented by students who value science, data, and public safety. Not \"personal choice\". That phrase is a cover up for antivaxers who do not wish to recognized as suc h. The vaccine is safe, free, and not dependent on one person. This is a group effort. Make the tough decision so we ALL can be safe as a pack. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think requiring students and staff and anyone who wants to come on campus should be required to be vaccinated. This is because it is a choice and a privilege to be on campus, not a right (just like you must stay in good standing with the university) and so we should all be doing our part to keep everyone safe by getting vaccinated. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 420 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy As a PhD student and instructor at UNM, I fully support this policy. Students, staff, and instructors need a safe environment that is conducive to learning, and this policy appears to foster this environment. As a student and instructor who has missed being in person, UNM must provide the needed too ls to safely return; this policy appears to accomplish that goal. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Considering the magnitude of the situation we are currently living, I fully support this proposal. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I would feel more comfortable going back if vaccines were required! If they're not required I would expect there to be an alternative to inperson classes to allow for flexibility if some students don't feel comfortable being inperson with their unvaccinated counterparts. I would also hope that if they are re quired that there be adequate access to the next dose that may be required after the initial 2 (1 for J and J). Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I'm really excited to get back on campus and finish out my senior year in person. However, I'm also really nervous about going back! I would feel a lot more comfortable if I knew everyone around me was vaccinated so I think this is a wonderful policy to implement! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy As an incoming freshman who is already fully vaccinated, I think requiring vaccination of school personnel and students is a good idea. It will make the campus a safer place for students and faculty in the coming semesters, and will classes and oncampus life to continue more normally in spite of the pandemic. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe that it would be most beneficial to require students to get the vaccine before returning to campus with exemption to those that cannot get it due to a medical condition. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I agree with the idea that all students attending inperson classes should be vaccinated. It makes me feel much safer. I am hoping that those who attend inperson class unvaccinated have actual reasons for not taking the vaccine (not just being antivax) and that the university will strictly enforce that . Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please require vaccines I don't want to get sick Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Please make everyone get vaccinated. I have a pre existing condition. I would like to be in person because I have severe adhd. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 421 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I really think vaccines should be mandatory as an RA and a trip guide at recreation services it makes no sense for us not to require the vaccine. Science supports it and I want to stay safe. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy UNM should absolutely make the COVID19 Vaccine a requirement for all students, faculty, and staff who are going to be on the main campus. This is an institution that follows facts and trusts science. If this is a place that wants to protect and serve the public, UNM needs to be a part of the sol ution and not the problem and join the other universities around the country who are ensuring that their students and staff have a safe environment to go back to. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this policy is fair and well thought out, and will help keep the UNM community safe. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I absolutely think a vaccine requirement is vital to bringing back students at UNM. Requiring face masks is simply not enough. I've worked for the University Libraries since 2017. It has been offensive to see that our student patrons do not comply with the face mask requirements while using the facilities during the pa ndemic. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe that requiring the vaccine is an affective way to keep the campus safe. I see no problem with this requirement. I believe it is showing that the campus cares for our safety. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy everyone should have a vaccine. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I would really appreciate if being vaccinated was a requirement for going back to in person classes on campus. It helps ensure the safety of staff and students and would make me feel much better about returning. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Vaccines should be mandatory, especially if we are going to be sharing close spaces with our classmates (eg. buses, in class) It seems like, Atleast for my major, I have to attend a few classes in person, so I would really feel safer if the vaccine was mandatory. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think it is a great idea to require people to be fully vaccinated who are on campus! I would feel a lot safer and I think it would really help keep any covid numbers down. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Hello, I agree with the proposed plan. I believe students and faculty should be fully vaccinated prior to attending campuses or inperson classes. Thank you. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 422 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I'm not sure if I understand the reasoning of why COVID vaccines wouldn't be required for everyone stepping foot on campus in person, regardless of whether or not the FDA has approved at least one of the vaccines. UNM is a public university that serves many different communities and popu lations; therefore, requiring COVID vaccines ensures the safety and protection of everyone. This is a matter of public health and protection of our community, not one of politics or personal beliefs. Public universities require other types of vaccines (tetanus, diphtheria, etc) and that students are uptodate on their vacci nes befo re coming to campus, and the COVID vaccine should be no dierent. Thank you for your me and consideration. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think requiring students to be vaccinated would make me and others feel a lot better about their wellbeing on campus. if most of campus was vaccinated it will make it easier for events to happen and put less strain on covid practices. I would feel safer getting to know mor e people. The university would also be able to reach herd immunity on campus atleast Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy This policy is essential to getting student life on campus back to normal. I only have my senior left and I would love to have a sense of normalcy in my life again as a student. The vaccine is safe and effective, as most reasonable people know, so it makes sense to require students and staff to have the vaccine. The sooner UNM is open and students can attend safely with the comfort of knowing their fellow Lobos are vaccinated, the better. I hope this policy is implemented so we can get back to enjoying UNM the way we did befo re the pandemic shut it all down. Thank you. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think this proposal is a really good start to bringing everyone back to campus in a safe way. I would love to be able to see my grandma without worrying that people are unvaccinated and spreading the virus more than is needed. I think this is something that is very important to keep everyone including students, faculty, and staff safe come fall. Hopefully people will finally realize how serious this is and follow the guidelines so we do not have to return to online learning! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think students should be required to have proof of vaccinations, especially if they do not want to wear masks. Fall 2021 will have a lot more inperson classes, and the last thing the university wants is a second wave that recloses the school. Confirming people that aren ' t wearing masks have been fully vaccinated will help prevent the spread of the virus and we can get back to normal faster. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 423 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe that if there are requirements to be vaccinated, it will provide the very less likelihood of a covid outbreak. Thus ruining not only my chances but the other students and staff's chances to socialize and be human. I know there are people out there who don't really lik e this but i believe in not only protecting ourselves but also protecting others. I havent even experienced college as a social setting (and to get to know my instructors) here at UNM. And truthfully, it sucks to not get to know new people... Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I believe the vaccine should be mandatory for staff, faculty and students to get if they want to be on campus. I support mandated vaccination. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy While I want everyone at UNM to be vaccinated, I don't think requiring the vaccine is right. Especially for out of state logos who haven't had the ability to get their shot yet. I do support requiring vaccines for all employees and those who want to live on campus thou gh. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Hello,Please instute a vaccine requirement for the Fall 2021 semester. I do not feel safe whatsoever having people with an exponentially higher chance of spreading covid around me in classrooms and buildings. I have family members who are immuno compromised. Don't bow to the selfish antivaxxers and push for an option tha t will keep our community and students safe. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy Yes!!! I would feel so much safer if I knew everyone around me was vaccinated! I love the idea of this policy! Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I think you should absolutely require vaccines. People have been required to have vaccines for years to attend school. What makes this different than getting the measles vaccine for kindergarten? They exist for a specific purpose: to keep us and others safe in a closed environment. If kids weren't require d vaccines fo r elementary school there would be small kids dying left and right from completely preventable diseases. Technology has advanced and so should we. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy It would make me feel much better if everyone was vaccinated on campus. It would make me feel safe and I believe a fully vaccinated community would be a much more conducive environment for learning. Without being worried about COVID, if everyone were vaccinated, we would be able to focus on our learning . Thank you for taking this into consideration. Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy I appreciate the vaccine requirement. Wednesday, August 4, 2021 Page 424 of 425Affiliation Sentiment Category Comment Student Supportive of Policy Support Policy This is a great proposal and I will feel much safer on campus with the majority of people I interact with being vaccinated.
