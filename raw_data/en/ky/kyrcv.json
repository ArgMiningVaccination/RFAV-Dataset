In addition to alleviating and managing neck and back pain, chiropractic care can also be used to boost the immune system. Residents of Altamonte Springs, FL, who are looking to have an immune system boost can book an appointment at Beyond Medical. Our chiropractor will provide you with all the help you need to boost your immune system. Chiropractic care is a form of therapy where the body is aligned using hands or small devices to manipulate the body's alignment to alleviate pain and improve function. Chiropractors and other trained professionals perform the therapy. The immune system protects the body from infectious organisms and toxins and helps the body to recover from injury. It comprises proteins, tissues, cells, and organs. The cells making up the immune system are white blood cells, while the organs are comprised of lymph nodes, bone marrow, and thymus. Immunity helps keep the body healthy and free of diseases and infections. A body with a weak immune system is highly prone to infections, injuries, and allergies. The spine is a key part of the immune system because the brain communicates with the rest of the body through the spinal cord. This means that a spinal cord misalignment can adversely affect the immune system and increase the chances of disease and illness. Although chiropractic care focuses on relieving neck and back pain, the adjustments help improve the immune system. Chiropractic care also boosts the immune system by enhancing the function of the nervous system by allowing the movement of the spinal bones in the spinal cord. Additionally, chiropractic care boosts the immune system by alleviating anxiety and stress, both of which are infamous for weakening the immune system and worsening illnesses. Chiropractic care also relieves muscle tension and improves blood circulation.
