I only bought this recently so I tried it just for a couple of times but so far I'm very happy with the results. I like the scent and my hair looks really nice and smooth. I've tried a few other shampoo from high end brands but I didn't get the same effect so I might stick with this one for some time. I'm really happy with the purchase to the point that I'm considering to buy the mask as well. I'm impressed. I'm so impressed with this product. I bought it as I've moved into an area with hard water which was making my hair feel horrible and greasy within a day. I also have balayage. After washing it felt soft and the colour was better too. I left it 4 days before washing and it still wasn't greasy. I highly recommend. The most beautiful shampoo/cleanser for the hair. This shampoo is a serious game changer, I love the fragrance. Since using it on my hair after my latest hair colour, my hair has never been in better condition not to mention the incredible SHINE!!!!!! Gentle and light. It really helps to keep my colour looking good for longer. And it is very light and gentle on your scalp. You don't ned much at all so it should last a while. I am very pleased with it. Strong zesty smell, shiny results. This shampoo has a very strong fresh zingy zesty smell. The shampoo is of thick consistency and feels quite heavy when working into hair, a little goes a long way. I have bleached and coloured damaged hair. I used this without conditioner so I could really see what the product did for my hair. Initially my hair was quite knotty after washing and felt dry ( I have some bleach damage). But once dry, my hair looked shiny and voluminous. The scent has staying power too, which has its pros and cons depending if you like the smell as it with be for everyone. "}
