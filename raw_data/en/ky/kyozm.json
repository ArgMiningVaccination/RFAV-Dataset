Flow achieves this magic with the skillful combination of nature imagery, music and the genuine, accessible voice of Tristan Elizabeth Gribbin.\" Craig Mackie Professor of Mindfulness and Certified Psychotherapist \"I had a chance to try Flow in virtual reality and I was blown away. I am very skeptical of technology and especially in the world of mindfulness where we are taught to practice as if the most important environment is inside the mind - not dependent on the external world. The experience reminded me of going on retreat, being lead by a skillful guide in a sacred place. It presents a complete package to rejuvenate, de-stress, and calm.\" Ylva Berg CIO at Coor Service Management \"We enjoyed working with the Flow team and we gathered valuable data to show that having Flow at Coor has shown there is a correlation between meditation in VR and improvements in stress, well-being, happiness, energy and focus. Flow's combined focus on health and innovation is very well in line with Coor's ambitions about increasing the well-being in the workplace, for our employees and for our customers.\" G\u00f6ran Elovsson CEO at AIM Sweden \"After trying Flow: \"I found Nirvana. This is incredible. I can see myself using this at my desk at work every day to de-stress.\" Krist\u00edn Gestsd\u00f3ttir HR Manager at Vodafone Iceland \"The Flow workshop was a real success.
