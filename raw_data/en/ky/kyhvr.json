Get Vaccinated for the Flu It is more important now than ever before that you get your flu shot. Here's why: - To protect yourself and those around you - To prevent flu in communities most at-risk for influenza and COVID-19 - To protect our healthcare system, reserving resources for those who become ill with COVID-19 Flu vaccine facts: - The flu shot is the best way to prevent the flu. The CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important step in protecting against flu viruses. - The flu vaccine is safe, and is recommended for everyone 6 months of age and older. - Flu vaccine does not cause the flu because the virus used is dead or weakened so it cannot make you ill. Fewer than 1% of people develop flu-like symptoms, such as mild fever and muscle aches, after vaccination. These side effects are not the same as having the actual disease. The more people vaccinated prior to the arrival of the flu, the lower the risk to our community, especially those most vulnerable to illness. Get your Records Need immunization records?
