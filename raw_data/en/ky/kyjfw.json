Objectives: To determine the clinical and cost- effectiveness of using NPWT in obese women havingelective and semiurgent CS. Methods and analysis: A multisite, superiority parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial with aneconomic evaluation. Women with a body mass index(BMI) of 30, booked for elective and semiurgent CS at 4 Australian acute care hospitals will be targeted.A total of 2090 women will be enrolled. A centralisedrandomisation service will be used with participantsblock randomised to either NPWT or standard surgicaldressings in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by hospital. Theprimary outcome is SSI; secondary outcomes includetype of SSI, length of stay, readmission, woundcomplications and health-related quality of life.Economic outcomes include direct healthcare costsand cost-effectiveness, which will be evaluated using incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Data will be collected at baseline, and participantsfollowed up on the second postoperative day andweekly from the day of surgery for 4 weeks. Outcomeassessors will be masked to allocation. The primarystatistical analysis will be based on intention-to-treat. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval has been obtained from the ethics committees of theparticipating hospitals and universities. The findings ofthe trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewedjournals, national and international conferencepresentations. Trial registration number: ACTRN12615000286549; Pre-results. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Between 187 and 281 million surgical proce- dures are performed around the world each year, or 1 for every 25 people.1Surgical site infections (SSIs) are de ned as infectionsoccurring up to 30 days after surgery that affect the incision, deep tissue at the oper- ation site or involve the organs or bodyspaces. 2Of concern is that SSIs occur in up to 30% of all surgical procedures, and arethe third most commonly reported hospitalacquired infection in many countries. 3-5SSIs have many negative effects including increas-ing the risk of death, prolonging hospitalisa- tion and increasing costs. 4 Obesity is an independent predictor of SSI.67Obese pregnant women are twice as likely to have a caesarean section (CS) than non-obese women.89Postoperative infection is a potential complication of all surgeries including CS; however, overweight and obese women are three times more likely todevelop a SSI. 10SSI extends hospital length of stay (HLOS) by up to 6 days in womenundergoing obstetric and gynaecologicalsurgery and hospital readmission is more likely, increasing hospital costs by US$14 000 for each SSI. 11 The use of negative pressure wound therapy in primary wounds Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) iswidely used, particularly in the management of wounds healing by secondary intention and for skin grafts. 12-15However, NPWT is increasingly being applied prophylactically to closed surgical wounds in high-risk popula- tions to reduce the incidence of SSI. Thisuse of prophylactic NPWT is generally applied to wounds perceived as being at high risk of SSI, for example, CS incisions inobese women. 14 15A recent Cochrane review concluded that evidence for the clinicaleffectiveness of prophylactic NPWT in redu-cing SSI and wound dehiscence is inconclusive. 16 Two further randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NPWT have subsequently 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287 1Open Access Protocolgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from published; both were feasibility studies.17 18One of these trials examined the use of NPWT in 70 patients under- going primary hip replacement.18The other pilot study17recruited 92 women undergoing elective CS and has demonstrated that a de nitive trial is feasible. Neither of these trials was powered to nd an effect, so the bene ts or harms of NPWT for prophylactic use remain unclear. Thus, a RCT to evaluate the clinical and cost- effectiveness of NPWT in obese women undergoing CS is timely and responds to the imperative to provide much-needed evidence to guide practice in a rapidlydeveloping and costly area of healthcare. Primary objective To compare the effects of prophylactic NPWT and stand-ard surgical dressings on the incidence of SSI in obese women undergoing CS. Secondary objectives To compare: (1) the incidence of super cial, deep, organ/space SSI; (2) the number of dressing changes; (3) the number and type of wound complications (ie, dehiscence, haematoma, seroma, adverse events (AEs)); (4) the number of readmissions; (5) HLOS(days); (6) health-related quality of life (QoL); and (7) direct healthcare costs in obese women undergoing CS who receive prophylactic NPWT with women whoreceive standard surgical dressings. Study design Multicentre, parallel group, pragmatic, randomised con-trolled superiority trial. METHODS Study setting and population Four acute care public hospitals offering obstetric ser- vices in Queensland, Australia, have agreed to partici-pate. Across the four sites, the number of births ranges from 2400 to 10 000 per annum. The study population will consist of 2090 women with a BMI of 30, undergo- ing either elective or semiurgent CS. Eligibility criteria According to national and international guidelines, CS urgency is based on these four categories: (1) life- threatening to woman or fetus; (2) maternal or fetalcompromise, not life-threatening; (3) needing earlier CS than planned without maternal or fetal compromise; and (4) a scheduled time acceptable to the woman andCS team. 19 20 Inclusion criteria : 1. Women booked for elective CS surgery (category 4);2. Women whose condition changes to require a semiur- gent CS (categories 2- 3); 3. Recorded pre-pregnancy BMI of 30 at the rst ante- natal visit; and4. Able to provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria : 1. Women who require an urgent CS (category 1) at any point; 2. Existing infection after admission to hospital in labour/immediately prior to CS; 3. Previous participation in this trial; and4. Unable to speak or understand English, with no interpreter available. Interventions While this will be a pragmatic trial, a checklist based onpublished current clinical practice guidelines and Queensland Maternity and Neonatal Guidelines will be used to standardise the CS surgical procedure. The par-ticipating obstetrician 's clinical judgement may produce slight variation in practice in the type of wound closure(ie, closure of facial layer as well as rectus muscle); selec-tion of suture materials (ie, staples vs hydrocolloid). There isno evidence to suggest that the aforementioned minor variations in clinical practice increase the risk of SSI. Intervention At the completion of skin closure, women randomly allo- cated to the NPWT arm of the trial will receive a PICO(Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) dressing applied by the obstetrician under sterile conditions. The PICO product was chosen because it is lightweight and disposable, sig-nicantly cheaper than other options, and has per- formed well in a pilot study. 17It comprises a small, discrete pump, powered by two AA-lithium batteries witha highly absorbent dressing that holds the wound exudate away from the skin, thus negating the need for a bulky canister. The polyurethane foam dressing will besecured over the incision by the application of an adhe- sive drape. A tube is embedded into the foam, and con- tinuous negative pressure of 80 mm Hg will be appliedto the dressing. Control Women in the control arm will have a standard dressing based on the obstetrician 's usual preference, applied according to the manufacturer 's recommendations after skin closure. In both groups, we anticipate the dressingwill remain in situ for 4- 5 days, unless it becomes soiled or dislodged, in which case a new dressing of the same type will be applied. Given the pragmatic nature of this trial, the number of days dressings are left in situ and the number of dressings used will be recorded. Toensure consistency, clinicians providing care to the target population at each of the sites will receive trial- specic education (NPWT and standard). The research assistants (RAs) who will also receive trial-speci c train- ing will be available to clinical staff during businesshours to provide ongoing training and support aboutcorrect use of the dressings, as well as monitoring 2 Gillespie BM, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from dressing changes and completing documentation daily to assess protocol compliance and outcomes. If our monitoring shows variation from the proposed protocol,this variation will be used as a factor in the analyses. Outcome measures The primary outcome is the incidence of an SSI in the CS wound at any time up to 28 days after surgery. The following secondary outcomes will be assessed: depth of SSI, that is, super cial, deep or organ/body space 3; number of and dehiscence, haematoma,seroma, blisters). secondary outcomes: will be measured in days; number of hospital readmissions will be measuredwithin 4 weeks from the day of surgery. The secondary outcome, health-related QoL will be assessed using the Short Form (SF)-12v2 (acute 1-week recall). The SF-12v2will be administered at baseline (ie, recruitment at >36/ 40 weeks in women having elective CS, or on the day of CS for women undergoing semiurgent CS), and via tele-phone interview weekly for four consecutive weeks after surgery. Direct healthcare costs will be included as part of an economic evaluation. Participant timeline and trial duration Participants will be enrolled in the study for 28 daysfrom the day of surgery ( Table 1). The project will take up to 5 years to complete, with recruitment and data col-lection expected to occur over 3.5 years. Participants willexit the trial when they: withdraw consent; have been in the trial for 28 days postrandomisation; are lost to follow-up; die; or for another reason have to exit basedon the clinical judgement of the attending healthcare professional. Sample size The sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome, SSI. Based on other related publishedstudies, 21 22we conservatively estimate the baseline SSI incidence in obese CS women to be 15%. Following dis-cussions with infectious disease experts and obstetri-cians, we have accepted an absolute difference between groups of 5% to be clinically important. Therefore, to achieve over 90% power to test the superiority of SSIincidence between groups, 950 women per group will be required (Power Analysis & Sample Size system (PASS, V .12), NCSS). To allow for attrition, a further 10%(n=95) will be recruited to each group for a total sample of 2090 (1045/group). We anticipate recruiting approxi- mately 600 women per year, thus recruitment should becompleted in about 3.5 years. Recruitment of participants We will use a staged approach to recruitment, starting at one site to test procedures, prior to starting at the other sites. All obese women will be given an information bro-chure informing them of the trial during their routineantenatal visit at 36 weeks. This strategy will facilitate further discussion and assist with consent processes in labour in the event that a semiurgent CS is required.Women booked for an elective CS will be given the opportunity to provide written consent during their antenatal visit (36/40 weeks). On the day of surgery,women undergoing elective CS will be screened to ensure they continue to meet the inclusion criteria; those who have not yet provided written consent will beinvited to do so. Women undergoing semiurgent CS will be consented on the day of surgery. Figure 1 shows anticipated participant flow through the study. Implementation of sequence generation and allocation concealmentWomen booked for elective CS will not be randomised at recruitment as the long time lag between randomisa- tion and receiving the intervention which could lead topoor adherence to allocation and loss to follow-up. All women who continue to meet the eligibility require- ments will be randomised using a centralised, independ-ent, web-based randomisation system. The RA will randomise participants in the operating room at the start of their CS procedure and advise the operatingobstetrician and nursing staff of the allocated treatment as close to the end of the procedure as possible in order to minimise performance bias. The allocation sequencewill be used to ensure allocation concealment. To reduce predictability of a random sequence, randomly varying block sizes of four, six and eight will be used. Blinding This pragmatic trial tests a clinical intervention that is not amenable to protection against performance bias through the blinding of participants, clinical staff ordata collectors. To minimise the potential for outcome detection bias, an expert clinician, blinded to group allocation, willassess the data to determine the primary outcome. The trial statistician and coordinating principal investigator (PI) will also be blinded. It is unlikely that entries to themedical records and hospital databases will be falsi ed; thus, lack of blinding for these outcomes should notaffect the data integrity. Subjective outcomes (woundcomplications, QoL) are reported by patients or observed by RAs, who cannot be blinded because they need to check the dressings and document participants ' responses. Performance bias is a consideration when clinical staff cannot be blinded. To assess the risk of performancebias, a standardised set of questions will be used to docu- ment the number of dressing changes and/or protocol violations occurring during the hospital stay, and follow-ing discharge. We considered using dressings where tubing was attached to a suction apparatus in both groups; however, participants, staff and data collectorswould almost certainly be aware if suction was activated Gillespie BM, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287 3Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from Table 1 Timeline of trial activities Study period Allocation (day 0) EnrolmentElective CSSemiurgentCS Postallocation Time dayspostoperative Closeout Enrolment Inpatient Day of surgery up to 28 days Eligibility screen 36/40-week antenatal visit X XDay of CS X X Informed consent 36/40-week antenatal visit X XDay of CS X X Baseline data 36/40-week antenatal visit X XDay of CS X X Randomisation during CSprocedureXX InterventionS (4 -5 days insitu) NPWT dressing XX X X X Standard dressing XX X XInpatient SSI screening XBlood culture XAB therapy X BM, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from and we decided it was most important to measure 'real- world 'effects and conduct a pragmatic trial. Data collection The RAs will collect SSI-related data on day 2 (postsur- gery) using a structured form. In Queensland, Australia,the Centre for Healthcare Related Infection Surveillance and Prevention provides guidelines identifying SSI signs and symptoms (ie, redness, swelling, pain/tenderness, dehis-cence, watery or purulent discharge), both during hospi- talisation and after hospital discharge. Data which will be collected from a variety of sources including chartaudit, direct observation and patient self-report both during hospitalisation and after discharge. RAs will record dressings used and antibiotic medication. Datacollection will occur on weekdays (Monday to Friday). Clinical outcome data will be collected by the RAs retro- spectively though telephone interviews and by accessingparticipants 'medical records. After hospital discharge, all women will be telephoned weekly (from their day of surgery) and outcomesassessed using a series of questions, which have been used successfully in other research in this area. 17 18 22 Seven-day recall of SSI symptoms and related resource use including health professional visits (eg, consultations with general practitioners (GPs)) was demonstrated as being feasible in a recently published pilot trial17and will allow accurate SF-12v2 and costing data to be collected. RAs will collect and directly enter data while in the clinical areas, using portable computers with a purpose-built database and form-based interface (ie, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database). Clinical characteristics such as age, comorbidities and other riskfactors for SSI, such as nicotine use and length of oper- ation, will be collected at baseline. Recruitment anddata collection will be monitored by the clinical trial coordinator (CTC) weekly and monthly reports will be presented to the study investigators. While there is apotential for loss to follow-up, our pilot study has demonstrated retention rates of >85%. 17We will also use standard procedures, such as recording alternative phone and email contacts for participants and GPs, in order to assist with tracing women who may have moved house/changed internet providers, etc. Ascertainment of the primary outcome SSI-related data will be given to the two blinded expert clinicians, who will compare the data against criteria dened by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Guideline for Prevention of SSI3to decide if a SSI exists. We will use decision rules to ascertain the primary outcome.If the two blinded expert clinicians disagree on whetherthe patient has sustained a SSI within the 28-day post- operative period, we will use the following combinations with regard to wound infection: yes/no, yes/unsure, no/unsure:Table 1 Continued Study period Allocation EnrolmentElective CSSemiurgentCS Postallocation Time dayspostoperative Closeout Postdischarge Wound Resource use associated withCS woundXXXX SF-12 v2 XXXX SSI screen (chart audit) XX Closeout hospital site visit X AB, antibiotic; BMI, body mass index; CS, caesarean section; NPWT, wound therapy; RR, risk ratio; SF-12, Short Form; SSI, surgical Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287 5Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from 1. If the two assessors say: 'yes/unsure 'then we will say the patient has a SSI, using the data provided by the assessor who said 'yes'. 2. If the two assessors say: 'no/unsure 'then we will say the patient does not have a SSI. 3. If the two assessors say: 'unsure/unsure 'then we will say the patient does not have a SSI. 4. If the two assessors say: 'yes/no 'then the third asses- sor will be consulted and will decide if there is a SSI or not. The third assessor 's decision will be nal. If s/he is unsure whether the patient has a SSI or not, then the patient will be considered not to have a SSI. Training, outcome assessment and treatment fidelity Adhering to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) recommenda-tions, 23this multisite study will have an experienced CTC coordinating the RA training, and site and data monitor-ing. Trial-speci c RA training to assess the patient 's inci- sion/dressing site will be provided by a tissue viability nurse. Additional training in the use of the PICO NPWT dressing product will be provided by a Smith & Nephewclinical nurse educator with specialist knowledge but with no role in the design, analysis or reporting of the study. Involving a product specialist in the training of theRAs and clinicians who will be using the PICO product ensures that all end-users receive comprehensive and consistent information relative to the appropriate useand management of the study intervention. The RAs will undergo group and individual onsite training to ensure consistency across the four sites. Areas covered willinclude recruitment and data collection processes, use of the central randomisation service and database. Consistent with GCP recommendations, 23a standar- dised operating procedure manual has been developedto provide more speci c detail on the protocol, plans for dealing with intervention delity issues, and monitor- ing the delivery and receipt of the intervention. Assessment of treatment delity will focus on type of dressing used, duration of use and number of dressing changes. While this is a pragmatic trial, obtaining infor- mation on intervention delity may help to explain study results. All members of the research team, includ- ing RAs, will be provided with training, a procedure manual and a DVD detailing the NPWT dressing appli-cation to ensure protocol consistency. A trial-speci c training programme and ongoing education sessions tar-geting obstetricians, operating room staff, midwives andnurses will also be implemented at each site. Withdrawal If a participant decides to withdraw from the trial afterconsent is given, any existing data obtained during the trial will be retained and no further follow-up data col- lected. A withdrawal form will be completed and reasonsfor withdrawal noted. Patients who withdraw from rando- mised treatment prior to randomisation will be left in the study and reported in the flow chart as 'not receiv- ing randomised intervention '. Patients who withdraw after they have received the intervention (ie, after dress- ing application) will also be included and reported intheflow chart as 'receiving randomised treatment '. Data managementAll data will be managed using a centralised REDCap(Nashville, Tennessee, USA) database repository, hosted on a dedicated secure server within the Clinical Trials Unit at Grif th University. The trial statistician will not have access to the database to ensure he remainsFigure 1 Anticipated participant flow through study. 6 Gillespie BM, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from blinded to group allocation. This database enables dif- ferent levels of data access, allowing researcher control over who sees the les and what they can do with them. Data access will therefore be restricted and all data pass- word protected. Each site RA will have a level of access to the database speci c to their site and position, and will use a password-protected tablet computer for data entry into REDCap. An electronic case report form (eCRF) will be devel- oped in collaboration with the trial statistician, coordin-ating PI and CTC. The eCRF will be hosted on the REDCap database within the Grif th University 's Clinical Trials Unit. Source data will be entered by the site RAs, who will receive trial-speci c training in the use of the eCRF . All entered data will be directly exported into the IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS V .22.0, New York, USA) for analysis. Identifiable data For the purposes of statistical analysis, data will be anon- ymised and collated by the CTC and uploaded intoSPSS. Identi able data will be entered on the eCRF to enable follow-up. These data will be de-identi ed when transferred to the statistical database. Participants will beidenti ed on the statistical database using a unique code and hospital site initials. Statistical analysis Primary analysesPrior to analysis, a rigorous process of data cleaning to check outlying gures, missing and implausible data against source data will be undertaken. Baseline characteristics of the patients in each arm of the trial will be calculated using descriptive statistics. We will employ an intention-to-treat approach for the primaryanalysis with the population de ned as all trial partici- pants who completed the baseline assessment andunderwent surgery and received the intervention. AEswill be analysed and reported on a per protocol analysis. The incidence of SSI per 1000 patients between groups will be compared. Risk ratios (RR), 95% CIs andp values assuming a 5% signi cance level will be presented. For the primary outcome, the numberneeded to treat and absolute risk reduction will be calcu-lated from the RR. While we do not anticipate differ- ences between groups in terms of known or unknown prognostic factors due to randomisation, adjusted ana-lyses using multivariate logistic regression models will be used if any difference in prognostic variables is detected. Despite every effort to minimise missing values it is pos-sible that some may occur. We will evaluate the utility of empirical imputation methods in such cases and only impute them if the explanatory power of the empiricalimputation models is robust. To assess the representative- ness of the sample, we will compare the characteristics of the women in our sample with secondary data avail-able at state and national levels.Secondary analyses Secondary end points will be compared between groups using statistical methods appropriate to the distributionof measures. A random sample of 5% of the data will be rechecked for accuracy against source data. RRs with 95% CI will be calculated for clinical outcome data.Analysis will be performed by one of the study investiga- tors (blinded to group allocation), trained in biostatistics. Economic evaluation Direct costs to the healthcare system will be obtainedfrom patient records/hospital cost centres (during hos- pital admission) and self-reported by women (weekly for 4 weeks post surgery). Resources costed during admis-sion will include dressings and related wound manage- ment products, medications related to SSI (ie, use of antibiotics), and resources used to manage any adverseeffects of the dressing. Use of dressings, medications and health professional appointments related to wound management will be recorded at weekly intervals for4 weeks following surgery. Direct costs will be assigned using standard costing sources (eg, Medicare Bene ts and Pharmaceutical Bene ts Schedules; Independent Hospital Pricing Authority). The Australian-re ned diagnostic-related groups will be used to indicate the costs associated with each hospital admission, adjustedfor HLOS. Cost-effectiveness analysis A within-trial economic evaluation will be undertaken from the health system perspective to compare the costs and effects of NPWT , relative to the standard dressing.Parametric (eg, analysis of covariance) or non- parametric bootstrapping techniques 24will be employed to compare the mean difference in the total costs between groups. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken based on the primary outcome measure (SSI). Additionally, a cost-utility analysis will be per-formed using the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) as the outcome measure. The QALY gain associated with NPWT will be estimated based on SF-12v2 utilityweights. 24Uncertainty around the incremental cost- effectiveness ratios will be tested using one-way sensitivityanalysis and non-parametric bootstrapping methods. 24 The inform recommen- dations on adopting NPWT dressings for CS surgical wounds in clinical practice. Safety and data monitoring An AE is de ned as an untoward medical occurrence experienced by the participant, whether or not consid- ered treatment related.25In this trial, AE will be classi- as non-serious (infection, pain, maceration, odour) and serious (dehiscence, return to theatre). Both typesof AE would be expected to occur equally in both treat- ment groups. Patients will be monitored for potentialAEs, serious and non-serious. All AEs reported will be et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287 7Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from assessed to determine whether further diagnostic investi- gation or treatment is warranted. If an AE occurs, appro- priate treatment will be given. Monitoring and reportingof suspected unexpected adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be performed by the site PI and the research team. All SUSARs will be recorded on a dedicated eCRF .Serious AEs associated with the intervention are consid- ered unlikely, although if any are reported the relevant Human Research Ethics Committees will be noti ed, with appropriate noti cation of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) as required. The results of the trial will be reviewed every 6 months by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) including an obstetrician, a statisti- cian and a tissue viability nurse, all of whom will be inde-pendent of the study. The DSMC has the ability to terminate the trial prematurely if there is unacceptable harm associated with the treatment. 26If requested by the DSMC, an interim analysis will be performed by a statistician (independent of the DSMC), blinded for the treatment allocation. Auditing Data monitoring of this trial will ensure compliance withGCP . 23The participating sites will provide access to all trial-related source data/documents and reports for thepurposes of monitoring, auditing and inspection bylocal authorities. The CTC will undertake monitoring in relation to the accuracy of the case report data collected by the site RAs. During the trial, the CTC will use sourcedata to verify the data entered by the RAs into the eCRF . Ethics and dissemination This trial has been approved by the relevant hospital ethics boards and the respective universities where the PIs are employed. This study will be conducted inaccordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) NationalStatement. 27 Dissemination strategies will include knowledge trans- lation events involving opinion leaders and stakeholders.Findings will be presented at local hospital and other fora and a press release will be prepared. A succinct non-technical paper discussing the relevance of ndings and application to practice, and recommendations for future research, will be prepared and disseminated to the colleges representing the relevant health profes-sional groups. Abstracts will be submitted to major inter- national meetings of infection control, nursing/ midwifery and medical groups. We envisage the resultswill be published in high-impact generalist and specialist journals. We will bring the published study to the atten- tion of the Cochrane Wounds Group and the authors ofthe relevant Cochrane review to ensure early inclusion in review updates. The results will have international application and we anticipate that they will be rapidlyadopted and cited within the GCP literature.DISCUSSION Despite a lack of rigorous evidence to support either clinical or cost-effectiveness, NPWT is increasingly beingused as a prophylaxis against SSI in high-risk surgical groups such as obese women undergoing CS. To the best of our knowledge, this RCT will be the largest of its kindin this area. It has signi cant potential to inform practice because it assesses the clinical and cost-effectiveness ofusing NPWT in a patient population at high risk of incur-ring an SSI. A RCT design with a suf ciently large sample is time consuming and expensive to undertake,but it is nevertheless necessary to determine the ef cacy of NPWT in the management of surgical incisions. Our trial has several strengths. First, the RCT design with a robust randomisation process will ensure that anydifference in outcomes between the groups is attribut- able to the intervention. Second, a pragmatic approach allows testing of an intervention that re flects the reality of the clinical environment relative to study population, intervention, comparator and outcomes. 26Third, an independent clinician, blinded to group allocation will assess these data to determine SSI status. Fourth, the embedding of an economic evaluation responds to the need to provide healthcare administrators and decision-makers with meaningful cost-effectiveness data. Finally, this trial is independent of industry funding, and there- fore minimises potential for a con flict of interest which may bias the results. While we envisage that the results of this trial will provide clinicians with de nitive answers around the effectiveness of NPWT in this speci c patient popula- tion, undertaking this 5-year trial is not without its chal-lenges, including meeting our recruitment targetswithin a 3.5-year timeframe. For each hospital site, yearly recruitment targets will need to range from 120 to 200 women. To maximise both recruitment and generalis-ability, we will include women who are undergoing both elective and semiurgent CS. Another major challenge is the potential for missing outcome data due to partici-pant attrition as participants in this study will typically be busy with childcare and other commitments postopera- tively. Yet in a recent pilot study, participant attrition wasless than 10%, 17which is considered acceptable. Maximising participant retention over a 4-week follow-upperiod will be achieved by the RAs meeting womenface-to-face during pregnancy/labour and again post- operatively. These meetings will enable a relationship of trust to be developed and allow the RAs to resolve anyqueries promptly. It will also provide opportunities for the RAs to recon rm women 's contact details and remind them about the four weekly telephone follow- ups. In the event that an RA is unsuccessful in their rst attempt to contact women following discharge, they willtry again, perhaps using their alternative contact details.Finally, during the 3.5-year data collection period, there may be clinical innovations introduced that potentially influence the trial outcomes (ie, 'history '). However, we anticipate that both groups to be equally in fluenced. 8 Gillespie BM, et al.BMJ Open 2016; 6:e010287. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010287Open Accessgroup.bmj.com on May 27, 2016 - Published by http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ Downloaded from Author affiliations 1NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Nursing, Centre for Health Practice Innovation (HPI), Menzies Health Institute Qld (MHIQ), Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia 2Research Centre for Clinical Nursing, Royal Brisbane and Women 's Hospital and Griffith University, Nathan, Queensland, Australia 3Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Griffith University School of Medicine and Director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Gold Coast UniversityHospital, Australia 4Mater Research Institute and The University of Queensland (MRI-UQ), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia 5Department of Health Economics, Pharmacoeconomics & Quality Use of Medicines, School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Australia 6Department of Health Sciences, College of Arts & Science, Qatar University, Qatar 7School of Nursing, Midwifery & Social Work, The University of Manchester, UK 8West Moreton Hospital and Health Service, Ipswich, Queensland, Australia 9NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Nursing, Menzies Health Institute Qld (MHIQ), Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia Contributors BMG, JW and WC conceived of the study.
