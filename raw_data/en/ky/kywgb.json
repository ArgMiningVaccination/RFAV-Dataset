The senses are portrayed as human spirits. These senses, when used inappropriately, can allow the spirits of deceit to overcome a person and lead them to sin. Seeing, tasting and hearing can all be distorted by the spirits of deceit. When this happens a part of person's nature is replaced with that of the forces of evil. The Testaments thus problematise the self and the body as a bonded category. - Notes: - Tom de Bruin. \"A Bad Taste in My Mouth: Spirits as Embodied Senses in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\" Journal for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies 4.1 (2022): 17-38. - Metadata: [xml](https://hcommons.org/deposits/download/hc:47413/descMetadata/xml/) - Status: - Published - Last Updated: - 1 year ago - License: [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) - A Bad Taste in My Mouth: Spirits as Embodied Senses in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs "}
