He did amazing work and I'm happy to say that I am recovering well. The thing, however, that really stood out to me about him is his knowledge of my injury. I was walking around with a serious injury that was emergent and honestly needed surgery ASAP but due to many- and I mean many- misdiagnoses from other doctors. I believe I had 5 doctors before I was sent to him for discussion about surgery. He was to the point, smart, well informed. It was unlike the other doctors I saw beforehand. His certifications are well earned and his hard work and skills really do show. I would recommend him to any one of my friends who get injured in any other sports season. - My son was reffered to Dr. Schamale at 3 months of birth for a femur fracture that he suffered just whithin a week of his birth while still in NICU at another hospital. As a firsts time parent I was terrified, had no trust in medical facilities since my sons leg injury, I was angry, bitter, doubtful, had no sympathy or respect for anyone in the medical field. My son had been evaluated by another medical hospital to asses injury and future treatment. We were informed he might never walk or crawl or even sit due to his injury and a short right leg femur. When we met Dr. Schamle we were skeptical at first, but the more we talked to him the more we were assured that this would not be my sons future. He explain possible treatments and surgeries he would have to undergo through, the stages and age he would be when these took place, the out come from each individual procedure. While it did take some time for us to re gain our trust in anyone in the medical field I can honestly say that he patiently demonstrated to us with every treatment and surgery that not all doctors work in the same manner. I am very happy to share that my son is as normal and as active as any 8 year old boy. Dr. Schamle Thank you for being so passionate about what you do. For taking the time to calm our nerves and making this as easy as possible. You deleted any doubt we have, we feel truly blessed to have had the pleasure of having you as our son's doctor. We feel we are in great hands while at Children's and this is all in big part because of you. We still have a long jurney ahead of us but we will for ever be greatful for all you've done for our family. - I have the pleasure of highly recommending Dr. Schmale as a hip doctor. I had a SCFE back in April of 2001 and needed emergency surgery to correct my condition. Dr. Schmale performed the initial surgery as well as 2 follow up surgeries to fix the injury. He scheduled multiple doctor visits afterwards to keep track of my progress and make sure that the hip was healing correctly. Through these appointments, I never felt rushed at all and Dr. Shmale took the time to explain everything to me; even in words that a 12 year old could understand. Throughout my time as Dr. Schmale's patient, I greatly appreciated his expertise in the field and felt very confident in his ability to diagnose and treat my case. I would highly recommend Dr. Schmale.
