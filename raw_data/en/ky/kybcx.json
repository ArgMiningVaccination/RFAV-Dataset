Contains Wheat and Milk REMOVE FLATBREAD FROM PLASTIC WRAPPING. THAW FOR 15-30 MINUTES for the best pizza experience - it really makes a difference! It takes about the same amount of time to thaw as it takes for your oven to preheat. While the pizza thaws, preheat the oven to 425. Place directly on oven rack. Bake for 5-8 minutes. The crust should be lightly crisp to the touch, the cheese bubbly. The trick is not to overcook. It will make your flatbread dry. Remove from oven, slice, serve and ENJOY! NOT READY TO EAT. This product must be cooked to an internal temperature of 165F prior to eating. Refrigerate any unused heated portion. Tip: It's a good idea to place another pan or a piece of aluminum foil on the rack below the pizza (not directly on bottom of oven) to catch any drips while baking. "}
