Keywords:AdjuvantInnate defence regulator peptideHost defense peptideCpG DNAOligodeoxynucleotidesToll-like receptorsFormulationabstract There has been an increased demand for the development of novel vaccine adjuvants that lead to enhanced induction of protection from infectious challenges and development of immunological memory. A novelvaccine adjuvant was developed comprising a complex containing CpG oligonucleotide and the syntheticcationic innate defence regulator peptide HH2 that has enhanced immune modulating activities. The com-plex of HH2 and the CpG oligonucleotide 10101 was a potent inducer of cytokine/chemokine expressionex vivo, retained activity following extended storage, had low associated cytotoxicity, and upregulatedsurface marker expression in dendritic cells, a critical activity for a vaccine adjuvant. Immunization ofmice with a coformulation of the HH2-CpG complex and pertussis toxoid signicantly enhanced theinduction of toxoid-specic antibody titres when toxoid alone, inducing high titres of IgG1and IgG2a, typical of a balanced Th1/Th2 response, and also led to high IgA titres. This study demonstrates the potential application of the HH2-CpG complex as a vaccine adjuvant. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction To decrease the adverse events associated with whole cell bac- terial vaccines, there has been a trend towards the development of better dened vaccines containing a limited number of antigensand highly puried components [1]. Although this has diminished vaccine-associated adverse events, this trend has also resultedin vaccines with reduced ability to promote protective immuneresponses. Thus, alternative strategies have focused on the designand development of vaccine adjuvants in an effort to enhanceimmunogenicity. Adjuvants have an important role in current vaccine devel- opment as they modulate immune responses, through immunecell recruitment, the direct or indirect activation of immune cellsto produce cytokines and chemokines, and/or a poorly explained 0172. E-mail address: bob@cmdr.ubc.ca (R.E.W. of antigen in an appropriate tissue) [1]. Alum is the most widely used adjuvant for a wide-range of anti-gens although it demonstrates limited adjuvanticity reflecting itsmodest ability to activate immune cells through Toll-like receptors(TLR). However there are signicant concerns regarding its poten-tial to cause certain pathologies including granulomas, increasedIgE production, and allergenicity [2-4]. Thus there is great interest in adjuvants that are safe, stable, have low associated costs of man-ufacturing, and promote an appropriate cellular and/or antibodyimmune response [5]. The identication of pattern recognition receptors, and in particular the TLR family, has provided a cellular target for adju-vant design since activation of these receptors stimulates innateimmunity, which is recognized to be critical for the inductionof antigen-specic adaptive immune responses. Many adjuvantssignal through such pathways leading to induction of cytokineand chemokine expression [1]. Thus it seemed reasonable to develop adjuvants that activate multiple pathways in an effortto enhance antigen-specic immune responses. Previous studies 0264-410X/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.05.094J. Kindrachuk et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 4662-4671 4663 demonstrated partial synergy between CpG oligonucleotides (ODN; a TLR9 agonist) and the LL-37 in induc-ing certain cytokines [6]. Therefore we sought here to combine synthetic innate defence regulator peptides (IDRs), with enhancedimmunomodulatory activities relative to LL-37, with CpG oligonu-cleotides, to provide a new adjuvant formulation for antigenpresentation. IDRs are synthetic mimics of cationic host defence peptides (HDPs) that are ubiquitous in nature; HDPs represent importantcomponents of the immune systems of all complex life formsranging from insects to humans. Traditionally these peptides arecharacterized by their limited size ( 12-50 residues in length), cationic charge (due to high proportions of arginine and lysineresidues), and amphipathic nature ( 30% hydrophobic amino acid residues), and adopt ordered structures upon interactionwith hydrophobic environments such as cell membrane bilayers.Recently, there has been an increased appreciation that many HDPsare able to modulate immunity, while some also possess directantimicrobial activity. The immunomodulatory activities of thesepeptides include the up-regulation of chemokines and cytokinesand their receptors, direct (or indirect) recruitment of leukocytesto sites of infection, stimulation of histamine release from mastcells, angiogenesis, dendritic cell (DC) maturation and wound heal-ing [7-10]. HDPs also enhance adaptive immune responses through activities such as chemoattraction of immature DCs and lympho-cytes [1 1-14] and the induction of DC maturation [15]. HDPs such as the human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3 and LL-37 are able to act as adjuvants, promoting adaptive immunity[16,17]; however, these peptides are quite long and/or complex andare thus limited by difculties in synthesis and associated cost ofmanufacturing. Thus, we have undertaken to create short, novelsynthetic mimics, IDRs, with optimized immunomodulatory activ-ities. Recently, we demonstrated that the 13-aa synthetic peptideIDR-1 was able to confer protection to bacterial challenge throughmodulation of innate immunity [18], indicating that it may be pos- sible to produce a short peptide that modulates adaptive responsesthrough activation of innate immunity. Bacterial DNA is a potent activator of innate immune responses in mammals [19]. The immunostimulatory activity of microbial DNA is due to the presence of unmethylated CpG dinucleotidesequences frequently found in microbial DNA but largely absentfrom host cell genetic material. Single-stranded CpG ODNs havegarnered much interest as novel immunomodulators due totheir relatively low toxicity, chemical stability, and low costof production [19]. The immunomodulatory properties of CpGs have resulted in a number of potential medical applicationsincluding: (1) priming the innate immune response, (2) as anti-allergens, (3) for the treatment of a variety of malignancies, and(4) as adjuvants for improving vaccination efciency, especiallyin individuals with poor immune responses [19]. Indeed these molecules have been demonstrated to enhance human, murine,and porcine neonatal immune responses [20-22], although the use of CpGs in adjuvant formulations was previously demon-strated to skew vaccine-induced immune responses towards aTh1-bias [1]. In the context of a vaccine adjuvant, a balanced Th1/Th2 response is arguably the most desirable response sincethe modulation of Th1 and Th2 contributions influences thebalance between protection and immunopathology [23]. The Th1 response results in the initiation of inflammatory immuneresponses, primarily addressing intracellular infections, whereasthe Th2 response evokes antibody responses to extracellularpathogens, and most allergies [24]. However, over-activation of the Th1 pathway can result in the generation of organ-specicautoimmune disease [23] whereas Th2 overactivation is associated with allergy and a predisposition to systemic autoimmune disease[25].Here we present a novel vaccine adjuvant comprising a mixture of CpG ODN and a synthetic 12-amino acid IDR,HH2 (VQLRIRVAVIRA-NH 2), which had been optimized for immunomodulatory activities. The in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo per- formance of this complex suggests the potential of this complex asa new vaccine adjuvant. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Phosphorothioate-stabilized CpG ODN 10101 (TCGTCGTT - TTCGCGCGCGCCG ) (VQLRIRVAVIRA-NH 2), HH18 (IWVIWRR-NH 2) and 1047 (IIRRWWV-NH 2) were synthesized using solid phase Fmoc chemistry, puried to a purity >90% using reverse phase HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry, at either the Brain ResearchCenter (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) or Gen-Script (Piscataway, NJ, USA). The genetically detoxied form ofpertussis toxoid was generously donated by Novartis Vaccines(Siena, Italy). 2.2. Formulation of HH2-CpG complexes and agarose electrophoretic mobility shift assays (AEMSA) Binding incubating CpG ODN 10101 with peptide HH2 in a nal volume of 50 /H9262L of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 270 mM Sorbitol (pH 7.4). Reactions were incubated at 37 Cf o r 10 min, stopped by the addition of 10 /H9262L of agarose gel loading solu- tion subjected to electrophoresisthrough a 0.8% agarose gel at 95 V for 1 h. DNA was visualized byethidium performed with Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped witha pulsed nitrogen laser (20 Hz, 337 nm) with the kind permissionof Dr Suzanne Perry (Michael Smith Laboratory Proteomics CoreFacility, UBC). All samples were acquired in linear mode andnegative ion spectra were acquired. The accelerating voltagewas20 kV with a delay time of 400 ns. 200 laser shots were obtained from across the sample surface and then averaged. Forthese measurements, 1 /H9262L of sample was mixed on a stainless steel sample plate with the same volume of 6-aza-2-thiothymine(ATT) [10 mg/mL in 1:1 (v/v) solution of acetonitrile mMammonium citrate] matrix solution. The preparation was allowedto dry at room temperature and subjected to mass spectrometry.Close external calibration with peptide standards was performed. 2.4. Human PBMC isolation and stimulation with HH2-CpG formulations Venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected in Vacutainer \u00aecollection tubes containing sodium heparin as an anti- coagulant (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) in accordance with Universityof British Columbia ethical approval and guidelines. Blood wasdiluted with an equal volume of complete RPMI 1640 with 10% (v/v) mM sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA, USA) and separated by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA)density gradient. The buffy coat was collected, washed twice inRPMI 1640 complete medium, and peripheral blood mononuclearcell (PBMC) numbers determined by trypan blue exclusion. PBMC4664 J. Kindrachuk et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 4662-4671 (5\u00d7105) were seeded into 24-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon; BD Biosciences) at 1 \u00d7106cells/mL and rested for 1 h at 37Ci n 5% CO 2. The cells were then stimulated with the HH2-CpG formu- lations for 24 h. All experiments were repeated on at least three separate occasions. 2.5. Chemokine/cytokine induction Following exposure of cells to peptides for 24 h at 37Ci n5 %C O 2, the tissue culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7gat 4C for 5 min to obtain cell-free samples. Super- natants were aliquoted and then stored at MCP-1 and TNF-/H9251 secretion into the assays were performed intriplicate in three separate experiments. The concentration of thechemokines in the culture medium was quantied by establishing astandard curve with serial dilutions of recombinant human MCP-1and TNF-/H9251. 2.6. Cytotoxicity assay Fresh human venous blood was collected as described above and PBMCs separated from the blood cells over a Ficoll-Paque Plus gra- dient. The toxic effect of HH2-CpG complexes on human red bloodcells was assayed by measuring haemoglobin release due to celllysis. Red blood cells were washed three times in sterile 0.85% NaCl(saline) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Concentrated redblood cells were diluted 3-fold in saline, and 100 /H9262L of this cell sus- pension was mixed in standard non-coated 96-well polypropylenemicrotiter plates with 50 /H9262L of HH2-CpG complexes at the concen- trations indicated and incubated on a rocking table at 37 C under 5% CO 2pressure for 24 h. Triton X-100 (1%) was used as a positive control demonstrating 100% cell lysis, and sterile saline was consid-ered as a negative control. Haemoglobin release was monitored at414 and 546 nm using an ELISA plate reader. To further test toxicity,PBMC (2 \u00d710 5) were seeded into 96-well plates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC, USA) and incubated at h of incubation with the HH2-CpG complexes. All experiments were done in triplicate. 2.7. Flow cytometry Flow cytometry data (Becton Dickinson). For analysis of cytokine production, the cells were treated with appropriate stimuli for 18 h, with the Golgi-STOPTMinhibitor (BD Biosciences) added 2 h after the beginning of the stimulation. The cells werexed and permeabilized using the Cytox/Cytoperm Plus TMkit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufac-turer's protocol, and stained with the the analysis of cell surface marker expres-sion, the cells were re-suspended in Hanks balanced salt solutionpH 7.4, supplemented with 2% FCS (Invitrogen Life 0.2% sodium azide and20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The staining was carried out at 4 Cf o r 20 min, and the antibodies used were allophycocyanin-conjugatedanti-CD123 (clone antibodies part of the IT-Box 341set. 2.8. Immunization of mice Cohorts of 5-6-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, St. Constant, QC) were immunized intranasally with various vaccine formulations on days 1 and 14. To examine thesynergistic effects of the adjuvant components, mice were immu-nized with either 0.5 /H9262g pertussis toxoid alone (Novartis Vaccines, Siena, Italy), or in combination with 10 /H9262g CpG ODN 10101, 50 /H9262g HH2 or the formulated Mice were sedatedwith ketamine and xylazine and 13 /H9262L/nostril of vaccine formu- lation was delivered using a pipette. Saliva was collected on day20 following stimulation with 0.05 mg/mL carbamylcholine chlo-ride (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Oakville, ON) and mice wereasphyxiated on day 21 with CO 2.Sera, vaginal washes and bron- choalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected for determination ofantibody titres. 2.9. Analysis of antibody titres Antigen-specic IgG and IgA from sera and secretory IgA from saliva, vaginal washes and broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) were determined by end-point ELISA using methods previouslydescribed [26]. Briefly, twofold diluted samples were assayed on polystyrene microtitre plates coated with 100 ng pertussistoxoid/well. Specic total (1:8000; Pertussis titre wasdened as the reciprocal of the dilution that gave an A 405 value 0.05 greater then the pooled pre-immune samples. 2.10. Statistical analyses Statistical comparisons were performed with Prism 4.0 Software (GraphPad Inc.), using the two-tailed Student's t-test for compar- isons of two data sets, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons. 3. Results 3.1. Formulation of the HH2-CpG complex Two libraries of short cationic synthetic IDR peptides were developed that demonstrated enhanced immunomodulatory activ- ities ex vivo and in vivo as compared to a model parent peptide (Jenssen et al.; manuscript in preparation). From these libraries,peptide HH2 was chosen as a model peptide for use in the devel-opment of a novel vaccine adjuvant, based on its superior ability,compared to IDR-1, to induce chemokines in human PBMC. HH2was that the formulation of an enhanced immunomodulatoryIDR peptide and a CpG ODN would lead to a complex that couldsynergistically enhance the immunogenic response to a particularantigen. Various ratios of the peptide HH2 and the CpG ODN 10101 were by AEMSA and staining of theJ. Kindrachuk et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 4662-4671 4665 Fig. 1.

(B) MALDI-TOF analysis of the HH2-CpG complex. Two /H9262g of HH2 was complexed with 1 /H9262g of CpG and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. HH2 alone (mass 1394.76 Da) and CpG alone (mass 6900 Da) are displayed in the inset. The formulated HH2-CpG sample demonstrated two broad peaks, one at corresponding to CpG at a mass of 6900 Da, and a second at 8300 Da corresponding to the combined masses of peptide and the CpG. CpG to monitor for complex formation (Fig. 1). As anticipated, the co-incubation of HH2 and CpG ODN 10101 resulted in theformation of a slow migrating aggregate when compared to themobility of the CpG alone; however, as AEMSA EMSA does notresolve complexes solely by molecular weight an estimate of thesize of the HH2-CpG complex could not be made. Complex for-mation was independent of pH and high salt concentrations, andtitration of MgCl in no discernable dissociationof these complexes (data not shown). A representative sample ofthe 2:1 (wt/wt) ratio formulation of HH2:CpG was selected forMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to directly conrm complex for-mation between the peptide and CpG. HH2 alone had a distinctpeak at 1394.76 Da corresponding to the correct molecular weightof the peptide whereas CpG 10101 alone resolved with a broadpeak with an apparent mass of 6900 Da (Fig. 1B). The formulated HH2-CpG sample demonstrated two broad peaks, one at corre-sponding to CpG at a mass of 6900 Da, and a second at 8300 Da, corresponding to the combined masses of peptide HH2 and theCpG ODN (Fig. incubation of CpGODN 10101 and HH2 resulted Synergistic induction of chemokine in PBMCs by theHH2-CpG complex Preliminary studies demonstrated that peptide HH2, as well as CpG [30], is a potent inducer of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, chemokine that T cells, NK cells, and neutrophils. ThereforeMCP-1 chosen for analyzing chemokine induction by theHH2-CpG HH2 and CpG were pre-complexed with a rangeof CpG:HH2 ratios prior to PBMC stimulation. For these chemokinescreens four CpG concentrations were chosen that best representedthose currently utilized in other in vivo studies and these were held constant across a range of seven ratios of CpG:HH2 ranging from8:1 (wt/wt) CpG:HH2 to 1:8 e.g., the 2:1 (wt/wt) ratio of HH2:CpG was tested by combining thefour different concentrations of CpG (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 /H9262g/ml) with HH2 concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 /H9262g/ml, respectively. Human PBMCs were stimulated with the various HH2-CpG com-plexes immediately following complex formation and monitoredfor induction chemokine expression ex vivo (Fig. 2A). These results were particularly striking for those CpG4666 J. Kindrachuk et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 4662-4671 Fig. 2. Complexes of HH2 and CpG resulting in synergistic chemokine induction at dened HH2:CpG ratios. Human PBMCs were stimulated with a range HH2-CpG complexes, or the components alone, for 18 h. Following stimulation, supernatants were collected and monitored for MCP-1 release by ELISA. (A) Total MCP-1 relea se induced by HH2-CpG complexes. (B) Induction of MCP-1 release by either HH2 or CpG alone at the concentrations used to form complexes. (C) Calculation of synergy for MCP-1 release by complex formation between HH2 and CpG. Synergy was calculated as the total MCP-1 release by the HH2-CpG complex divided by the summed MCP-1 release caused by HH 2 alone and CpG alone, at the concentrations found in the complex. (D) Induction of TNF-/H9251 by the various HH2-CpG complexes described in (A). (E) Total MCP-1 release induced by HH18-CpG complexes.

As the enhanced induction of MCP-1 for a particular HH2-CpG complex ratio might simply have been due to the additive effects of the individual components on MCP-1induction, the synergistic MCP-1 induction (synergistic effect) wascalculated for each ratio screened. Synergistic effect was calculatedas the total release of MCP-1 by the HH2-CpG complex divided bythe additive release of MCP-1 induction by the individual complexcomponents. A cut-off level of 2 was chosen to indicate syn- ergy (Fig. 2C). In particular the 2:1 (10 /H9262g/ml/5 /H9262g/ml) HH2-CpG complex was a strong pg/ml) and showed 2C). Induction of thepro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-/H9251 was also examined for all of the HH2-CpG formulations and only modest increases of the cytokinecould be demonstrated (Fig. 2D), in contrast to the very potent MCP-1 induction. As a control, peptide HH18 (IWVIWRR-NH2), a peptidecreated in the same library as HH2 but having weaker MCP-1induction activity, resulted in considerably diminished total MCP-1induction and synergistic induction values when complexed HH2 ( Fig. 2E and F). It should be noted that complex formation between CpG ODN 10101 andpeptide 1047 Kindrachuk et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 4662-4671 4667 Fig. 3. Minimal cytotoxicity of the HH2-CpG complex. Human red blood cells or PBMCs were stimulated with a range of HH2-CpG complexes, or the components alone ,f o r 18 h. Following stimulation, supernatants were collected and monitored for the release of haemoglobin or LDH. (A) Total haemoglobin release from red blood cells induced by the HH2-CpG complexes. (B) LDH release from PBMCs following stimulation with the HH2-CpG complexes. All data are representative of at least 3 indepen dent experiments. (DOTAP), a cationic transfection reagent, led synergy values of <1 for MCP-1 induction; even though complex formation could still bedemonstrated by AEMSA (data not shown). As vaccine adjuvants must demonstrate safety as well as potency, possible cytotoxicities associated with the HH2-CpGcomplexes were investigated by monitoring the release of LDHfrom PBMCs and haemoglobin from red blood cells. Previousinvestigations with cationic peptides had determined that somepeptides have strong membrane lytic properties [31]. In contrast the tested HH2-CpG complexes resulted in minimal or no releaseof haemoglobin or LDH from RBCs and PBMCs, respectively (Fig. 3Aand B). The 2:1 (wt/wt) HH2-CpG complex was used to investigate the retention of MCP-1 induction activity following prolongedstorage. To examine storage stability, HH2 and CpG were com-plexed and either left in solution or lyophilized to powder andincubated at room temperature over a 28 day period ( Fig. 4A). AEMSA conrmed that the HH2-CpG complexes were preservedover extended incubation as either a solution or powder withno evidence of unbound CpG over the period monitored. Toverify the retention of chemokine induction activity followingextended storage, PBMCs were stimulated with the HH2-CpGcomplexes after 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 day incubations andMCP-1 induction measured by ELISA. It was demonstrated thatthe immunomodulatory activity of the complexes was fullyretained and in fact increased following these extended incubations(Fig. 4B). 3.3. HH2-CpG complex induction of IFN production in pDCs and up-regulation of surface marker expression on monocytes and conventional DCs Cationic peptides are able to enhance immune responses as assessed by induction of chemokine/cytokine expression andup-regulation of co-stimulatory markers in DCs[15,32,33]. For example, the human cathelicidin LL-37 promotesDC and induction of while LL-37 and human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1-3 are known to have adjuvant properties [16,17]. Based on these observations and the recent demonstration that LL-37 coupled withself-DNA strongly augments pDC responses [34] it was postulated that HH2 in complex with CpG ODN, may also augment pDC acti-vation. Human PBMCs were stimulated with either the formulated HH2-CpG complex or the individual components HH2 (20 /H9262g/ml)or CpG ODN 10101 (10 /H9262g/ml) for 18 h. Normal endocytic uptake of the individual components or HH2-CpG complex was allowed toproceed for 2 h with subsequent addition of the monensin-basedvesicular transport inhibitor Golgi-STOP to inhibit protein secre-tion and induce cytokine accumulation inside the cells. Sampleswere analyzed for IFN-/H9251 production by flow cytometry, gating on the plasmacytoid DCs as positive for MHCII and CD123 and neg- Fig. 4. Stability and activity of the HH2-CpG adjuvant complex following prolonged storage. Following formation of a 2:1 (wt/wt) complex of CpG (20 /H9262g/ml) and HH2 (40/H9262g/ml), HH2-CpG complex was stored and monitored for stability and activ- ity.

Induction, by the HH2-CpG complex, of IFN /H9251production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and activation of monocytes and conventional dendritic cells.

All data were representative of at least 3 independent experiments; statisti cal analysis employed a one-way ANOVA test, * CD20, standard protocols; the constituted on aver-age 0.2% of the total PBMC ( Fig. 5A). The percentage of IFN-/H9251 containing cells within the pDC gate was compared between thesamples and a strong synergistic induction of IFN- /H9251was observed in response to the HH2-CpG complex ( Fig. 5B and C). As IFN-/H9251 is known to strongly augment antigen-presenting-cell activation,stimulate adaptive immune responses, and promote Th1 polariza-tion, the IFN-/H9251 induction by the HH2-CpG complex could have contributed to adjuvant activity. The ability of the HH2-CpG formulation to activate other classes of antigen-presenting-cells in blood was also analyzed. Theinduction of the co-stimulatory receptor CD80 was measured onmonocytes overall synergistic induction of CD80was seen for both monocytes and cDCs in response to the HH2-CpGcomplex (Fig. 5E). It remains possible that the effects of the complexon monocytes and DCs may be an indirect result of the activationof other cell types, such as the IFN-/H9251 producing pDCs, since human monocytes and conventional DCs are considered to be devoid offunctional TLR9 [19]. 3.4. In vivo induction of antigen-specic of the HH2-CpG complex with pertussis toxoid Detoxied pertussis toxin (PTd) was used to assess the ability of the HH2-CpG complex to enhance mucosal immune responsesin mice. PTd, a component of all commercial pertussis subunit vac-cines, was formulated with or without the various adjuvants andthe PTd-specic humoral response monitored following intranasalimmunization with two doses on days 1 and 14. For the immuniza-tions a 5:1 (wt/wt) ratio of HH2:CpG was selected as this ratio fellwithin the range of our most active HH2-CpG complexes identi-ed from the initial MCP-1 screens Sera from BALB/c mice immunized with PTd alone, or in combination with either CpG orHH2, or co-formulated with the HH2-CpG complex, were analyzedby ELISA for the presence of total specic IgG as well as the dif-ferent IgG subtypes; IgG1 as an indicator of a Th2 response andIgG2b as an indicator of a Th1 response. PTd alone failed inducea strong immune response, while the addition of CpG led to vir-tually no improvement over the antigen alone for any of the IgGsub-types (titres less than 10 1;Fig. 6). The combination of HH2 with PTd led to a strong increase in antibody titres but this was stronglybiased towards an IgG1 (Th2) response with absolutely no IgG2aobserved. In contrast the co-formulation of PTd with the HH2-CpGadjuvant complex resulted in higher titres (>10 4) of total IgG, as well as both the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses indicating a balancebetween a Th1 and type responses following co-formulationwith the HH2-CpG complex. intranasal administration of PTd with the HH2-CpG adju- vant complex also induced signicant increases in PTd-specicserum IgA antibody titres as well as secretory IgA in thebrocheoalveolar lavage while PTd alone or co-formulated sepa-rately with either CpG or HH2 led to no increase in IgA titres. Therewas no signicant change in antibody titres of vaginal or saliva IgAin response to either PTd alone or in combination with any adjuvantutilized here.J.

BALB/c mice (5/group) were immunized intranasally with the indicated vaccine formulations on days 1 and 14.For determination of pertussis toxoid-specic antibody titres, sera from each exper-imental group were pooled on day 21 and analyzed using specic ELISA as describedin Section 2. NB for the CpG + PTd samples there were marginal levels of IgG1 and IgG2a that were not detected when total IgG was assessed. 4. Discussion With the ongoing development of novel and improved vac- cines, there has been an increasing interest in developing improved adjuvants that can enhance immune responses to an antigenwhile minimizing both vaccine- and adjuvant-related adverseevents. Effective adjuvant approaches should bridge the innate andadaptive immune responses in the host. New vaccine adjuvantdevelopment to date has focused on the production of novel adju-vants that are stable, biodegradable, have low associated costs ofmanufacturing, and result in the induction of appropriate cellularor antibody immune responses; however, this has proven difcultdue to a high incidence of injection-site and systemic toxicities[5]. Here we report on the development of a novel vaccine adju-vant comprising an immune modulating IDR peptide HH2 and from a libraryof synthetic IDRs as having enhanced immune modulating activitiesand was able to confer protection to bacterial challenges in animalmodels (manuscript in preparation). It was postulated here thatthe addition of a peptide optimized for immunomodulatory activityalong with single stranded CpG ODN, which might skew vaccine-induced immune responses towards a Th1-type response, wouldcreate a potent vaccine adjuvant platform. Importantly, the use ofan optimized chemokine inducing IDR would likely enhance cellrecruitment to the site of immunization and thus improve immuno-genicity. CpG oligonucleotides have been studied extensively for their immunomodulatory activities that include induction of TLR9pathways leading to invitro [35] and in vivo in experimental vaccines for hepatitis B [36-39], anthrax [40], and HIV [38]. Interestingly, CpGs have shown even greater adjuvanticity when co-administered with other adju-vants [41-43]. On the other hand, IDRs as chemokine [45], and anti-inflammatory activities [46]; importantly, these peptides also enhance and modulate adaptiveimmune responses. For example, the chemoattraction of immune responses andresistance to subsequent tumour challenge, respectively [16,17]. Recently, it was reported that IC31, a vaccine adjuvant comprisedof the synthetic peptide KLKL 5KLK with a single-stranded ODN of IC (ODN1a), induced strong antigen-speciccellular and humoral immune responses [47]. The work described here demonstrated that an adjuvant com- plex comprised of the peptide HH2 and CpG oligonucleotideinduced strong chemokine release in PBMC, dependent on the spe-cic ratio of HH2 to CpG. Furthermore, the most active HH2-CpGcomplex ratios had no discernable cytotoxicity and minimal poten-tial for the pro-inflammatory /H9251. Using these ex vivo investigations of a guide, an HH2-CpG com- plex ratio (5:1, wt/wt) that demonstrated both strong synergisticchemokine induction was utilized to demonstrate that intranasalimmunization of BALB/c mice with this complex co-formulatedwith PTd resulted in the induction of strong and balanced humoralresponses. Initial assessment of HH2-CpG vaccine adjuvant formulations relied on the demonstration that HH2 and CpG interact to form astable complex and subsequent studies were aimed at identifyingthe optimal concentrations of HH2 peptide and CpG for induc-tion of chemokines following complex formation. The HH2-CpGcomplex likely results from the strong electrostatic interactionbetween the cationic and anionic acids and polycationic amino acidsor peptides [47,48]. Previous studies with a simple peptide and a polyIC-ODN indicated an immediate formation of peptide-ODNcomplexes leading to enhanced immune modulating propertiesas compared to the components alone; however, no systematicinvestigation was performed concerning the optimal ratios of com-ponents or their concentrations [47,49]. The work described here demonstrates that the immune modulating activities associatedwith HH2 as well as the overall ratio of HH2 to CpG in the com-plex have a signicant impact on the chemokine inducing activitiesof the adjuvant complexes. In contrast complexes of CpG 10101 withthe peptide 1047, a relatively inert cationic IDR immunemodulating activities, or between the cationic transfection reagentDOTAP and CpG 10101 did not result in the synergistic inductionof MCP-1, demonstrating that the immune modulating activity ofthe complex was not simply due to non-specic complex forma-tion between the CpG and a cationic molecule. Similarly HH18,a moderately immunomodulatory peptide when led to much weaker chemokine induction activitiesand calculated synergy values as compared to HH2. Cell stimulation experiments also veried that specic ratios of CpG:HH2 are required for optimal chemokine induction activity;CpG:HH2 ratios outside the ranges of 1:2-1:8 decreasedinduction of chemokine. Using these ex vivo chemokine induction screens as a guide also it was demonstrated that these optimizedHH2-CpG complexes induced synergistic activation of DCs, a pro-cess required for activation of na\u00efve T-cells and for the consequentinduction of adaptive immune responses. These results were con-sistent with actual adjuvant studies employing PTd co-formulatedwith an optimized HH2-CpG adjuvant complex, which resulted inthe induction of a potent mixed Th1/Th2 immune response in mice,conrming that the HH2-CpG adjuvant formulation increased abalanced immune response to this antigen. Important to all candidate vaccine adjuvant platforms was the demonstration that the adjuvant did not induce systemic toxicity.Highlighting this was the demonstration that the HH2-CpG adju-vant complex did not induce cytotoxic responses or LDH releasefrom human cells. Similarly immunization with the HH2-CpG com-plex resulted in no obvious lesions at the injection site nor adverse4670 J. Kindrachuk et al. / Vaccine 27 (2009) 4662-4671 symptoms upon injection, suggesting that the adjuvanticity asso- ciated with the complex is not an artefact of HH2-CpG mediatedtoxicity. It is possible that the lack of toxicity of the HH2-CpGcomplex, as well as the storage stability of the complex, might becorrelated strong electrostatic interaction between the two com-ponents. Upon extended storage of the HH2-CpG complex in aliquid medium, or as a lyophilized powder, an increasing abilityto stimulate MCP-1 induction was observed. This may reflect addi-tional complex formation over extended periods of time leadingto formation of more stable structures between peptide and ODNmolecules. In addition to assisting in recruitment and activation of immune cells, the vaccine adjuvant comprised of the HH2-CpG complexlikely might also enhance cellular delivery of the accompanyingantigen to antigen-presenting cells, and improve CpG uptake ithas been demonstrated for complexes of the cationic peptide LL-37 with CpG ODN [34]. The precise mechanism utilized by the HH2-CpG complex for cell entry, and the signalling pathwaysinvolved in initiation of the immune response, remain to be inves-tigated.
