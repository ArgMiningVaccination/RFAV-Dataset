Clavibacter toxicus ) National Plant Disease Recovery System, a cooperative project of The American Phytopathological Society and The United States Department of Agriculture, posted at http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/npd rs. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 2 Executi ve Summary Rathayiba cter (Clavibacter ) toxicus was originally added to the Sel ect Agent List in 2008 and relisted in 2012, due pri marily to the p otential da mage affecting do mesticated forag e- consu ming animals in the U. S. R. toxicus is a cros s-domain patho gen affecting plants : a ne matode -transmitted Gram-positive bact erium that causes pla nt disease produces animal toxins in forage g rasses. Consu mption of infected grass often results in fa tal poiso ning of grazing animals. Rathayibacter poisoning has many names, the most com mon of which is annual r yegrass toxicity (A RGT). The disease is found mainly in Australia a nd to a lesser extent in South A frica. In Australi a, the pla nt disease has been found on over 10 million hectares of farmland in different parts of the country , with total losses attributed to Rath ayibacter poisoning in Western Australia estimated at 40 million Australian dollars per year . In Australia, the bacte rium R. toxicus is most com monly (annual ryegrass) with the nematode Anguina fu nesta, but the bacterium is not vector/host specific and can pote ntially colonize and produce toxin in a wide ran ge of cere als and fodder gras ses, including species consumed by h umans. The pathogen can go undetected for long peri ods, making visual detection of an accidental or deliberate r elease very difficult . Several s pecies of Angu ina seed and leaf gall nematodes carry R. to xicus into the host plant, where it resides in the devel oping seed head and forms galls. Galls may be consumed by grazing animals or fall to the ground after the grass has senesced . Most infected pl ants do not show any visible symptoms. Thus, abse nce of visib le yellow slime (gum mosis) does not mean that a plant is free of R. toxicus . In many cases, bacterium and ne matode in fections go undetected or the disease is misidenti fied. The ne matode vector and bacteri um can survive in the dry state for many year s. The toxins, termed corynetoxins, are members of the tunicamycin family of antibiotics and are p roduced as the plants be come senesce nt and the bacter ia reach their peak biomass. Corynetoxins produced by R. toxicus are heat stable, hig hly toxic (oral lethal dose for sheep is 3-6 mg/kg body weight) glycolipids with c umulative ef fects. Up to 16 different forms of corynetoxins may be produced, di ffering only in th eir side chains. Animals that consu me sufficient infected past ure gra ss suffer a to xicosis chara cterized by episodic ne urolog ical signs , often lea ding to death. Animals exposed to the toxins do not develop im munity. Treat ments for af fected ani mals are li mited. An antid ote has been devel oped, but is not available commercially ; its use is also const rained by the fact that outbreaks a re unlikely to be detected before ani mals have died or have cons umed too much toxin to be successfu lly treated. In Australia, t he disea se occurs during spring and summer grazing. Ho wever, it can happen at any ti me of the year in live stock fed with hay containing corynetoxin s. Rathayibacter poisoning was diagnosed in Japan in cattle aft er they had eaten hay exported from Australia. In the U.S., s uscepti ble animals incl ude the ap proximately 95 million cattle, 6 million s heep, 9 million h orses, and an unknown number of bison . Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 3 The threat of introducti on and esta blishment of R. toxic us in the U.S. is very high due to presence of susceptible grass es and pote ntial ne matode vectors. P asture and rangeland throughout the U.S. are p otentially susce ptible to infection, as indicated by the occurrence of Angui na species, the nematode vectors , and other Rathayi bacter species in the U.S. closely related to R. toxicus . As seed and hay are moved about t he country, R. toxic us and nematode vecto rs could be spread, most co mmonly thro ugh uncleaned or poorly cleaned grass seed, but also by wind dispersal and in hay, cont aminated machinery, vehicles, ani mals or ru n-off water. It may take several years aft er the introduction of the bacterium in close proximity to a nematode vector before there is evidence of the disease in grazing animals. This means the bact erium, nematode or infected seed could be i ntroduced wit hout detecti on or any su spicion. Currently , there is a cost-effective, rapid and sen sitive ide ntification test for R. toxicus but not f or its nematode vector s. Risk of Rathayibacter poisoning is g enerally mitigated by manage ment practices such as crop rotation, stock rotation a mong grazed pas tures, har vesting hay before corynetoxin s are produced in seed-heads, herbicide treatment of suscep tible pasture grasses, inspec tion of fields for signs of infection and the use of certified seed f ree of the ba cterium. Recomme ndations 1. Establish s trict quar antine measures at all ports of entry for hay products and forage gras s seeds , especially those originating fr om Australia, New Zealand and South A frica. Develop reliable detection and identificat ion tests for all R. toxicus hosts and vect ors. 2. Establish an i nterdisci plinary working group of scie ntists familiar with these diseas es, to coordinate research on the detection and identification of the pathogen and vectors, ecology and manag ement of the diseases , and assess the app licability of Austr alian diagnostic practices and procedures to U.S. production sy stems. Bec ause of the co mplexity of these diseases, this recom mendation is critic al to achieve an appropriate and early response to their appearance. 3. Educat e veterinarians, plant pathologists, n ematologists, extension personnel, crop consult ants and gr ain and ani mal produc ers to be able to identify Rathayibacter poisoning and Rathayibacter bacteriosis and understand their ecology and manag ement. Early respo nse is critic al for appropriate and effective control due to the complexity of the disease s. 4. Obtain addi tional specific information to i mprove disease manage ment and animal protection. a. Bacteria : survey potentially susceptible grasses for g ummosis, initially emphasizing areas of the U.S. with previous reports of Rathayibacter bacteriosis and/or staggers - like occurrences to determine the geographic distribution of Rathayibacter species with subsequent random surveys emphasizing plant hosts in important stock grazing areas ; develop diag nostic tools for detection and differentiation of R. toxicus and related species; determ ine the role of bacteriophage and plasmids in toxin production; determine the r ole of the to xin in the ecology of the bact erium; sequence t he genomes Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 4 of several R. toxicus and related Rathayibacter species to ass ess similariti es and differences, and especially gene(s) related to corynetoxin productio n; develop methods to reproduce the disease under controlled environment s to improve our understanding of the interactions between R. toxicus , its nematode vector, and the plant ; and determine the potentia l for biolog ical control of R. toxicus with non -toxigenic Rathayibacter species . b. Nematodes : survey potentially susceptible grasses for presence of nematode galls emphasizing areas of the U.S. with previous reports of Rathayibacter bacteriosis and/or staggers -like occurrences to determine the geographic distribution of Anguina species as potential vectors of R. toxicus with subsequent random surveys emphasizing plant hosts in important stock grazing areas ; establish pure cultures of the nematode vectors on greenhouse -grown plants for use in controlled environment studies; develop molecular detection and identification tools for Anguina species ; assess the potential for Anguina species present in the U.S. to transmit R. toxicus , as well as the carrying capacity for R. toxicus ; and , determine the potential for biolog ical control of potential nematode vectors since chemical control is not feasible . c. Plants : identify sources of resistance /tolerance to R. toxicus and/or the nematode vectors; determine viabili ty and yield poten tial of plants bred for resista nce to the bacterium and/or vector under U. S. conditions; d etermine applicability and feasibility of Australian pasture manag ement practices to the U.S. d. Animals: develop a better understa nding of the mechani sms of toxin action to develop more ef fective diagnostics or treatment protoc ols; improve the protective efficacy of an Australian experi mental vaccine or develop a new vaccine.

Introduction Rathayiba cter to xicus is -producing Gra m-positi ve bac terium that colonizes the vegetative stems and floral structures of g rasses. In gestion of sufficient amounts of the toxin by grazing animals results in a serious p oisoning that frequently leads to the ir death. The bact erium is transferred from infested soils into plants by plant parasitic n ematodes of the genus Anguina , which produce foliar or se ed galls in several s pecies of grasses. R. toxicus proliferates within t he nematode killing the nematodes and co mpletely filling the lumen resulting in formation of a bacterial gall. B acterial growth in grass flowers is often suf ficient to cause oo zing from the floral structures of a yellow ba cterial sli me; such sy mptoms caused by plan t-colonizing bact eria are referred to as gum mosis. Damage resulting from livestock poisoning and associated effects is estimated at 40 million Australian dollars per year in Western Australia (Kessell, 2010). R. toxicus was originally added to the Sel ect Agent List in 2008 and relisted in 2012, due pri marily to the p otential da mage affecting do mesticated forag e-consu ming animals in the U. S. The com mon na mes given to the diseases caused by the ass ociation of Rathayiba cter and Anguina are nu merous. The common names for the plant and animal diseases are not used Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 6 consistently and t herefore, we use Rathayibacter poiso ning to emphasize the causa l agent and primary concern for the consequences of ingest ion of infected grasses by animals . Rathayibacter poiso ning is a serious ani mal dise ase in Austra lia, but has also been reported in South A frica. Primarily sheep and cattle have been a ffected, but all gra zing ani mals fed on a R. toxicus -infested pasture, hay or fe ed grain are susceptible to poisoning , as are other animals such as poultry fed R. toxicus contaminated feed . We use Rathayibacter bacte riosis to represe nt the plant disease . Plant disease names Yellow sli me disea se is a common name used to describe R. toxicus infection of grasses, but this name also has be en used for other sli me diseases, including Rathayibacter tritici in wheat. Most of the common names associated w ith the disea se are related to toxic effects in animals (Table 1). A bacterial disease in orchard grass ( Dactylis glomerata ) was named Rathay's disease (Smith, (1914), after Rathay, who first described it in Austria in 1899. Rathay's disease, caused by Rathayibacter rathayi , is a common name used for the disease of orchard grass in Oregon, U. S. (see Appe ndix Table A1). Table 1. Common n ames for Rathay ibacter toxicus and/or Anguina associations. Referring to Common names of disease, galls, or pathogen Toxicity of Lolium rigid um caused by toxicity Black Springs syndrome iformi s (syn. Agrostis ave gon monspel iensis caused Rathayib acter toxic us flood plain staggers blown grass/beard grass corynetoxin Bertozzi and Davies, 2009; Bertozzi and McKay, 1995; Edgar et al., 1994; Johns ton et al., 1996; McKay et al., 1993; Riley and Barbetti, 2008; Riley, 1992a, 1995; Riley et al., 2001 . Animal dis ease names Various n ames have been given to the disease in animals, based on the host, geographic area in which the disease occurred a nd the toxins involved (Table 1). For exa mple, annual r yegrass toxicity (ARGT) is the most com monly used n ame to describe t he poisoning of ani mals Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 7 consu ming Lolium rigidum in which the nematode Anguina fun esta is the vector of the bacterium, R. toxicus (ryegrass was previ ously separated into two words, viz. rye grass, w hich gave rise to the established acron ym ARGT ). Names given to the disease by so me veterinary scientists su ch as coryne toxicosis or tunicaminylura cil toxicosis have merit, but have not been widely ado pted presu mably because they do not r elate to the plant dis ease (Table 1) and are not easily understood by non -technical audiences. Hosts and vectors Other pla nt hosts rep orted to be in fected by McKay, 1995; Chatel et al., 19 79; Edgar et al., 1994 ; Johns ton et al., 1996 ; McKay & Ophel 1993; McK ay et al 1996; Riley and Barbett i, 2008; Riley et al., 200 1). Known vectors for R. toxicus are four Anguina speci es (family Anguinidae): A. funesta (Riley, 1995), A. triti ci (Riley, 1992a), A. austra lis (Riley et al., 20 01), and A. paludic ola (Bertozzi and Davies, 2 009). History The first re ports of pla nt disease or gum mosis (pathological production of gum my or sticky exudates as a result of pla nt cell degen eration , bacterial cell prolife polysacc harides ) of grasses associated with R. toxic us were in 1968 (Fisher, 1978). The first livestock poisonings reported occurred in 1956 in South Australia ( Fisher et al., 1979). Poisonings spr ead throughout the agricultural areas of South and Western Australia, and a localized area of New South Wales thereafter (Mc Kay and Ophel, 1993). A weather damaged grain -associated tunicaminyluracil toxicosis, not involving R. toxicus , occurred in pigs in New South Wales in 1985 (Bourke, 1987). Poisonings were reported in 1980 in South Africa (Schneide r, 198 1). The bact erium was isolated in the 1 960s, but not descri bed as a separate species (Clavibacter toxicus ) until 1992 (Riley and Ophel, 1992). In Australia the pla nt disease has been found in over 10 million hectares of farmland in different parts of the country (Carsla ke, 2006). Experience in Australia with the plant and ani mal diseases has led to manage ment practices that have minimized the incidence of plant disease and ind irectly reduced the incid ence of animal disease. Following the death of some cattle in Japan in 1996 from eating oaten hay exported from Australia (contaminated with ryegrass ; Masters et al., 2006, 2011 ), routine inspection and testing for R. toxicus was introduced for all exported hay, and no deaths have occurred since. Since R. toxicus can be vect ored by dif ferent ne matode species to several grass species (Riley and Barbetti, 2008) , the th reat of introd uction and esta blishment of R. toxicus in the U.S. includes other grass hosts and n ematode vectors ; therefore, a single inclusive name wou ld be appro priate. Hence, we use Rathayibacter poisoning for this docu ment. However, in keeping with the literatur e, other na mes are used as published. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 8 II. Disease Develo pment a nd Sym ptoms A disease cycle of Rathayibacter toxicus is shown in Fig. 1. R. toxicus adheres to the cuticle of the seed -gall nematode, Anguina , and is carried to the d eveloping seed heads of the plant (Fig. 2E). The infective juvenile stage of the nematode enters the growing plant and migrates to the seed head (Fig. 2C, D) , where it infects individual developing seeds and transforms them into galls. Within the galls ju venile nematodes develop to adults, which produce several hundred eggs per gall. Eggs hatch within the galls releasing juvenile nematodes. Likewise, b acterial cells increase in number and may colonize the gall and grow outside of it to other parts of the s eed head (Fig. 2A, B) . During summer , galls fall to the ground and the nematodes within enter a dry (anyhydrobiotic) resting stage that allows them to survive through adverse, dry conditions for many years, if necessary. However, when exposed to favorable climat ic conditions of sufficient periods of soil moisture or rainfall, galls rehydrate as water is absorbed. As a result, the nematodes rehydrate and once again become active. Soon the galls disintegrate releasing the nematodes onto the soil surface. As long as the soil surface is moist the nematodes will move towards the growing point (meristem) of nearby host plants , where they accumulate and wait until the immature seed head forms. Soon the seed head is invaded thereby, completi ng the life cycle (Riley and Barbetti, 2008 ; Subbotin and Riley, 2012 ). Figure 1. The annual life cycle of t he bacterium causing Rathayiba cter poisoning. This dia gram is for illu strative p urposes only a nd is not dr awn to scale. Note that not all animals consuming infected grasses will die. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 9 Host plants can occur in pasture s or as weeds in crops . Nematode galls in annual ryegrass are difficult to detect in the field as they are small and covered by the outer seed coat (lemma and palea) ; once these coats are removed, the galls are spindle -shaped, shrunken in comparison with normal seed, and purplish -colored (Fig. 2F) . Although most infected pl ants do not s how any visible symptoms, some colonized g rass seed heads beco me twisted and defor med, and may be covered with an orang e-yellow exud ate sometimes called yellow slime. Over time, the slime may harden and darken in color. Note that s lime does not always form, or it may be washed -off by rain. Thus, absence of obvious slime does not mean that a pasture is free of R. toxicus (McKay and Riley, 1993 ). B C F E D A Figure 2.

Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 10 Galls form as the result of infection of the ovaries an d replace the seed. Galls typically are either nematode galls ( dark purple ining galls ( yellow -colored, conta ining bacteria sometimes the remains of dead nematodes ) (Fig. 2F). In many cases, bacteria and ne matode in fections go undetected or the disease is misidenti fied (Finnie, 1991 ). The ne matode vector and bact erium can survive in the dry st ate for many years (M urray, 1986; Nickle, 1991). A rel ated bacterium , Rathayibacter ira nicus, was recently found in Turkey and isolated from asymptomatic wheat seeds on a se mi-selecti ve agar medium (Postnikova et al., 2009). Prod uction of c orynetoxin s varies within field populations of the bact erium, as toxin is not found in all mature gall s colonized by bacteria. Corynetoxins are usually produced as infected plants beco me senescent and the bacteria reach their peak biomass. The toxins are heat stab le glycolipids, known as coryneto xins or C Ts, and are highly toxic ( oral lethal d ose for sheep is 3-6 mg/kg body-weight). Up to 16 toxins may be produced, dif fering only in t heir side -chains (Appendix Table A2; Figs. A1 and A2). The dis ease in a nimals may be confused with o ther diseases, such as ergot of Paspalum , ement of a bacterial virus or bacterio phage has been considered important for toxin production by R. toxicus for so me time, but there is uncertainty over the significance of bacteriophage in disease outbreaks . Bird et al. (1980) and Stynes and Bird (1983) demonstrated the presence of a bacteriophage in toxic galls from Lolium rigidum . McKay et al. (1993) isolated the same bacteriophage from toxic galls found in Lachnagrostis fil iformi s and Polypo gon monspeliensis , and Ophel et al. (1993) showed that only R. toxicus infected with bacteriophage and producing bacteriophage structural proteins, produced corynetoxins in laborat ory experiments. Furthermore, culturing toxin -producing R. toxicus in the presence of an antiserum to the bacteriophage resulted in the bacterium losing the ability to produce corynetoxins. All of these studies were considered reasonable evidence that a ba cteriophage was involved in the production of toxins by the bacterium. However, Kowalski et al. (2007) conducted a study of toxic galls obtained from the screenings of harvested grain, and seed heads collected from ryegrass pasture samples, and found a poor correlation between the presence of corynetoxins and the bacteriophage. In toxic galls from grain screenings, 100% contained R. toxicus and corynetoxins, but only 68% contained the bacteriopha ge. ryegrass seed heads, 86% R. 47% bacterium -positive galls contained corynetoxins, and only 5% of all the seed heads were positive for the bacteriophage. The seed heads with bacteriophage also contained R. toxicus and coryn etoxins. Animals co nsuming R. toxicus -infect ed plants can develop a f atal ne urological disease characteriz ed by convulsions. All grazing ani mals, regard less of age or sex are susceptible to poisoning by the corynetoxin s. Early clinical signs are loss of coordinat ion in the legs, followed by high -held heads and arched backs. Later, muscle tre mors, head nodding, tooth gr inding , involuntary e ye movement, and body convulsions can occur. Initially, these clinical signs are intermittent and episodic, with perio ds of relative normality in between. In the final st ages, the animals lie on their sid es and make walking motions. Poisoning signs can occur over several weeks, and animals can die wit hin 24 hours of the first signs of poisonin g. When an outbreak of the disease occurs, animals may continue to develop clinical signs and die for up to 10 days Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 11 after removal from the toxic pasture . Pregnant a nimals can abort after exposure to co ntaminated forage, and it is belie ved that the inc idenc e of this problem is underesti mated. Post mortem findings may include s mall he morrhages com monly seen in t he gallbladder and also in other organs in cluding the rumen, small intesti ne, kidney and ly mph nodes throughout the body, and altered c olor and appearance of the liver. Elevated liver enzy mes in blood indic ate hep atic damage caused by the to xins. There is no test for corynetoxin s in animal tissues and consequently, the disease is diagnosed on the basis of known exposure to the toxin, level of toxi n exposure (determined by quantity of bacterial galls in the feed), clinical signs, gross and microscopic pathology (lesions suggestive of corynetoxicosis) and the exclusion of other causes . Despite neu rological signs , brain tissue can appear nor mal histo logically. Animals ex posed to corynetoxins do not develop i mmunity bec ause the toxin molecules a re too small to be anti genic (Mc William and Voge l, 1988). Additio nally, a second exp osure to the toxins can result in more severe signs due to an accumulation of the toxin in certain tissues (Jago and Culveno r, 1987). III. Plant In fection, Spread of the Bac terium and Animal Poison ing Pasture and rangeland t hroughout t he U.S. are poten tially su sceptible to infection, as indicated by the occur rence of Anguina species in the U.S., the ne matode vectors , and bacteria related to R. toxicus (Alder man et al., 2003; Postnikova et al., 2004; Riley et al., 200 4). No atte mpt has been made to isolate R. toxicus from toxigen ic fescue gr ass in the so utheastern U .S. Suscepti ble animals at risk in the U.S. include the ap proximately 95 million cattle (USDA- Econo mic Research Ser vice, 2009), 6 million s heep (A merican Sheep Industry Association, 2009), 9 million h orses (A merican Horse Council, 200 9) and an unknown number of Bison . Pigs, lla mas and alpa cas may also be at ri sk, as well as ani mals consu ming toxins from hay or feed grains (e.g. poultry) . The most valua ble ani mals at risk are r ace horses. It is important to note that R. to xicus can pote ntially colonize and produce corynetoxin s in a wide range of ce reals consu med by hu mans, such as those included in dry breakfast cer eals. As seed and hay are moved about t he country, R. toxic us can be spread, most com monly through uncleaned or p oorly cleaned grass s eed, hay, and by wind. Galls fall to the ground after the grass has senesced where the bacteria and nematodes survive , and ne matodes infest gr asses the following autumn or spring. The bacterium and its nematode vector can also be spread by contaminated machinery, vehi cles, animals or run-off water. Given the relatively low r ate of disease develop ment, it may take several years after the introduction of the bacterium and nematode vector to see eviden ce of the dise ase in grazing ani mals. This means the bact erium or nematode could be introduced without detection or any suspici on. Regular grazing helps keep nematode populations low enough to prevent development of Rathayibacter bacteriosis to an economic level. It is a n important but subtle point that in all recorded cases of ARGT in Western and South Australia , the plant host was protect ed from grazing through production of seed heads for one or more seasons , which allowed the nematode populations to increase to damaging amounts. For example, A. funesta in ryegrass within another Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 12 crop as a dominant and hard to control weed, wheat as a host of A. tritici , Anguina spp. in orchard grass and Chewings fescue grown for seed production, A. paludic ola in a pasture that was not grazed because th e field was flooded , and A. paludic ola in blowngrass where rare flood events resulted in a host population well above that which could be consumed by low livestock densities. Suscepti ble grasses and poten tial ne matode vectors are present in the U. S. It is possible that poisoning of cattle and sheep associ ated with consumption of Chewing s fescue scre enings (infested with nematodes), recorded in the 1940s on the west coast (Shaw and Muth, 1949; Galloway, 1961), may have been due to R. to xicus or a related species . Herbarium speci mens from that ti me enabled d etection of a glycolipid toxin, but it dif fered from those produced by R. toxic us (Riley et al., 2 003, 2004). IV. Monitor ing and Detection Surveys for R. toxicus , even in Ore gon where cattle poisonings have occurred (Riley et al., 2003; Shaw and Muth, 1949) , have not been conducted s ince the 196 0s. Thus, it is unkno wn whether a low level of ba cterial infesta tion persists within fiel ds or among native or weed grasses. Surveys of grasses, particularly pasture gr asses, for R. toxicus should be considered. Several published methods for detecting R. toxicus in infected plants are available. The bacterium is not difficult to isolate, but grows sl owly on agar media and may be missed . Seed scarif icatio n, a process of breaking, scratching or mechanically altering seed coats to break seed dormancy and enable ge rmination, can be used for detection of the ne matode and the rel ated bacteriu m, R. rathayi , in orchard grass seed lots (Alder man et al ., 200 3). Newer methods including PCR (Kowalski et al., 2007), rea l-time PC R (Schaad et al. , unpublishe d), me- linked im munosorbent a ssays (ELIS A; Masters et al., 2006 , 2011, 2014 ) for detection of R. toxic us are more preci se, more sensitive, faster and perhaps less expensive , but th eir validation data have not been publis hed. Like R. iranicus, R. toxic us can be presu mptively ide ntified 16S by AFLP analysis (Postnikova et al., 200 9). Rumen fluid and feces may also be tested for the prese nce of R. toxicus , although its presence does not confirm that an ill animal is su ffering from , nor that a dead ani mal died from corynetoxin s poisoning (Allen and Gregory, 2011) . At least for ARGT, a large proporti on of livestock without any clinical signs will give a p ositive rumen test because R. toxicus is widely distribu ted (Bourke, 2007). Necrop sy of animals, with microscopic examination of the brain and liv er especially, is used to pro vide support for diagno sis (see Section II) (Finnie, 2006). ELISA can be perfor med on ryegra ss seed heads pre-anthesis to det ect R. toxicus as a means of predi cting the likelihood of toxicity later in the season (R iley and McKay, 1991; Rile y, 1992b) and allowing stock-owners to undertake measures to reduce the develop ment of toxin (e. g. early grazing, herbici de applica tion or mowing). ELISA is more com monly app lied to mature rye grass samples to determine if the bacterium is present, and if so, the risk of disease that the material presents if consumed by livestock (e.g. when a pplied to hay or standing pa sture) or could poten tially contrib ute to the spr ead of the causal organis ms (McKay and Rile y, 1993 ; Masters et al., 2014 ). Several methods h ave been pub lished for detecti on and identification of potential nematode Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 13 vectors, but their use is not neces sarily ass ociated with the diagnosis of disease in the plant or toxicosis in the ani mal (e.g. McKay and Riley, 1993; Powers et al., 2001) .

Response The response to all pla nt health emergencies is under U SDA-APHIS-Plant Protection under The Plant Protecti on Act of 2000 (7 C FR Part 330) and the Agricult ural Bioterrorism Prote ction Act of 2002 (7 CFR Part 331). The planned immediate response to suspect instances of Rathayibacter bacteriosis of pasture grasses or Rathayibacter poisoning of animals would be to deter mine the causal ag ent. It is necessary to rule out other potential cau ses that pres ent similar sympto ms in the plants or signs in the animals. Thus, diagnosis and dete ction of the bact erium are essenti al first steps. Nematode detection in galls would be an ind irect indicator of high conc ern. A survey of as ymptomatic seed for the bacte rium such as conducted in Turkey ( Postnikova et al., 2009) would be a high priority. After a confir med detecti on of R. toxicus by the USDA-APHIS -PPQ recognized authority, APHIS, in cooperation with the affected State Depart ment of Agricul ture, is in con trol of the respo nse. The respo nse is an immediate assess ment of the disease by a Rapid Assess ment Te am (RAT) that would incl ude regulatory personnel and recog nized R. toxicus experts. The assess ment will con sist of investig ation and del imitation of the site of i nitial detection to prevent pathogen spread and to e stablish e xtent of the af fected area. The RAT team will also assess if the introduction was intentional or accide ntal. As a plant pathogen on the select age nt list, R. toxicus is cover ed under the Agricu ltural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002; federal and local law enforce ment may be involved to deter mine if a n act of bioterrorism has occurred. APHIS imposes quara ntines and re gulatory req uirements to contr ol the i nterstate movement of quaranti ne-signi ficant pathogens or regulated articles and works in c onjunction with states to impose these actio ns par allel to state regulat ory actio ns to r estrict intras tate movement. The US DA-APHIS-PPQ response w ill also depe nd on whe re R. toxicus is found and how widespread, b ased on the initial s urvey by the R AT. If eradi cation of the pathogen is impossible Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 14 as in the event of widespread e stablishment, a decision can be made to continue, ex pand, or modify regulatory actions. S ince the disease in pla nts could be easily o verlooked, it may spread considerable dista nces b efore being detected. In that case, alt ernate manag ement and mitigation techniques would be needed, as outli ned below under Mitigation and Disease Manage ment. VI. USDA Pathogen Permits The Ani mal and Plant Health Inspe ction Service (APHIS) uses an electro nic database, d esignated as e-Permits. Current users are: the Agr iculture Services S), (BRS), Plant Pr otection and Quaranti ne (PPQ), and Veterinary S ervices. Additional information about APHIS per mits can be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/aphis/resources/permits or contact PPQ permit services at (301) 73 4-8758. Access to e-Permits requir es US DA level-2 e-authentic ation, including Select Agents. Applications and permits for Select agents can only be viewed and processed by the Agriculture Select Agent Services staff. Select Agent Permits require the following process: 1. E-submission available and preferred over paper applications of PPQ Form 526. 2. The applicant does not need to have an e -authentication (for paper applications) , but must be Security Risk Assessment (SRA) -approved and registered with the Agriculture Select Agent Services (AgSAS ) or the Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 3. Only the A gSAS staff may receive and input the paper application s into e -Permits. 4. Only the A gSAS staff can \"see\" Select Agent permits in e -Permits. 5. The Unit Director for Operational Services (AgSAS) reviews applications and writes permit conditions. 6. Permit condition s are not sent to the state. 7. Final Permit review and approval is by the Unit Director for Operational Services (AgSAS) , not the PPQ Permits Branch Chief. 8. The Unit Director for Operational Services (AgSAS) signs the final permit and sends it to applicant. 9. The Select Agent pathogen permit looks like any other PPQ Form 526 permit generated through e -Permits by PPQ. 10. Site-Inspections: a. \"General\" or non -Select Agent plant pathogen and pest inspections are conducted by PPQ-Containment Staff, PPQ field inspectors, or State Ag inspectors. b. Select Agent site -inspections are conducted only by A gSAS and/or DSAT inspection staff. c. Select Agent site -inspections can satisfy a \"general\" plant pathogen inspection, but not the reverse. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 15 Additional information on APHIS Select Age nt PPQ 526 permits can be found at: http://www.selectagents.gov or AGSAS@aphis.usda.gov or at 301 -851-3300 option 3. VII. Economic Im pact and C ompensation As late as the 1990s, th ousands of sheep and cattle, as well as so me horses died from ailments (Table 1) attributed to Rathayibacter poisoning in Australia ( Davis et al., 1995). In Austr alia, annual losses of production and cost of control f rom Rathayibacter poisoning ha ve been estimated in the millions of dollars ( Kessell, 2010; Stirling et al., 1992). If the bacterium enters the U.S., compensation by the US DA Risk Manag ement Agency (RMA) may be available f or losses caused by Rath ayibacter tox icus either to plants or ani mals. VIII. Mitigation and Disease Mana gement effective methods. Less ef fective and experi mental methods are also mentioned for comparison. Some methods may be transferable to the U.S. ; however, c ultivars, biological control agents, and va ccines might need to be developed specific ally for the U.S., and possibly for dif ferent re gions within the U.S . Resistant cultivars. There are few commercially known r esistant varie ties of grasses, although resear ch in this ar ea is co ntinuing in Australi a. A sin gle ne matode resistant ryegrass cultivar 'Guard ' was developed (Erickson , 2014 ) for use in South Austr alia. F ). Herbicides. Pre- and post-emergent herbicid es are suggested to kill grass es and decre ase disease presence. This process makes crop r otation easier for manag ement of infested grasses. Howeve r, the development of herbicide resista nce has been reported to correspond with an inc rease in the use of herbicides for the control of annual ryegrass in order to control ARGT (Riley and Gill, 1994). Furthermore, resistance in ryegrass and other weedy grasse s is widespread in parts of the U.S. ( Jasieniuk et al, 2008 ). Pasture ma nagement. Hay can be cut before the seed hea ds become toxic . Topping, or spra ying the tops of plants with an herbicide before f lowering is another po ssibility, alth ough not al ways practica l. Alternatively, heavy grazing can be used to reduce seed head production, but this is only possible if there is a sufficient number of animals to remove all seed heads and any re - emergent seed heads before they can become toxic. Because of the nu mber of animals required, this can only be applied to one or a few fields in a given year. In Austral ia, selecti ve burning of dry pasture after harvest is another manage ment tool used to reduce infected seeds, remains of toxic hay, and ne matode galls. Sowing of clean and certified seed is recom mended. Avoiding seed produced in areas where yellow slime disease is known to occur is a pru dent practice. Close observation is needed to deter mine that seed h eads are free from galls. Seed heads should be examined to watch for the e mergence of yellow bacterial slime on the heads. G rass and seed head s should be tested for the prese nce of the ne matode and/or b acteria. Crop rotation and clean fallow, eradication of host plan ts and alternative p asture forages have been recommended. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 16 Nematicid es. Efforts to re move the vectors by chemical treat ments have not proven ef fective or are considered too costly or impractical. Biological control. Research on bio logical control of vectors has shown promise (e.g. Barbe tti and Riley , 2006), but has not been widely used on a practical basis. The twist fungus, Dilophospo ra alopecuri, has been used by the Western Austr alia Dep artment of Ag riculture and Food to reduce the population of ne matodes (Riley, 1994; Riley 1996; Yan and Riley, 2003) , but is not commercially available at this time . Applying non -toxigenic Rathayibacter species to soil that could compete with R. toxicus for binding sites on the nematode cuticle has potential, but needs additional research (Riley and Barbetti, 2008) . Animal tr eatment s. Treatments for af fected ani mals are limited. Ca re must be taken not to graze animals on heavily infested pastures during d angerous per iods, which extend s from the seed - setting sta ge until the infested grass has weath ered away , been burnt or p loughed under. If alternate pastures are availa ble, ani mals may be re moved from conta minated ar eas. Stock suspected of being af fected by the d isease should be moved as ex peditiously as possible to a clean site. Veteri nary advice sho uld be sought. Curren tly there are no govern ment approved or commercial antido tes or vaccines available. An antid ote to corynetoxin s has been rep orted (May and Stewar t, 1998; C SIRO, unpublished), but its use is constr ained by the f act that outb reaks are unlikely to be detected before ani mals have died or have cons umed too much toxin to be successfu lly treated. Al so, the stress of administering the t reatment can induce an epi sode of convulsions leading to death. An experimental vaccine has been develo ped (Than et al., 19 98) but it has l imitations. Multi ple immunizations are nee ded to give acceptable protection. Even if such prote ctions were availa ble, they may not be suf ficient to per mit ani mals to gra ze toxic pastures witho ut close monitoring (McKay and Rile y, 1993). Integra tion of Mitig ation and Disease Manage ment Strate gies. Risk of Rathayibacter poisoning is generally mitigated by manage ment practices such as crop rot ation, wh ich inclu des changes in grasses grown in past ures, stock rotation a mong grazed pastures, harvesting hay before bacteria produce toxi ns in seed heads , herbicide treat ment of susceptible pasture grasses before flowering to minimize vector and bacterial colonizatio n, inspection of fields for signs of infection and the use of certified seed f ree of the bac terium. The latter is determined t hrough serolo gical or molecular assays and is curre ntly done by both private and govern ment laborat ories in Australi a. IX. Infras tructure and Experts Diagnosis and identification of R. toxicus to species is likely to be relat ively easy if the pla nt host species is wn and sy mptoms pathogens of grasses. Samples from sick a nimals would be exa mined by local veterinary services, a nd may be confused with other a gents or maladies. It would be important to have cross communicati on of plant and animal diagnostician s. If the bacterium is iden tified, t hen regio nal centers of t he Nation al Plant Diagn ostic Network (NPDN) need to know, and sa mples must be submitted to USDA -APHIS - PPZ-CPHST in Belts ville, MD for identificati on. Diagnosticia ns in th ose labs will need educ ational materials for such iden tificati on.

Resea rch, Extension, and Educat ion Needs Needs for r esearch, extension and e ducation vary depending on whether the bact erium, nematode, plant or a nimal co mponent is addres sed. Three over -arching recommendations and several specific recommendations are listed below. 1. Establish stri ct quar antine measures at all ports of entry for hay products and forage grass seeds, especially those originating fr om Australia, New Zealand and South A frica. Develop reliable detection and identificat ion tests for R. toxicus, its hosts and vect ors. 2. Establish an i nterdisci plinary working group of scie ntists familiar with these diseas es, to coordinate research on the detection and identification of the pathogen and vectors, ecology and manag ement of the diseases , and assess the app licability of Austr alian diagnostic practices and procedures to U.S. production sy stems. Bec ause of the co mplexity of these diseases, this recom mendation is critic al to achieve an appropriate and early response to their appearance. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 18 3. Develop educational materials for veterinaria ns, plant pat hologists, n ematologists, extension p ersonnel, crop consultants and p roduc ers of grains and ani mals for food, recreation, and wool. These materials c ould be prod uced in print, web-based material s, symposia and/or workshops. Materi als should first be provided to APHIS and the National Plant Diag nostic N etwork. Specific Needs For bacteria: 1. Deter mine the occurrence and geographic al distribution of Rathayibacter speci es in the U.S. by conducting surveys that initially target plant species and areas with previous reports of Rathayibacter bacteriosis and/or staggers -like occurrences (e.g. California, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Utah, and the northern Appala chians). Subsequent surveys may be more random emphasizing plant hosts in important stock grazing areas. Analysis should include microbial populations in soil (com munity analyses) f rom collection sites . 2. Improve our understanding of genetic diversity a mong Rathayibacter species by such methods as Multil ocus Seq uence Typing (MLS T) and Amplified Frag ment Length Polymorphism (AFL P). 3. Develop an d/or improve rapid diagnostic and detection tools for R. toxicus and related species. 4. Deter mine the prese nce and role of bacteriophage and plasmids in corynetoxin produ ction. A bacteriopha ge ha s been implicated in toxin production by R. toxicus , but further study is needed to determine its role in ARGT outbreaks. In so me bact eria, plasmids carry genetic determinants for toxic products. R. to xicus is known to lose the ability to produce corynetoxin s in culture; loss of pla smids may be one of the reasons. 5. Determine the potential for biological control using non -toxigenic Rathayibacter species. 6. Deter mine the role of corynetoxin s in the ecology of the bacte rium. 7. Sequence t he entire ge nome of at least six R. toxicus strains (one from each geographic al group) and two strain s of related species to asse ss similarities and dif ferences, inclu ding the assess ment of gene(s) related to toxin produ ction. For nemat odes: 1. Deter mine the occurrence and geographic al distribution of Anguina speci es in the U. S. by conducting surveys that initially target plant species and areas with previous reports of Rathayibacter bacteriosis and/or staggers -like occurrences (e.g. California, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Utah, and the northern Appala chians). Subsequent surveys may be more random emphasizing plant hosts in important stock grazing areas. Analysis should include microbial populations in soil (com munity analyses) f rom collection sites . 2. Establish pure cultures of the nematode vectors on greenhouse -grown plants and develop methods for reproducing the disease under controlled environment conditions to i mprove our understanding of the interactions between R. toxicus , its nematode vector, and the plant. Being able to reproduce the disease under conta inment (gree nhouse) co nditions is essential to accomplishing this goal. Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 19 3. Develop tools for molecular detection and identification of Anguina species that may serve as vectors for R. toxicus . 4. Deter mine vector capab ility under optimal and adverse con ditions, or carrying capacity for R. toxicus. 5. Assess the potential for biolog ical control of pr ospective ve ctors. Agen t(s), ease of u se, cost, distribu tion network and shelf life a re factors to be exa mined. Chemical control in t he U.S. is not likely to be approved for the ne matodes, although herbicides might be used for control of host pla nts. For plants: 1. Deter mine feasi bility of developing plant resist ance to ne matode and/or bac terial colonization for the U.S. 2. Deter mine viab ility and yield potent ial of plants bred to be resistant to the nematode, bacterium or toxin production under U. S. conditions. 3. Deter mine applicability and feasi bility of Australian pasture manage ment practices to the U.S. For animals: 1. Deter mine the t oxicolo gical mechani sms by which corynetoxin s produced by R. toxicus damage ani mal tiss ues. Methods using global geno mic and proteo mic analy ses to deter mine specific biomarkers have provid ed some information (Ret allick et al ., 2006 ; Penno et al., 2009, 2012 ). A greater understanding of the mechanism of acti on needed to develop more effective diagnostics or treat ment protocols. 2. Improve the pr otective efficacy of experi mental vaccine s (Than et al., 1998 ) or develop a new generation of vaccine s using novel conjugation and highly potent a djuvant techn ologies. Additional data e fficacy , cross -neutr alization cost e ffectiveness and practical ity are needed for all corynetoxin s to be successful . Rathayibacter Poisoning, page 20 W. Schaad E. 2003.

Corynetoxins (CTs) produced by R. ucturally and functionally similar N-acetylgluco samine tunica minyluracil core struct ure, but vary in the length , terminal branching formation and hydroxylation states of their fatty acid chains ( Eckardt, 1983) (Figs. A1, A2, and Table A2). The stru ctural and functio nal similarity between the CTs produced by R. toxicus and TMs by S. iys osuperficus allows t he use of S. iys osuperficus TMs as a substit ute in e valuating functions of R. toxicus CTs in vitro and in vivo . Indeed, many ef fects of R. toxicus CTs on cells and ani mals were obta ined using S. iysosuperficus TMs in cell and ani mal models, and nu merous reports confir med that the effects of the two on cells and ani mals are in distinguishable (Allen, 2004; Allen et al., 2006; Finni e, 2006). The half-life for R. toxicus CTs should be short, ba sed on studies of S. iys osuperficus TMs, which is about 4 hr in sheep (Stuart et al., 1992). In gener al, glycolipids in their native forms are poor im munogens and not surprisingly, n atural immunity against R. toxicus CTs as glyc olipids has ne ver been rep orted in affected ani mal species. R. toxicus CTs may be extracted from the bacterial g all-rich concentr ate purifi ed with H PLC (Than et al., 2002; Vogel et al., 1981). Table A2.
