What Spikevax is and what it is used for Spikevax is a vaccine used to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2. It is given to adults and children aged 6 years and older. The active substance in Spikevax is mRNA encoding the SARS -CoV - 2 Spike protein. The mRNA is embedded in SM -102 lipid nanoparticles. As Spikevax does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID -19. How th e vaccine works Spikevax stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID -19. Spikevax uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that cells in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you are given Spikevax The vaccine must not be given if - you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). Warni ngs and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax if: - you have previously had a severe, life -threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given Spikevax in the past. - you have a very weak or compromised immune system - you have ever fainted following any needle injection. 2 - you have a bleeding disorder - you have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold - you have any serious illness - if you have anxiety related to injections There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflamma tion of the lining outside the heart ) after vaccination with Spikevax (see section 4) . These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second dose compared to the first dose , and more often in younger males. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain, and seek immediate medical attention should these occur . If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Spikevax . Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare -ups A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare -ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low blood pressure ) have been reported following vaccinat ion with Spikevax. If you have previously had episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given Spikevax. Duration of protection As with any vaccine, the primary 2-dose vaccination course of Spikevax may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. Children Spikevax is not recommended for children aged under 6 years. Other medicines and Spikevax Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other medicines. Spikevax may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Spikevax works. Immunocompromised individuals If you are immunocompromised, you may receive a third dose o f Spikevax. The third dose may still not provide full immunity to COVID -19 in people who are immunocompromised , and you should continue to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID -19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appr opriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Pregnancy and breast -feeding If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before you receive this vaccine. Spikevax can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with Spikevax during the second and third trimester have not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been see n. Spikevax can be given during breastfeeding. Driving and using machines Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines. 3 Spikevax contains sodium Spikevax contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose and, that is to say, essentially 'sodium - free'. 3.

Children 6 through 11 ye ars of age Spikevax will be given to you as two 0.25 mL injections.
