Intuitive readings can be used for guidance and validation of your current experience. Energy healings facilitate the releasing of old/stuck energy and align the energy centers (chakras) of the body to help you feel energized, refreshed and inner calm. If you are challenged by feelings of overwhelm, confusion or stagnation a healing can help. By releasing the stuck energy, cultural programming and misconceptions you believe about yourself, your true essence of vibrance, light and joy can be revealed. Crystal bed and healing sessions with Bethany can be scheduled using the calendar below. Contact healers individually to schedule other appointments. All healers are independent contractors (aside from Bethany, who is the owner) with their own healing practices, who rent space at Sukha Yoga.

Persons requiring medical diagnosis and possible treatment should seek out medical diagnosis, medical monitoring, and take responsibility for what medical actions should be taken if necessary. Readings & Healings with Dr, Bethany Miller Intuitive Readings are useful if you have questions about your relationships, career, life path or you want to release from emotions and thought patterns that are no longer serving you. The sessions may include intuitive guidance, energy healing, chakra balancing, channeling divine knowledge from spirit guides, light language transmissions and hands on healing. These sessions help you to remove obstacles and connect more fully with your intuition, creativity, wisdom and joy. During the session you can ask a question or speak about a concern and Bethany will watch the energy as you are speaking. She will look at what chakra or chakras (7 main energy centers in your body) are out of balance or blocked. An energy healing will help to transmute the vibrational frequencies in your energetic field that have been holding you back from realizing your full potential. You will be supported to release any resistance, fear or doubt that is keeping you in suffering. This co-creative process will bring forward new energetic frequencies that will be expansive and supportive to your soul's purpose on the earth plane. It's like an upgrade for your soul. You have the potential to tap into instant healing and manifestation power. Sessions are $200 for a 60 minute session or $100 for 30 minutes. The end of the session may include time on the crystal bed to help integrate the process. You may choose to come for one session or work deeper with Bethany on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. Healings are currently offered in-person or over the phone. Use the calendar to schedule your session. Listen to this [podcast](https://bit.ly/3Xn1DKr) to learn more about Bethany's work.

Clarity in Motion - With Angela Desalvo If you're seeking clarity and/or validation of your Truth and the courage to carry out your purpose, I can help. I use numerology and basic astrology as portals to do meditation on the purpose of Your Soul. What gets revealed is a snapshot of your journey as it has been, currently is and has to the potential to become. Every client has agreed that it validates their journey and empowers them to live the life they've always felt was theirs to claim but rarely had the courage to do. 1:1 Coaching When working with clients 1:1 for coaching sessions we work in ways that bring further clarity to the individual's life. Clarity is often a result of gaining a different perspective on things as they've always been. I incorporate tools from the Enneagram, numerology, divination and basic astrology into my innate intuitive way of listening deeply from my heart what a person is saying. My ability to mirror a person is often the catalyst for change for the individual. Enneagram Circle Facilitator Learn to find the balance between your strengths and shadows in order to live a more aligned, authentic life. This is accomplished through the Enneagram, an ancient tool that has been married with psychology to offer incredible detail on how to transcend our limitations. Grief work - Medium As a Medium, I can connect you with your departed loves ones. Being seen is what inspires. motivates and validates us to live fully What clients have said: \"Your work is efficient and powerful.\" \"Amazingly accurate to where I am, who I am and where I am going.\" \"Angela helped to clarify the underlying issues I was ignoring in my life... .\" \"...when you said the nickname my father called me, there's no way you could have known that!
