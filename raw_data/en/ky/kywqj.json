The Catalogue of the Public Documents of the [... ] Congress and of All Depart - ments of the Government of the United States (Document Catalogue) fulfilled the requirement for a \"comprehensive index of public documents \" to be prepared \"at the close of each regular session of Congress. \" The Monthly Catalog of United States Government Publications (MoCat) met the stipulation for a \"Monthly Catalogue ... which shall show the publications printed during a month, where [those publicaf^ns are] obtainable, and the price thereof. \" Thus, the original relationship was a current awareness listing (in the MoCat) and a permanent, authoritative, and comprehensive catalog (in the Document Catalogue). In 1947, the cost and perennial difficul - ty of compiling the Document Catalogue led the Superintendent of Documents to recommend to the Joint Committee on Printing that the Catalogue be discontinued after the edition for 1940 was completed. The MoCat began to serve in the capacity of a single source for bibliographic information, fulfilling the requirements of the 1895 act, which stand to this day in 44 USC \u00a71710-1711. From 1895 until 1976, the Government Printing Office (GPO) arranged and described documents according to its own standards and systems. A major revision of the appearance and functionality of the MoCat took place in July 1976. GPO catalogers began producing machine- readable cataloging records (MARC) con- forming to Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR), Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), the Ohio College Library Center (later the Online Computer Library Center, OCLC) bibliographic standards and formats, and other applicable national level standards. Since that time, GPO has gradually expanded the emphasis of its cataloging and indexing program from the production of a single printed product to the creation and maintenance of a database of high-quality, standards-based biblio - graphic records. These records are used by GPO and the library community to sup- port an expanding array of bibliographic control activities. The bibliographic data used to produce this abridged paper edition is also used to produce a compact disk/read-only memory (CD/ROM) and a World Wide Web (WWW) edition. The Web edition links users directly from bibliographic citations to electronic publications, and assists the public to locate information in depository libraries and through GPO sales. GPO bibliographic data is also available to individual libraries directly from GPO and from a variety of commercial sources for the creation of high quality local databases and public access catalogs. pr eli m . 5 Catalog Arrangement -------- Bibliographic entries in the Monthly Catalog (MOCAT) are arranged in Superintendent of Documents classification number order. Each record is also assigned a unique catalog number \u2014a two- digit prefix representing the catalog year, followed by a sequential number beginning with \"1\" in the first issue of each year. Within this arrangement, the publications of each Government author are further identified by the name and address of the issuing agency. Catalog entries in this catalog may be accessed by title keyword index (alphabetical list of truncated titles, arranged by important words selected from publication titles). Please consult the CD-ROM version of the MOCAT for indexing accessed by: Keyword Author Title Series/Report Number Subject Stock Number Contract Number Classification Number Indexes in the CD-ROM version of the Monthly Catalog will cumulate from the beginning of the cal- endar year through the current issues. Abbreviations Abbreviations used in the bibliographic entries are those described in the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd ed, and the GPO Classification Manual: A Practical Guide in the Superintendent of Documents Classification System.
