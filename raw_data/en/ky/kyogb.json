This fulfilled the efficacy standard as recommended by WHO, where the primary efficacy endpoint point estimate for a placebo -controlled efficacy trial should be at least 50%, and the lower bound of confidence interval (CI) should be >30%. More data is expected from ongoing Phase III trials on a rolling review basis. Q10: How long will Vaxzevria provide protection? A10: As the clinical trial is still currently ongoing, no data is available to inform about the duration of protection that the vaccine will provide.
