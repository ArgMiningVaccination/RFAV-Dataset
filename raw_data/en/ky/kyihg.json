Butthere have been fewattempts to define exactly what this means. After a lengthy consul-tation exercise, two influential oncologyorganisations, the American Society ofClinical Oncology and the EuropeanSociety for Medical Oncology, have nowissued a consensus statement on whatconstitutes quality care in cancer (p48).This document spells out the rights thatshould be guaranteed to every cancerpatient, such as the right to be treatedwith dignity, the right to a second opin-ion, the right to receive care from a mul-tidisciplinary team, and rights to pallia-tive care and rehabilitation services. Thestatement offers an authoritative markeragainst which every cancer service can bejudged, and it raises questions about whyrights that are considered fundamentalare still being flouted by so many healthsystems, hospitals and doctors, and whatwe can do to turn this around.The right to a second opinion is a case inpoint. Access to a second opinion isimportant because doctors can makemistakes. A second doctor could seesomething that the first has missed, orknow something the first did not. Secondopinions are particularly important inrare cancers, borderline cases, and can-cers of unknown origin. They can helpKathy Redmond EDITOR ensure that the cancer is diagnosed andstaged correctly and the patient receivesoptimal treatment and follow-up. However, a poll of patients at the 2005masterclass of the European CancerPatient Coalition showed that fewEuropean cancer patients have easyaccess to a second opinion paid for bytheir public health-care system - 50%indicated that in theory there is access,but in practice bureaucracy hinders theprocess. In some countries, patients find italmost impossible to get hold of theirpathology reports and imaging studies,which they need if they are to get a secondopinion. Many health-care systems are setup in a way that makes it very hard to seea second doctor on a reimbursed basis.Personal issues also play a role. Wheresecond opinions are not actively encour-aged, it can be very difficult to ask forone. Some patients worry about offendingtheir doctor; others are concerned abouthaving to build up a relationship with anew team of carers if they change health-care institution.Why are cancer patients still being deniedrights that most of us believe to be funda-mental? What can be done to narrow thegap between our aspirations and reality?CancerWorld will be seeking answers to these questions through an e-survey sentto all our readers in September.

He believed that new technology would make it safer andmore effective. Today, he has faith that synergies between radiotherapy and targeted drugs canbring further benefits - and he is determined to see Europe play a full part in the research effort. Jacques Bernier must have one of the most glorious vistas of any oncologist - from hisoffice balcony in Genolier, Switzerland, hehas a panoramic view of Lake Geneva andthe mountains beyond. He's recently moved to co-head radiation oncology at the pri-vate Genolier Swiss Medical Network, havingspent a long spell in Bellinzona in southernSwitzerland in a similar capacity. While thesecentres may not be the biggest cancer opera-tions around, Bernier has proved that this is noobstacle to scaling the heights of oncology - onmore than one front. His core work in clinical radiation oncology, in particular on head and neck cancers, has ledto pioneering work on radiation dose fractiona-tion, quality assurance and new technology, and,more recently, synergistically combining radio-therapy with chemotherapy, molecular targeteddrugs or surgery. In 2000, he started theInternational Conference on TranslationalResearch and Pre-Clinical Strategies inRadiation Oncology (ICTR). The third have cement-Marc Beishon 4CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006ed this critical discussion on translationalresearch in the packed oncology calendar. And what better place than the traditionally neutral Switzerland for a senior, multilingualoncologist to play a part in bridging the dividebetween northern and southern Europe,through numerous committee and training posi-tions, especially in the European School ofOncology (ESO) and the EuropeanOrganisation for the Research and Treatment ofCancer (EORTC), where he has designed andsupervised many clinical trials. He has some good news - and not so good - about bridging the gaps in oncology and in thewider research and development community. Inhis own field he says the growing synergiesbetween radiation oncology and targeted drugtherapies, and the emergence of new technolo-gies, has led to exciting progress. \"Over the lastdecade or so radiation oncology is again in thegame, which wasn't the case back in the1980s.\" The traditional isolation of radiationoncology centres has been breaking down inrecent years, he adds, noting the appearance ofCoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 5more collaborative papers at his own ICTR meetings. But in a wider context, he feels strongly that Europe has missed the boat in terms of compet-ing with North America on the research front, inoncology and indeed in most medical and scien-tific disciplines. \"In oncology we should havedone something five to ten years ago when wesaw that ASCO [the American Society ofClinical Oncology] was prevailing,\" he says. papers go to ASCO now for scientific andfinancial impact; we should have tried harder tokeep them here.\" That's a view shared by many, of course, but Bernier feels it's symptomatic of a fairly seriousbrain drain among the current generation ofyounger researchers, too many of whom areworking in the US and not returning to Europe.It has prompted him to look closely at an issuehe says is affecting much of European science.\"There is no European market for research - itsimply doesn't exist,\" he says, noting how sad ithas been for him to see so many bright youngresearchers leave for the States. But he isnot one to sound off from the sidelines. He's putpen to paper on the issue, researching and ELIGIO PAONI / CONTRASTO Growing synergies between radiation oncology and targeted drug therapies has led to exciting progressCoverStory 6CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006suggesting action points - applying similar rigour to his 'big picture' interests as he's known for inhis clinical work. That work currently involves rather too much administration for his liking, as he helpsbuild the oncology department at the GenolierSwiss Medical Network, which will include anew centre in Geneva. Having spent 18 years atBellinzona, he says he was ready for new chal-lenges in the last part of his professional life,with the opportunity to add state-of-the-artradio-oncology equipment, which will be inplace by the end of this year. Admin is a necessary evil, he adds, to main- tain a proper integration of oncology disciplinesand to plan for the medium term at least. \"Butit's now very difficult to have a long-term visionas things are changing so fast,\" he says. \"I'm notsure I can say now what radiation oncology willlook like even by 2011.\" This certainly poses a challenge for radiation oncologists as they push for investment inexpensive machinery and resources to staff facil-ities. They also face competition for resourceswith other departments. \"Medical oncology isusually much bigger, which is not favourable tointegration - there's an imbalance of people andfinancial resources. Radiation oncology hasbeen the poor relation.\" Bernier is a Belgium national and went to medical school in his own country, following inhis grandfather's footsteps. He became interest-ed in oncology as he felt, like many in the early1970s, that 'something had to be done'. Takinghis time over a specialism, he wasn't put off bypeople telling him that radiation oncology wouldbe finished in 10 years' time thanks to new drugtreatments. For certain, the machinery of theday could have severe side-effects, \"But I wassure that new technology would improve treat-ment efficiency, and once the modern linac [lin-ear accelerator] was in widespread use, we'veseen a steady progression.\" He went on to achieve distinctions in both radiation oncology and nuclear medicine inLi\u00e8ge, with training also at MD Anderson andthe Curie Institute, and spent his formative clin-ical days in hospitals in Eupen and Charleroi.Here he carried out lab research, developing in-vitro assays for interferon, interleukin and the tumour necrosing factor - his path crossing thatof Paul Franchimont, a 'visionary' Belgian doctorand scientist - and received awards for both hisclinical and research work. While his specialty may have taken a back seat to the rush to chemotherapy in the 1980s,he says the presence of powerful and forcefulfigures in radiation oncology helped him andothers keep the faith. They include Jean-PierreBataini, from the Curie Institute in Paris,Emmanuel van der Schueren, a Belgium oncol-ogist who died too young and who Bernier sayswas a great loss to European oncology, and, inthe US, well-known names such as HermanSuit and Gilbert Fletcher (the latter Bernierworked with at MD Anderson). \"They wereeither pioneering or reinforcing things, and Inever had the impression that we'd reached aplateau in radiation oncology,\" he says. The history of his specialty is of more than just passing interest for Bernier. Over the last fewyears he has written several times on the histori-cal context, including a paper published in 2004in Nature Reviews Cancer , entitled 'Radiation oncology: a century of achievements', on whichhe was lead author. \"We have to understand thelessons of the past to develop treatments that aremost fruitful for the future,\" he says. \"For exam-ple, we have followed paths such as neutrontechnology that, while efficient, had severe side-effects and were too niche to be worthwhile.History has a habit of repeating itself.\" Naturally, he has a modern day example in mind - although reluctant to single out any pro-fessional colleagues, he wonders whether theinterest at European level in boron-neutroncapture therapy might be subject to rather toomuch hype. But given the huge developmentcosts and timescales involved in creating newmachinery, open debate - and patience - issurely needed. As Bernier also points out, therehave been periods in the 100 plus years of radio-oncology where little outward progress wasmade, and much persistence and trialling withthe right approaches is essential. What is striking about his historical article is that, although the timeline for techniques suchas positron-emission tomography (PET) andCoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 7intensity-modulated (IMRT) shows that they were first developed some yearsago, widespread access to affordable machinery,and new clinical techniques, are much morerecent. The old cobalt-60 units, he notes, arestill in use, especially in the developing world,thanks to their relatively simple operation.Meanwhile in Europe he reckons that the aver-age age of machinery in use has not changedmuch since he carried out some surveys over 15years ago. In his own history, Bernier reached deputy department head in Charleroi before, in 1988,taking a step up to be director of the radio-therapy and nuclear medicine department at theItalian Swiss Institute of Oncology, based at the San Giovanni hospital in Bellinzona,Switzerland. He took with him his earliest andmost important specialism, head and neck can-cer, which he'd worked on at his various place-ments and with his main mentors. \"Head and neck is a good model for clinical investigation,which is probably why I started there,\" he says.\"Later, I have also specialised in breast irradia-tion - that's a key topic in my training activitieswith the European School of Oncology - andalso lymphomas, as there are significant num-bers treated at Bellinzona. But clearly head andneck is my main field.\" His most significant contribution to date has been pioneering the combined use of radio- andchemotherapy in head and neck oncology. Whenthe emphasis in the field was largely on alteredfractionation techniques, which he also con-tributed to, Bernier was working in the early1990s on radio/chemo combination, culminatingin a paper showing the advantages of concomi-tant cisplatin and irradiation as an adjuvant treat-ment for stage III or IV head and neck cancer. \"This was based on clinical trials and \"It's very difficult to have a long-term vision as things are changing so fast\" Man and machine. The precise imagesobtained throughmodern WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006the format of trials and it will also be important to obtain quality of life data - to calculate thetherapeutic index and increase efficacy withoutincreasing toxicity. Otherwise there is no pointto the treatment.\" Another factor is a need to reverse to some extent the role of smaller centres in Europe-wide trials, as they simply will not have theresources to participate to a meaningful degree.As Bernier says of his own contributionat Bellinzona, his focus was on quality notquantity of trials - \"It is better to participatewith a lot of patients in 10 trials than one or twoin 50, which is a nonsense,\" he says. At Bellinzona, Bernier contributed to the establishment, in 1999, of the OncologyInstitute of Southern Switzerland, whichmarked the shift to multidisciplinary integrationof specialisms, away from a general hospitalmodel, and was one of the first such moves inthe country. He notes that the geography of theregion posed problems for integrating services,but modern communications such as e-mail area great aid. \"Interdisciplinary tumour boards have the great advantage that you don't take decisions byyourself, and they can improve the quality oftreatment especially where you have many casesof one cancer type.\" His model for the idealoncology department involves what he terms the'magnificent five' - training, organisation, spe-cialism, networking and funding. As for the status of radiation oncology in Europe, he broadly agrees with MichaelBaumann, current president of the radiationoncologist body ESTRO (who was profiled inthe January 2006 issue of CancerWorld ) that radiotherapy suffers from a lack of visibility; it isdwarfed by the drugs lobby, with the result thattoo little money is allocated to replacing wornout and out-of-date equipment. Bernier alsohighlights the problem of isolation, which while published side by side in the New England Journal of Medicine with American work that reached more or less the same conclusions. It isa good example of evidence-based medicine.\" Bernier is described by one close collabora- tor as a \"model clinical researcher - innovativeand lateral thinking with a solid grasp of clinicalreality,\" and he's been a highly valuable researchcoordinator at the EORTC, standing down fromchairing the head and neck group only recently. \"My EORTC work was extremely time con- suming, but it offers an excellent platform toconduct trials and there are many top-qualitypeople involved. But it will have to evolve tomeet several challenges.\" Chief among these, he says, are the increas- ing administrative burdens placed on trialsthanks to the \"negative impact of the EUClinical Trials Directive\", and the advent oftranslational research and the need to have acompanion trial, say on biomarkers, alongsidethe main clinical trial. \"We will have to change \"Radiotherapy is not Herceptin, interleukin or cetuximab - it's much cheaper\" Taking a break in the French Alps with wifeAnne and daughtersCaroline (left) and G\u00e9raldine(right) . Bernier's love of has alsoled him to in a moreradiological senseCoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 9starting to break down, still remains. \"Some cen- tres are persisting with old institutional policies,and do not integrate enough lessons from thepast into their daily practice.\" He also mentions the abiding, old-fashioned image of radiotherapy in the public mind, andthe shortage of professionals entering thespecialty in some countries. \"In Switzerland,there are few radiotherapy centres, so potentialradio-oncologists and medical physicists couldbe concerned about their careers. Our mission isto make the case that radiotherapy is cost effec-tive,\" he adds. \"While the effectiveness arguments are well rehearsed, Bernier also notes that, as cancerpatients are living longer, the number of patientsneeding radiotherapy is rising - quite markedlyso in some countries such as the Netherlands.\"It is less so in Switzerland, but the trend is stillupwards. \"Radiotherapy is not Herceptin, interleukin or cetuximab - it's much cheaper. But the mes-sage is still difficult to get across, as the magni-tude of investment for new machinery and themultidisciplinary team needed to operate it ishigh at the start.\" The economic argument won the day at Genolier, where the latest adaptive technologywill be installed at the new site in Geneva.Genolier will no doubt be a rising force inEuropean oncology, having both Bernier and ahigh-profile director of the multidisciplinaryteam on board - the latter being Matti Aapro,another multitasking international operator. \"We are now in position to mine a rich seam of contributions from radiation oncology,\" saysBernier. \"I would class these essentially intotechnical improvement of equipment, con-comitant therapies, big-dose fractionation, for instance, that a better knowledgeof the tumour radiosensitivity level prior to anytreatment is bound to help oncologists tailormore accurately the patient management. He has concerns that, while satisfactory for the present, the R&D of new equipment is vest-ed in a small handful of manufacturers, and thatin any case radiation oncology is but small com-pared with the radiology diagnostics field. New technology will certainly be needed to investi-gate big-dose fractionation, an area Bernierfeels has not been fully explored. \"We don'tknow enough about the biology of large doses -we can deliver them with new techniques athigher precision without an increase in toxicity,but it will require more sophisticated machinerythan we have now.\" Translational research is one of Bernier's main interests now - in particular efforts to opti-mise dose distribution according to variationsnot just in the physical dimensions of thetumour but also biological parameters such asthe metabolism or hypoxia of the tumour tissue.\"One of the main breakthroughs was presentedby James Bonner at ASCO in 2004 on growth factorreceptor] drug cetuximab [Erbitux] in head andneck cancer, which paves the way for any cyto-toxic or non-cytotoxic drug to be used in combi-nation with radiotherapy - it is one of the maincontributions in a new field.\" Bernier would like to see more attention paid to non-cytotoxic drugs, most of which arecurrently directed towards cell membranereceptors - either monoclonal antibodies for theouter domain of the cell membrane, or smallmolecules for the inner domain that trigger thesignaling pathways in the cytoplasm. \"I have a mind that is rather mechanistic - I feel close to this membrane receptor, signalingpathway research field. The clinical model is notimportant - it's the use of targeted therapieswith radiation that appeals.\" It is the testing of drug therapies with radio- therapy that for Bernier has brought radiationoncology 'into the game' and into the world ofclinical oncology and systemic treatment. Afterpromoting various translational studies, intoareas as radio-resistance mechanisms andmodulation, organising courses forthe European School of Oncology, Bernier felt itwas time to do things on a bigger scale, and setup in 2000 the first conference devoted to trans-lational research strategies in radio-oncology, theICTR. For this conference, he drew principallyon his ESO, EORTC and US contacts, and as aresult it initially received a somewhat coolCoverStory 10 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006reception from the radiation oncologist body ESTRO. However, Bernier has since invited sev-eral ESTRO people in as contributors, and theproceedings of the third meeting were publishedin ESTRO's journal, Radiotherapy and Oncology . It's a good example of his ability to act as a bridge builder - although he points out that thereis some ongoing discontentment with the'north-south divide' in oncology in Europe, withnorthern countries having more senior positionsin societies, and also having most of the majorcancer centres. \"There are clearly very large vari-ations in the quality and quantity of centresbetween north and south,\" he says. \"And I knowthat, despite a somewhat better balance observedrecently, some colleagues in southern Europe feelfrustrated about the representation on societyboards - language plays a role of course.\" A poverty of ambition and funds in most countries feeds into his view that Europe aswhole should be worried about its overall R&Dpicture. \"It has been a shock to me to find somany of the next generation leaving to go to theUS.\" He has noted for example, that there hasbeen perceivable unrest in a number ofEuropean research laboratories, especially inFrance and Italy, commenting that France hasspent just $3 a head on cancer research - com-pared with $14 in the US. \"Overall, Europe is investing 40% less in R&D than the US and the gap is still widening. Inthe medium term the European Union needs torecruit 700,000 scientists to meet its needs - andwhat's alarming is that out of 400,000 Europeanscience and technology graduates who now workin the US, only a third intend to return home.\" A toxic mix of factors is contributing to this situation, according to Bernier. Chief amongthem are a drastic reduction in permanent posi-tions, low salaries - a differential of three to onebetween the US and the UK, for example - and\"rapidly deteriorating working conditions in lab-oratories\", with \"scores of dysfunctions resulting from staff shortages\". Research programme frag-mentation has reduced labs to 'science hotels',where each group is independent and responsi-ble for its own funding and survival. Bluntly: \"Billions of euros and tens of thou- sands of jobs are at stake.\" Bernier has a three-pronged prescription to reverse this decline. For researchers, more clus-ters of excellence for academic training shouldbe established, he says, with a better balance oftemporary and permanent posts. Further, thebureaucracy associated with applying for postsand grants should be greatly reduced. \"Decisiontimes are far too long.\" As a contribution, Bernierhas himself set up the Foundation for theAdvancement of Radiation Oncology (FARO),based in Geneva, which offers a number of train-ing grants, and also raises funds for equipment. For the scientific leadership, he advocates more mobility for scientists - an issue oftenraised in CancerWorld - and less fragmentation of research. The UK's National CancerResearch Institute and France's new 'can-ceropoles' are steps in the right direction. \"Theformation of a European equivalent of the USNational Cancer Institute could help exchangebetween these centres,\" he adds. For policymakers, he is backing the idea of a Europeanresearch area and the concerted take up of aplan to allocate 3% of GDP to research. While active on many bodies over the years, Bernier does not aspire to head an oncologysociety - and says that it is perhaps easier tocommunicate these big picture issues from thebackground. However, on the brain drain issuehe is not overly pessimistic in the long run. \"Theproblem is not as extreme as the rush to the USin the 1950s/60s, and there is excellent researchand clinical work being carried out in Europe -the issue is how to develop the work and makeit more visible.\" A drastic reduction in permanent positions and low salaries are still driving young researchers to the USCoverStory CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 11Bernier has only been at Genolier a few months, so his work programme away from routine clini-cal work has yet to be decided. He does not feelthat the switch to a private institute will affecthis networking ability - he is also a professor atthe University of Geneva, for example, and willcontinue with teaching duties there and at ESO.He adds that Genolier is not an exclusive set-up,although inevitably a lot of patients come fromwell-off, overseas backgrounds. Genolier alsohas a special relationship with Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York for knowledge exchange,he says. While at Bellinzona, he also became presi- dent of the Tessin League, a cancer patientorganisation that interfaces with professionals,and notes that this canton in Switzerland hasbeen a leader in such support bodies. \"We devel-oped an approach first used in France wherepatients could express their frustrations tomedics,\" he says. \"It is very helpful for patientswho have not so far vented their feelings and alsofor doctors to realise it is not a perfect world.\" With his mind back on trials - which it often is - Bernier notes that patient power could ren-der the gold standard randomised controlled trialrather less than academic. \"Patients and familiesare accessing a lot of information on the Internetthat even insiders find difficult to interpret,\" hesays. \"One consequence is that we are finding itharder to randomise patients into different treat-ment arms as they are increasingly reluctant toaccept our proposals. I'm not a statistician, butmethods other than randomisation may need tobe found for evidence-based medicine.\" Away from work, Bernier enjoys jogging and skiing. His wife Anne, a physiotherapist, proba-bly came in more than handy after several bro-ken bones on the slopes. His two daughters bothwork in Italy, one a lawyer, the other in tourism. On his reading list are books on geopolitics, not surprisingly, while a favourite author isUmberto Eco, whose 'translational' literary works no doubt appeal to Bernier's mechanisticmind. Another Umberto, the Italian cancerleader Veronesi, is a close contact and Bernier ison the scientific committee of this year's Futureof Science conference in Venice, set up byVeronesi, where luminaries such as the experi-mental psychologist Stephen Pinker and theevolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins will beholding court. No doubt evolution is yet another core inter- est for Bernier - even though he still won't betaking bets on what his own field will look likein five years time. \"There is excellent work being carried on in Europe - the question is how to make it more visible\" ELIGIO PAONI / CONTRASTOGrand Round 14 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006The discovery of the first human oncogene in April1982 marked an explo-sion of knowledge aboutthe molecular biology of cancer. It delivered scientists theirfirst molecular target, which had pro-found implications for the develop-ment of anti-cancer drugs. If patientsare to reap the huge potential benefitsoffered by molecular targeted thera-pies as quickly and cheaply as possi-ble, industry and academia alike willneed to adapt their drug developmentstrategies accordingly. Mariano Barbacid, now head of the Centro Nacional de InvestigacionesOncol\u00f3gicas (CNIO) in Madrid, ledone of three teams that separately, andsimultaneously, isolated the mutantgene. In the same year, dubbed byNature the Year of the Oncogene, he went on to show the gene was from theras family, that it differed from the nor-mal gene only in a single point muta- tion and that it could be found in thetissue of lung adenocarcinoma, but notin the patient's normal tissue. What happened next is a caution- ary tale that Barbacid makes a pointof telling young researchers.Pharmaceutical companies rushed tofind a way to inhibit the activity of themutant rasgene. They identified as a likely target the farnesyltransferaseenzyme, without which the rasgene would be unable to send its pathogen-ic signals. A billion dollars was sunkinto the race to find the first effectivefarnesyltransferase inhibitors. None ofthem worked. Too late, it was discov-ered that the rasgene has a contin- gency plan. In absence of thefarnesyltransferase enzyme, a relatedenzyme, geranylgeranyltransferase I, iscalled into action, and the gene isback in business. The researchers had identifiedtheir target correctly and had found a way to inhibit their target, but theyhad failed to check that hitting theirtarget had the desired effect on thetumour. (Attempts to resolve theproblem by inhibiting both enzymesat once have so far failed due tounacceptable toxicity.) This lesson has been reinforced by subsequent history. New targets dis-covered in labs offer vital pointers forthe development of effective anti-cancer drugs. But unless researchersexplore, as early as possible, whathappens in real tumours when thetarget is hit, they risk committingthemselves to an expensive develop-ment of a drug that will not work.Worse, there is a possibility of over-looking a potentially effective drugbecause it was tried on the wrongpatients, at the wrong dose or sched-ule, or without recognising its efficacyin combination with other therapies. Anna WagstaffTargeted drug development by trial or error? Bringing the new wave of targeted cancer drugs to the market poses new chal- lenges for researchers and clinicians. It is not enough to design a smart drug to hit amolecular target. Researchers need to know how to test and develop the drug.The potential prizes are enormous - so is the price of failure.CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 15Grand Round Development has replaced discovery as the key to getting new drugs to themarket, says Jean-Pierre Armand,who set up the phase I clinical trialsunit at the Gustave Roussy inVillejuif, Paris, almost 25 years ago,and was a founder of the FlimsClinical Trials Workshops. \"Ten yearsago there were very few drugs, butnow we have many drugs that are verysimilar. The difference now is not inthe discovery but in how you developthem.\" The good news is that the possi- bilities for finding out what is goingon at a molecular level are expandingat an impressive speed. The patho-logical/diagnostic imaging industry isworking overtime to find improved,easier and more accurate ways todemonstrate and interpret what ishappening in tissue at a genomic andproteomic level, enabling researchersto track the biological impact of theirdrug on the tumour and adapt theirdevelopment according to what theyfind. The new mantra for the aca-demic drug development community,coined by Jos\u00e9 Baselga of inBarcelona, Inthe words of Lex Eggermont, pastPresident of the EuropeanOrganisation for Research andTreatment of Cancer (EORTC),\"The patient should guide theprocess,\" and \"a properly designedclinical trial is a tool to better under-stand cancer biology.\" It is taking a while for the message to get through. Armand tells of a morerecent rerun of the farnesyltrans-ferase inhibitor saga, this time with metalloproteinase inhibitors - a typeof antiangiogenic compound. \"Therewere five or six big companies in thegame, including Schering and BristolMyers Squibb. They had shown pre-clinical activity, they had a nice target,and nice concept of activity and theyshowed biological modifications inphase I and II. People said the clini-cal results will follow. They werewrong.\" Armand is not at all surprised that none of these drugs turned out to beclinically active in phase III, as nonehad shown evidence of clinical activi-ty in phase I or II. \"We used to go intoa randomised phase III trial onlywhen we had very strong data fromphase II. But now companies are sorich that they already have the moneyfor phase I, II and III, and theybelieve that the phase III will tellthem that the drug is active, evenwhen they have not seen anything inphase II.\" This approach, he adds, partly explains the exorbitant price of thenew anticancer drugs. \"It is becausethere are such stupid phase III trialslaunched, because of some minimalactivity, in the hope that they will getfantastic results, when the clinicaldata on phase II are not encouraging.They are relying too much onserendipity.\" He accepts, however, that lessons are being learnt, and that pharmaceuti-cal companies are far more cautiousabout committing themselves thanthey were five years ago, \"sometimestoo cautious\". Surprisingly, perhaps, itis the smaller 'biotechs', for so long hailed as the creative engines of thedrug industry, who are now branded asthe main culprits - and their problem istoo little money, rather than too much. Eggermont says \"The culture in biotechs is to try to hit a home run.They have a budget that depends onvery quick decisions and offers thechance for only a very limited amountof study, and one phase III trial. Ifthey don't score on the phase III, theyusually are dead. So you see a lot ofwishful thinking and jumping intophase III trials, where you take thewhole population into your study,hoping you are going to be lucky,rather than working with more select-ed patient populations where yourchances of being successful may beenhanced, because at least you haveproved that the patients have the tar-get, and that you have reached thetarget. Some biotechs may be simplytoo small to have the time and moneyto go through all these steps, and theymake a tremendous push to try tomake the home run without havingdone all these studies.\" There has also been a failure among clinicians and statisticiansinvolved in designing trials to appreci-ate just how unlikely it is that the tra-ditional trial protocols used for theold-style cytotoxics would work for adrug designed in the laboratory to hita very specific molecular target. TRADITIONAL TRIALS DO NOT WORK Clinical trials have traditionally beendesigned to answer only minimal Too late, it was discovered that the rasgene has a contingency planGrand Round questions, the key one being: does this drug work better (prolong sur-vival, prolong disease-free progres-sion, etc) than a given alternative orplacebo, with secondary questionsabout side-effects. Phase III, usuallya large randomised controlled trial,was designed to answer this question,while phases II and I were merelydesigned to clear the way. Phase Itested for toxicity in humans and triedto identify the maximum tolerateddose; phase II looked for signs of effi-cacy - usually tumour shrinkage - andwas used to judge whether it would beworth investing in a phase III. The whole point about the new targeted agents, however, is that theyare targeted. Some are precisely tar-geted against a particular moleculesuch as the epidermal growth factor(EGF) HER-2 receptor, others,notably kinase inhibitors, oftenhit a number of proteins similar totheir intended target, but they arenonetheless highly selective com-pared to the blanket bombingapproach of traditional cytotoxics.They can therefore be expected towork only in patients in whom thetarget is a significant driving forcebehind their cancer. Sadly, with an experimental drug, it is rarely possible to identify inadvance who the responders will be.Though targeted drugs by definitionaim at a target believed to be involvedin driving the cancer in question, onlyin the more 'simple' cancers such aschronic myeloid leukaemia, has shut-ting down that target proved sufficientto get a response in the vast majority 16 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006of patients. Even Herceptin, hailed asa huge step forward, is only effectivein half the breast cancer patients withHER-2 overexpression. A key part ofdeveloping a targeted drug thereforehas to be finding predictive 'markers'that differentiate responders from thenon-responders. Rushing into phaseIII trials without doing the necessarywork to identify the patients likely torespond is therefore likely to be arecipe for failure. In addition, there is also the 'old' problem that experimental drugs areusually tested first for use inadvanced disease. In early disease themolecular mutations are likely to beimplicated in driving the cancer, andare therefore potential targets. Overtime, however, the tumour will usual-ly mutate further as a result both ofthe natural history of the disease andthe effect of treatments given earlierin the disease, making it very hard tointerpret what is going on. For this reason it is becoming common, before going into phase IIItrials, especially with less toxic drugs,to explore how they function in asmall group of patients with earlierdisease, if a 'window of opportunity'can be found. Typically this will be ina neoadjuvant setting, for instance inwomen with locally advanced breastcancer in the run up to surgery, orperhaps prostate cancer patients whohave undergone surgery or radiother-apy with curative intent, who stillshow rising levels of prostate specificantigen, but are without sufficientsymptoms to warrant hormonaltherapy. Neoadjuvant/adjuvant studies also have the advantage that pre- and post-treatment tissue is readily availablefrom preoperative biopsies and laterfrom the excised tumour. In studies ofmetastatic cancer, by contrast, it canbe difficult to harvest tissue, forinstance when the lesions are in thebone, liver or lung. These trials may be designed as non-randomised single-arm studies,but very often they will move on to arandomised controlled phase II trial.They may be stratified to refineunderstanding of the best dosingschedule, or to check whether apotential marker of response reallycan differentiate patients who arelikely to respond from those who arenot, or even to look at the effect ofusing the drug in combination (eachcombination must of course havebeen tested preclinically and in aphase I to establish toxicity). PhaseI/II trials now often comprise a seriesof studies, each step adapted to thefindings of the previous one. A third problem with relying exclusively on traditional phase IIItrials is that many targeted drugs areexpected to be effective mainlythrough halting disease progression(cytostatics) rather than by killingtumour cells (cytotoxics). For exam-ple, anti-angiogenesis agents choketumours by inhibiting their ability togrow new blood vessels. Though angiogenesis inhibitors are now proving effective in what hadhitherto been some of the hardestcancers to treat, such as renal cellcancer and metastatic colon cancer, \"They had a nice target and nice concept of activity. People said the clinical results will follow...\"CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 17they are not natural performers in clinical trials. The tumour shrinkageshown with cytotoxics is a strongindicator of activity; it is harder toprove activity where the aim is non-progression. However studies thatshow the scientific concept of thedrug works in live tumour tissue - inthis case, that vascular growth isinhibited - increase its medical plau-sibility, and can help to convince reg-ulators that a cytostatic drug is clini-cally effective. Doing the science preclinically and in phases I and II is crucial tosuccess at phase III. It is also essen-tial to the early identification of thoseearly drugs that are enticing in theirscientific concept but do not actuallywork in human tumours.THE RETURN OF THE MOUSE Clinical trials are costly, they taketime to accrue patients and they areheavily restricted by ethical consider-ation safeguarding the best interestsof the patients. One way to avoidwasting time on inactive drugs andquickly to find out as much as possi-ble about active drugs is to subjectthem to a thorough examinationbefore allowing them into the clinic.The era of molecular medicine hasopened up new possibilities in thisarea that are often not fully exploited. The mouse model, criticised for its shortcomings in predicting humanresponses to drugs, is making acomeback in mutant form. Instead ofinjecting mice with carcinogenicagents, 'transgenic mice' are geneticallyengineered to model be driving particularcancers. These 'transgenic mice' can beused to examine the pathogenic mech-anisms involved, to try out the efficacyof targeted drugs and to look for surro-gate markers for anti-tumour activity. Pier Paolo Pandolfi, of the Sloan Kettering in New York, sits on theUS National Cancer Institute'sMouse Model of Human CancerConsortium, which is dedicated toextending the range of mouse modelsand making them available forresearch. He stresses that when itcomes to predicting toxicity or evenefficacy in humans, mice models arenot much help. However, they cantell you whether a drug is actually hit-ting its target, and whether the targetGrand Round Genetically destined to develop cancer. By engineering geneticchanges in mice that mimicmutations known to causespecific cancers in humans,researchers can now breedstrains of mice that will,for instance, develop a particulartype of breast cancer 'like a clock',6 months from birth, and whoseoffspring will do the same Mouse models can tell you if a drug is hitting its target, and if the target is indeed driving the cancerSCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYGrand Round is indeed a driving force for the can- cer in question. The story of the farnesylase inhibitors, he says, is a case in point.Researchers used a mouse model engi-neered with a mutant rasgene, and then inactivated the farnesylaseenzyme. \"They proved that knockingout this enzyme, which was what thefarnesylase inhibitors were designed todo, did not affect the tumorigenesisdriven by rasat all, and they even came up with an explanation, which is thatrasuses another enzyme to be activat- ed.\" Sadly, this was only done after mil-lions had been wasted on the drug. Pandolfi says that such tests are essential before jumping into the clin-ical arena and testing for efficacy andtoxicity in labour-intensive, expensiveand long-term experiments inhumans. \"You cannot quote me a sin-gle example where a drug that shouldwork in a mouse and does not, hasbeen shown to work in humans. Ifthey would first assess whether thetarget, once inhibited or taken out 18 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006from a mouse, would impact at allon the tumour, they could save anenormous amount of money.\" The transgenic mouse is a far more powerful investigation tool thanits predecessors. \"Technologicallyspeaking we are in a position to liter-ally recreate a tumour with the genet-ic makeup that we want, because weare able to inactivate genes, activategenes, mutate genes in a specific tis-sue at a specific given time.\" Of course models can only be made after the genetic make up of theequivalent human tumours have beenprofiled - and scientists have only justscratched the surface of that work.But as Pandolfi points out, the bene-fits increase as more profiles aredefined. The more that genetic sub-types of a given cancer are identified,the smaller the patient population foreach becomes, which makes it moredifficult to accrue patients in trials.Genetic subtypes are not a problemwith mice, which can be bred foreach strain of the relevant mutation.In this way, a potential breast cancer drug can quickly be screened across avariety of genetic subtypes, while adrug aimed at a particular mutationcan be screened across a variety oftumour sites. The information can beused as a guide to stratify patients inearly clinical trials to help refine thetarget patient group. Eggermont from EORTC also believes that mouse models enhanceunderstanding of targeted drugs.\"With all the technology we can nowknock out and knock in genes, whichgreatly enhances your biologic under-standing of what a certain targetmeans. It would be a failure of under-standing of how biology moves for-ward to say that mouse models arenot important. Mouse models can bevery important, but they are part of amuch bigger picture.\" He cites work by Craig Jordan, of the Fox Chase Cancer Center inPhiladelphia, into tamoxifen resist-ance in mouse models. \"The tumourswere originally with tamoxifen becomeinsensitive. Then you give second-lineand third-line hormonal therapies andyou can end up with tumours that aretamoxifen sensitive again. Thosemouse models give great insight intowhat actually may be happening in thesubset of patients with hormonal sen-sitive tumours who 'live on for ever'despite having metastatic disease. It'sa new thing to even conceive that youcould go back to tamoxifen after anumber of lines of hormonal therapy.\" PHASEI TRIALS Although a lot can be learnt from pre-clinical trials about a target, its role indriving a cancer and the ability of thedrug to hit that target, it is only by tri-alling it in patients that it is possible todiscover its toxicity, activity, and opti-mal dosage and to identify in whichMice models of human cancer have only recently been liberated from a highly con- troversial all-encompassing 'oncomouse' patent held by Harvard University. Patentsare still in force covering the use of these mice or cell lines derived from them fortesting drugs. However, Pier Paolo Pandolfi, who sits on the US National CancerInstitute's Mouse Model of Human Cancer Consortium (MMHCC), says that in hisexperience there is a lot of scope for academic exploratory studies without runningfoul of the patent.So far, mouse models are available from the MMHCC for around 64 genetic muta-tions, with types of leukaemia, lymphoma, skin, breast, lung, gastrointestinal,prostate and brain tumours being the most frequently modeled. They can be pur-chased over the Internet, as live mice or in frozen embryo form athttp://mouse.ncifcrf.gov/. Though Europe does have a consortium, the EuropeanMutant Mouse Archive (www.emmanet.org) dedicated to archiving and distributing'relevant mutant strains essential for basic biomedical research', it does not have thesame focus on generating engineered models of human cancers. There are individualinstitutions, such as the CNIO in Madrid, that are heavily involved in this sort of work.THE MUTANT MICE MARKETCANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 19patients it works best. Phase I trials were traditionally limited to establish-ing maximum tolerated dose, butArmand from the Gustave Roussy,who did the phase I trials on sunitinib[Sutent], says this has all changed.Phase I trials are where you begin tolearn about how the drug impacts onthe tumour, and how best to measurethat impact to find out the most effec-tive dose and schedule, and maybetease out some pointers to what differ-entiates responders from non-respon-ders, which can be tested in phase II. \"I believe this phase I moment is very critical. You should do more thanone phase I trial and you shouldexplore more than 40 patients, maybe 60 or 80 at this level, because that isthe moment you do the fine tuning tooptimise the dose and recognise a fewsignals of activity.\" Armand uses a variety of tech- niques to see what the drug is doing,including expensive high-techmethods like genomic profiling,cheaper quicker functional imagingtechniques and, above all, his clinicalexperience as a doctor. His advice to clinicians involved in clinical trials is not to get blinded bythe technology. \"When you are a cli-nician, you should remain a strongclinician. You cannot see yourpatients through a chart. You should see your patients every week duringdevelopment, because the patientshave tools which tell you, before youcan read it anywhere, that there issome activity. So see the patient andmeasure what they say.\" Everyone, he says, is rushing around desperate to find 'surrogatemarkers' of activity that can quicklyand reliably predict whether a treat-ment will be clinically effective, inorder to speed up the phase I and IIstudies. \"The real activity, and this isone of my latest discoveries, is theclinical benefit,\" says Armand. \"WhenI have patients telling me, 'DrGrand Round The ultimate investigative tool.

I don't have one\"Grand Round Armand, I am happy with this drug,' even if the surrogate markers are notsignificant, for me it is a real drug. \"We are back to the old story: let the patient tell you whether they arehappy or not with the treatment, andthen you have something in yourhands. On the other side, you havepeople who would prefer to say: 'Wedon't need the patients. We only needa sample of blood to say this is a gooddrug for the patient'.\" Most phase I trials are conducted with patients reaching the end oftheir disease, when they are gettingworse by the patient thedrug, and one week later they areplaying tennis, when before theyspent all day in bed. Tell me a bloodtest that can predict activity quickerthan the clinic.

Some of my patients haveenough drug for one month, and theytake it in one week. And they say, 'Youknow your dosage is not enough, so Iincreased it and I feel a lot better.'There is critical clinical informationavailable when, as a good clinician,you know how to listen to a patient.\" That is not to say that biological markers of activity and predictors ofresponse are not essential, but merelythat highly relevant information frompatients is too often ignored in favourof charts of assay results and tumourgenomic profiles. SURROGATE MARKERS Surrogate markers, the indicators ofanti-tumour response, can give anidea, in a relatively short time, about a drug's anti-tumour activity. Goodmarkers are key to exploring the mosteffective dosing schedule andwhether a drug will work better incombination or alone. Crucially, theycan also be used to sort patients intoresponders and non-responders(sometimes more of a continuumthan a 'yes/no' variable). This informa-tion is then used to look for 'predic-tive markers' that can prospectivelyidentify the target patient group. As individualised therapy is increasingly tailored to the exact phe-notype of a cancer, the ideal is to findbiological markers (biomarkers) ofresponse based on key changes in thetumour's genetic expression profile, oreven better, changes at the proteomiclevel, as demonstrated in biopsiestaken before, during and after treat-ment. This can be difficult andexpensive, and is by no means arequirement for getting a drugthrough to approval. The key to an effective surrogate marker is simply that it reliably indi-cates anti-tumour activity (evidence ofbiological changes is not enough), thatit reveals itself within weeks, days orhours of initiation of treatment, andthat it can be easily and reliably meas-ured. There is a huge internationalresearch effort underway to find andvalidate new biomarkers that can beused in this sort of research. Currentlyprostate specific antigen (PSA) forprostate cancer and CA125 for ovariancancer are the only strong candidates,and neither of these have yet beenfully validated. Hopes that the new molecular imaging techniques would quickly deliver reliable sur- rogate 'biomarkers' that correlate with anti-tumour activity and predict clinicalresponse have so far not been realised - prostate specific antigen (PSA) for prostatecancer and CA125 for ovarian cancer are the closest so far, and neither have yet beenvalidated.This is not for lack of effort. The US National Cancer Institute is allocating millions ofdollars to teams looking for protein biomarkers using transgenic mice. In Europethere are proposals to set aside funding for research into biomarkers as part of theinitiative to promote a European Technology Platform proposed for the EuropeanUnion research programme, FP7, set to run from the beginning of next year.Eggermont of the EORTC is confident that finding biomarkers is only a matter of time,and says - in a reversal of the advice given to people investing in uncertain financialactivities - \"Failure in the past is no guarantee of failure in the future.\"THE SEARCH FOR BIOMARKERS\"When there is no change in the genes, most of the time I have no responders\"CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 21However, while evidence-based vali- dation will probably be required if theregulators are ever to licence a newdrug on the basis of such a surrogatebiomarker, the level of validation forsurrogate markers used in exploratoryphase I and II trials can be a lot lessrobust. As Eggermont points out:\"Most surrogate markers are not ableto have a direct 100% outcome corre-lation, certainly not with survival. Butyou need target validation and somesurrogate marker in order to makerational decisions about the next stepin your drug development plan.Without that the chance of failure isgreater.\" The most commonly used markers remain changes in the size or rate ofgrowth of lesions, which have beencodified into a set of 'rules' with the acronym RECIST (ResponseEvaluation Criteria In Solid from changes in perfusion in the tumour,and measures of apoptosis orproliferation. Armand believes in keeping things as simple as possible for both thepatient and the technician, and he isvery proud of the novel technique ofdynamic contrast-enhanced Dopplerultrasound, invented validated Oncol 16:995-996; 1054-60). \"It is a fantastic predictor of activity or resistance.

And if there is a change, this predicts clinical activitylater on. \"It is very cheap, because you need minimal software, and you don'tneed to schedule a scan weeks inadvance as you do with CT. We arevery strong believers in this type oftool.\" Grand Round One of the key goals of phase II trials is to identify which patients are likely to respond Doing the science. In his phase I exploratory work, Armand of the Gustave Roussy Institute in Paris, is looking at how an exploratory combination oftwo drugs changes the signalling pattern of 40,000 genes in a variety ofcancers. He compares patterns of change in responders (e.g. patient DGPtop left ) with non-responders (e.g. patient RDF bottom left ) and tries to identify the genes of relevance (bottom right) . With proper analysis, this exercise can reveal a wealth of information about the disease and the drug.Armand hopes to be able to identify a genomic signature that will predictwho is likely to respond and who is likely to be resistant to the combinedtherapy.

Reproduced with permissionGrand Round He also works with expensive high- tech micro-array techniques forgenetic profiling, which can profilethe expression of 40,000 genes intumour tissue. This has to be done offsite at the cost of around US $2000 athrow. \"I do a tumour biopsy before the treatment, and I do the same tumourbiopsy one day, one week or a littlelonger after. And I see the change inthe tumour as it is manifest in 40,000genes. When there is no change inthe genes, most of the time I have noresponders. When there is massive 22 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006change, very quickly, then I havesome clinical activity. This is not yetvalidated. I just use it in a very exper-imental way.\" At this stage, Armand is using the before and after data, simply to iden-tify the changing patterns that corre-late with clinical response, to helphim \"fight for the drug\". \"Then we will move to phase II and confirm what we have seen, andmaybe try to see if we can select the responding patients with the specialprofile, and identify from the 40,000genes, the 50 or so that can be appli-cable in a microchip in any type of patient. PHASEII TRIALS Well-designed phase II trials ensurethat a potentially valuable drug isgiven the best chance to show itsworth and so be included in a phaseIII trial, and that complete duds arerejected as early as possible. Traditionally, phase II trials checked for activity, usually by esti-mating the proportion of tumoursthat shrink by 50% or more when thedrug is administered (singly or in Susie Stanway of Imperial College, London, has spent the last two and a half years researching STX64, the first in a new class of drug, sulfatase inhibitors, which may help patients with hormone-responsive breast cancer. The scientific concept More than three-quarters of breast cancers are oestrogen-receptor positive (ER+) and it is known that suppressing oestrogen is an effective treatment. Current treatments include drugs such as tamoxifen and Fulvestrant, which block the activity of oestrogen at the receptor level, and aromatase inhibitors, which inhibit the conversion of androgens to oestrogens. However, another pathwayexists, the steroid sulfatase (STS) pathway, which is responsible for the conversion of sulphated steroids, such as oestrone su l- phate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate to biologically active oestrogenic steroids. This pathway may account for resistance to aromatase inhibitors. STX64 is a potent non-steroid-based irreversible inhibitor of the STS enzyme. Preclinical trials Was it likely to work? STX64 was tested in rats in which breast cancer had been induced by nitrosomethylurea, and whose ovaries had been removed. The tumour was stimulated with oestrone sulphate and the drug was then given orally, resulting in regressionof the tumour.Surrogate markers? Taking successive biopsies to measure levels of STS activity in the tumour tissue would not be feasible. Studies were done to see whether STS activity in blood correlated with that in tumour tissue, and the correlation was seen to b e very strong. STS activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) was therefore accepted as a valid surrogate marker, and its val idity was later checked in human tissue. Phase I translational research A two-centre (London and Belfast) single-arm, dose-escalation design was used. Fourteen post-menopausal patients with meta-static ER+ breast cancer who had undergone at least one form of systemic (endocrine or chemotherapy) treatment were recruitedover a period of two years.Each patient was studied for seven weeks, using an intermittent dosing schedule - one week on, one week off.Stanway saw her patients every day during the weeks they were on the drug, and one day in each of the intermittent weeks.Every two weeks she did a formal examination, including clinical measurement of the lesions where possible. Tumour responseDOING THE SCIENCECANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 23combination) to patients with advanced-stage tumours of a specificprimary site. Only if the proportionwas high enough - and in most casesit was not - would the drug continueto a full-scale randomised phase IIItrial. Under the new paradigm, the idea is that by the time a drug moves intophase II, a lot is already known fromtranslational work in phase I about itsactivity in humans. Surrogate markersof activity will have been establishedand validated, allowing more nuancedstudies into dosing schedules and tofind ways to identify patients most likely to respond. Randomisation is being increas- ingly used in early trials to tease outrelevant information to guide thedevelopment process. As cytostaticdrugs find it hard to impress over ashort time-scale, and would neverpass the traditional 50% tumourshrinkage criteria, randomised con-trolled studies can be used to providethe confidence needed to proceed toa phase III, or provide the evidence oflack of activity needed to condemnthe drug. Such studies can use signif-icance levels set far below the requirement for approval, say p<0.1, thus requiring far fewer patients. Randomised controlled phase IIs were used in the development of bothsorafenib and sunitinib - two of thefirst multi-kinase inhibitors to reachthe market. In a \"randomised discon-tinuation phase II trial\" patients weregiven the drug, and those whose dis-ease stabilised were then randomisedto either continue or stop taking it. Randomising to different doses or schedules (including sequential orcombined administration with other Grand Round was measured according to the RECIST criteria using pre- and post-treatment bone scans and plain films, CT or MRI scans, depending on the nature of the lesion and where it was.Every week she took a blood sample. At the end of the seven weeks, all blood samples were assayed at the same time.Was the drug safe? Patients spent the night under observation in hospital the night after taking their first dose. They were assessed for side-effects using the US National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 at every visit and in a for mal examination every two weeks. The only adverse events that were thought to be drug related were mild - grade 1 or 2.Did the drug hit its target? Stanway measured changes in the level of STS activity in PBLs and in selected patients' tumour sam- ples. and in tumour samples 99% of baseline activity. This confirmed that the target wasbeing hit, and also that STS activity in PBL is indeed a reliable surrogate marker for STS activity in the tumour. Did inhibiting the target have the desired biological effect? The study aimed to cut down the concentration of oestrogenic steroids, oestrone, oestradiol and androstenediol, which Stanway compared the concen-trations pre- and post-treatment and found a significant decrease. Unexpectedly a decrease was also found in androstenedione an d testosterone concentrations.Did inhibiting the target have evidence of anti-tumour activity? She compared pre- and post-treatment scans using the RECIST crite- ria for disease response, stabilisation or progression. Four patients, all of whom had previously progressed on aromatase inhib itors, showed evidence of stable disease for 2.75-7 months, with a further patient showing stable disease in target lesions only. The future Dose. Stanway now intends to explore optimal biological dose using a continuous daily oral dosing schedule. Target population. She also wants to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from this new therapy. To do this, an 'enrich- ment strategy' will be employed (which restricts recruitment to those deemed most likely to respond), exploring the use of pote n- tially predictive biomarkers. Over-expression of STS is known to correlate with a poorer survival, and Stanway is particularly inter- ested to see whether this predicts a stronger response to STX64. She also wants to find out about the clinical benefit rate in a homogenous enriched population of patients who have previously been treated with aromatase inhibitors.Other indications. Ultimately, she hopes STX64 will show a significant clinical benefit rate and a favourable risk/benefit ratio in metastatic disease. If it does, the next step may be to seek approval for it to be used in the adjuvant setting. Because the dr ug shuts down a pathway that is common to the production of many hormonal agents, she also thinks it would make sense to test itin other hormone-dependent tumours, such as prostate and endometrial cancers.Grand Round drugs) can also yield important infor- mation about the most effective wayto use the drug, which could be usedto further develop a promising drugthat might have failed a traditionalapproach using a single protocol. One of the key goals of phase II trials is to identify which patients arelikely to respond, so that the phase IIItrial can exclude patients known notto respond to the drug (this is knownas patient 'enrichment'). Stratifiedphase II trials test for differences inresponse between patients stratifiedaccording to potentially relevant crite-ria - be they genomic/proteomiccriteria, age, ethnicity, history ofsmoking, or even history of previouscancer therapies. Very often phase II trials involve a number of different studies, some ofthem in patients with early-stage andsome with advanced disease, lookingto refine knowledge about the drugand its use. In what is known as an'adaptive trial', as more is found outabout dosing schedules and targetpatient groups, the patient selectionin the relevant trial arms can be pro-gressively enriched and ultimatelycan form the basis for a larger phaseIII trial, thus minimising the numberof new patients who have to beaccrued at this stage. Discourse on appropriate designs for phase I/II trials of targeted drugsis still at a very early stage. A goodintroduction to the subject can befound in papers by Marc Buyse,Elizabeth Eisenhauer and KarenGelmon, and Richard Simon, whichcan be found under the clinical trials 24 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006heading of the ASCO 2006educational book. The US Food andDrug Administration also recentlyconducted a workshop on this issue -Accelerating Anti-cancer AgentDevelopment and Validation - slidesfrom which can be found atwww.fda.gov/cder/genomics/presentations/anticancer.pdf. APPROVAL : THE FINAL HURDLE At the end of the science, there is stillphase III, where every drug has toshow clinical effect in a largerandomised trial - if not on survival,then at least improved disease-freesurvival, time to progression, orpossibly decreased side-effectscompared to existing therapies. Thedream is that progress in validatingsurrogate endpoints will allow thiscumbersome procedure to bedispensed with. We're not there yet,but being able to show medicalplausibility can still clinch it for adrug that can only show marginalbenefit in a phase III trial. It is therefore essential not just to get the science right, but to keep theregulators on board throughout thedevelopment process. They need tobe convinced that the chosen bio-markers and the assays for those bio-markers are valid, and researchers arewell advised to discuss these issues,as well as the phase I/II trial design,with the regulators as they go along,to avoid spending years going downone particular path, only to be told atthe end of it to go back to the drawingboard. Storing tissue according toaccepted standards is also vital, asregulators may well ask the researchers to go back and do furthertests before their application canproceed. Undoubtedly, developing drugs in the era of molecular biology is a com-plex process. The upside is that withevery new anti-cancer drug devel-oped, we learn a great deal moreabout the disease itself. Eggermonttalks of moving from one level of com-plexity to the next, and is confidentthat Europe has the resources to meetthe challenge. \"The infrastructure,the institutes, the basic science andtranslational research labs are thereand we perform very well in the trans-lational research field. In terms of tis-sue legislation we are on a footingthat actually has more opportunitiesand is simpler than in the US, whereexchange of tissue between institutesis almost impossible because of theHIPAA [Health Insurance Portabilityand Accountability] Act.\" He warns, however, that for a successful trial, researchers must takethe time and money to do thenecessary science. He offers thefollowing advice: \"Make sure that youhave done sufficient early phase IIstudies with translational researchcomponents to be convinced of thepotential efficacy of your drug, thatyou reach your target and that you cannarrow down the patient populationyou want to study in a phase III trial.If you don't raise enough funds totake those steps, the likelihood is thatyou will fail in phase III. In theprocess you may actually kill yourown drug.\" With every new anti-cancer drug developed, we learn a great deal more about the disease itself26 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006INa recent cancer debate in theBritish House ofCommons, theopening state- ment by John Baron MP included thefollowing: \"The Opposition recognisethat there have been improvements inoutcomes, but they have not out-stripped comparable improvements incontinental survival rates. According to last year's report from theKarolinska Institute, the UK stilllags behind other Europeancountries when it comes to survival rates over periods of one year and fiveyears. In fact, Britain has one of theworst survival rates in all of westernEurope: whereas 81 per cent of can-cer patients in France survive for oneyear, the equivalent UK figure is only67 per cent. Even Albania and Lithuania have better one-year andfive-year survival rates than we do.\"(Bold text throughout indicatesemphasis added.) These remarks are seriously mis- leading, but Mr Baron is not toblame. The report from theKarolinska Institute has gained widecurrency since its publication inSeptember 2005. But the report isseriously flawed: the cancer survivaldata in the report, the statisticalmodels of survival as a function ofthe availability of chemotherapydrugs, the authors' conclusions fromthose models - they are all wrong. Itseems important to set the recordstraight, since the faulty data andconclusions may lead to inappropri-ate decisions by politicians, or unduefrustration among cancer patients. The efficacy of many cancer drugs in improving survival andreducing mortality is supported bysolid evidence from high-qualityrandomised trials, and it is no part ofmy intention here to challenge thatevidence. But I do challenge the nature and scope of the cancer survival data pre-sented in the Karolinska report, andthe way in which those data havebeen modelled with data on thenational availability of cancer drugs.If my critique of the Karolinskareport is correct, those analyses can-not be used to support its policy-related conclusions about the impactof the availability of cancer drugs in agiven country on cancer survival ratesin that country.Forum Michel ColemanNew drugs and survival:does the Karolinskareport make sense? Is it possible to demonstrate that access to new drugs impacts on a country's survival rates? Last September, the Karolinska report claimed to have done just that. Here, Michel Coleman argues that its conclusions were misleading and unsupported by the data and analysis. In the Debatethat follows, the authors respond and health economists and policy advisors offer their views. *Michel Coleman is Professor of Epidemiology and Vital Statistics in the Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology Unit, London Sch ool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Dr FrankLichtenberg of Columbia Universityhighlights that access to more cancer drugs means improved survivalrates for patients. His analysis of the situation in the US demonstrated thatthe increase in the stock of cancer drugsaccounted for 50-60% of the increase insurvival rates in the first 6 years post diagnosis. \"In addition, his examination of the USA and selected European countriesindicates that an increase in the num- ber of available drugs is associated withan increase in both the one-year andfive-year survival rates. Therefore, withthe importance of new drug therapiesin the battle against cancer, it is clearlyin the best interest of cancer patientsthat new, innovative drug therapies aremade available to them as soon as pos-sible. Reduced or delayed access to cancer drugs has a very real impacton patient survival.\" The evidence for this assertion is based on chapter 7 of the report,\"Pharmaceutical innovation and can-cer survival\", which is described as a'commentary' prepared by FrankLichtenberg at Columbia in August2005. He examines cancer survivaltrends in the US in relation to drugavailability, and carries out a similarexercise with European data. This isdescribed as an investigation of \"theeffect of availability of new drugs on survival from 17 types of cancer inmore than 35 countries.\" The data sources and the description of themethods are reprinted here in the boxon p 28. No other detail is providedon either data sources or methods.No reference for the method is given. Results are shown for 38 European countries (Table 7.2, p89 ofthe report) in the form of one-year andfive-year survival rates (%), for all can-cers combined in both sexes, alongwith the annual number of cases andthe number of new drugs launchedsince 1982. No survival data areshown for 17 different cancers. Noresults are given from the modelling ofcancer survival as a function of theavailability of drugs. Instead, theseresults are summarised as follows: \"The estimates indicated that an increase in the number of availabledrugs is associated with an increase inboth the 1-year and the 5-yearsurvival rates. The sample includesboth European and non-Europeancountries. Two additional analysesrelated to this distinction have beenperformed:1. We estimated survival models usingthe full sample of countries butallowed the ln(N_DRUG) coefficientto be different in the European andnon-European sectors. We saw no evi-dence of a difference. Availability ofdrugs seems to have the same effecton cancer survival within Europe as itdoes in the rest of the world.2. We tried estimating survival modelsusing data for European countriesonly. This reduces the sample size by \"It is important to set the record straight, as faulty data and conclusions may lead to faulty decisions\" A pan-European Comparison Regarding Patient Access to Cancer Drugs , generally known as 'the Karolinska report', was written by Wilking of theKarolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, andBengt J\u00f6nsson of the Stockholm School ofEconomics. The data modelling and analysis wascarried out by Frank Lichtenberg of ColumbiaUniversity in the US. The report was funded byRoche and was published by the Karolinska Institutein collaboration with the Stockholm School ofEconomics in September 2005. It can be accessedat http://ki.se/content/1/c4/33/52/Cancer_Report.pdf.THE KAROLINSKA REPORT 60%. We did not obtain statistically significant results. However, onemight well obtain statistically signifi-cant results based on European dataonly using time-series incidence,mortality and drug utilisation data.\" INTERPRETATION Several serious problems complicatethe interpretation of this material. First, the report says of the GLOBOCAN data (used for survival,see box below): \"These incidence data are collated from national cancer reg-istries\". This is not so. The GLOBO- CAN website (http://www-dep.iarc.fr/globocan/database.htm) makes it clearthat \"Incidence data are available from-cancer registries. They cover entirenational populations, or samples ofsuch populations from selected regions. \" This leads the authors into modelling what are often regionalcancer survival rates with national drugmarketing data. Second, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),which compiles the GLOBOCANdatabase, does not itself collect or pro-duce cancer survival data. As the web-site clearly states, survival data inGLOBOCAN 2002 were takendirectly from the EU-sponsoredEUROCARE study into cancer sur-vival in Europe, in this case EURO-CARE-3 (Berrino et al. Ann Oncol 14:v1-v155). They relate to patientswho were diagnosed during 1990-94and followed up to 1999. Yet thosesurvival data have been deployed inthe model in the Karolinska report in relation to the number of drugs avail-able in 2000, as if they were forpatients who had been diagnosed inthe year 2000 or later. Third, five-year survival data for cancer patients diagnosed in 2000could not have been published at thetime of these analyses (August 2005).Only so-called 'period estimates'(Brenner et al. Int J Epidemiol 31:456-462) could have been used to'predict' such survival rates, but peri-od survival estimates were not includ-ed in the GLOBOCAN database thatwas the source of the data. Fourth, in 12 of the 38 countries (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bul-garia, Cyprus, Greece, Hungary,Luxembourg, Macedonia, Moldova, 28 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Forum The data used to model drug availability against survival in the Karolinska report came from three different sources. The survival data were taken from the GLOBOCAN 2002 database (though in the Karolinska report this was given as GLOBOCAN 2000) Data on drugs approved by tumour type were taken from the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Formulary Data on drug availability were taken from the IMS Lifecycle New Product Focus The model to which these data were applied is described in the report as follows: \"These data are used for estimating a model that included both fixed cancer-type effects and fixed country effects, which contr ol for all determinants of cancer survival that are invariant across cancer types within a given country and that are invariant across cou ntries for a given cancer type. SURVij = ln(N_DRUGij) + i + j + \u00c2ij 1 Where:SURVij = the (1-year or 5-year) survival rate for cancer type i in country jN_DRUGij = the number of drugs for cancer type i available in country jai = a fixed effect for cancer type idj = a fixed effect for country jeij = a disturbance\"Due to inclusion of fixed cancer-type and country effects in the model, [sic: i.e. the comma \",\"] represents the effect of relative drug availability within a country on relative survival rates within the country. Suppose that, on average (across all countries), t he survival rate of cancer type A is 25% higher than the survival rate of cancer type B, and the number of drugs for cancer type A is 35% h igher than the number of drugs for cancer type B.\"Then one would expect that if, in a particular country, the number of drugs for cancer type A is only 20% higher than the numb er of drugs for cancer type B, the survival rate of cancer type A is less than 25% higher than the survival rate of cancer type B. In deed, esti- mation of the model requires that the relative availability of drugs for different cancer types varies across countries.\"KAROLINSKA REPORT: DATA SOURCES AND METHODSCANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 29Romania, Serbia-Montenegro, Ukra- ine) for which the authors purport togive national survival rates forpatients diagnosed in 2000, no can-cer registry was in operation in thosecountries in that year, and in mostcases there is still no such registry. Infact, the 'survival rates' for thosecountries, reproduced in theKarolinska report, were taken inGLOBOCAN to be a weightedaverage of survival rates in othercountries in the same region ofEurope for which national or pooledmulti-registry estimates of survivalwere available from EUROCARE-3. For example, for Albania, in SouthernEurope, survival rates in GLOBO-CAN were taken to be a weightedaverage of the cancer-specific sur-vival rates reported from EURO-CARE-3 for Italy, Malta, Portugal,Slovenia and Spain, weighted by thecancer-specific mortality rates inAlbania. Equivalent procedures wereadopted for other countries fromwhich no survival data were available.This was done in order to estimatecancer prevalence 1, notas the basis for an international comparison ofsurvival, and certainly not as the basis for modelling international variationin survival as a function of the avail-ability of cancer drugs. Fifth, almost no information is given on the methods or the results ofthe modelling. The results are simplysummarised in the form of the con-clusion \"that an increase in the num- ber of available drugs is associatedwith an increase in both the 1-year and the 1-year survival rates. Thesample includes both European and non-European countries.\" Sixth, the survival data from Europe that are used in the modelrepresent a single time point (suppos-edly in the year 2000). No data onsurvival trends are presented thatcould support a conclusion of anyincrease in survival over time as a function of drug availability. Lastly, the model is extremely simplistic. It treats the number ofdrugs available on the market, regard-less of their availability to patients, ortheir actual use in individual patientsincluded in the survival analyses, asthe sole explanatory factor for inter-national differences in cancersurvival. Most of the Karolinskareport deals in detail with the mar-keting of cancer drugs in Europe overthe last 20 years. I have no commenton the analysis of the availability ofcancer drugs per se, except that thereport seems to be pervaded by anassumption that the market availabil-ity of a licensed cancer drug is thechief factor influencing the nationalsurvival rate for that cancer, whereassurgery and radiotherapy remain themainstay of treatment for most of thecommon malignancies. CONCLUSION The analysis of cancer survival in rela-tion to the availability of cancer drugsin the Karolinska report is very mis-leading. It purports to show cancersurvival data from several countries forwhich no such data are available: thoseincorrect data have already been citedin a parliamentary debate in the UK,and quite possibly elsewhere. The report provides no data on cancer sur-vival beyond those published in 2003for EUROCARE-3. Real survival datafrom some countries are then usedalongside imaginary data for othercountries in a crude statistical modeldesigned to estimate the 'effect' of thenumber of cancer drugs on the marketin 2000 on cancer survival (all cancers,both sexes combined). Worse, the sur-vival data used to model the impact ofcancer drugs available in 2000 are forpatients who were diagnosed in1990-1994 - some six to ten years before the currency of the drug data . For 12 of the 38 countries, the 'survivaldata' are actually the average survivalrates from four or five completely dif-ferent countries from the same broadgeographic region of Europe. The con-clusion that an increase in the avail- ability of cancer drugs is associatedwith an increase in cancer survival rates is also completely unsupportedby the data presented in the report. Neither the cancer survival data nor the analyses of them can supportthe policy conclusions in theKarolinska report. 1. Methods of estimating prevalence: \"Partialprevalence (1-, 3- and 5-year prevalent cases) wereobtained by combining the annual number of new casesand the corresponding probability of survival by time. ...Several sources of site-specific survival were used. ...Europe: The EUROCARE-3 project provid[ed] figuresfrom 1990-1994. Wherepossible, country-specific survival estimates were used,based on regional cancer registries, and four regional estimates were prepared for countries where nolocal survival data were available. \" (Ferlay J et al. GLOBOCAN 2002: cancer incidence, mortality andprevalence http://www-dep.iarc.fr).Forum \"It treats the number of drugs on the market as the sole explanation for differences in cancer survival\"30 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Forum CancerWorld asked the authors pointsraised in Coleman's cri- tique, and European health econo-mists and policy advisors were askedto comment on the report, and moregenerally on whether it is possible todraw out the impact one particularaspect of cancer therapy has on sur-vival rates, and if so, how this can bedone in the most meaningful way. In their response, the authors said that the report's findings showsignificant differences in access tonew drugs and the implications ofthese differences merit discussion.\"The Karolinska report provides forthe first time comprehensive informa-tion on the use of new cancer drugs indifferent countries, and it documentssubstantial variation in the uptake ofnew drugs, and systematic differ-ences between countries. The UK, forexample, is slower than otherEuropean countries in the uptake anduse of new cancer drugs.\" The reportgoes further, they said, and investigat-ed different reasons for the observeddifferences. While it concluded thateconomic factors play a role, \"coun-tries with lower GDP and health-careexpenditures per capita, such asPoland, the Czech Republic andHungary, tend to have slower uptakeof new cancer drugs,\" most of thevariation, said the authors, \"seems tobe explained by factors related to how cancer care is funded and paid for,and by attitudes towards innovation.\" \"We think that it is important to point out these differences and todiscuss the factors behind them, andto consider what can be done toachieve a more rational allocation ofresources to cancer care in Europe.This is of interest not only foroncologists and other health-careprofessionals, but for patients andthe general public as well.\" Coleman's criticisms related both to the quality of the data and to themethodology used to model survivaldata against access to new drugs. Onthe question of the data, the authorsagreed that Coleman's criticismsregarding the use of drug availabilityrather than actual use in the modelswas fair comment. \"The point is welltaken, and in the follow-up report tobe published later this year, we willhave a new set of estimates based onthe vintage of drugs actually used.This may strengthen the relation, butprobably not lead to a different con-clusion since availability and use arecorrelated.\" However, they rejected the other charges relating to the quality of data,arguing that, though \"the data avail-able for assessing the relation acrosscountries between actual use of newcancer drugs and improvements insurvival over time are far from per-fect\", the limitations are by no meanssufficiently serious to invalidate the findings of the report. Taking Coleman's points in turn, they stated, \"First, we do not see anyproblem modelling regional cancersurvival rates with national data ondrug availability. If a drug has notbeen launched in a given country,then it is not available for use in anyregion of the country. So regional drugavailability = national drug availability. \"Second, the estimated survival rates were obtained by dividingone-year or five-year prevalence byincidence. The results of this proce-dure appear to be consistent withother estimates of survival rates. Forexample, the method used impliesthat the five-year survival rate for allsites other than non-melanoma skinfor males in the US is 63.8%[=2431746/ (5*762399)]. Accordingto the US National Cancer Institute,the five-year survival rate for all sitesfor males in the US during1995-2000 was 64.0%. \"Third, the fact that the inci- dence and prevalence data may referto different time periods would, ofcourse, introduce errors of measure-ment in the estimates of survivalrates. However, these errors are likelyto be random, i.e., uncorrelated withthe drug availability measure.Random errors of measurement inthe dependent variable do not causeany statistical bias.\" Regarding Coleman's point about THE DEBATECANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 31the GLOBOCAN/EUROCARE 3 data having been compiled to esti-mate cancer prevalence and not as abasis for modelling survival as a func-tion of the availability of cancer drugs,the authors said \"The argument that[these data] can only be used for thespecific purpose for which they werecollected is absurd.\" As for the criticism that changes in survival as a function of access to newdrugs cannot be explored using sur-vival data from a single time point, theauthors commented, \"We did not useinternational data on survival trendssince such data are not available. Theanalysis on changes in survival overtime is done for the US survival alone.\" CancerWorld asked European experts from a variety of fields to whatextent they felt that Coleman's criti-cisms of the quality of the data werevalid. Ren\u00e9e Otter is a director and medical oncologist at theComprehensive Cancer CentreNorth-Netherlands, who sits on theboard of the Netherlands' NationalComprehensive Cancer Plan and isinvolved in many European projectsrelating to registries, benchmarking ofcancer care and guidelines. She agreed with Coleman's analy- sis and said the flaws he pointed toeffectively invalidated the claim of theKarolinksa report to demonstrate animpact of drug availability on survival. \"If you don't have other data, the only report you can make is about twodifferent things. One part is the sur-vival analysis, the other one is theavailability of drugs.\" These results,she said, could be used as the basis topropose a project that could use bothdata but in a different way. \"Youshould try to get these data over thesame period, and only use data thatare not an expectation, but are actual-ly observed in the different countries.\"Isabelle Durant-Zaleski is a health economist based at the H\u00f4pital HenriMondor in Paris, and has a long his-tory of working with epidemiologicaldata to investigate disparities inhealth outcomes. She says that inter-national comparisons in healthcareare difficult, but can be useful. \"Whatthese very large macro-economiccomparisons do is draw your attentionto something strange. And to me thatis exactly what the Karolinska reportdoes. \"It is very good academic practice to challenge the methods and chal-lenge the results, and this is whatMichel Coleman is doing, but it isalso useful to do some perhaps imper-fect comparisons and difficult com-parisons, as the authors of theKarolinska report do, because it putsaccess to cancer care on the politicalagenda.\" Her views are echoed to an extent by Mattias Neyt, a pharmaco-econo-mist who works for the Belgian healthtechnology assessment agency, theKCE, and has recently been involvedin assessing the cost-benefits ofHerceptin [trastuzumab] in an adju-vant setting. He argues that you haveto work with the data you have.\"What is best? To do no research or toresearch with the best available data?I would choose the second. You canfind interesting results. How robustthey are is another question, but ifthey don't have more recent figures,that doesn't mean they shouldn't doresearch at all.\" Mike Richards, the UK's National Cancer Director, in contrast, thinksthat modeling survival rates from oneperiod against the number of drugsavailable in another is very likely tocome up with misleading results.\"The only accurate measure we haveof survival rates between countriescome from EUROCARE 3, and theyrelate to patients diagnosed between 1990 and 1994. None of the newdrugs we are now talking about,except for Taxol [paclitaxel], had evenbeen licensed at that point.Everything aboutnow, like Herceptin or Glivec[imatinib] or Rituximab [mabthera],weren't even available so they couldnot possibly have affected survivalrates for people diagnosed in1990-1994.\" The authors counter that they could have chosen to use drug avail-ability for 1995 or 1997 instead of2000. \"But since availability (and vin-tage) in different years is strongly cor-related that will not make the resultsmisleading.\" METHODOLOGY In addition to the issues relating tothe data used, Coleman also criti-cised the methodology of theKarolinska report. He argued that themethods used to analyse access todrugs as a function of survival did notprovide any basis for the assertionmade in the executive summary that\"Reduced or delayed access to cancerdrugs has a very real impact onpatient survival.\" Firstly, saysColeman, no information was givenon the methods or results of the mod-elling, and secondly, the number ofdrugs available on the market wastreated as the sole explanatory factorfor differences in survival. The authors say they were sur- prised by these criticisms, particularlyas Coleman himself acknowledgesthat \"The efficacy of many cancerdrugs in improving survival andreducing mortality is supported bysolid evidence from high-quality ran-domised trials.\" Information fromclinical trials needs to be supplement-ed with studies based on drugavailability and use in actual clinicalForum32 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006practice, said the authors, particularly given the fact that of the 57 cancerdrugs approved by the US Food andDrug Administration through the reg-ular process since 1994, only 18 wereapproved on the basis of a survivalendpoint, and in none of the 14 grant-ed accelerated approval was a survivalendpoint used (see J Clin Oncol 21:1404-11). \"Observational studies enable investigation of the impact of innova-tion in cancer management on costs aswell as outcomes... How can our con-clusions be misleading if they supportthe results from the clinical studies?\" While welcoming serious discus- sion and comments on the methodsand data used for these sorts of obser-vational studies, the authors arguedthat it would have been better ifColeman had read the originalresearch papers before concludingthat the models were all wrong. \"Anumber of misunderstandings couldhave been avoided.\" The full paper tothe similar study conducted byLichtenberg in the US can beaccessed at www.nber.org/papers/w10328, and a revised version takinginto account the European data willbe posted there soon, say the authors. They also point out that Coleman fails to provide any alternative expla-nation or interpretation of the results,and merely implies that the resultsobtained should not have beenobtained. On the question of the methodol- ogy, Zaleski said, \"In my view themethod is not appropriate for thecausal relationship, but it is appropri-ate to attract attention to discrepan- cies. It showed there might be a cor-relation, but establishing causalrelationships between a treatment andan outcome - in this case new drugsand survival - is very difficult outsideof randomised controlled trials.\" She mentions, however, a similar piece of research carried out by theOECD health policy unit, whichlooked at the use of mammographyand survival of breast cancer. \"It is notquite the same exercise, but it is notvery different. In the case of theOECD report, they identified the factthat, for example, France has 10times as many mammographs asCanada, standardised by women overthe age of 40, yet the survival inCanada from breast cancer is exactlythe same as in France. So this meansthat for people who are interested inpublic health, you have to look morein-depth.\" The Karolinska report, she says, \"is a good attempt to have comparisonsthat would enable you to go further. Itis very much what the OECD is doing,but it is more far-fetched in the case ofthe Karolinska report. The OECD isextremely prudent.\" Zaleski suggests one possible explanation for the correlation foundbetween survival and access to newdrugs could be that the latter is a\"surrogate marker\" for somethingelse. \"Countries which have speedyaccess to new drugs may also havebetter coordination of care and betteraccess to specialised oncologists. Italso means access to research proto-cols, possibly access to multidiscipli-nary teams, or even access to other innovative or state-of-the-art cancertreatments.\" This, she stresses, canonly be conjecture, which can onlybe validated by more detailedresearch, \"which is what theKarolinska report and MichelColeman's piece urge us to do.\" Otter also questions whether the methodology used could ever demon-strate a causal relationship betweennew drugs and survival. \"I don't thinkthat in the way they have put theirproject together you can make anyrelationship - even if it was in thesame time period. It sounds like thestory I was told in my first course onepidemiology about there being anincreasing number of births becausewe have an increasing number ofstorks.\" The issue, she suggests, should be whether patients are getting thedrugs recommended in evidence-based guidelines. \"The drugs you giveare dependent on the stage of thetumour. So in some countries youroutinely give adjuvant chemotherapy,and in others you will rarely give adju-vant chemotherapy, because there areno stage I patients in these countries.They come too late to the doctor.\" She also argues that the role of drugs in cancer management makes itunlikely that they are a big factor inexplaining differences in survival.\"Very good surgery and very goodradiotherapy are more relevant forsurvival than drugs. The exceptionsare all haematological diseases, chil-dren's cancer and testicular cancer.For all the others we know that the Forum \"How can our results be misleading if they support the results from clinical studies?\"CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 33additional drugs influence your sur- vival chances less than surgery with orwithout radiotherapy. Drugs havemore influence on survival in the pal-liative phase of the tumour than inthe curative setting.\" More fundamental still, says Otter, is getting the diagnosis right soyou can plan the most appropriatetreatment. \"Everything starts with avery accurate diagnosis and staging.Then you need people who are veryspecialised for the surgery, peoplewho are very specialised for the radio-therapy with access to state-of-the-artradiotherapy equipment. Third comesthe medical oncology.\" Back in 2000, Richards called in a team of international experts to lookat exactly the same survival data aswas used in the Karolinska report,with the brief that they were to estab-lish whether the data that showed theUK bumping along the bottom of theEuropean cancer survival league tablewere an actual reflection of reality,and if so, what could explain the poorresults. \"The overwhelming view from that meeting was that we did have toaccept the UK had worse survivalrates than comparable Western coun-tries. But we also found that the mainreason for that was due to patientspresenting with more advanced dis-ease in the UK than in those othercountries. What that tells me is that itmatters as much what goes on beforediagnosis as what goes on after diag-nosis, if not more.\" This finding was reached by look- ing at the patient data on stage ofdiagnosis that was available from a number of high-resolution studiesthat were included in EUROCARE-3. \"But that's all the registry studiescan tell us - they can't tell us morebecause they have insufficient dataon treatment.\" Richards speculates that drug expenditure may be a proxy for overallcancer expenditure. FUTURE STUDIES As a policy maker whose job is to usethe resources available in the mosteffective way to improve Britain's can-cer services, Richards warmly wel-comes studies that throw light on therelative contribution of differentaspects of cancer care to the overalloutcome. He says, however, that to beof practical value they need to look ata range of input variables. He pointsto the growing body of evidence thatin certain cancers, such as colorectalcancer, the quality of surgery is deci-sive in reducing local recurrencerates, and is therefore likely to beimportant in explaining differentialsurvival rates. \"You would need data on stage at presentation, then compare that witha whole load of different things likewhat treatments are actually beinggiven, what training is being given,what is the quality of surgery and theradiotherapy.\" He accepts that such studies are not easy, because it is difficult to getcomparable measurements acrosscountries. The best way, he suggests,would be to get countries that are pre-pared to do this well to work together.\"I think you need to engage with peo- ple from the individual countries whoknow what is going on and can adviseas to what the data might mean andwhat is a realistic and reasonablecomparison to make.\" Zaleski points to a study recently carried out by Stanford University,which posed the question: Has theintroduction of new technologies forheart treatment changed the outcomein heart attack? It also looked at howvariations in the speed at which thesenew technologies were introducedinto routine practice impacted on sur-vival. \"Heart attacks is a much easiertopic, because people die quickly, sosurvival data are easy to get. Theyhave been able to show correlationsbetween the introduction of newtechnology, the use of health care,and survival. But that is a multicoun-try endeavour with a very largedatabase and a lot of work to havecomparable data.\" It should in principle be feasible to apply a similar methodology to can-cer, says Zaleski. \"The idea therewould probably be to look at one typeof cancer and begin with a case study.This would have to be done with mul-ticountry comparisons. You wouldneed to have a large number of coun-tries, because there are so many treat-ment variables. You want to havemore countries than variables, andyou need longitudinal data of goodquality.\" Longitudinal data are needed to track the treatments a single patienthas throughout their cancer journey.Getting hold of this data, says Zaleski, Forum \"It is very much what the OECD is doing, but it is more far-fetched in the case of the Karolinska report\"34 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Forum Why the disparity? The EUROCARE results showed that in somecountries cancer patients stand abetter chance of survival than inothers. The reasons will vary fromcancer to cancer. In colorectalcancers, good quality surgery isknown to be critical in avoidingrecurrences. In breast cancer,expert surgery, radiotherapyand appropriate drugs all play arole. Catching the cancer early andgetting the diagnostic work-up rightare enormously important. Evidenceshowing the relative contributionmade by each factor on survivalrates would be very helpful for policymakers deciding where toconcentrate their resourcesCANCER SURVIVAL ACROSS EUROPE \"It would be worth looking in detail at what accounts for survival differences\"Source: MP Coleman et al. EUROCARE-3 summary: cancer survival in Europe at the end of the 20th century. Ann Oncol 14 (Suppl 5):v137. Reprinted with permission from Oxford University PressCANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 35could prove a problem. \"In many countries, like France, you do nothave linkage of discharge data. Whena patient has had several treatments,there is no national database wherethose treatments can be linked to thesame patient. That is why they lookedat heart attacks, because most of thetreatments are done on the firstadmission.\" She also mentions the need to look at how reimbursement systemsdetermine which patients actuallyhave access to drugs that are on themarket - something also highlightedin the Karolinska report. Otter suggests that it would be worthwhile comparing some regionsin Eastern Europe with some inWestern Europe and looking in detailat what accounts for survival differ-ences. Incidence and survival datawould have to come from well-docu-mented regional-based cancer reg-istries, but the study would have to behospital-based, using 'cancer centresof excellence', to get good data ondiagnosis and treatment. It shouldlook at one cancer at a time, focusingon high-incidence cancers in order tohave enough patients to be able toidentify small differences. The vari-ables she would like examinedinclude the use of good diagnosticprocedures and good staging proce-dures, the education of surgeons, thevolume of surgeons, multidisciplinarydiscussions, radiotherapy equipmentand the availability of drugs. \"First we should identify some countries which are able to get drugsor not able to get drugs, able to giveadequate radiotherapy or not, and high-quality surgery or not. And this iswhat we should try to comparebetween countries.\" She feels there is potential for making better use of existing net-works and data. She mentions in par-ticular the EUROCHIP project - aEurope-wide study to compare differ-ent indicators of diagnostics andtreatment in different countries. \"I think by combining high-reso- lution studies, EUROCHIP andsome additional data, at least we cantry a pilot study. It won't be easy, but Ithink it should be possible, and it is amuch better approach than theKarolinska one. Otter believes that working to coordinate European guidelines andfind ways to ensure that guidelinesare followed is the way forward,not just for drugs, but also fordiagnostics, radiotherapy, surgicalprocedures and so on. The availabilityof a given therapy is not the issue,she says, because if that therapy isnot in the guidelines, it won't be paidfor and it won't be used. She mentions the European proj- ect CoCanCPG, which is bringingtogether all the bodies responsible fordrawing up guidelines in countriesand institutions. It aims firstly toidentify the level of evidence in rele-vant publications to reach conclu-sions for international guidelines,and, secondly, to gain insight into theproblems and processes of translatingthe evidence into national guidelinesthat are regularly revised and appliedin practice. BETTER RESEARCH NEEDED The Karolinska report flagged upsome significant differences in therate at which cancer drugs hit themarket across Europe. There seemsto be general agreement that the sug-gested correlation with survival meritsfurther examination. Though theexperts CancerWorld spoke to do not believe the evidence in the reportsubstantiates the claim that \"Reducedor delayed access to cancer drugs hasa very real impact on patient survival,\"they do believe access to drugs maybe a proxy for general expenditure oncancer, or access to research proto-cols or state-of-the-art innovations ingeneral - a point also made in thereport. The authors themselves are com- mitted to further refining the findingsof the report, \"We are well aware oflimitations of methods and data, andwill continue to work to improve onboth, because questions about therelation between innovation, costsand outcome in cancer deserveanswers.\" The contributors to this discus- sion, however, clearly believe thatmodelling drug availability aloneagainst survival cannot guide policymakers in deciding where to concen-trate resources and efforts to get thebest impact on survival. This can only be done through more in-depth studies that can look atthe contribution of a variety ofaspects of stage of detection, diagnos-tics and treatments. The Debate was compiled by Anna WagstaffForum Access to drugs may be a proxy for general expenditure on cancer or state-of-the-art innovationsMaster piece The man behind the margins Roland Holland started investigating mammograms and their relation to pathological findings as part of the first European pilot of breast screening. His findings were later used by UmbertoVeronesi as key evidence in support of breast-conserving surgery. More than 20 years on, hisdata are again being called into service, this time by America's brachytherapists. Roland Holland started a new life at the age of 40 as a paediatric pathologist inNijmegen, the Netherlands, after escap- ing with his family from Hungary, via Nigeria,sort of disguised as a Dutch airline pilot. It was 1976, and although he was not imme- diately aware of it, Nijmegen and Utrecht hadjust become the second region in the world toset up a pilot mammographic breast screeningprogramme. Sooner or later, this inquisitive pathologist was bound to start poking his nose into the pilotprogramme, and this led to a confrontation inthe corridor with one of the young radiologistspioneering mammography reading. They settledtheir differences to strike up a lifelong friend-ship and teamwork that helped make the Dutchscreening programme the most respected inEurope. Holland's work on the clustering of tumour foci in the breast was used by Umberto Veronesiin Milan and by others to develop procedures forbreast-conserving surgery. Today this 1985 paperis making renewed ripples, as radiotherapistsPeter McIntyre 38 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006consider how to narrow the range of radiothera-py dosage after surgery. Before getting into the science, or even the adventure story, we have to deal with thiscoincidence of name between person and thecountry, that we shall call the Netherlands. Didhe change his name from something more obvi-ously Hungarian, or choose the countrybecause of his name? In fact, neither is thecase. The name Holland goes back a long wayin Hungary, apparently. \"My Dutch friends say: 'Your ancestors were probably slaves on our ships, and they did a goodjob so we gave them the name Holland,'\" he says. He has certainly done a good job for his adopted country and some might say he is stillshackled to his work at Nijmegen, even after hisformal 'retirement', but it does not seem likelythat Holland would have made a good slave. Hewould probably have escaped. Holland did his medical training in Budapest, specialising in pathology, because his(doctor) father advised him that this was thefoundation of good medicine. He took part inMaster piece CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 39the Hungarian uprising of 1956 as a student. \"Half of us got a gun and the other half who hada bicycle were messengers. I was in the bicyclegroup. Afterwards, I was not in direct danger,because I had no gun. I wanted to escape butmy father and family were very depressed aboutthat and asked me not to.\" As an out of favour non-Communist Partymember, his career was blighted. By the early 1970s, he was mar-ried, with a young daughter, anddeputy head of pathology atPeterffy Hospital, Budapest. He wanted out. In 1973, Hungary was recruiting a patholo-gist to complete a Hungarian med-ical aid team in Nigeria. The rest ofthe team were trusted Party mem-bers. Holland, and his family, wereincluded because none of the Partypathologists agreed to go. \"This was a wonderful opportu- nity. We spent three years inNigeria. My duty was to set up andrun the first pathology laboratory inPort Harcourt (the coastal 'GardenCity'). My greatest reward was thatwhen I left, the surgeons said wecan never work without a patholo-gist again.\" Under the terms of his con- tract, someone arrived regularlyfrom the Hungarian Embassy totake away half of his salary. Tomake up the shortfall, the wholeHungarian team worked in privatepractice. Holland became compa-ny doctor to a number of largeinternational companies and theirstaff, despite warning them that asa pathologist \"I am only really anexpert after you have already died.\" Studying at night he taught himself to be a fam-ily doctor. Senior staff at the Dutch multinational Interbeton heard that he was thinking of tryingto gain admittance to the US, and urged him totry the Netherlands instead. When he was senton a two-week course to England, his contactsarranged for him to visit Nijmegen on the way. \"My greatest reward was that when I left, the surgeons said we can never work without a pathologist again\" PETER MCINTYREMaster piece 40 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006The Professor of Pathology Peter Vooijs prom- ised him a job, once he had completed his tourin Nigeria. There were troubled sounds out of the Dutch Embassy in Lagos, but Holland wasbacked by powerful friends in industry whoensured that the Hungarian Embassy heard nohint of his departure. A Dutch-American heli-copter company flew him to Lagos and walkedhim around the back of immigration controlwearing a Dutch pilot's tie. There he joined his family on a KLM flight for Amsterdam. \"They sent a note from theplane, to my Dutch friends saying 'your doctor issafe'. I am still very emotional when I thinkabout this.\" Holland arrived at the University Medical Centre at Radboud University in 1976 aspathologist for the new paediatric oncology cen-tre. Aged 40 he was both student and expert,travelling to the Netherlands Cancer Institute inAmsterdam every weekend to study paediatriccases, and working in Nijmegen during theweek, while at the same time learning Dutch. What he found most enjoyable was being included in ward visits to see the children - andthe fantastic cure rate. \"I loved this job and wewere very effective with children. This was 30years ago and this was my first encounter with amultidisciplinary approach. It was an innovationhere; you saw the patient first and later exam-ined the specimen.\" Even a University Centre like Nijmegen did not see enough child cancer cases to keep ahard-working pathologist busy, and Hollandbegan also to work in general surgery, examiningbreast cancers uncovered during screening. Inspired by the New York breast screening programme, William Penn, head of theRadiology Department, set up the Nijmegenpilot to test the potential for national screeningin the Netherlands. X-RAYS AND BIOPSIES Many of Holland's studies deal with the detec-tion of the precursor lesion of breast cancers,so-called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Mammography does not detect DCIS directly,but detects the microcalcification that occurs asa cancer progresses. Holland's job was to com-pare the biopsy specimen with the suspiciousmicrocalcifications on the mammogram. In oneof his first examinations he reported that therewas no calcification in a biopsy taken on thestrength of a radiologist's report. The young radi-ologist, Jan Hendriks, came to visit this junior'idiot' who was questioning his expertise. Theymet in the corridor and after a healthy exchangeof views, decided that they liked what they sawand that it was probably the surgeon's fault forsending the wrong bit for testing. Holland, Hendriks and a young radio- grapher Henny Rijken started working understand the themammogram and the pathological findings,learning about each other's jobs on the way.Holland became skilled at readingthe mammograms, while Jan Hendriks andHenny Rijken became familiar pathol-ogy of breast tumours. \"They called us thetroika. We did courses, scientific projects andpublications together. We came back here at9 o'clock in the evening and worked two to threehours without anyone disturbing us. We nevercalled what we did work.\" After the screening programme had been running for its first four-year cycle, it becameapparent that screening was not finding all thecancers. \"I was starting to work on this. I saw theso-called 'missed' interval cancers. They werecategorised as negative from the mammogram,and women come back with a palpable mass.This was disappointing.\" Holland produced the first international paper on interval cancers in the 1980s, and in\"Holland's job was to compare the biopsy specimen with the microcalcifications on the mammogram\"1984 defended his thesis on \"New aspects and pitfalls in the diagnosis of breast cancer\" 'cumlaude'. \"Invasive cancers start always as in situintraductal (DCIS) or intra-lobular (LCIS). At acertain point they break through the basementmembrane and they become invasive, forming atumour mass. \"So long as they are in the ducts or lobules, limited to the basement membrane, there is nopossibility of spreading to the lymph nodes or toother parts of the breast. They are theoretically100% curable if you take them out. If it isalready invasive, then you have always a certainpercentage chance that it has already spreadwhen detected. \"If we could find all breast cancers in their in situ intraductal phase, nobody would die of thedisease. Unfortunately, not all intraductal cancershave microcalcifications. In others the process ofbecoming invasive is rapid and the two-yearscreening interval is most likely too long.\" In almost two-thirds of invasive cancers, there are multiple foci in the breast, even if theydo not show up on the screening mammogram. Holland did a study with the Joint Centre of Radiotherapy at Harvard together with JayHarris, Jim Connolly and Stu Schnitt. \"Weshowed that if you have a recurrence of cancerafter breast-conserving therapy it is usuallybased on residual intraductal foci. If you leavethis behind, even if you irradiate the breast, theintraductal tumour will grow out and recur.Master piece CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 41\"The question was: How far do these other fociexist around the detected lump? That was thestudy that nobody had done. If you take out alump and irradiate the breast you don't knowany more what you have left behind. You couldonly do that on mastectomy specimens.\" MARGINS OF SAFETY That is what Holland set out to do, slicing andexamining 314 breasts that had been removedby mastectomy, but could have been candidatesfor breast-conserving surgery. Of these, 282breasts had invasive cancers, and of these, only105 (37%) did not show other foci. By measur-ing the distance from the 'reference' tumour,Holland estimated what percentage of tumourswould be left behind after each extra centimetreof breast was excised. Holland, Hendriks and two colleagues (Velingand Mravunac), calculated that ifinvasive cancers that were 4 cm or less wereremoved along with 3-4 cm of surrounding tis-sue, invasive cancer would be left behind in7%-9% of women, with non-invasive cancer leftbehind in a further 4%-9%. Their paper was published in Cancer in September 1985. Holland says he had no idea ofthe significance of this work until it was fin-ished. \"The world discovered it after three orfour years when they started doing breast-conserving surgery.\" Veronesi in Milan pioneered the route from Hidden tumours. By comparing breast cancer biopsy sections against their corresponding X-ray images, Holland and his team were a ble to show that tumour foci did not always have microcalcifications, which explained why some cancers were not being picked up at mammography sc reeningMaster piece 42 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006mastectomy to breast conservation. He argued that if the cancer had already spread, mastecto-my would not help, while if it had not spread,taking the whole breast was unnecessary. Whynot just take the tumour? Holland's work wasjust what he needed to support his practice. \"In my studies in Nijmegen, working with many hundreds of mastectomy specimens, Icame always to the same answer - a 5% chancethat there was a tumour in a remote quadrant,other than the one where the primary tumourwas found. Veronesi put my figures on the wallof the operating theatre and said, 'Look, he sayswe have to excise this area.'\" Holland's work was based on the morpho- logy of the tumour. A few years later, clinical sta-tistics began to tell the same story. Just asHolland predicted, there was a 90%-95%chance that any recurrence appears in the samearea of the breast and not in a remote quadrant. Research over the past 20 years has revealed a more complex picture, without shaking theunderlying arithmetic. In 1996 a study by JSVaidya and others at the Tata Memorial Hospitalin Bombay used three-dimensional techniquesto visualise the breast. They came to a differentanswer - finding remote multicentric foci in 15out of 19 breasts. However, studies continue toshow that more than 90% of early recurrence isin the same quadrant as the primary tumour. The key question is why some foci of DCIS develop into invasive cancers, while others donot. Holland believes that the answer lies in thedifferentiation of the cells. \"Poorly differentiatedcancer with many mitoses can go crazy in a shorttime and in one to one-and-a-half years becomean invasive cancer. A well-differentiated tumouris quiet, the nuclei are evenly distributed andapproximately the same size. It may becomeinvasive in 10 to 15 years. Maybe these foci arebiologically less important, but we never see aDCIS disappear.\"Holland was recently approached by radiothera- pists at the Annual Congress of the AmericanBrachytherapy Society, who dusted off his 1985paper and asked him to revisit his figures apply-ing current criteria about tumour size and type,the extent of microcalcification and the age ofthe patient. They hope to use the results toguide them in reducing the area of the breastthey need to irradiate. Holland has promised tohelp them to estimate a 'safe zone'. In 1989, on the basis of the mortality decrease shown in Nijmegen and Utrecht, theNetherlands approved a national breast screen-ing programme for women aged 50-69, at two-year intervals, although it took until 1996 toextend this to the whole country. In 1998 theupper age band was increased to 75. Mammography is done by radiographer technicians in 68 mobile buses, who send themammograms to 28 radiology reading centres inthe nine screening regions of the country. In 1988 Holland was appointed director of the National Expert and Training Centre forBreast Cancer Screening (LRCB) at RadboudUniversity Hospital, responsible for training andfor quality assurance of the nation-wide popula-tion-based screening project. Every radiographerand radiologist in the country must train herebefore being allowed to work in the nationalscreening programme. For many years the Netherlands had the lowest referral rate of any screening programmein the world - until 1999 it was under 1%. Oneof the last papers that Holland and Hendriksworked on together with the support of epi-demiologists in Nijmegen and Rotterdam -Hendriks died from melanoma in 2004 - was tolook at the likely extent of missed cancers andcalculate how many more would be detected ifthe referral rate increased. Holland felt that the low referral rate was connected with the Netherlands being the \"The question was: how far do these other foci exist around the detected lump?\"Master piece CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 43European pioneer of mammography. \"At that time there were no pre-operative minimallyinvasive procedures like core biopsies or vacu-um-assisted biopsy. We were afraid that if wesent too many women for unnecessary examina-tion and surgical biopsies they would not comeback. They would say 'they operated on mewhen there was nothing wrong'.\" As some of the cancers have only less obvi- ous, subtle signs on the mammogram and only20 to 30 mammograms of 1000 may show a sus-picious sign, of which 5 to 6 are cancers, thereis always the possibility of missing something.For this reason, each mammogram is read bytwo radiologists. If they do not concur, they talkto each other and come to a consensus. Holland and his team visited the screening centres and urged them to change their practice.\"I feel that the most logical thing is not to talk toeach other, because consensus usually lowersthe recall rate. If one of you feels she should berecalled, then recall her.\" QUALITY CONTROL By 2002, the recall rate had risen from below 1%to 1.3%, and is now around 1.4%. Above 3%,says Holland, there is a law of heavily diminishing returns. As part of quality control, a team from LRCB visits eachmammography reading centreevery three years. They reviewdata on the number, size andtumour stage of cancers detect-ed. They also review the cases of120 women who had intervalcancers that had not beendetected by screening. \"We lookat the previous mammogramsand assess whether the cancercould have been detected early.Many interval cancers are veryfast growing so you don't see any-thing on the previous screeningmammograms. In some cases there is a minimal sign. And someyou just miss,\" says Hollandbluntly. A weakness in the Dutch system is that once the recall has been issued,the national screening programme loses controlof the subsequent assessment. The woman'sdoctor sends her to any one of 100 or more gen-eral hospitals in the Netherlands, where mam-mography is repeated with extra views, magnifi-cation and ultrasound if necessary. In about 20%of cases, they decide there is nothing wrong.The other 80% of woman are referred for histo-logical examination. Holland says this was a mistake - again a result of being early in the field - that they arenow trying to correct. \"There is not enoughcontact between a radiological department of ahospital and the screening radiologists, and theradiologists at the radiologist department are nottrained here. Assessment must be incorporatedin the screening process. \"In every visit we do, there are two or three cases where the screening radiologist had said itwas suspicious, the radiologist in the hospitalsaid it was nothing and the cancer came in halfa year or one-and-a-half years. That is what wecall doctor's delay. We are happy to know thatEUSOMA [the European Society of Mastology]and EUREF [the European Reference Surgical margins.

Weare trying to change now. We could have 20 to30 breast centres in the Netherlands with goodcooperation with the screening.\" When Holland planned to make his journey to the Netherlands 30 years ago, his Dutch busi-ness contacts in Port Harcourt told him hewould be fine there so long as he learned todrink Dutch gin (jenever) and smoke Dutchcigars. As a cancer specialist he could not acceptthis definition of Dutchness. However, when hewas appointed Professor of Pathology at StRadboud in 1998 he reached for another Dutchtradition to draw a lesson for screening. \"The Dutch herring is very delicious and there is always a test for the quality of the Dutchherring in May each year when the first catch ofnew herring start to be sold in the fish shops. Isay if we can have quality control for the Dutchherring, why can't we have a comparative quali-ty control of the management of breast cancerpatients in our hospitals?\" With an award from the Queen of the Netherlands and a professorship, Holland iswell accepted by the country whose name hebears. Despite being retired - radiologist Dr Gden Heeten has now taken over as director ofthe LRCB - he works almost every day and is indemand on scientific groups and at internation-al conferences. He also keeps a friendly eye onthe progress of the breast screening programmein Hungary, where he is, today, welcomed. He promotes multidisciplinary workingwhere specialists tread over boundaries. \"I teach people the relationship between what you see onthe mammogram and the histology. I always tellradiologists to find a pathologist who is interest-ed, and to look at everything together. Look at themammogram and then look in the microscope.\" The future of breast screening is digital. Ultimately, computers will help to highlightchanges in consecutive scans for the specialistto review. \"Tomosynthesis, a kind of CTscanning, can section the breast into hundredsand thousands of sections and then you willhave a much better three dimensional image.You can manipulate the image and probablyhave a better chance of finding cancers in densebreasts of women under 50 years of age.Whether you can also reduce the number ofmissed cancers, we don't have yet data on that.\" And that is the key question.\"Usually in medicine we tolerate 5% errors, whether it is a false-negative rate of sentinelnode technique, recurrence after breast-conserving treatment, or whatever. But you can-not tolerate 25% or 30% errors. I don't thinkmammography will survive more than 15 or 20years. A method must come that can detect atleast 95% of breast cancers. \"I always say we are working with statistics and science, but statistics cannot tell you any-thing about an individual patient. We must givewomen the best information and tell them thatwe find 70%-75% of cancers, not all of them.You should not absolutely rely on screening butstill palpate your breast between screeningexaminations.\" \"There is not enough contact between radiology departments of hospitals and screening radiologists\" \"You cannot tolerate 25% or 30% errors. I don't think mammography will survive more than 15 or 20 years\"There are parts of Europe where newly diagnosedcancer patients are notgiven access to their diag-nostic reports. They have to trek to their general practitioner tofind out what the reports say. In otherregions, it tends to be the patient'sfamily that is told the diagnosis. Theythen decide what, if anything, to tellthe patient. In many places, thenotion of a second opinion is laugh-able. In some countries, patientsdiagnosed with cancer stand to losetheir job; they're either summarilysacked or their working lives aremade so difficult they are forced toquit. And, despite scientific advancesthat should produce good outcomes,cancer survival rates vary dramatical-ly from country to country, becausepatients do not all have access to thesame standards of care. \"The progress that's been made in the basic science of cancer andtreatments for a variety of tumoursfaces tremendous obstacles in muchof the world in terms of application,\"says Gabriel Hortobagyi, president ofSpotlight on... 46 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Quality cancer care Ten rights that should be guaranteed to every cancer patient If equal access to quality cancer care is to be more than an aspiration, we need to define minimum standards. ASCO and ESMO have now taken a lead with a consensus statement. the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and Professor ofMedicine and chairman of theDepartment of Breast MedicalOncology at the M.D. AndersonCancer Center in Houston, Texas. Many parts of the world, he says, have not even begun to think aboutthe broader issues pertinent to thelives of those struggling with a cancerdiagnosis - such as discrimination onthe job, rehabilitative needs aftertreatment, and even problems withsuch basic tasks as getting a mort-gage, because of the cultural misap-prehension that a cancer diagnosisinevitably means a death sentence. In response to the enormous challenges faced by cancer patientsaround the globe, ASCO and theEuropean Society for MedicalOncology (ESMO), the two largestassociations of clinical oncologists,recently issued a joint statement onquality cancer care (see p 48).Announced in June at ASCO's annu-al meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, it callsfor, among other things, privacy, con-fidentiality and dignity for patients,access to medical records, non- discrimination and the right to inno-vative treatment. The decision to make it a joint statement was an easy one. \"We feltit was critical for us as organisationsthat cover much of the Westernworld, and influence, to a largeextent, what happens in the oncologyworld, to provide the road map aboutthe principles on which we shouldbase our clinical approach to cancerpatients,\" says Hortobagyi. \"It gives power theDepartment of Oncology at theKarolinska University Hospital inStockholm, Sweden. But agreeing on the principles that should be the standard of care isone thing; putting those standardsinto operation will be something elseagain. The statement, which is aimedlargely at the national politicalmachineries that control health-caresystems, isn't enforceable by law.Neither society can force countries Elizabeth DeVita-RaeburnSpotlight on... CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 47and their oncologists Hortobagyi, \"doesnot mean implementation.\" \"It's easy to say everybody should have access to high-quality care, butif the infrastructure and resourcesdon't exist, it's very hard to imple-ment,\" says Hortobagyi. \"And it's easyto say everyone should have access topreventive services, but if it's not inthe budget, it's much more compli-cated. We hope, over the next severalyears, to cause gradual alterationsand change, first in the culturalacceptance of these issues, and sec-ondly in the rearrangement ofresources to fully implement theplan,\" he says. Some critics say the statement is not as strong as it could have been,partly because of concerns that byraising the bar too high, developingcountries with limited resourceswould be unable to meet the stan-dards. But neither the ASCO nor theESMO president felt the statementhad been watered down. \"We are critically aware that, in many parts of the world, the limita-tion of resources will make thisextremely difficult to implementfully,\" says Hortobagyi, \"but that's nojustification for setting the bar anylower.\" Mellstedt agrees. \"I think it's time for them to start to see whetherit's possible to reallocate money fromother areas to address the prioritieswithin their society. Clearly there areproblems with the health-care systemthat need to be revised.\" Both societies have made a commit- ment to continue to work together topromote the right to quality care viaan ASCO-ESMO Task Force. Thestatement was published in the July20 issue of ASCO's Journal of Clinical Oncology , and the July issue of ESMO's Annals of Oncology , and is also available online at each organ-isation's website. ESMO has given staff in its Brussels office, and ESMO nationalrepresentatives in each country, thetask of distributing the statementamong members of the Europeanparliament, along with documenta-tion showing the difference in sur-vival rates between countries. Heinz Ludwig, chairman of the ESMO Cancer Patient WorkingGroup, says he hopes that ASCO andESMO members - there are morethan 30,000 in all - \"will act as amultiplier of this idea, and use thisstatement in their interactions withtheir policy makers and society ingeneral.\" Mellstedt adds that they are also counting heavily on the cooperationof patient advocacy groups, whomthey see as critical to the cause. \"Wehave to have all the patients onboard. They are often the most effec-tive at distributing the message. Theyare a very powerful pressure group.Previously,\" he says, \"we have forgot-ten the patients.\" ASCO expects to invest several million dollars in the coming yearson, among other things, a task forceon quality affairs to address issues ofquality measurements; an online quality assessment tool that physi-cians can use to evaluate their per-formance in the care of cancerpatients; and a task force to pushthrough initiatives related to issues ofsurvivorship. But both societies say it's just a start. What the document reallydoes, for now, is set a standard, muchas both organisations once did by col-laborating on a global core curricu-lum for medical oncologists. \"It sets abar where the application of certainprinciples should get to as a mini-mum,\" says Hortobagyi. \"It provides agoal to national organisations, and topatient survivor and advocacy move-ments. And it provides guidelines forindividuals in politics who makedecisions that influence qualityof care. \"And that will make it much eas- ier to get into a discussion with thosewho need to provide improved quali-ty of care, regardless of where theyare, as to where they should be head-ing and put pressure on them tocome in line. ESMO and ASCO havetaken a very courageous first step,\" hesays. \"We hope it's contagious.\" But the proof will come in what actually happens on the ground, inhospitals, clinics and doctors' offices.Five to ten years from now, forinstance, will all cancer patientsleave the hospital with a copy of theirdiagnostic report in their hand? Orwill there still be some who have topersuade their GP to reveal what itsays? \"It provides guidelines for individuals in politics who make decisions that influence quality of care\"321 4 5 6 78 9 10Access to Information. Patients should receive adequate informationabout their illness, possible interven-tions, and the known benefits and risksof specific treatment options. Thesematters should be discussed with qual-ified health care personnel who arecommitted to responding forthrightlyto patient inquiries. Patients shouldhave the ability to ascertain names,roles and qualifications of those whoare treating them. Privacy, Confidentiality andDignity. Patients should have the ben- efit of privacy with respect to theirdiagnosis and treatment. Medicalrecords and other patient-specificinformation, including genetic infor-mation, should be regarded as private,except to the extent that they arerequired to be shared for treatment orpayment purposes. If access to patient-specific information is necessary forresearch efforts, including clinical tri-als, epidemiological research, transla-tional research or other clinical investi-gations, patients should be given theopportunity to agree to such uses oftheir information for the benefit of can-cer patients in general.

Recognisingthat resources, financial and otherwise, vary greatly from country to country and that systems for providingmedical care are similarly varied, ASCO and ESMO nevertheless believe that health care plans shouldaspire to meet certain common goals to ensure access to, and continuity of, quality cancer care.ASCO-ESMO consensus statement on quality cancer care their medical records and obtain copies for free or for a reasonable fee. Healthcare providers should be available toexplain the contents of medical recordsto patients. Prevention Services. Individuals should be advised with respect toprevention of cancer and provided anypreventive interventions that are evi-dence-based and available. Non-discrimination. Access to health services should be providedwithout discrimination as to race,religion, gender, national origin, or dis-ability. Patients should also be free ofdiscrimination on the basis of theirdisease with respect to both employ-ment and health insurance. Consent to Treatment and Choice. Patients should be empowered to par-ticipate in decision-making about theirtreatment and care to the degree theydesire, and the health care team shouldrespect those decisions. Patientsshould have access to a second opinionand the ability to choose among differ-ent treatments and providers. Multidisciplinary Cancer Care. Optimal treatment of cancer should beprovided by a team that includes,where appropriate, multidisciplinarymedical expertise composed medical oncologists, surgical palliative careexperts, oncology nurses, andsocial workers. Patients should alsohave access to counseling for their psy-chosocial, nutritional and other needs. Innovative Cancer Care. Patients should be offered the opportunity toparticipate in relevant clinical trials andshould have access to innovative thera-pies, which may improve their diseaseoutcome. Survivorship Care Planning. Cancer survivors should be provided acomprehensive care summary andfollow-up plan at the completion of pri-mary therapy and systematicallymonitored for long-term and lateeffects of treatment. The need for reha-bilitation services should be evaluatedas part of the long-term follow-up plan. Pain Management, Supportive andPalliative Care. Quality cancer care requires pain management, includingthe use of opioid analgesics, and othersupportive care for conditions inducedby cancer treatment or by the diseaseitself.

Other stud-ies have shown that HER2 overexpres-sion the risk of developingCNS metastasis, whether sympto-matic or occult, and most of thewomen with this type of breast cancerhad controlled extracranial disease. 2 To explore the prevalence of and predictors for CNS metastasis amongwomen with HER2-overexpressingmetastatic breast cancer et re-exam-ined two clinical trials of first-linetrastuzumab-based therapy (see oppo-site). In one phase III trial of 464patients, 3chemotherapy was used alone or with trastuzumab, while in aphase II trial of 54 patients,chemotherapy and trastuzumab wereadministered. In both trials, 9-10% ofpatients had isolated CNS metastasisas the first sign of progressive metasta-tic disease, accounting for 14-16% ofall disease progression. CNS metasta-sis occurred later than progression at other sites in both treatment arms.Overall risk of initial progression with-in the CNS was not lowered by addi-tion of trastuzumab to chemotherapy.HER2 amplification was associated with a trend toward greater risk of ini-tial CNS progression. SimultaneousCNS and other metastases were notinvestigated. Additionally, follow-upwas limited (<8 months in both stud-ies) and probably led to underestima-tion of the true incidence of CNSmetastasis. These findings have beenseen with other successfulchemotherapeutics for systemicbreast cancer. This study highlights important pathophysiological questions. Severalmolecular mechanisms have beensuggested to mediate the aggressivebehaviour of HER2-positive breastcancers. First, increased activation ofHER2 signalling enhances central nervoussystem (CNS) tumours rep-resent important health burden and portend a poor prognosis.Clinically, 10-16% of patients withbreast cancer - up to 200,000 casesyearly in the US - have symptomaticbrain metastases; up to 30% of autop-sies in these patients show evidence ofintracranial metastases. 1,2Survival in patients with breast cancer andmetastatic CNS tumours ranges from2 to 16 months, extracranial (sys-temic) metastatic disease present, andthe treatment used; the mean 1-yearsurvival rate is approximately 20%. 2 Traditionally, inability to control sys-temic disease is the limiting factor forsurvival. 2As systemic therapies improve, extracranial disease controlcould become less influential, a pointstrengthened by studies of HER2-positive patients with breast cancertreated with trastuzumab. 2,3Nearly half the patients in one study Weil*Does trastuzumab increase the risk ofisolated CNS metastases in patients with breast cancer? Research shows that brain metastasis of breast cancer may occur more often in women with HER2 overexpression. These patients require more aggressive surveillance to identify diseaseearlier, and new therapies are needed that can overcome barriers to effective CNS drug delivery. *Robert Weil is Associate Director of Laboratory Research in the Brain Tumor Institute at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Clev eland, Ohio, USA This article was first published in Nature Clinical Practice Oncology 2006 vol. 3 no. 5, and is reproduced with permission. www.nature.com/clinicalpractice doi:10.1038/ncponc0487, \u00a92006 Nature Publishing GroupCANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER might endow tumour cells with increased metastat-ic aggressiveness, and increase spreadto visceral sites such as the lungs andCNS. 2Third, by enhancing patient survival, trastuzumab might permitbrain metastases to develop orbecome of to overexpress HER2. 2,4,5 The clinical challenges are to define new strategies for surveillanceand therapy.

(2005) Isolated central nervous system metastases in patients with HER2- overexpressing advanced breast cancer treated with first-line trastuzumab-based therapy. Ann Oncol 16:1772-1777 Background. The predictors for central nervous system (CNS) metastases in women with advanced breast cancer have not been well established. It has been suggested that HER2 overexpression and therapy involving trastuzumab might beassociated with a high rate of CNS metastases. Objective. To study the prevalence and timing of occurrence of isolated CNS metastases in women with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy, and to assess the contributing effects of HER2status and trastuzumab treatment. Design and intervention. Two clinical trials of chemotherapy in conjunction with trastuzumab as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer were reviewed for timing and sites of first progression. Sites of progression wereclassified as 'isolated CNS disease' (brain or One was a multicentre, randomisedphase III study of chemotherapy (paclitaxel or doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide) with or without trastuzumab. Theother trial was a multicentre phase II study of vinorelbine in combination with trastuzumab. Outcome measures. A competing risks analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model, with isolated CNS disease and progression at any other sites as the two competing risks, was used to establish time to disease progression resultingfrom isolated brain metastases. Results. The initial site of tumour progression was identified in all 518 patients; isolated tumour progression occurred in the CNS in 9-10% of patients receiving first-line treatment with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Median follow-up times in thephase III study were 7 months for women receiving trastuzumab-based therapy and 4.6 months for those receiving chemother-apy alone. Risk of isolated CNS progression was similar in women receiving trastuzumab-based therapy and those receivingchemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.45-1.54), but CNS progression was a later event than progression at othersites ( P<0.0001). Analysing outcomes according to follow-up time available, the incidence rate of isolated CNS progression was 16.1 per 100 person-years in patients receiving trastuzumab-based treatment versus 15.7 per 100 person-years in thosereceiving chemotherapy alone. The incidence rate of progression at other peripheral sites was 96 per 100 person-years in thetrastuzumab-based arm and 188 per 100 person-years in the chemotherapy-alone arm. The effect of HER2 gene amplification measured by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was analysed for patients in the phase III study by estimating the CNS progression-free survival from the time of primary breast cancer diagnosis. Patients with FISH-positive tumours had a greaterlikelihood of CNS recurrence than patients with FISH-negative tumours, but the trend was of borderline statistical significance(P=0.09; hazard ratio 2.14, 95% CI 0.89-5.18). Conclusions. Isolated CNS metastases can develop in patients receiving trastuzumab-based therapy for reasons such as improved peripheral tumour control, longer survival time and the lack of penetration of trastuzumab through the blood-brainbarrier.

As a result, thisdose-response relationship has beenextrapolated from data originating pri-marily from retrospective andprospective nonrandomised studies. 1,2 The study by Zietman et al. (see opposite), using a combination ofconventional photon radiation withprotons, clarifies this point by docu-menting that a higher dose is objec-tively better than a lower dose inachieving an improved 'biochemicaloutcome' in well-defined subsets ofpatients. Although the was opti-mally designed, efficiently has sufficient follow-up, severalcritical issues related to the'dose-response question' in particu-lar, and to prostate cancer treatmentin general, remain unresolved. Firstly, the absolute minimum dose needed to eradicate cancer foreach stage of disease is still notestablished. Although dose-responsedata such as these suggest that moreis generally better, it is difficult to determine how much of the improve-ment in biochemical control noted inmany older dose escalation trials issimply related to better patient selec-tion or the more optimal delivery ofthe radiotherapy dose (through dose specification, andpatient immobilisation or tracking).If, using modern three-dimensionaltechniques, a portion of the target isoccasionally found to be outside theintended high-dose region, it is possi-ble that lower doses could be suffi-cient with the superior targeting ofoff-line adaptive or on-line image-guided radiotherapy approaches. 3 Secondly, it remains uncertain if the appropriate biochemical end-point - that acts as an early surrogatefor cure - to measure treatment suc-cess with all forms of radiotherapy isbeing used. Debate on the best bio-chemical definition continues. 4 Thirdly, although protons were used very effectively in the study byZietman et al.

Finally, even if higher radiothera- py doses are superior to lower dosesin eradicating cancer, these newradiotherapy technologies must bedirectly compared with other formsof treatment (e.g. surgery) in termsof cost, quality of life, ease of admin-istration, availability and repro-ducibility. Unprecedented capabili-ties for radiotherapy techniques to efficiently eradicate cancer and sur-gical techniques to comprehensivelyremove cancer have been achieved.What will prove just as critical willbe the long-term effects of thesetreatment strategies on patients'quality of life and the cost of theiradministration.

(2005) Comparison of conventional-dose vs high-dose conformal radiation therapy in clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the a randomized controlled trial. JAMA 294:1233-1239 Background. Conventional-dose radiotherapy is unable to eradicate prostate cancer in a substantial proportion of cases. Increasing the radiotherapy dose might achieve better local tumour control, but there is a risk of higher morbidity unlessthe radiotherapy can be targeted accurately to avoid damage to normal tissue. Objective. To establish whether local control of prostate cancer could be improved by the use of higher doses of radio- therapy using conformal techniques. Design and intervention. In this randomised controlled trial, patients with localised prostate cancer received external radiotherapy at a conventional dose of 70.2 Gy or an increased dose of 79.2 Gy. All patients received the same dose of con-formal photon therapy (50.4 Gy), but boost dose differed between the groups (19.8 or 28.8 Gy) and was delivered usingproton-beam therapy. Men with stage T1b-T2b tumours (using the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria), serumprostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels below 15 ng/ml and no metastatic disease according to whole-body bone scan andabdominopelvic CT scan were included. Patients were stratified according to nodal status and serum PSA levels. Outcome measures. Biochemical failure, local control and morbidity were the endpoints for this study. Biochemical fail- ure was assessed using the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) criteria (i.e. 3 successiveincreases in PSA level), local control was estimated using a surrogate measure in lieu of biopsy (PSA levels <1 ng/ml) andmorbidity was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. Results. Median follow-up was 5.5 years (range 1.2-8.2 years) for all 392 patients. Five-year freedom from biochemical recurrence was 61.4% (95% CI the the high-dose group ( P<0.001), a 49% decrease in the risk of failure. High-dose therapy was advantageous in both low-risk disease, defined as PSA level <10 ng/ml, Gleason at 5 years was 47.6% (95% CI 40.4-54.8%) in the conventional-dose group 60.4-74%) in the high-dose group ( P<0.01). The overall survival rate did not differ significantly between the groups (97% vs 96%; P=0.8). Acute genitourinary or gastrointestinal (rectal) morbidity grade 3 developed in 1% of patients in the conventional-dose group and 2% in the high-dose group, and late genitourinary or gastrointestinal mor-bidity of grade 3 or higher developed in 2% and 1% of patients, respectively. High-dose treatment increased acute and lategenitourinary morbidity grade 2, however. Conclusion. Men who have localised prostate cancer are more likely to be free from biochemical recurrence at 5 years, and have a lower risk of locally persistent disease, if they are treated with high-dose as opposed to conventional-dose radio-therapy.

This is because the dis-ease is considered incurable. However, arecently published study has revealed thatwomen who have a complete removal ofthe primary tumour have a 40% lowerchance of dying of breast cancer. The popu-lation-based study carried out inSwitzerland between 1977 and 1996 evalu-ated the impact of surgery on the originalarea of the cancer, and the survival ofpatients whose cancer had already spreadwhen they were diagnosed with breast can-cer. The study looked at all 300 metastaticbreast cancer patients recorded at theGeneva Cancer Registry between 1977 and1996. It compared mortality risks frombreast cancer between patients who hadsurgery of the primary breast tumour andthose who had not, and adjusted these risksfor other prognostic factors. Women whohad had their primary tumour totallyremoved and checked for healthy tissue allaround had a 40% reduced risk of dyingfrom breast cancer compared with womenwho did not have the same surgery.

The report showed that employmentproblems differed by cancer type, with sur-vivors of some cancers being up to fivetimes more likely to be out of work. Amongother factors associated with increased riskof unemployment were: living in the US,younger age, and female gender. As part ofthe study, which was conducted by theCoronel Institute for Occupational Health,at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, researchers systematically sum-marised and analysed data from 40 studiesthat investigated the questions of whetherchildhood cancer survivors have a greaterrisk of unemployment than the generalpopulation, and what factors may identifyindividuals and groups at risk. Analysis of the data showed that adults treated for brain or other central nervous sys-tem tumours were five times more likely to beunemployed. Blood-cell and bone marrowcancer survivors had an elevated unemploy-ment risk, but the difference did not reachstatistical significance. Similarly, survivors ofother cancers had no elevated risk. Analysis of other factors indicated that nationality, gender, age at diagnosis, andphysical and mental impairments were alllinked to higher unemployment rates. Forexample, survivors in the US were threetimes more likely to be unemployed, whileEuropean survivors had no elevated unem-ployment risk. Female gender and youngerage at diagnosis also predicted higher risk offailing to find work. The prognosis for children diagnosed with cancer is excellent. More than seven inten paediatric cancer patients now survivemore than five years and most of those sur-vive to adulthood.

BMJ, 10 June, 332:1359 Anew study has found no major impact of obvious personality traits on the chances of developing cancer or dying fromthe disease. The population-based studylooked at around 5,000 German men andwomen aged between 40 and 65. Theparticipants completed an extensive per-sonality test and questionnaire on lifestylefactors and health. During the follow-upperiod of 8.5 years, 257 participants diedand 240 were diagnosed with cancer. The study examined five broad inde- pendent dimensions of personality -symptoms of depression; anger control;time urgency (those frequently concernedwith the passage of time and how they canmost efficiently fill it with productive activ-ity); internal locus of control over thedisease (the patient's belief that the onsetand process of an illness is the result of theirbehaviour) and psychoticism.

The study found thatPersonality traits do not influence risk of developingor dying from cancer British Medical Journal Anew study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology suggests that there is no reason why breast cancer patients whohave had lymph nodes removed should nottake part in resistance exercise such asweight training. The randomised trial foundthat a six-month programme of resistanceexercise did not increase the risk of lymph-oedema, or worsen existing symptoms. Breast cancer patients often have the lymph nodes under the arms removed toprevent the cancer spreading through thelymphatic system. This can lead to excessfluid building up in the body's tissues, caus-ing long-term swelling of the arms. Doctorsusually advise women to refrain from phys-ical activity, for fear that this might triggerthe onset of lymphoedema, or make anexisting condition worse. This latest study followed 45 breast cancer survivors who participated in anupper- and lower-body weight-training pro-gramme. The participants had an average ageof 52 years, and their treatment, which included the removal of the main lymphnode (axillary dissection), had finishedbetween 4 and 36 months earlier. Thirteenof the women had lymphoedema at thestart of the exercise programme. The study participants underwent supervised weight-training sessions twice aweek for six months. The circumference oftheir arms was measured at the beginningand at the end of the programme. The studyfound that none of the group involved inthe exercise programme experienced achange in arm circumference and noneshowed clinical or self-reported signs oflymphoedema.

Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed in older men; however, younger men can alsobe affected.

Because CT scans are costly anddeliver a substantial amount of radiation tothe body, researchers have been interested indetermining the minimum number of post-operative CT scans needed to safely followpatients. New data from a study presented at ASCO 2006 suggest that two post-operativeCT scans are as safe for detecting relapse asfive scans. Investigators from the UK'sMedical Research Council randomlyassigned 414 patients who elected to haveonly surveillance after surgery to follow-uproutines containing either two CT scans (247patients at 3 and 12 months after surgery)or five CT scans (167 patients at 3, 6, 9, 12and 24 months after surgery). All other sur-veillance tests were performed with equalfrequency between groups during monthlyfollow-up visits during the first year, everyother month during the second year, andevery 3 to 6 months thereafter. At a medianfollow-up of 40 months, the investigatorshad detected 37 relapses (15%) in the two-CT group and (20%) in the five-CT group.Recurrent tumours were approximately thesame size at detection in both groups. \"Thereis no clear advantage to more frequent CTscans in follow-up\" of these patients, statedGM Mead, of the Mount Vernon CancerCentre in Middlesex, England. \"The two-CT-scan schedule can be considered a newstandard.\" Medical Research Council trial of 2 versus 5 CT scans in the surveillance of patients withstage I non-seminomatous germ cell tumours ofthe some testicular tumours Journal of Clinical Oncology Abiomarker whose presence can be iden- tified through a simple, inexpensive and reliable test has been found to identify kid-ney tumours that are most likely to spread tothe rest of the body. As part of a programme to develop bio- markers for clinical use, Zhong Jiang andcolleagues, of the University of Massachusetts,Worcester, USA, studied the expression of theprotein IMP3 in 501 patients with primary andmetastatic renal-cell tumours. They then fur-ther studied 371 of these patients who hadlocalised primary tumours to see whethertheir cancer had spread. The researchers foundthat the presence of IMP3 was significantlyincreased not only in metastatic renal celltumours but also in primary tumours thatlater developed metastases: patients withIMP3-positive primary tumours were almostsix times more likely to subsequently developmetastasis and four times more likely to diethan were those with IMP3-negative tumours,even after adjustment for other well-knownclinical variables. \"Tumour metastasis, the spread of can- cerous cells from an original site toelsewhere in the body, is almost alwaysdeadly news,\" said Jiang, \"early detectionand treatment of these patients with a highpotential to develop metastasis is crucial forthe survival of cancer patients.\" At present, 'watchful waiting' is the standard of care for patients with localisedkidney cancers that have been removed bysurgery. The authors suggest that, with theuse of the IMP3 test, patients with early-stage disease and a high potential todevelop metastasis after surgery can now beidentified and offered additional treatment.

Consequently, doctors tend torecommend more aggressive treatments,such as radical prostatectomy, to youngerpatients - even to patients with local dis-ease that has not spread. However, olderpatients diagnosed with a similar localisedcancer are offered more choices, includingexternal beam radiation therapy. Andre Konski and colleagues from the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphiacompared how men aged 55 and under per-formed five years after diagnosis comparedto men aged between 60 and 69, and menaged 70 and over - looking at survival, dis-ease progression, and whether blood tests(PSA) showed signs of disease recurrence.All the men had localised prostate cancerand were treated with external beamradiation. They found no statistically significant differences in the outcomes of these threeage groups after five years: 94%, 95% and87% of patients in each respective age cat-egory were alive five years after diagnosis;96%, 97% and 98% of patients in eachrespective withoutmetastatic disease; and 82%, 76%, and 70%of patients in each respective age categoryhad no evidence of disease recurrenceaccording to blood tests. While this study did not compare radi- ation to other therapies, the authorsconcluded that \"External beam radiation atappropriate dose levels has been shown tobe equivalent to permanent prostate seedimplant [brachytherapy] and radical prosta-tectomy in the treatment of patients T1-2 prostate cancer.\" Becauseyounger men with localised disease respondas well as older men to radiation therapy,the authors suggest that this less invasivetreatment option should be considered forthis patient population.

The number of people developing the disease is rising, and it is most prevalent inyoung adults. The risk factors are complexand include family history, skin type, the useof sun lamps and exposure to sunlight.Monitoring those with an increased risk ofthe disease could help to identify cases earlierand reduce the number of deaths. The study analysed data from more than 700 white non-Hispanic patients with inva-sive melanoma recruited from melanomaclinics in Philadelphia and San Fransicso andmore than 900 control subjects from similarcatchment areas. All participants were interviewed and given thorough skin examinations. This infor-mation was combined with incidence andmortality rates in the US and used to deter-mine the risk of developing melanoma withinfive years. The relative risk models showed an attributable risk of 86% for men and 89% forwomen, using at most seven variables.Attributable risks did not vary by age, expo-sure to ultraviolet B or the amount of timespent outdoors. Absolute individual risk variedwidely, depending on age and geographicarea. The study suggests that the risk factorscan be put into two broader categories: indi-vidual interaction with sunlight and thenumber of moles present at a particular timein the participant's life. This new predictor for skin cancer is based on a successful model used to calculatethe risk of breast cancer. The new informationcan help identify those at risk of developingmelanoma so that they can undergo skinexaminations and counselling and be madeaware of the increased importance of avoid-ing sun exposure. It will also be valuable in designing clinical trials in order to select par-ticipants who are more likely to developmelanoma.

The studyshowed that a type of HD known as nodularsclerosis was much more common in the USthan in Europe, and that there is significantlymore variability in the types of HD foundacross Europe. Differences in type of HDaccounted for differences in survival betweenthe US and most of Europe, with EasternEurope being the exception. HD is a malignancy of the lymphatic system of the body, which includes lymphnodes and the spleen. Like many cancers,there are different types of HD, and studieshave shown that certain types have worseprognoses. However, treatment regimens,particularly the newer generation ofchemotherapy and radiotherapy, are gener-ally successful at curing the disease. Despitethis, a recent study of European cancer reg-istries showed significant geographicdifferences in the survival of blood-bornecancers, such as HD. In order to understand the causes of these regional differences, Claudia Allemanifrom the Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio ela Cura dei Tumori in Milan, and the EURO- CARE Working 6,726 casesfrom 37 cancer registries Europe(EUROCARE-UK, EUROCARE-West, andEUROCARE-East) and from 9 - Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults) registries diagnosed between 1990and 1994 and followed for at least fiveyears. Analysis showed that the distribution of HD types in a region was a major factor indetermining regional differences in HD five-year survival and risk of death. In the modelthat was adjusted by age, gender and yearssince diagnosis, the relative excess risk (RER)of death (relative to the SEER data) was 0.93in EUROCARE-West, 1.15 in EUROCARE-UK,and 1.39 in EUROCARE-East. When the modelwas also adjusted for type of HD, EUROCARE-UK and SEER no longer differed (RER 1.06).However, the type of HD did account for thedifferences in mortality risk between cases inthe EUROCARE-UK and EUROCARE-Eastregions. Even after the type of HD was adjusted for, mortality risk remained significantlyincreased in EUROCARE-East compared toEUROCARE-UK, suggesting factors other thanHD morphology, such as stage of diseaseat diagnosis and treatment, influencedoutcome. The study also confirmed the conclu- sions of previous research that HD tumourswith lymphocytic predominance have anexcellent prognosis and HD tumours withlymphocytic depletion are associated withsignificantly worse outcomes.

But the cervical can-cer jab is well on its way. There are currently 3,000 new cases of cervicalcancer a year in the UK. A coupleof shots in the arm, perhaps, andyoung women may never have tothink about it again. That is possible because cervi- cal cancer is spread by a viruscalled HPV, or human papillomavirus. You can catch it by sleepingwith somebody who has it, sowomen with more sexual partnersare more likely to get it. The vac-cine does not act against cancerper se, but protects against the virus which caus-es it. Which makes cervical cancer, effectively,an infectious disease. Can you really catch cancer? And if cervical cancer is caused by an infection, is it remotelypossible that we might also catch breast cancer,or prostate cancer, or bowel cancer? The answerBestReporter 60 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Guardian journalist named Best Cancer Reporter The Best Cancer Reporter Award 2006, sponsored by the European School of Oncology, has gone to Sarah Boseley , health reporter for the UK's Guardian newspaper. She was commended for her 'thorough, balanced, informed and articulate' approach to covering cancer from a widevariety of angles. Below we reprint one of her articles, entitled: Can you catch cancer? is yes and no. Certainly, catching cancers is not the same as catching a cold. Human papillomavirus may trigger cervical cancer, but manywomen infected with it will never develop thedisease. There must also be other factors. Where a virus is involved in cancer, it appears, it is one of many causes -a trigger in a chain of triggers.Along with the virus, there mayhave to be something in yourgenes that tips your chances ofgetting this particular cancer theunlucky way. Diet affects somecancers, alcohol others, smoking isan important risk factor and airpollution is under suspicion. Butthe remarkable and exciting thingabout the involvement of viruses in cancer is that they are a switch that canpotentially be turned off. This is not a bad newsstory; quite the opposite. If an infection isinvolved in the onset of some cancers, thenthere is a way to stop them developing.Potentially, we could invent a vaccine. That isexactly what has happened in cervical cancer BestReporter CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 61and there is every reason to think that, one day, it may be possible in other cancers too. We do not know to what extent viruses are implicated yet, nor in which cancers, but theestimate is that they may play a part in up to20% of cases. The evidence is slowly accumu-lating. Just before Christmas, a paper appearedfrom Newcastle University that offered new evi-dence that minor viral infections such as colds,respiratory problems and mild flu might triggerchildhood cancer. Richard McNally, an epi-demiologist, had mapped outbreaks of two can-cers - forms of leukaemia and brain tumours -in children under 15 over a period of 45 yearsfrom a tumour database in Manchester. He dis-covered clusters of children who were bornaround the same time and in the same place -and went on to develop cancer. Whenever clusters of childhood cancers have been spotted, parents have understandablyascribed them to the man-made environment,assuming that fallout from a power station orradiation from a phone mast must be to blame.But McNally and colleagues have identified apattern which is exactly like what you would seein infectious diseases. \"We found that place of birth was particu- larly significant, which suggests that an infec-tion in the mother while she is carrying her baby,or in a child's early years, could be a trigger fac- tor for the cancer,\" says McNally. \"These couldbe minor common illnesses that are not evenreported to the GP, such as a cold, mild flu or arespiratory virus.\" But no, he hastens to say, youcannot catch cancer. His research suggests thatinfection is one of the factors in its onset, but itis not the only cause. Instead, the hypothesis that his research helps to support is a double-whammy theory.Firstly, babies are born with a propensity toleukaemia. Mel Greaves, a professor at theInstitute of Cancer Research in London,analysed the blood taken by midwives from theheel-pricks of newborns and found that manyalready have cell damage that could lead to thedisease. But it is now clear that a second thinghas to go wrong before a possibility becomes alikelihood. And that could be a viral infection. This fits with the work of Leo Kinlen at Oxford University, who has been lambasted byanti-nuclear campaigners for his theory, firstmooted in 1988, that childhood leukaemia is notthe result of radioactive fallout and waste butcaused by 'population mixing'. Cancer clustersoccur where whole groups from towns and citieshave arrived to live and work in a remotish ruralsetting, he observed. Look at the oil fields,military installations, the building of new towns A good read. In her article Can you catch cancer? Boseley doesn't dodge the difficult science, but she also takes a balanced look at the hope vaccines can offer and explores the wider issues - such as parents who take a dim view of being asked tovaccinate their 10-year-old girls against a sexually transmitted disease and environmental campaigners who are unwilling toconsider the possibility that cancer clusters may not always be caused by local radiation levels BestReporter 62 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006- and nuclear plants too. The incomers bring with them new viral infections, which couldspark cancers among the native local population. In fact, infections associated with cancer have been known for some time. There is a catvirus which causes leukaemia and a vaccineagainst it, causing people to wonder if therecould be a parallel in human leukaemia. But theneatest example of infection as a significantcause is in stomach cancer. This is not triggeredby a virus, but by a bacterium calledHelicobacter pylori . That discovery netted a recent Nobel prize. \"Fifteen to 20 years ago,\"says Heather Dickenson, principal researchassociate University's centre forhealth services research, \"nobody would havetaken seriously the theory that stomach cancerwas the result of infection.\" Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that enters the stomach in food and drink, but does not getdestroyed by the acid there. Around 30%-40%of us are thought to be infected with it, and itcan cause inflammation of the stomach lining,known as gastritis. In a small number of cases(about 3%, which means that other triggers suchas diet or smoking have to be involved) that pro-gresses to stomach cancer. But now we knowthat H. pylori is one of the guilty parties, many of these cancers (though not all) can be pre-vented. Give patients the right antibiotics, andH. pylori goes away. Research into the links between cancer and viruses began around the start of the last centu-ry. In 1908, two Danes, Wilhelm Ellermann andOluf Bang, identified a virus which they foundspread leukaemia between chickens. In 1911,Peyton Rous in the United States found anotherchicken virus which caused sarcoma. The workwas ignored for decades, but eventually wonRous a Nobel prize in the 1960s. In that same decade, the first definitive link between infection and a human cancer wasestablished. A British scientist called Anthony Epstein, based at the Middlesex hospital, wentto listen to a British surgeon called DenisBurkitt, who had identified what is now knownto be the commonest childhood cancer inAfrica. This was a tumour of the jaw thatbecame known as Burkitt's lymphoma. In a remarkable piece of scientific detective work, Epstein mapped the incidence of thetumour across the wet, lowland areas of centralAfrica and realised he was looking at the malarialbelt. He hypothesised that the cancer was causedby an infectious agent, spread by the malarialmosquito, and spent two years staring down anelectron microscope attempting to find it. He and his team had no luck until one tumour biopsy arrived from Uganda in an unfitstate for microscopic examination. So Epsteincultured the cells instead. To everyone's sur-prise, it grew a previously unknown form of her-pes virus, which became known as Epstein-Barr.Epstein-Barr was later found in almost all sam-ples of Burkitt's lymphoma from Africa. Almost everyone has this virus. \"Ninety-five per cent of us are infected by Epstein-Barr,\" saysLawrence Young, professor of cancer biology atthe institute of cancer research in Birmingham.\"It doesn't cause us any effect at all. But withcertain co-factors it could cause problems.\"Malaria was a co-factor in Africa, which is whythe pattern of incidence of Burkitt's lymphomamatched the malarial regions. The ultimate proof that a virus is a contrib- utory cause of cancer is if you remove it, saysYoung. \"Hepatitis B virus is associated with pri-mary liver cancer. It's very common in Africa andthe Far East. About 25 years ago they introduceda vaccine for Hepatitis B in Taiwan where it hadbeen a very common infection and you wouldsee liver cancer in young adults. The incidenceof liver cancer in the population has been signif-icantly reduced.\" Where a virus is involved in cancer, it appears, it is one of many causes - a trigger in a chain of triggersBestReporter CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 63If you have Epstein-Barr and you catch malaria while on holiday, it does not mean you willdevelop Burkitt's lymphoma. None of this isquite that simple. You would have two of therisk factors - two possible triggers - butbecause this is mostly an African cancer, thereis probably a genetic component involved too.Too little is known about the causes of cancer,for all the noise made about diagnosis and treat-ment. But if scientists can nail down a particu-lar virus as a risk, they can interrupt the processthat can cause disease and death. Young callsthe virus \"a link in the chain of events. This isnot like catching a cold. You can't catch canceras an acute disease. But if it is a vital link, youcan break the chain.\" Epstein-Barr is also implicated in about half of Hodgkin's lymphomas, but not the other half.In China, Epstein-Barr is in nasopharyngealcarcinoma - but fascinatingly, the extra link inthe chain is the salted fish in the Cantonesediet (and probably some genetic propensity aswell). \"We know because if populations fromChina move to the west coast of America, in one generation they lose it,\" says Young. \"It's thechanges in their diet.\" Breast cancer, too,appears to have dietary links. The incidence inJapanese women who move to the US soars.\"Diet is a major contributory factor to cancer,\"acknowledges Young. Diet we can change. Viruses and bacteria we live with, for the most part harmoniously aslong as our bodies' infection-fighting systemsare in good order. Epstein-Barr does most of usno harm unless our immune system is sup-pressed. In the early days of heart transplants,for instance, most patients died not because theheart gave out or was rejected, but of Epstein-Barr-associated lymphomas. They were beinggiven massive doses of immuno-suppressantdrugs, which meant that the virus was no longerkept in check, allowing the cancer to develop. And in the early 80s, the first sign that we were in trouble from a new virus that wouldwreak havoc across the planet was the arrival of anew cancer in America called Kaposi's sarcoma. It Public watchdog. In The selling of a wonder drug , also submitted to the award panel, Boseley takes a critical look at drugcompany marketing techniques. Over the years, she has helpedreaders build up an understanding of cancer from a medical,social, political and economic standpoint. More than 400 of herarticles touching on cancer can be accessed on GuardianUnlimited, the Guardian's free Internet site, which is visited by more than 9 million readersBestReporter 64 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006had once been a very rare disease in elderly Jewish men from the Mediterranean. Suddenly,young gay men had it, as the HIV virus knockedout their immune systems, allowing the Kaposi'ssarcoma herpes virus to flourish. Viruses are now thought to be implicated in up to one in five cancers. As time goes on, wemay find it is more. There are some controver-sial theories around. Papers have been writtenthat suggest a monkey virus called SV40 is a trig-ger, with asbestos, for mesothelioma - a cancerof the lining of the chest wall, the abdominalcavity or the lining of the heart. Some have spec-ulated that the monkey virus may have passed tohumans through contaminated stocks of poliovaccine. Others are looking for a virus in lungcancer. In Australia, researchers are studying ahuman virus similar to one called MMTV whichis responsible for mammary tumours in mice.They want to know if it could be implicated inbreast cancer. Finding any cause of cancer - even one that plays a small part - is very good news because itmeans prevention is possible. If a virus isinvolved, it opens up the possibility of a vaccineto disrupt the chain of events that leads to can-cer. That is, in short, a holy grail. The revelationsof the excellent results in trials of the cervicalcancer vaccine were greeted with euphoria.Gardasil, manufactured by Merck, was 100%effective among the 12,000, mostly young,women who took part. It knocked out the twostrains of HPV, 16 and 18, that are implicated in70% of cervical cancers. And the vaccine could prove even more use- ful. The trials showed that some of the otherHPV types which are involved in a minority ofcervical cancers were also stopped in theirtracks. \"Because there are beginning to be signsof cross-protection against other HPV types,[the proportion of cancers affected] could goup,\" says Anne Szarewski, a clinical consultantfor Cancer Research UK who has been involved in the trial. She thinks the proportion of cancersaffected could eventually be as high as 80%. Atthat point, the vaccine becomes more effectiveas a prevention tool than the cervical screeningprogramme. As newer vaccines are developed, itis assumed they may hit the rest of the trouble-some HPV types too. So cervical cancer could, in theory, be wiped out, just as smallpox was. This is unlike-ly to happen, however, since it is only achiev-able if every girl and boy in the country has thejab. The vaccine is expected to be offered tosexually inexperienced girls who will not haveHPV, aged around 10 to 13, but suggesting avaccination for a young girl that will protect herfrom a sexually transmitted disease has notgone down well with parents. The Merck vac-cine, unlike its GlaxoSmithKline rival, protectsalso against two types of HPV that cause geni-tal warts. \"It has proved a nightmare to promotein the States,\" observed Szarewski. Trials inwomen over 25 who will have the virus - formost pick it up at some point - are only justbeginning. Cancer is the scourge of our times, the most feared disease of the 21st century. Itappears to come from nowhere and kill at ran-dom. The more we know of the causes, the bet-ter we will be able to protect ourselves. At themoment, the best advice we have is generally tolive well - to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables,drink in moderation, stop smoking and takeexercise. But there are plenty of people whohave lived unimpeachably healthy lives anddied of cancer. Finding a silent trigger such as avirus that scientists may be able to knock out ofthe equation with a vaccine is not a reason topanic, but a cause for hope. This article was first published in the Guardian on 24 January 2006, and is reprinted with permissionIf scientists can nail down a particular virus as a risk, they can interrupt the process that can cause diseasePatient Voice 66 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Take one at bedtime and you'll soon feel worse Are your patients following the regimen you prescribed? Many cancer patients, intentionally or by mistake, fail to take their medication as prescribed. Understanding why can help doctors encourage their patients to stick with the treatment. Most patients, when faced with a diagnosis of a life-threateningdisease, feel they would 'do any-thing' to survive. It would there-fore seem reasonable to expect that if you offer a treatment protocol that promis-es additional survival, if not a cure, this would begrasped by patients and closely followed. But that doesn't account for human nature. For all kinds of reasons many patients, includingcancer patients, fail to take their medication. Formany, the drugs make them feel worse than theircancer, others forget - perhaps because they arein denial about their illness or maybe they feel sowell on the treatment that they forget they are ill. If these reasons appear trivial, it is because they are often symptoms of more fundamentalunderlying problems to do with how the patientunderstands their disease and the proposedtreatment, and how the patient and doctor worktogether. In recent years, increasing attentionhas been paid to this issue, and it is now knownthat the whole nature of patient adherence totreatment is very complicated and requiresunderstanding and negotiation by health-careprofessionals if their patients are to fully benefitClaire Laurent from the treatment they prescribe. This can onlyhappen if doctors become more aware that theremay be a problem. In an editorial in the British Medical Journal (326:348-349), Marinker Marshall and JoanneShaw say that doctors tend to think non-adher-ence is a problem for other doctors, so when aprescribed drug fails to produce the benefit theyexpect they often respond by varying the dose orchoosing another medicine rather than by talk-ing to their patient about how closely they arefollowing the prescribed drug regimen. This canlead to serious consequences - not just for theindividual patient but also for understandingtherapeutic benefit as well as on financial costs. A growing awareness of the need for greater communication between doctor and patient onthis issue has been accompanied by a change inthe language used. The World HealthOrganization, in a report entitled Adherence to Long Term Therapies: Evidence for Action , rec- ommends the term 'adherence' rather than themore traditional term 'compliance', arguing that'compliance' implies an imbalance in the doc-tor/patient relationship: the doctor is in chargeand the patient must do as they are told. Patient Voice CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 67'Adherence', in contrast, is a more neutral term, simply designating \"the extent to which a per-son's behaviour - taking medication, following adiet, and/or executing lifestyle changes - corre-sponds with agreed recommendations from ahealth-care provider.\" The word promoted by many health practi- tioners today is 'concordance'. This 327:189), the concordant model is one ofshared understanding. It's about shared decision making and an agreement that respects thewishes and beliefs of the patient. What it shouldnot be, she stresses, is a gift-wrapped version ofcompliance. In the UK, the Department of Health has given its backing to the Medicines Partnership(www.medicines-partnership.org), an initiativeset up to encourage a move from 'compliance' to'concordance'. It is calling for more appropriate CORBIS \" 'Compliance' implies the doctor is in charge and the patient must do as they are told\"Patient Voice 68 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006prescribing and a different approach to patient adherence. Patients comply with treatment, saysthe Medicines Partnership, when they under-stand and accept the diagnosis, agree with thetreatment proposed and have had their concernsabout the medicines specifically and seriouslyaddressed. Part of the cultural shift for doctorsentails a recognition that the patients' ownbeliefs about their illness, their treatment andwhat works for them might be at odds withthose of the medical profession. SIZE OF THE PROBLEM Research shows that about half of the medi-cines prescribed for people with chronic condi-tions are not taken ( Lancet 348:383-386). Lesley Fallowfield, professor of psychosocialoncology at the Brighton and Sussex MedicalSchool, in the UK, who co-authored astudy on non-adherence in breast cancer(Eur J Cancer doi:10.1016/j.ejca.2006.03.004), says, \"We know from our research thataround 40% of women with breast cancer, bethat in a chemoprevention, adjuvant or moreadvanced setting, do not take their oral drugs asprescribed.\" According to Michael Mauro of the Center for Hematologic Malignancies at the OregonCancer Institute, Canada, the overall all CML patients pre-scribed Glivec (imatinib) was 75%. ona Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society thisFebruary, Mauro said that 50- to 70-year-oldmen were the most compliant, whilst youngermen were the least compliant, with up to 20% of them failing to take their medication properly.He suggested the difference might be that theolder men were more likely to have wives whosupported them through the treatment. Benjamin Gesundheit is a paediatric oncol- ogist at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. Heargues that for young people, the discipline ofadhering to a drug regimen can be particularlydifficult. Speaking at the 4th International con-ference on Teenage and Young Adult CancerMedicine earlier this year, he said that youngpeople don't want to be told what to do at an agewhen they just are beginning to make their owndecisions. Young people are also more likely tobe risk takers than older people. The evidence shows that the reasons for non-adherence are many and varied. The WHOsays adherence is simultaneously affected byseveral factors. These include: social and eco-nomic factors, the health-care team/system, thenature of the disease and its therapies as well aswhat it calls 'patient-related' factors. In the study of adherence amongst breast cancer patients, the authors found that the issuewas not necessarily related to sociodemographicfactors such as level of education or race. Thekey factors were whether the therapy hadadverse side-effects, and whether it was com-plex and/or lasted longer. According to Fallowfield, the most common reason for non-adherence in breast cancer isquality of life. Women may take 'drug holidays'if they are experiencing side-effects such as hotflushes, which might not be life-threatening but \"In behavioural terms it makes sense to stop taking something that makes you feel sick\"\"Patients' own beliefs about what works for them may be at odds with those of the medical profession\"Patient Voice CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 69can make life miserable. In one study of adher- ence to treatment amongst breast cancerpatients, she found that women aged between40 and 49 years were less likely to adhere tomedication than both younger and olderpatients. While this could simply be an 'arte-fact' of the numbers in the study, she thinks \"it'smore to do with that age group experiencing anearly menopause and being blown over bythat along with everything else going on in theirlives.\" With many long-term conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, schizophrenia andepilepsy, if the patient stops taking their med-ication they quickly begin to notice symptoms.Cancer patients don't necessarily have this tan-gible and immediate connection between med-ication and relief from the disease. \"Rather,\" saysFallowfield, \"they just experience noxious side-effects, so in behavioural terms it makes senseto stop taking something that makes you feelsick or gives you vasomotor problems.\" BRIDGING THE GAP Understanding this behaviour is essential ifhealth-care professionals are to help their patientsstick to their treatment. Doctors may be confidentthat a particular therapy works and not taking itwill result in a poor health outcome, but patientswill, understandably, want to take account of theirown experience of how the drug works for them,which may be telling them something verydifferent. Bridging this gap is the transitiontowards concordance. Jan G, a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia who runs Leukaemie-online(www.leukamie-online.de) for German-speak-ing patients, agrees that side-effects can beimportant when you are on a medication for anylength of time. He says, \"For those drugs thathave strong side-effects, adherence depends onwhether patients feel the drug might save theirlife, but take away all quality of life. Some might decide to stop taking the medication/chemotherapy and resume 'normal' life, takingthe risk that it might reduce how much timethey have left.\" One study of adherence to tamoxifen over five years (Lash et al. Breast Can Res Treat , doi:10.1007/s10549-006-9193-0) found that31% of women who started tamoxifen failed tocomplete the five-year recommended course,despite the fact that five years of treatment con-fers a significant benefit beyond one to two yearsof tamoxifen. Reasons given included severeside-effects and having an additional prescrip-tion added to their treatment. Interestingly,patients with more prescription medications atbaseline were lesslikely to discontinue, as were patients who had a positive view of the drug andan improving view over follow-up. Other evidence has shown that patients may not adhere to their treatment if they don't knowenough about the advantages or disadvantagesof taking it, when they don't feel unwell (so don'tfeel in need of treatment), or when they do feelunwell but find the therapy makes no percepti-ble difference or makes them feel worse. Not all non-adherence comes down to a deliberate decision by the patient, however.Sometimes patients just get it wrong - theyeither don't understand the regimen or they for-get to follow it. Again, there are a variety of rea-sons why this might happen. They may havebeen told one thing by the doctor, another by anurse and something else again by the pharma-cist. Consistent, clear and accurate informationis therefore essential. Research shows that patients forget up to 80% of what they hear in a clinical consultation,and almost half of what they do remember isincorrect, so health professionals have to thinkhard about how to ensure that medication regi-mens are understood and likely to be followed. \"It is important to gain the support of other family members or friends in the management of treatment\"are often more accurate about non-adherence than adherence. Doctors also routinely runblood tests to monitor the disease and treatmenteffects. These can be checked for inconsisten-cies with the drug regimen. It is also important not to assume that the patient has the literacy skills to follow the infor-mation on medicine bottles or on the literaturethat comes with them. It is estimated thatbetween one-quarter and three-quarters ofadults do not have the minimum reading skillsneeded for coping with the demands of modernlife. A report by the OECD, Literacy in the Information Age , (OECD 2000) found at least 15% of adults had only the most rudimentary ofreading skills in 14 of the 20 countries studied:Australia, Belgium (Flanders), Canada, Chile,Czech Republic, Hungary Ireland, NewZealand, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia,Switzerland, the UK and the US. Doctors need to be aware that patients who cannot read are likely to have developed all sortsof coping mechanisms to cover up their poor lit-eracy skills. It is important to go through every-thing very thoroughly with every patient, andmake sure that they have understood. Some simple strategies that can help doc- tors communicate clearly are detailed atwww.askme3.org, a project of the Partnershipfor Clear Health Communication in the US.The project title refers to the three questionsthey advise patients always to ask:1. What is my main problem?2. What do I need to do?3. Why is it important for me to do this? Ensuring adherence or concordance with treatment is about involving the patient, one wayor another, in a dialogue that tackles these threeissues, so that the doctor can be sure the patientunderstands what is wrong with them, what theyneed to take/do and when, and how the treat-ment can help.Patient Voice 70 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006AN HOUR 'S INVESTMENT Gesundheit says it is important to explain thetreatment thoroughly. \"I dedicate an hour toexplaining everything to them: each drug,what it is for and how long they have to take it.This hour is a good long-term investment,because I see much less non-compliance andmisunderstanding.\" He says this explanation has to be repeated at intervals and emphasises that clinicians mustalways remember that the early part of the dis-cussion will be forgotten as the patient may bein shock from hearing their diagnosis.Gesundheit advises that it is important to gainthe support of other family members or friendsin the management of treatment. He adds thattalking to patients about their treatment regi-men can often encourage them to open up aboutthemselves and their illness. \"It's a very goodopportunity to understand the patient.\" He also suggests a number of techniques that might help patients remember theirregimen. A written contract between clinicianand patient or a home diary where the patientrecords that they have taken their medicationcan help. More consultations or a home supportperson to clarify the responsibility of drugadministration can improve adherence. At thehigh-tech end of the market is the MedicationEvent Monitoring System (MEMS). These aremicroprocessors in the cap of standardmedicine bottles. Every time the bottle isopened it is regarded as a presumptive dose.Any patterns in non-adherence will becomeapparent over time - but this is an expensiveway to monitor compliance and does notaddress the reasons why a patient is not takingtheir medication. Doctors can routinely address the issue of adherence at patient consultations. One way todo this is simply asking the question: \"How areyou managing with your medication?\" - patients A quarter to three-quarters of adults don't have the minimum reading skills needed in modern lifeFocus 72 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006IFcannabis were unknown, and bioprospectors weresuddenly to find it in some remote mountain crevice, its discov-ery would no doubt be hailed as amedical breakthrough. Scientistswould praise its potential for treatingeverything from pain to cancer, andmarvel at its rich pharmacopoeia -many of whose chemicals mimic vitalmolecules in the human body. Inreality, cannabis has been withhumanity for thousands of years andis considered by many governments(notably America's) to be a dangerousdrug without utility. Any suggestionthat the plant might be medicallyuseful is politically controversial,whatever the science says. It is in thiscontext that, on April 20th, America'sFood and Drug Administration(FDA) issued a statement saying thatsmoked marijuana has no acceptedmedical use in treatment in theUnited States. The statement is curious in a numberof ways. For one thing, it overlooks areport made in 1999 by the Instituteof Medicine (IOM), part of theNational Academy of Sciences,which came to a different conclu-sion. John Benson, a professor ofmedicine at the University ofNebraska who co-chaired the com-mittee that drew up the report, found some sound scientific informationthat supports the medical use of mar-ijuana for certain patients for shortperiods - even for smoked marijuana.This is important, because one of theobjections to marijuana is that, whenburned, its smoke contains many ofthe harmful things found in tobaccosmoke, such as carcinogenic tar,cyanide and carbon monoxide. Yetthe IOM report supports what somepatients suffering from multiple scle-rosis, AIDS and cancer - and theirdoctors - have known for a long time.This is that the drug gives themmedicinal benefits over and abovethe medications they are alreadyreceiving, and despite the fact thatthe smoke has risks. That is probablywhy several studies show that manydoctors recommend smokingcannabis to their patients, eventhough they are unable to prescribeit. Patients then turn to the blackmarket for their supply. Another reason the FDA statement isodd is that it seems to lack commonsense. Cannabis has been used as amedicinal plant for millennia. In fact,the American government actuallysupplied cannabis as a medicine forsome time, before the scheme wasshut down in the early 1990s. Today,cannabis is used all over the world, despite its illegality, to relieve painand anxiety, to aid sleep, and to pre-vent seizures and muscle spasms. Forexample, two of its long-advocatedbenefits are that it suppresses vomit-ing and enhances appetite - qualitiesthat AIDS patients and those on anti-cancer chemotherapy find useful. Souseful, in fact, that the FDA haslicensed a drug called Marinol, a syn-thetic version of one of the activeingredients of marijuana - delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).Unfortunately, many users of Marinolcomplain that it gets them high(which isn't what they actually want)and is not nearly as effective, norcheap, as the real weed itself. This may be because Marinolis ingested into the stomach, mean-ing that it is metabolised before beingabsorbed. Or it may be because themedicinal benefits of cannabiscome from the synergistic effectof the multiplicity of chemicals itcontains. JUST WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING ? THC is the best known active ingre-dient of cannabis, but by no meansthe only one. At the last count, mari-juana was known to contain nearly 70Reefer madness It suppresses vomiting and enhances appetite - qualities that those on chemotherapy find usefulMarijuana is medically useful, whether politicians like it or not.CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 73different cannabinoids, as THC and its cousins are collectively known.These chemicals activate receptormolecules in the human body, partic-ularly the cannabinoid receptors onthe surfaces of some nerve cells inthe brain, and stimulate changes inbiochemical activity. But the detailsoften remain vague - in particular,the details of which molecules arehaving which clinical effects.More clinical research would help. Inparticular, the breeding of different varieties of cannabis, with differentmixtures of cannabinoids, wouldenable researchers to find outwhether one variety works better for,say, multiple sclerosis-related spastic-ity while another works for AIDS-related nerve pain. However, in theUnited States, this kind of work hasbeen inhibited by marijuana's illegali-ty and the unwillingness of the DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA)to license researchers to grow it for research.Since 2001, for example, LyleCraker, a researcher at the Universityof Massachusetts, has been trying toobtain a licence from the DEA togrow cannabis for use in clinicalresearch. After years of prevarication,and pressure on the DEA to make adecision, Craker's application wasturned down in 2004. Today, the sagacontinues and a DEA judge (whoFocus \"This has no medical benefit because no tests have been done, and we refuse to let you do any tests\" SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARYThe first it,but only tinyminority can get it onprescription74 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006presides over a quasi-judicial process within the agency) is hearing anappeal, which could come to a closethis summer. Dr Craker says that hissituation is like that described inJoseph Heller's novel, Catch 22 . \"We can say that this has no medical ben-efit because no tests have been done,and then we refuse to let you do anytests. The US has gotten into a bind,it has made cannabis out to be sucha villain that people blindly say 'no'.\"Anjuli Verma, the advocacy directorof the American Civil LibertiesUnion (ACLU), a group helpingCraker fight his appeal, says thateven if the DEA judge rules in theirfavour, the agency's chief administra-tor can still decide whether to allowthe application. And, as she pointsout, the DEA is a political organisa-tion charged with enforcing the druglaws. So, she says, the ACLU is inthis for the long haul, and is alreadyprepared for another appeal - onethat would be heard in a federal courtin the normal judicial system. Verma's view of the FDA's statementis that other arms of government areputting pressure on the agency tomake a public pronouncement thatconforms with drug ideology aspromulgated by the White House,the DEA and a number of vocal anti-cannabis congressmen. In particular,the federal government has been rat-tled in recent years by the fact that11 states have passed laws allowingthe medical use of marijuana. In thiscontext it is notable that the FDA'sstatement emphasises that it issmoked marijuana which has notgone through the process necessary to make it a prescription drug. (Norwould it be likely to, with all of theharmful things in the smoke.) Thestatement's emphasis on smokedmarijuana is important because itleaves the door open for the agencyto approve other methods of delivery. HIGH HOPES Donald Abrams, a professor of clini-cal medicine at the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, has beenworking on one such option. He isallowed by the National Institute onDrug Abuse (the only legal supplierof cannabis in the United States) todo research on a German nebuliserthat heats cannabis to the point ofvaporisation, where it releases itscannabinoids without any of thesmoke of a spliff, and with fewercarcinogens.That is encouraging. But it does notaddress the wider question of whichcannabinoids are doing what. Forthat, researchers need to be ableto do their own plant-breedingprogrammes.In America, this is impossible. But itis happening in other countries. In1997, for example, the British gov-ernment asked Geoffrey Guy, theexecutive chairman and founder ofGW Pharmaceuticals, to come upwith a programme to developcannabis into a pharmaceuticalproduct. In the intervening years, GW hasassembled a 'library' of more than 300varieties of cannabis, and obtainedplant-breeder's rights on between 30and 40 of these. It has found the genes that control cannabinoid pro-duction and can specify within strictlimits the seven or eight cannabi-noids it is most interested in. And itknows how to crossbreed its strainsto get the mixtures it wants.Nor is this knowledge merely aca-demic. Last year, GW gainedapproval in Canada for the use of itsfirst drug, Sativex, which is an extractof cannabis sprayed under the tonguethat is designed for the relief of neu-ropathic pain in multiple sclerosis.Sativex is also available to a more lim-ited degree in Spain and Britain, andis in clinical trials for other uses,such as relieving the pain of rheuma-toid arthritis. At the start of this year, the companymade the first step towards gainingregulatory approval for Sativex inAmerica when the FDA accepted itas a legitimate candidate for clinicaltrials. But there is still a long way togo. And that delay raises an importantpoint. Once available, a well-formu-lated and scientifically tested drugshould knock a herbal medicine intoa cocked hat. No one would argue forchewing willow bark when aspirin isavailable. But, in the meantime,there is unmet medical need that, asthe IOM report pointed out, couldeasily and cheaply be met - if theAmerican government cared moreabout suffering and less aboutposturing. \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited, 27 April 2006Focus No one would argue for chewing willow bark when aspirin is available76 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Bookcase Rapha\u00ebl Brenner Holistic oncology a new paradigm? Physicians in the West have long viewed the various non-allopath- ic methods of treatment withsuspicion, considering them at bestineffective and at worst harmful.However, except for cancers such aslymphoma and testicular tumours,standard tumour-destructive thera-pies can severely impair the quality oflife of patients, while not significantlylowering cancer mortality, and agrowing number of patients havebeen turning to complementary andalternative medicine (CAM). CAMhas become very popular among can-cer patients for a variety of reasons: itcan offer better symptom manage-ment and quality of life; patientsoften feel more involved with theirtreatment; it can stimulate thepatient's immune system; alternativetherapists can be more empathetic,better listeners, and can impart newhope. In 1993, in response to theoverwhelming demand by patientsand health-care practitioners, the USNational Institutes of Health estab-lished the Office of AlternativeMedicine (later renamed theNational Center for Complementaryand Alternative Medicine), an organ-isation dedicated to scientificresearch into CAM. In addition topromoting research the initiative boosted recognition of CAM as apopular therapeutic option.Academic publishers have now fol-lowed suit with new textbooks on thesubject. Patients are often the groundbreak- ers. Some oncologists persist in refer- ring to CAM as quackery, but the factis that many patients credit CAMwith making them feel better. In bothComplementary Oncology and Integrative Oncology , the authors stress, however, that complementarytherapies are not intended to replaceapproved standard therapies and should be integrated on the basis ofsound scientific principles. This iswhat differentiates complementarymedicine from 'alternative therapies'(although acronym CAM is Integrative Oncology ): complementary oncologysimply claims to be animportant addition to con-ventional therapies. In view of the fact that CAMis most popular in Germanyand the US, it is not surpris-ing to discover that the firsttextbooks on CAM are thework of German andAmerican teams. Oncology inGerman in 2002: the currentedition is a completelyrevised translation of thatfirst edition. Beautifully pre- sented, rigorously researched andclearly written, the book is dividedinto two main parts. The first part ofthe book offers a critical analysis ofthe current situation in oncology andintroduces readers to tumourimmunology. There are also chaptersanalysing study designs and problems Complementary Oncology Adjunctive Methods in the Treatmentof CancerEdited by Josef Beuth euro 79.95 Integrative Oncology: Principles pp, euro 13.90Like it or not, health-care professionals are having to come to terms with the growing demand for complementary therapies in the treatment of cancer - a phenomenon reflected in thearray of new books on the subject.CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006 77Bookcase related to the evaluation of oncologi- cal studies. This part ends with thepresentation of the QoL-Recorder, atool designed to determine patientquality of life.The rationale of complementary ther-apies is then described in Part Two,which consists of 13 exercise, psycho-oncology(excellent extracts, and hyperthermiaare among the main topics discussed.There is also a very useful chapter,consisting of tables, in which theauthors note the accompanying com-plementary measures (includingdosage and duration of treatment) foreach stage of standard therapeutictreatment for most solid tumours.Written by an American team,Integrative Oncology emphasises the importance of integrating comple-mentary therapies into conventionalcancer treatment. Patients shouldnow be able to ask their oncologistsquestions such as: \"What can I do inaddition to conventional care toimprove my chances of living longerand better?\" The first part of thistextbook is devoted to the principlesof integrative oncology and the sec-ond to its practice. While some chap-ters are highly US-oriented (costs,legal issues), others such as the\"Introduction to IntegrativeOncology\" and the \"Health of the Healer\" are quite instructive.Integrative Oncology overall offers greater scope regarding the modali-ties of integrative oncology than theGerman book. nutrition, andmanual therapy, Integrative Oncology also discusses methods such asbody-mind interventions (medita-tion, yoga, psychology), energy medi-cine (chakra system), spirituality andalternative medical systems (tradi-tional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedicmedicine...), which are not men-tioned in the German book. While allthese methods are clearly worthy ofinterest, they are not supported bymuch evidence-based research, asthe authors point out. The book is badly-structured, leadingto much redundancy and lack of clar-ity. The reader's task would have beenfacilitated, had the modalities of eachmethod been presented separately:physical activity, for instance, isdiscussed in several chapters -prevention, supportive and antineo-plastic care, and in each chapter oninterventions for specific malignantdiseases.The scarcity of data for most modali-ties in integrative oncology hardly jus-tifies such a disease-specific approach. Since both the above books cater to ageneral readership of health profes-sionals, some chapters are too basic forphysicians but, this said, these two books offer a helpful introduction tothe world of integrative oncology andwill hopefully encourage oncologists tobe more open to the diverse resourcesoffered by these new disciplines.Armed with greater knowledge, theywill also be able to communicate morefreely with their patients on the sub-ject. As Matthew P. Mumber writes,integrative oncology has not only thepotential to improve outcomes, butalso to transform individuals and thesystem of cancer care. Is it not time forphysicians to do away with the absurdbarriers erected by allopathy, and viewtheir patients in their entirety - physi-cally and intellectually, emotionallyand spiritually? Patients can but bene-fit from a holistic approach that blendsconventional with unconventionaltherapies.Finally, French readers desiring toknow more about antioxidants andoxidative damage (an important issuein cancer treatment and prevention)can turn to Michel Brack's bookSlowing the aging process and prevent-ing diseases - the antioxidant revolu-tion- which caters to specialists and lay people alike. The second part ofthe book is particularly good. Itincludes numerous tables on theantioxidant power of fruits and veg-etables and practical advice ondietary antioxidants (recipes, ways ofcooking, menu suggestions, etc.). 78 CANCER WORLD SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2006Bookcase chapters on the principles of cancerscreening, the ethi-cal and legal impli-cations of genetictesting in alengthy final chapteron the role of com-plementary thera- pies in cancer prevention. Even if the inclusion of non-gynae-cologic tumours is surprising in thiscontext, one must acknowledge thatthe authors have succeeded in gath-ering together a wide range of infor-mation on risk factors, screening andprevention. The discussion on cancerscreening is particularly comprehen-sive and covers the benefits and therisks involved, as well as the potentialfor bias and error in evaluation. Thebook offers a systematic approach forevaluating the effectiveness ofscreening programmes and theanalyses of clinical trials for thechemoprevention of lung, breast orcolorectal cancer, to name a few, aresound, while not too long. There isalso an evidence-based analysis ofthe potential anticarcinogenic effectsof complementary therapies, ingeneral and in relation to specificcancers. Manetta thus provideshealth-care professionals involved inwomen's health with a overallpicture of cancer prevention. P\u00e9ter Bosze and Maurie Markman'sbook, the andthe of each can-cer. It offers a comprehensive analy-sis of the various aspects ofchemotherapy in the treatment ofgynaecological malignancies - fromthe mechanisms of action of cytotox-ic drugs and the clinical pharmaco- logic principles of their administra-tion, to the clinical trial methodologyfor gynaecologic cancers and themolecular biology underlying the dis-covery of new treatment approaches.Readers will find in this book awealth of up-to-date, practical, clear-ly presented information. The use oftables in the chapter on dosing,schedule and route of chemotherapyis particularly helpful. Without obfuscating the complexity ofthe issues, the authors manage to givean intelligent overview of the currentstatus of cytotoxic treatment of gynae-cologic tumours. Breast cancer, espe-cially systemic adjuvant therapy ofearly-stage tumours, where manyshades of grey remain, is dealt withparticularly well. The chapter onchemoprevention of breast cancersums up the major chemopreventiontrials for breast cancer published sofar. Maybe here, the authors do notsufficiently stress the fact that, untilwe have surrogate markers that identi-fy those who are at high risk of breastcancer, clinical cancer preventionresearch will remain in limbo, withthe danger that we end up treating riskas a medical condition and thus sub-stituting one disease for another.For such a technical book, it is unusu-al and praiseworthy to see that itincludes a chapter on the psychologi-cal aspects of chemotherapy.Curiously, most of the side-effects ofchemotherapy are discussed in thischapter. Psychological care is indeedimportant for patients suffering fromside-effects, but readers would expectto find here a more detailed analysis ofthe pharmacological management ofthe main side-effects caused by cyto-toxic drugs. This aside, the book is anexcellent aid for all those interested inlearning more about the chemothe-rapy of gynaecologic cancers. Alberto Manetta, Professor ofObstetrics and Gynecology at the University of California, Irvine,views women's health \"as a new dis-cipline that transcends and blendsthe boundaries of traditional clinicaldisciplines\" relating to women, suchas obstetrics and gynaecology, inter-nal medicine, family medicine, geri-atrics and paediatrics. He clearlywants gynaecology to return to itsetymological origin, i.e. the study ofwoman. The book he has compiledaddresses assessment of risk, preven-tion and early diagnosis of cancer inwomen, for cancers that occur mostfrequently and are responsible for thehighest mortality in Western coun-tries. It thus covers nine specific can-cers: lung, breast, colorectal, skin,cervical, vagina, vulva, ovarian anduterine corpus.
