INTRODUCTION If you operate a business which involves the practice of p uncturing or piercing the skin or flesh of the human body, then this code of practi ce applies. Skin piercing and puncturing includes: /square4 Acupuncture; piercing temporary tattooing); and /square4 Electrolysis. If you carry out any of these practices in the boro ugh of Dartford then you must be registered with Dartford Borough Council by law: /square4 Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 198 2, as amended by the Local Government Act 2003; and /square4 Dartford Borough Council's byelaws for skin piercin g activities. Registration is important to ensure that you are opera ting within controlled conditions, to reduce the risk of introducing micro-organisms that can cause infection. You have responsibilities for the health and safety of anyone yo u employ, your clients and any others who may be affected by your business (Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974). This Code of Practice sets out known procedures and practices that you must follow in order to comply with the law. Procedures that you must follow to comply with the law are written in bold type. An a lternative procedure is only acceptable provided it is equally effective. Also included in this document are recommendations for be st practice and information to help you understand the chain of infect ion and how to eliminate the risks of cross-contamination as far as possible. 2. TRAINING AND COMPETENCY Practitioners must be at least 18 years old and sho uld be able to demonstrate appropriate training for the procedure they are car rying out. Full records must be kept on the premises of all qu alifications and courses attended, and be available for inspection at all ti mes. Practitioners have a duty for their own ongoing profe ssional development. This may include subscriptions to relevant newsletters, journals and articles; attending seminars and conferences or joining a relevant trade associ ation. Tattoo and Cosmetic Piercing /square4 Practitioners must attend a relevant course on infe ction control, and a refresher course at least every five years. /square4 Training must include procedures on dealing with bo dy fluid spillage (vomit, blood, urine etc), needle-stick injury and all safe working methods. /square4 Practitioners should be carefully supervised during the first year of practice by a practitioner who has been successfull y practising routinely over the previous five years. Records of supervision should be kept on 5 the premises. (It may take up to two years of full -time practice to achieve the minimum level of competence). /square4 Practitioners should be able to demonstrate compete ncy and knowledge on anatomy, diseases and their transmission and inf ection control procedures. Ear-Piercing /square4 Practitioners must have received appropriate traini ng and records of training must be available for inspection at all ti mes. Electrolysis /square4 Practitioners must have completed a course recognis ed by a professional association and records should be avai lable for inspection at all times. /square4 Practitioners should be appropriately supervised du ring their first year following qualification. Acupuncture /square4 Practitioners must have completed a relevant course and be registered with a professional association. Recognised associations: British Acupuncture Council; Acupunctu re Association of Associ Chinese Medicine A ssociation UK; British Medical Acupuncture Society; and College of Ayur veda. 3. MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THE CHAIN OF INFECTION Infections are caused by the introduction of micro-organi sms (germs) to the body in sufficient numbers to cause infection. Not all micro-orga nisms are as potent as others, therefore the number of micro-organisms needed to cause infection varies. The \"chain of infection\" describes how micro-organisms, the source of infection, get out of their natural reservoir (i.e. where they norm ally live) and are spread to a new site (i.e. into the body's tissues or onto clean equipmen t) where they may cause harm. When a needle breaks a person's skin, blood, serum or small fragments of tissue inevitably adhere to the needle or instrument used. These can then be transferred to dyes, operator's hands or other objects in the room if st ringent infection control procedures are not followed. As a result, other instrum ents, cloth or paper, that come into contact with the pierced skin, may also become contami nated. Decontamination and sterilisation or disinfection (as appropriate) is essen tial to ensure that infection is not transmitted to others. Blood or serum does not have to be visible on the i nstrument or needle to transmit infection. Disinfection: a reduction in numbers of microbes to levels where bacter ial infection probably will not occur. Sterilisation: the complete removal of all micro-organisms. 6 The term \"micro-organisms \" includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, helminths (worms) and ectoparasites: Bacteria Examples of bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Listeria, Legionella, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli. There are many more bacteria, some of which live in or on our bodies, protecting us against ot her potentially harmful bacteria. Other bacteria live in the environment and act in the breakdown of organic material. Viruses Examples of blood-borne viruses are hepatitis B, and C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The hepatitis B and C vi ruses and the HIV virus can live undetected in the blood for many years and affect how the liver works. The virus of Hepatitis B is very resilient and spreads re adily from person to person by contact with very small amounts of infected blood, serum or tissue fluids. With tiny abrasions in the skin, or where a procedure involves pier cing the skin, even where blood is not normally drawn, the serum that exudes is e qually infectious. Disinfection of instruments is not adequate, and instruments must be sterilised. Other viruses cause measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, the common cold and flu. These viruses are always present in a certain number of p eople and are spread in blood, respiratory secretions, and exude from lesions (e. g.chickenpox). The hepatitis A virus is mainly food or water borne, a nd can be passed from person to person by the faeco-oral route (e.g. if an infected pe rson does not wash their hands properly after going to the toilet, then touches or p repares food or drink, or equipment used in the preparation of food or drink, for someone else). Fungi Some examples of fungi are Athletes' Foot, aspergillus, and candida (thrush). Some fungi can be extremely dangerous if they get into the tissues of a person whose immune response is poor (e.g. through a break in the skin ). Helminths (worms) Examples of helminths are threadworms, tapeworms, round worms. These do not usually present a risk of infection in skin piercing establi shments. Ectoparasites Examples of ectoparasites (which live on the surface of th e skin or just beneath it) are headlice and scabies. These are spread by prolonged, dir ect, skin-to-skin contact. 4. CUSTOMER CARE It is illegal to tattoo anyone under the age of 18. A notice should be displayed with details of the Tattooing of Minors Act 1969 . Operators should carry out checks to ensure that clients are over 18. Adequate enquiries must be made before the procedur e is carried out to ensure that customers are not suffering from any infectiou s disease or other relevant medical condition before the operation commences. Adequate records should be maintained of all custom ers including details of their treatment. 7 Written information, specific to the procedure the clien t has had done, should be given. For further guidance see Appendix 1, Aftercare of the Client . 5. RECORD KEEPING Operators should record the following information f or each customer: /square4/square4 /square4/square4 Date of given; /square4/square4 /square4/square4 Procedure carried out, including position on the b ody, type of jewellery used (if applicable); /square4/square4 /square4/square4 procedure; /square4/square4 /square4/square4 If cosmetic piercing is provided to a minor, writt en parental consent must be obtained. Nipple and genital piercing is p rohibited on minors, regardless of parental consent. The Data Protection Act 1998 applies, and records k ept are confidential and must be held securely. Records should be maintained for at least three yea rs. 6. SKIN PREPARATION BEFORE A SKIN PIERCING PROCEDUR E The client's skin should be cleaned before any inva sive procedure is carried out. This prevents bacteria living on the surface of the skin from being introduced into the tissues of the body. If the client's skin is dirt y, the area to be pierced should be washed with soap and water before using alcohol to d isinfect it. An alcohol-based skin disinfectant (e.g. solution o f 70% alcohol in 0.5% chlorhexidine or wipes containing 70% alcohol) shou ld be used in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines. Alcohol preparations kill micro-organisms by drying them out; therefore in order to be effective, the alcoholic preparation must be allowed to dry before the start of a procedure. Solutions used to wipe procedure sites must be fres hly made-up for each client to discourage the growth of potentially harmful mic ro-organisms (germs) in the solution. It is recommended that these solutions are used from a disposable cup that is thrown away after one use. The use of squeezab le bottles for these solutions is not recommended (even if the bottle is covered with cling-film that is changed after every client). If the client's skin is broken, sore, infected or d amaged in any way at or near the site to be tattooed or pierced, the procedure s hould be postponed until the skin is healed. Skin in a poor condition is more likely to become infe cted, with potentially fatal consequences for the client. Where applicable, to mark the placement of a pierci ng, a single use water- based marker pen should be used. Alternatively a single-use toothpick dipped in gentian violet could be used, and the bottle should be discarded after each client. For guidance on use of Local Anaesthetic Agents , refer to Appendix 2. 8 7. CONSTRUCTIONAL STANDARDS The floors, walls, screen, partitions and ceilings of premises should be of sound construction, smooth finish and capable of be ing readily cleaned and redecorated where appropriate. Finishes should be light reflective colours. Effective and suitable means of ventilation should be provided. Adequate lighting must be provided. There should be suitable and sufficient sanitary ac commodation for operators and clients. For tattoo and cosmetic piercing, there should be a minimum of 5m 2 floor space for each operator in the establishment. The treatment area must be solely used for giving t reatments, and must be completely separated from all other rooms by full h eight walls or partitions. 8. CLEANLINESS OF PREMISES AND FIXTURES The floor and floor covering, internal walls, scree n partitions and ceiling shall be maintained in a clean condition. A suitable receptacle with close fitting lid shall be provided for waste material (for guidance on waste disposal please refer to sec tion 18). Every chair, seat or couch shall be capable of bein g readily cleaned and shall be maintained in a clean condition. Every shelf, table, cabinet, wash-hand basin and ot her fitting shall be capable of being readily cleaned and shall be maintained in a clean condition. 9. WASHING FACILITIES A wash-hand basin must be provided in the immediate vicinity of the treatment area, with an adequate supply of running hot and co ld water. The wash-hand basin is for hand washing only. Ideally hot and cold water should be available via a mixer tap, to deliver water at a comfortable temperature. Liquid soap and disposable towels must be provided and maintained at the hand washbasin, ideally from wall-mounted dispenser s. After hand-washing, hands should be dried thoroughl y on disposable, paper towels, which should be discarded into a foot-opera ted waste bin. Foot, elbow, wrist or sensor taps are recommended so that once washed, clean hands are not re-contaminated by turning off dirty ta ps. If hand-operated taps are in place, use a paper towel to turn them off after hand washing. 9 Effective drainage is required to prevent pooling o f contaminated water in the basin. The use of fabric, washable towels is unsuitable, since the y remain damp, encouraging the growth of micro-organisms. 10. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS OF OPERATOR Every person who attends a customer must have clean hands. Finger nails should be clean and kept short so that they can be kept clean more easily. Guidance for Hand Hygiene is available in Appendix 3. Cuts, sores and grazes on exposed skin (eg hands or forearms) must be covered with a clean, waterproof dressing. This protects the operator from the risk of infection from the client's blood splashes, and the client from the risk of infection if the operator has an oozing wound. There must be no eating or drinking in the procedur e area. This is to protect the operator from consuming food or drink that may have be en in contact with a contaminated surface or piece of equipment. 11. MAINTAINING A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT \"Clean\" and \"dirty\" zones should be maintained in the tr eatment area. Zoning prevents the transfer of \"dirty\" equipment used during a procedure to a \"clean\" area. Once equipment has entered the \"dirty\" zone, even if i t is not used, it must be decontaminated before it is put back into the \"clean \" zone. All surfaces (e.g. piercing chair, work surface) th at could become contaminated should be protected with paper roll during use; thi s should be changed after every client. If the paper roll becomes contaminat ed it should be discarded as hazardous (clinical) waste. If the paper roll is no t contaminated, it can be discarded as non-hazardous waste (refer section 18). Paper or other material used as a covering on a cha ir or seat or couch and any towel, cloth or any article which is applied to the customer's skin shall be clean and must not have been used in connection with any other customer unless it consists of a material which can be and has been ad equately cleaned. Surfaces can be protected by cling film and paper / kitche n roll to protect them from contamination by blood or body fluids. The cling film and kitchen roll must be changed after every client. Electric cables and motors should be covered by a p rotective impermeable plastic sleeve, which must be changed after every c lient. The surface should be wiped over with detergent and warm water in between each client, or with a 10% hypochlorite solution if there is contamination with blood or body fluids. This should be left on for two minutes to kill any potentially harmful micro-organisms, then rinsed of f to avoid damaging metal surfaces. 10 Alcohol sprays or wipes should not be used to clean dirty surfaces because they do not penetrate organic matter (e.g. blood or body flu ids) to reach underlying surfaces. Alcohol may also damage some materials e.g. waterproof finishes. 12. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Gloves must be worn at all times when the operator may be in contact with blood or other body fluids. Single-use, disposable, non-powdered latex gloves are r ecommended when contact with blood or body fluids is expected. If the client o r operator has a latex sensitivity, disposable nitryl gloves should be worn instead of latex . Vinyl gloves that are not CE marked do not offer the same level of protection as lat ex or nitryl gloves against all the micro-organisms that may be in blood or body fluid s. If your skin starts to become sore when wearing latex glo ves, remember that you may be developing sensitivity to latex. Alternatives (e.g . nitryl gloves) are available. If your skin is sore, you should discuss this with your GP. Hands should be washed and properly dried on a disp osable paper towel: before gloves are put on, and after they are taken off. Gloves should be discarded as hazardous (clinical) w aste when taken off. Gloves must be changed after every client. If you are doing two procedures on the same client (e.g. a tattoo on an arm and a tattoo on the back), gloves must be changed in be tween the two procedures. This is to avoid taking micro-organisms from one site of t he body to another. Gloves must be changed if they become punctured dur ing use. The operator should wear clean, practical clothing, preferably with short or three-quarter length sleeves, to allow thorough han d washing up to the wrists. The operator should wear a disposable, single-use p lastic apron to protect his/her own clothing during procedures and to preve nt possible cross- contamination. Aprons should be changed after ever y client and disposed of as hazardous (clinical) waste after use. Fabric towels should not be used to protect the ope rator's clothing from the client's body fluids. If needed, paper towel (e.g. kitchen roll) should be used for this purpose in addition to the plastic apron. Pap er towel used in this way must be discarded as hazardous (clinical) waste. If heavy bleeding occurs, or if dealing with a larg e spillage of blood or body fluids, the operator should consider the use of eye protection and/or a full-face visor to protect the eyes and/or the mucous membran es of the nose and mouth from body fluid (including blood) splashes. 13. DYES / PIGMENTS All entation and semi- permanent tattooing should be sterile and inert. T hey should be bought from 11 reputable suppliers and should be appropriate for t he procedure they are being used for. Fresh pigments from a clean container sh ould be used for each customer. The containers used to hold the dyes or pigments fo r each customer should be either sterile, pre-packed or single-use. They sho uld be disposed of after each client, or decontaminated and sterilised after each client and kept in clean conditions until the next use (in which case the co ntainers will need to be autoclavable). The dyes or pigments should be supplied with data s heets stating the level of sterility each dye or pigment has, and whether or n ot it contains any metal impurities. 14. EQUIPMENT It is essential that equipment is decontaminated in a way to prevent the spread of infection to the operator or clients. If the equipment has parts that can potentially be contaminated with dye or pigment, blood or body fluids by tracking back or a erosol contamination then those parts should be : Single-use only, or Steam-sterilised in accordance with guidance. If equipment is not single-use and cannot be steril ised due to the nature of the equipment (e.g. some motorised equipment used in mi cro-pigmentation) the following five-stage cleaning method should be used , if the manufacturer states that the piece of equipment is compatible with this : 1. Any non-replacement part of the equipment that has or may have become contaminated must be partially submerged, i. e. to cover all contaminated regions, in an ultrasonic bath contain ing an appropriate ultrasonic cleaning solution. The cleaning solution should be made up and used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 2. The equipment must be rinsed in clean water followi ng ultrasonification. 3. The equipment must then be immersed in a disinfecta nt as recommended by the manufacturer of the instrument. It is important that the following are noted when c arrying out disinfection procedures: Parts must be immersed for the correct contact time , which will be recommended by the manufacturer of the disinfectant . Affected parts must be fully covered in the disinfe ctant. The disinfectant must be at the correct concentrati on 12 The disinfectant must be fresh. The disinfectant must be capable of killing bacteri a and blood borne viruses including, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HI V. Ensure the equipment is compatible with the disinfe ctant you are using. 4. The equipment must again be adequately rinsed in cl ean water to remove all chemical residues. 5. Finally, the equipment must be dried using a clean, single use, disposable paper towel. 15. SINGLE-USE ITEMS If a piece of equipment has been identified for \"sin gle use only\" it must not be re-used on any other client. Any package with this symbol on the outer pack is d esigned for single-use only and must not be re-used: All razors must be single-use only. Needles used for tattooing must be single-use only. They should be discarded into a sharps bin immediately after use. Elastic bands on tattoo motors must be changed in b etween every client. 16. DECONTAMINATION OF EQUIPMENT All non-invasive equipment (e.g. tattoo motors) and invasive equipment that has been in the dirty zone must be decontaminated betwee n every client, whether used or not. Decontamination must be done followin g the manufacturer's instructions and may involve cleaning only, cleanin g and disinfection, or cleaning and sterilisation. The operator must ensure that all instruments and e quipment to be used during an invasive procedure are kept sterile until used. Equipment that is used invasively (i.e. goes throug h intact skin) must be sterile at the point of use. Great care should be taken to avoid any needlestick injury or splashing to the eyes and face while cleaning eq uipment used for invasive procedures. The most essential part of decontamination is the initia l cleaning done to remove organic matter. If an item of equipment is not clean before being sterilised, the item will not be sterile at the end of the process. The manufacturers' instructions must be followed about the correct way to clean all instruments or equipment. The tattoo machine's motor or frame cannot be steri lised and should be carefully wiped between clients with 70% alcohol. When considering the purchase or replacement of steam ster ilisers, consideration should be given to those with an integral printer. 13 Washing equipment or instruments by hand If washing dirty equipment or instruments by hand, you must use a dedicated sink. You must not use the hand washbasin for inst rument cleaning. Wear disposable gloves and a plastic apron, and eye prot ection in case of splashing with dirty water. The equipment or instruments being cleaned by hand should be cleaned in a sink deep enough to fully submerge the items. The items should be cleaned under water to prevent any spray or aerosol being g enerated, at a temperature below 35 0C to prevent proteins in the blood coagulating on t he equipment. Then clean the items with hot water and detergent, and rinse them in clean water before they are sterilised. Equipment or instruments used invasively should not be washed by hand. They should be washed in an ultrasonic cleaner to m inimise the risk of needle- stick injury and to ensure thorough cleaning. Ultrasonic cleaning Small items may be cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner . The items should be held in a mesh basket (supplied by the manufacturer) and the lid of the ultrasonic cleaner should be in place when the machine is in u se. Using the cleaner in this way enables the ultrasonic waves to reach the equipment being cleaned, and, if the lid is on during use, the contaminated cleaning solution cannot splash members of staff. If a tattooist has soldered his / her own needles o nto a needle bar, both the soldered needle and the needle bar should be cleane d in the ultrasonic cleaner and sterilised in the autoclave before use. After use, both the soldered needle and the needle bar should be cleaned in the ultrasonic washer and sterilised in the autoclave b efore the needle is removed and discarded into the sharps' bin. An enzymatic agent recommended by the manufacturer o f the ultrasonic cleaner should be used to clean the equipment in it . The cleaning solution must be changed as soon as it is visibly soiled OR every four hours. The tank of the ultrasonic cleaner should be emptie d at the end of every day, rinsed out and dried. The tank should be cleaned with a suitable agent as recommended by the manufacturer at least weekly. M ore frequent cleaning may be needed in hard water areas. Ultrasonic cleaners must be periodically tested acc ording to the manufacturer's instructions. Steam sterilisation (use of the autoclave) Steam sterilisation in a bench-top steam steriliser is the preferred method of sterilisation. 14 Autoclaves rely on the use of steam under pressure. It i s important that items placed in the unit are clean to ensure that the steam comes int o contact with the entire surface of items and so sterilises them effectively. Wrapped or hollow items will not allow steam penetrat ion unless there is active removal of air from within these items. Choosing the right steriliser: /square4 A traditional steam steriliser is not a suitable means of sterilisation for equipment that is hollow, not is it suitable for wrapp ed / packaged items unless the steriliser is a vacuum steam steriliser with pre-steril isation forced air removal and post-sterilisation drying stages. Maintenan ce and use of these sterilisers is more complicated. /square4 You should only use the type of steriliser that is suita ble for the types of loads that you intend to process - the manufacturer should clea rly state the types of load for which the steriliser is suitable. /square4 If the steriliser has more than one type of cycle, ensur e you use the correct cycle for the load. /square4 Consider how you will maintain and service the equipm ent. For example, service contract and periodic testing, and contingency plan s in the event that the steriliser either breaks down or if you cannot be assu red that it is working effectively. /square4 Ensure that you test new equipment before using it to ensure that it is working correctly. If using a steam steriliser - /square4 All items must be clean and dry before being put in to the steriliser. Do not overload the steriliser - items will not be ste rilised if steam cannot penetrate to all the surfaces of all the items. /square4 Equipment sterilised in a bench-top steriliser is o nly considered sterile if used straight from the steriliser as soon as it is cool enough, or within up to three hours. The door of the steriliser should not have been opened before the equipment is removed for the equipment to be consid ered sterile. The sterilised load items will be contami nated as soon as the steriliser is opened. /square4 If the equipment does not have to be sterile at the point of use, once sterilised and dried thoroughly in the steriliser i t can be stored in a clean, washable, airtight, lidded container until used. Micro-organisms are carried on dust particles and t hrive in wet or damp conditions. /square4 Equipment stored in an airtight, lidded container s hould be removed before a procedure begins. The person removing the equipment should have clean, gloved hands. /square4 The steriliser water chamber and reservoir should b e drained and cleaned at the end of each day, and then left to dr y. 15 /square4 Water should not be left standing in the steriliser for more than a few hours. At the end of the day the steriliser should be drained and all internal surfaces rinsed with (ideally) sterile wat er and left to dry. Residual water or moisture left following a sterili sation cycle will quickly become colonised with micro-organisms which can be harmful to the client. The water droplets present in the steam will contain th e same contaminants as the water used in the steam steriliser. When the steam condenses on the load during sterilisation, contaminants will be transferred t o the surfaces of the load where they will be concentrated when the load dries. The quality of the water used in the steriliser is therefore crucial. Steriliser manufacturers usually recommend the use of dist illed, de-ionised or reverse osmosis water. Levels of mineral contaminants are likely to be low but unknown. Purified water safeguards the steriliser but m ay not prevent contamination of the load with organic substances that cou ld be harmful to the client. The Medical Devices Agency recommends the use of sterile wate r, which has specification limits for mineral, toxic metal and endotoxi n contaminants. To minimise contamination of the steriliser and its load , part-used containers of sterile water should be discarded, as its microbiological p urity will be compromised from the moment the container is opened. Maintenance and record keeping - /square4 The details of all sterilisation cycles should be k ept as a record. /square4 You should carry out routine cleaning and maintenan ce in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and at the int ervals specified. It is expected that quarterly and annual checks should be carried out by a registered, authorised person. The details of Authorised Persons are available from th e Institute of Healthcare Engineering and Estates Management (0239 282 3186). The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) can adv ise on bodies that have relevant accreditation for the provision of compet ent persons (020 8917 8400 or www.ukas.com ). /square4 Operators must carry out daily and weekly checks, r ecording the written results to provide a record that the steriliser was working safely within known parameters. /square4 There must be a written scheme of examination and a maintenance programme to ensure that the steriliser's pressure system is regularly checked for safety. These are legal requirements u nder the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000. The written scheme of examination must specify the nature and frequency of examinations, and include any special measures that may 16 be needed to prepare a system for safe examination. It is a statutory examination designed to ensure that your pressure s ystem is safe for use. It is not a substitute for regular and routin e maintenance. The maintenance programme should take into account the system and equipment age, its uses and environment. /square4 The results of all checks and details of repairs sh ould be recorded. Sterilisers that are not maintained correctly and t ested periodically can be dangerous. Steriliser door locks and their oper ating mechanism, hinges and door seals all form part of the pressure containment system. The force on a benchtop steam steriliser door can b e about \u00be tonne. Sterilising temperature range ( oC) Minimum Maximum Approximate Pressure (bar) Minimum hold time (minutes) 134 137 2.25 3 126 129 1.50 10 121 124 1.15 15 17. BLOOD SPILLAGES If the environment is contaminated with blood or body fluids containing blood, use chlorine-releasing granules or a 10% hypochlorite soluti on to deactivate any micro- organisms (e.g. hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV) that m ay be in the spillage. Risk assessments must be carried out on all hazardou s substances used at work; this includes detergents, disinfectants and b ody fluids (e.g. blood). Blood and body fluids are included because of the p otentially harmful micro- organisms they could contain. This is a legal requirement of the Control of Subst ances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH) 2002. Protocol for dealing with blood spillages: IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD TRAINING IN THE USE OF SODIUM H YPOCHLORITE SOLUTIONS OR CHLORINE-RELEASING GRANULES, DO NOT US E THEM. REPORT THE SPILLAGE TO THE PERSON IN CHARGE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRU CTIONS WHEN USING CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS. Wear disposable gloves and a plastic apron; If dealing with a large spillage of blood or body f luids, consider whether eye and face protection should be worn; Cover the spillage with chlorine-releasing granules or a 10% hypochlorite solution and leave for two minutes; Use paper towels or a disposable cardboard scoop an d pusher to remove the spillage and granules or solution; discard into a clinical waste bag; Change gloves (discard as clinical waste) and wash hands. Put on new gloves; Rinse the area with detergent and hot water to remo ve any staining; 17 Remove PPE (discard as clinical waste) and wash han ds again. 18. USES OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE AND STRENGTHS OF SO LUTION Guidance on the use of sodium hypochlorite and the recom mended strengths is shown below: USE DILUTION OF STOCK SOLUTION (%) AVAILABLE CHLORINE (ppm) Blood spills 1 in 10 10 10,000 Environmental disinfection hard surfaces 1 in 100 1 1,000 Undiluted commercial hypochlorite (bleach) solutions conta in approximately 10% (100,000ppm) available chlorine. Hypochlorite concentration is expressed in terms of parts p er million (ppm) available chlorine. This varies from brand to brand and also dep ends on how the product has been stored. Liquid bleach should be stored in a cool, dark place and used within six months of purchase. Chlorine-releasing agents should not be diluted in hot water, nor mixed with acids nor inappropriate cleaning solutions, as a rapid release of chlorine may occur, causing irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract of the use r. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning equ ipment (e.g. tattoo motors) contaminated with blood or body fluids. 19. NEEDLESTICK INJURY OR SPLASH FROM BLOOD OR BODY FLUIDS All needle-stick injuries (i.e. when the skin is pi erced by a used, sharp instrument or piece of equipment), or splashes to t he eyes, mouth, or an exposed area of broken skin, must be treated extrem ely seriously and urgent action taken. You must do this even if the instrum ent or piece of equipment looks clean. If the injury has happened during the cleaning of e quipment, it must be treated as a needle-stick injury. This is because there is still a risk of contamination with potentially harmful micro-organisms until the equipment has been sterilised. Any wound should be made to bleed under clean runni ng water - squeeze the area gently to do this. The aim of this is to sque eze out any potentially harmful micro-organisms. Do not suck the wound. Cover the wound with a clean dressing. Rinse the mouth, eyes or broken skin thoroughly und er clean, running water. If you have sterile eye wash solutions in your first a id kit, use this to flush the eyes. Go to your GP or to the nearest hospital (accident and emergency department) immediately in case further treatment is needed. T reatment started within one hour of the injury can be effective in protecting a gainst HIV. 18 This course of action must be followed even if you have had hepatitis B vaccination. Remember, there is no vaccine availab le against hepatitis C and HIV . For further guidance on Vaccinations , refer to Appendix 5 . Inform the owner, manager or supervisor about the i ncident, which must be logged in the accident book. 20. DISPOSAL OF WASTE All waste contaminated with body fluids is classified as \"h azardous\" or \"clinical\" waste. This includes used gloves, aprons, cotton wool and paper r oll. Hazardous waste must be disposed of into appropriate ly marked bags, which should be removed by an authorised contractor and t aken for incineration. A copy of the current contract for the removal of s uch waste and contractor's license and transfer notes must be available for in spection on the premises at all times. Premises producing over 200kg of hazard ous waste per annum may need to be registered with the Environment Agency - discuss this with your local authority. All waste should be labeled so that the source can be tracked in case of any problem after collection, and details of your waste disposal system should be available for inspection. All other waste can be disposed of as non-hazardous waste, being discarded into non-hazardous waste bags that go to landfill for disposa l. There should be foot-operated, lidded bins to hold the hazardous and non- hazardous waste bags in the treatment area. This is to prevent cross contamination and to ensure proper segregation of w aste. 21. SHARPS Sharps are used needles or any single-use item of e quipment that may pierce the skin if not disposed of in a rigid container. They must be discarded in a designated sharps' bin placed within the treatment area. The sharps bin must be marked with either or both o f the following two figures: BS 7320 or UN 3291, to ensure it meets current Brit ish Standard and European Union safety standards for sharps' disposal (BS7320 ) and transport of sharps bins (UN 3291). Sharps bins must be colour-coded and labeled with t he correct EWC (European Waste Code) for the sharps they contain. The details requested on the front of the sharps bi n should be completed when the bin is assembled and when it is locked. This i s so that the source can be tracked if there is a problem after collection. 19 Sharps bins should be positioned out of the sight a nd access of unauthorised personnel. Sharps bins should be handled with the lid in the \"c losed\" position to avoid accidental spillage of the contents. Before collection, sharps bins should be stored in a locked area inaccessible to members of the public or unauthorised personnel. Sharps bins must be collected regularly by licensed contractors and sent for incineration. If staff are unsure about the correct use of sharps bins, the company representatives selling them are usually willing to give training when necessary. 22. EAR PIERCING Problems have arisen not only from unhygienic practices d uring this operation, but from the adverse effects of unsuitable materials remaini ng in close contact with body fluids. It is most important that \"sleepers\" are made o f suitable materials, for example gold, platinum and surgical stainless steel. The use of modern \"gun\" injectors utilising sterile fitm ents, with no manual handling of those fitments, is to be recommended as a simple, virtuall y foolproof, practical method of ear piercing. Customers should be advised to contact their medical practit ioner in case of complications arising following the operation. 23. INSURANCE The business must have third party liability insurance to cover claims, damages or negligence, and employer's liability insurance where ap propriate. 24. LEGAL REFERENCES - list Dartford Borough Council byelaws, made under Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, as amended by the Local Government Act 20 03; Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974; Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulati ons 2002; Tattooing of Minors Act 1969; Pressure Systems Safety Regulations 2000; Smokefree (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2 006. 20 APPENDIX 1 AFTERCARE OF THE CLIENT Clients should be advised to maintain a good standard o f personal hygiene to avoid the introduction of potentially harmful micro-organism s (germs) into the body's tissues. Written aftercare information should be provid ed to reinforce verbal advice. The procedure site should not be handled by the client for four days, but must be checked at least twice daily by the client. When checking t he site, hands should be clean and care should be taken not to cough over the site . If the client has been advised to turn a piece of jewellery, it should be han dled as little as possible, using a clean tissue to touch the jewellery. When salt water is recommended for use to clean a site, i t should have been boiled and allowed to cool before use. Sterile salt water (e .g. Normasol) can be bought from chemists for this purpose. If any of the following signs or symptoms are seen, urge nt medical attention should be sought: Redness spreading around the site and extending away f rom it; Pus or green / yellow fluid oozing; Bleeding that is not controlled by light pressure; Pain (rather than discomfort); Swelling; Heat; Immobility of, or reluctance to move, a limb / digit / part of the body. The procedure site should be kept clean and dry to promo te healing. It is usual for there to be some oozing from the site, which should be kept covered by a sterile, waterproof dressing to prevent potentially harmful mi cro-organisms getting into the body. For body piercing, it is difficult to estimate the expe cted healing times since individuals heal at different times. Clients should be advised about healing times, which may be prolonged because of the time it takes for the jewellery \"tunnel\" to become dry and healed after the initial tissue damage. The US Association of Professional Piercer's indicate the f ollowing possible healing times: Part of body Healing time Ear lobe, eyebrow, nasal septum 6 - 8 weeks Ear (cartilaginous region), nostril 2 months - 1 year Tongue 4 - 6 weeks Lips, cheeks 6 - 12 weeks Genitalia including inner labia, clitoral hood 4 - 12 weeks Nipple, scrotum, outer labia 2 - 6 months Navel, ampallang (transverse penile piercing) 4 months - 1 year 21 APPENDIX 2 USE OF LOCAL ANAESTHETIC AGENTS The use of ethyl chloride spray to \"freeze\" the skin bef ore a procedure is not recommended. If left on the skin for too long, ethyl chloride has the same effect as frost-bite, damaging the skin and increasing the risk of i nfection at the site. In the United Kingdom, any medicinal product that is i njected becomes a \"Prescription Only Medicine\" which can only be administered by a qualified doctor or dentist. Certain topical application creams are Prescription Only Medicines, therefore they cannot be used unless the client's GP has prescribed it. If anyone other than a doctor or dentist prescribes such a cream, they are in brea ch of the Medicines Act 1968. Certain lignocaine-based creams and sprays can be used lega lly as a topical anaesthetic by the purchaser but they must not be injected. Anaesthesia to the tongue or to the mucous linings of th e mouth can only be given using a topical preparation licensed for use on the tong ue or in the mouth. Sprays should not be used in the mouth because of the risk of in halation of the spray (which may numb the respiratory tract and cause breathing prob lems) or accidental spraying of the eyes. 22 APPENDIX 3 HAND HYGIENE Hand washing is the most important intervention in the prevention of the spread of infection. A liquid anti-microbial soap is recommended for hand washing. The following protocol takes 15 - 30 seconds for normal hand washing, and 2 minutes for hand washing before a skin piercing procedure: Before washing your hands, wet them under running w ater and apply sufficient liquid soap to obtain a good lather [NB: \"dorsum\" means back of the hand]. After washing your hands, rinse them under running wat er to remove all the germs loosened during hand washing, then dry your hands thor oughly on paper towels, ideally from a wall mounted towel dispenser. 23 Hand washing must be done at the following times: Before and after carrying out a skin piercing procedure ; Before and after eating and drinking; After using the toilet; After smoking; After accidental contamination of hands with body flui ds; If hands are visibly dirty; Before putting on gloves at the start of a procedure; After taking off gloves and apron at the end of a pr ocedure; If gloves are removed during a procedure (e.g. to ge t more equipment) hands must be washed then, and again before putting on a new pair of gloves to resume the procedure. The wearing of wrist watches or wrist bands is not advised while carrying out skin piercing procedures because it is not possible to wash the h ands thoroughly up to the wrists.

If rapid protection is not required, this consists of three injections given over a period of six months, at 0,1 and six mont hs with a blood test to check levels one to four months after the completion of the primary course. If rapid protection is required, hepatitis B vaccination consists of three injecti ons given at 0, 1 and 2 months with a fourth dose and blood test at 12 months. The DH now recommends that all individuals at continuin g risk of hepatitis B infection should have a booster five years after the primary cour se. There is no need for a blood test at this time. Antibody responses to hepatitis B vaccine should be checked o ne to four months after completion of the primary course or, if the schedu le to provide rapid protection is given, when the 12 month booster is given. Individua ls should discuss the implications of the antibody titre levels with their G P; these levels inform you whether or not you are protected against hepatitis B. A hepatitis B booster may be recommended after exposure to the hepatitis B virus (e.g. sharps' injury). Hepatitis B vaccination can be organised through your GP , who may refer to you to another GP. You may have to pay for the vaccination, however if you are employed, your employer should pay for it. Keep a record of the dates of vaccination and the result s of future tests to check whether or not you have an adequate level of protect ion against hepatitis B and whether or not a booster is needed (this will be indica ted on the test reports to your GP). There are currently no vaccines available against hepati tis C or HIV. TETANUS VACCINATION All individuals handling sharps are advised to ensure th ey are up-to-date with tetanus vaccinations. Your GP will be able tell you whether o r not you are fully protected against tetanus. "}
