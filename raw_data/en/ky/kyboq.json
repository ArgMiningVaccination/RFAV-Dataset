RIGHT OF ACCESS Each student has a right of access to his or her education records, except financial records of the student's parents and confidential letters of recommendation received prior to January 1, 1975. However, a student may waive these rights of access in three areas: - Admissions to any educational institution - Job placement - Receipt of honors and awards The University will not require waivers as a condition for admission or receipt of financial aid or any service or benefit normally provided to students. If the student chooses to waive his or her right of access, he or she will be notified, upon request, of the names of all persons making confidential recommendations. Recommendations will be used only for the purpose for which they were specifically intended. A waiver may be revoked in writing at any time, and the revocation will apply to all subsequent recommendations. TYPES AND LOCATIONS OF EDUCATION RECORDS - Academic: Registrar's Office, Dreier Building - Disciplinary: Department of Student Life, Dreier Building - Financial: Financial Aid Office, Dreier Building - Admission: Office of Admissions (For a limited time, records are transferred to the Registrar's Office upon enrollment.), Dreier Building ACCESSING RECORDS Requests for access to the records to be inspected should be made in writing, specifying the records requested, to the Office of the Registrar. The University will comply with a request within 45 days. Arrangements will be made for the student to read his or her records in the presence of a staff member. As outlined by the Act, students may not inspect and review the following: financial information submitted by their parents; confidential letters and recommendations associated with admissions, employment or job placement, honors to which they have waived their rights of inspection and review; or education records containing information about more than one student (the institution will permit access only to that part of the record which pertains to the inquiring student).

REQUESTS TO AMEND RECORDS, AND APPEALS Any student who believes that information contained in his or her education record is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of his or her privacy or other rights may request that the University official responsible for maintaining the record amend it. The official will decide whether to amend the education record of the student in accordance with the request within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the request. If the decision of the University official is to refuse to amend the education record of the student in accordance with the request, the student will be informed of the refusal and of his or her right to a hearing. The student's request for a formal hearing must be made in writing to the appropriate department head who, within a reasonable period of time after receiving the request, will inform the student of the date, place and time of the hearing. Students may present evidence relevant to the issues raised and may be assisted or represented at the hearing by a person of their choice. The hearing officer who will adjudicate such challenges will be designated by the department head, and will be someone having no direct interest in the outcome. The decision from the hearing will be final. The education records will be corrected or amended, if necessary, in accordance with the decision of the hearing officer. If the decision of the hearing officer is that the information is not inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, and the student disagrees with this decision, the student shall have the right to place in the education records a statement of reasonable length relating to the specific part of the student's education records which was challenged at the hearing setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the University.
