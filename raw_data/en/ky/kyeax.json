Click here to register today!Dakota Wellness Program JANUARY 2023 Goal Setting As we head into the New Year, we all start to think about what our New Year's resolutions might be. Are we going to eat more fruits and veggies? Be more active? Finally implement that new program at work? When setting goals, we often think about a long- term goal that seems so far in the distance. It can become stressful and overwhelming - who needs more stress in their life, right? We don't always think about the journey of how we are going to get there and the steps it requires. Having long-term goals is important, but we also need to back up a bit and focus on \"hopping over puddles\" instead of trying to \"hop over oceans.\" Set small, SMART goals that you can build on over time to boost self-confidence. This allows you to celebrate the small wins along the way, which can increase motivation. If you are a chronic New Year's resolution-setter, try setting a different goal for each month of the year. Let's look at what goes into creating a SMART goal. - Specific. What exactly are you trying to achieve? - Measurable. Be sure you can clearly measure the success of your goal. - Attainable/Achievable. Set goals you know you can achieve and are realistic. - Relevant. Set goals that are in line with your values and long-term goals. - Time-bound. Give yourself a timeline. Tip: When setting goals, try to focus on what you can include, rather than what you can exclude from your routine. Happy goal setting! Book Club The Desire Map: A guide to creating goal with soul by Danielle LaPorte Your bucket list. Quarterly objectives. Strategic plans. Big dreams. Goals. Lots of goals and plans to achieve those goals-no matter what. Except ... You're not chasing the goal itself, you're actually chasing the feeling that you hope achieving that goal will give you. Which means we have the procedures of achievement upside down. We go after the stuff we want to have, get, or accomplish, and we hope that we'll be fulfilled when we get there. It's backwards. And it's burning us out. So, what if you first got clear on how you wanted to feel in your life, and then created some \"Goals with Soul\"? With The Desire Map, Danielle LaPorte brings you a holistic life-planning tool that will revolutionize the way you go after what you want in life. Unapologetically passionate and with plenty of warm wit, LaPorte turns the concept of ambition inside out and offers an inspired, refreshingly practical workbook for using the Desire Map process: Identify your \"core desired feelings\" in every life domain: livelihood & lifestyle, body & wellness, creativity & learning, relationships & society, and essence & spirituality. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1. Do you have any desires/goals that you feel guilty or shy about wanting? 2. What goals do you need to make space for in your life right now? 3. What is your relationship to goal setting before reading Desire Map? What is your relationship to goal setting now? Ask the Expert Registered Dietitian Question: How important is Vitamin D? Vitamin D can be especially beneficial in building bone by helping our bodies absorb calcium and phosphorus, reducing our risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis. Vitamin D can also help control infections and reduce inflammation. Sources of Vitamin D can come from food as well as exposure to sunshine. However, in the Midwest, we are at a higher risk for Vitamin D deficiency. Some foods that are high in Vitamin D include fatty fish (salmon and tuna), orange juice fortified with Vitamin D, dairy and plant milks fortified with Vitamin D, egg yolks, and Vitamin D fortified cereals. Increase absorption of Vitamin D by consuming calcium. Foods high in calcium include dairy products, soybeans, dark, leafy green vegetables and calcium fortified cereals. If you are not able to get enough nutrients through your dietary intake, consult with your medical provider about supplementation. 2023 Dakota Wellness Program With a new year comes the opportunity to earn up to $250 in rewards for employees and spouses ($500 per household) with Sanford Health Plan and NDPERS insurance coverage.

By incorporating different colors of fruits and vegetables, you are actually consuming a wider variety of nutrients. This is critical in insuring our bodies' processes are running as efficiently as possible. Here are what the different colors of nutrients can provide: Red fruits and vegetables are high in Vitamin C, Vitamin A, potassium, and antioxidants - Great for heart health. Yellow/Orange fruits and vegetables can improve vision and enhance the immune system. Green produce can be high in potassium and Vitamin K which aids in the blood clotting process. They are also high in fiber and additionally can help with vision and bone density. Blue/Purple fruits and vegetables are packed with antioxidants, can boost urinary tract health, memory health and promote aging. White produce is good for the heart and can help control cholesterol levels.The information in this newsletter should not be considered medical advice and is not a substitute for individual patient care and treatment decisions. 272-276-905 Rev. 11/22 Follow us on Facebook!
