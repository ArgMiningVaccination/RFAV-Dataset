What factors impact attitudes toward or adherence to COVID -19 public health guidelines, including hand hygiene, wearing of face coverings, and physical distancing? 2. What interventions can create more positive attitudes toward following public health guidelines with the goal of i ncreasing guideline adherence? Key Messages from the Evidence Summary Studies consistently show higher adherence to COVID -19 guidelines among people who (i) trust government or authorities; (ii) perceive the threat of the virus to be greater; (iii) have a greater knowledge of the pandemic, (iv) who are older; and (v) who identify as a woman. Accessing information through traditional news media (print; television; radio) is associated with greater guideline adherence, while use of social media is associated with a higher likelihood of endorsing conspiracy beliefs , factual misperceptions and lesser degrees of guideline adherence. Limited evidence suggests that distinct population groups may require distinct messaging to promote guideline adherence. No strategies for promoting adherence to public health COVID -19 guidelines have been robustly proven in the published scientific literature. The most promising strategies appear to be communications to increase knowledge about the pandemic and perceived threat of the virus. Moralistic messaging (e.g. linking physical distancing to being a good person /citizen ) could produce problematic consequences such as ostracization of individuals who do not adhere to public health guidelines . As evidence on changing at titudes and behaviours related to COVID -19 is still emerging, medical and public health leaders may benefit from reviewing literature on attitude and behavio ur change in other, more widely studied health and societal contexts (e.g., climate change, waste reduction, vaccination or smoking cessation) where theories and frameworks have been established . Context COVID -19 case numbers are trending upward in Alberta. Albertans demonstrate low er COVID -19 public health guideline compliance compared to populations in some other Canadian jurisdictions (see Underschultz et al. 2020 for comparison to Ontario). These questions stem from the desire of medical and public health leaders within Alberta to enhance adherence to public health guidelines through interventions such as public messaging and social marketing. Writers and reviewers are aware that attitudes are only one of many factors known to impact individual health behavior. These questions focus on attitudes as they are linked to behavior and may be amenable to change through public messaging campaigns marketing. It is assumed that marketing acts to change attitudes. Findings of this review could be useful for promotion of an eventual COVID -19 vaccine. COVID -19 Guideline Following 2 Comm ittee Discussion The committee did reach consensus on the recommendations. The committee felt that although evidence was limited, there is utility in s ummarizing the literature that has been published in this area and suggested expansion of this section in the review . Other comments and considerations from the committee included an interest in public health messaging which is logically tailored to reach specific populations . The committee also noted the importance of engaging community members/partners in developing messaging, and that reported literature provides no information about approaches for important groups within Alberta such as First Nations , which is identified as a research gap. Ongoing assessment of public information needs, attitudes and barriers to guideline compliance was felt to be important . Recommendations 1. Public health messaging should aim to improve general knowledge of the COVID -19 pandemic, and in particular, focus on (i) the threat posed by the virus and (ii) the efficacy of public health guidelines to mitigate risk. Rationale: Those with limited knowledge of the pandemic, those who felt that COVID -19 posed a low risk, and those who were unconvinced of the efficacy of public health guidelines were more likely to exhibit consistently poor adherence. 2. Public health messaging sh ould be designed to target groups of individuals at higher risk of non- adherence with COVID -19 guidelines . Broadly, t his group currently includ es men, younger people, those who identify as politically conservative, and those who are prone to lower levels of t rust in government or science. Rationale: Certain groups have been found to be at higher risk of non- adherence than others . Those listed above had the most consistently poor adherence and the most negative attitudes about public health guidelines . 3. Public health content should be designed for distribution on multiple platforms, incl uding social media and traditional media (including television, radio, and via web- based sources). Messaging might incorporate encouragement to critically assess the accur acy of information before disseminating it on social media platforms. Rationale: Multiple studies found that social media users were less likely to be adherent to public health guidelines , highlighting an opportunity for improvement. Traditional t elevision , radio and newspaper, web-based traditional media , and social media channels were noted to be important media sources for conveying public health messaging. 4. Government and p ublic health officials should attempt to create an environment that enabl es adherence with public health guidelines by identifying and encouraging measures to address systemic and structural barriers to adherence guidelines (i. e. mask distribution, supportive work /school environments , etc.) Rationale: Although this was not an explicit focus of the review, s everal studies reported that individuals' capacity to comply with public health guidelines was one of the major driving factors in determining adherence levels . Decades of behavioural science research stresses the imp ortance of addressing all the determinants of behaviour, rather than education/attitudes alone. COVID -19 Guideline Following 3 5. Rather than relying on the relatively nascent literature specific to COVID -19, in crafting public health messaging, officials should work with behavioral scien tists and experts in communication sciences and should seek guidance from a number of sources, including but not limited to resources such as : a. The broader social psychology literature and established frameworks for influencing behaviour change (e.g. the Be havior Change Wheel [Michie, Stralen and West 2011]). b. Other related public health campaigns which have more rigorous evidence (i.e. hand hygiene). c. Local community and public engagement activities that focus on groups of particular interest, whose voices ma y be underrepresented in broad population- level surveys. d. Their own jurisdictional data collection on public perceptions, which should: (i) be rigorously designed and follow guidelines for the appropriate conduct of survey -based research [Kelley et al 2003, Eysenbach 2004], and (ii) consider applying the recently released methodology presented by the World Health Organization specifically for conducting iterative behav ioural insights research on COVID -19 [WHO 2020a,b]. Rationale: Evidence supporting specific messaging and content to enable behaviour change COVID -19 is very limited. However, a robust field of literature exists in sociology and psychology regarding behavi our change in multiple health and social contexts. This evidence would likely provide more helpful conclusions than the sparse literature currently available related to COVID -19. Given the highly context -dependent nature of behavioural research, the genera lizability/transferability of the findings presented in this review is questionable. There is a need for locally relevant high- quality research to further inform public health action. Strength of Evidence Evidence regarding attitudes and adherence to publi c health guidelines related to COVID -19, and interventions to support increased adherence, comes almost entirely from survey studies which use convenience samples . Of the studies reviewed, 14 relied on convenience samples, 14 relied on stratified convenience samples, 1 stratified its convenience sample after data collection and only 1 sampled systematically (see Appendix , Table A-3 for details). Some studies report measures of effect size (frequently without information on statistical significance) , while others present only correlation or regression coefficients. A further weakness of the literature is that factors impacting guidelines and outcomes assessed are inconsistently defined and reported from study to study. No literature on important population groups in Alberta such as First Nations or religious groups living in communal settings were identified at any stage of the review. Limitations of this review For survey studies to be valid, a major consideration is the representativeness of the sample. We have not formally assessed the representativeness of the sampling in the included studies. The volume of materials relevant to this review and diversity of approaches/concepts employed constrained the ability to perform a systematic quality appraisal in the required timeframe, though studies deemed of low quality after initial review were not included. Purely descriptive studies, commentaries, and convenience- sample studies with small numbers of participants (n=<1000) were excluded. The 1000 participant threshold was chosen to reduce the number of included sources to a number that could be managed in the rapid review timeframe, while excluding small studies. E xcluding all convenience- sample studies would have resulted in an empty review . The quality of statistical analysis reported within studies was not assessed (e.g. properly control ling for collinearity). As described in the Appendix, only articles from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand were included in this review in order to derive information from jurisdictions that are somewhat similar to Alberta. Data extraction was completed by only one person for each article and was not systematically checked. Factors reported in only one or two studies are not included in this review (but appear in Appendix Table A-4). COVID -19 Guideline Following 4 Attitudes are only one factor impacting behaviou r (other factors , such as capabili ty and opportunities , are much more extrinsic in nature) ; however, factors impacting attitudes and behaviou r are not distinguished in this review. Many studies distinguish factors impacting different behaviors (e.g. , factors impacting hand washing may differ from factors impacting mask wearing or physical distancing). This nuance is not presented in this review. Some studies report that adherence to guidelines was related to intrinsic psychological characteristics of individuals, such as narcissism, impulsiveness and agreeableness. Other articles focused on characteristics of societies such as relative individualism or collectivism. This review does not focus on such psychological traits and societal characteristics a s these are potentially less modif iable than other factors, from a public health perspective. Summary of Evidence 1. What factors impact attitudes toward or adherence to COVID -19 public health guidelines, including hand hygiene, wearing of face coverings, and physical distancing? Table 1 lists factors impacting attitudes toward COVID -19 guidelines and adherence to those guidelines, and the strength of evidence available in the literature. Factors were grouped thematically by the writer and data extractors. Table 1. Factors identified in primary sources . Factor Number of Studies Strength of Association * Consistency of Association ** Explanation Trust or confidence in government or authorities (including response to COVID -19) 14 Moderate Moderate Greater trust in government or authority predicts greater compliance. One study reported no statistical relationship. Age 13 Weak Moderate Some sign of a link between older age and more compliance. Three studies report no statistical relationship. Sex or gender 13 Moderate Moderate Studies show a link between being female and compliance. Three studies show no significant effects. Education 11 Weak High Some indication of a link between higher education and more compliance. Four studies report no significant results. Perceiving COVID -19 as a threat 9 Weak Strong Studies show a link perceiving COVID -19 as a risk to self or others and more compliance. All studies found significant results on at least some measures. Knowledge about pandemic or p ublic health guidelines 8 Weak Moderate Being knowledgeable or feeling informed was related to greater compliance. One study showed no significant effect. Politics 6 Not reported in any study Moderate Consistent reports of greater political conservativism being linked to less COVID -19 Guideline Following 5 Factor Number of Studies Strength of Association * Consistency of Association ** Explanation compliance. One study found no significant results. Socio -economic status 6 Weak Moderate Some sign of a link between higher income and more compliance. Two studies report no stat istical relationship. Belief in conspiracy theories 5 High (one study) Strong Believing conspiracy theories about COVID -19 is associated with less compliance for most behaviors. Primary media source 5 Weak Strong Using traditional media is linked to more compliance while social media is linked to less compliance. Trust in others 5 Mixed Not Consistent Trusting others had mixed effects on guideline compliance. Race or ethnicity 4 Mixed Not Consistent Compliance not associated with particular racial groups across studies. Capacity to comply 4 Moderate (one study) Strong Ability to follow guidelines (e.g. working from home, avoiding large events, space in home to isolate when ill) is linked to compliance. Perceived effectiveness of protective behaviors recommended in p ublic health guidelines 4 Moderate Strong Perceiving protective behaviors as effective linked to more compliance. Trust in science , scientists or medicine 4 Moderate Moderate One study found no significant results on most measures. NOTES: *Cutoffs for measures of association are derived from Chen, Cohen & Chen (2010) and are reconciled with the potential clinical importance by the following terms and cutoff points: (not signifi cant (n.s.)), weak strength associations Cohen's or OR <1.68 (inverse >0.59) ; OR>3.47 (inverse <0.28) or HR/RR >2.5). When directions of effect vary the association has been reported as mixed. When effect size is not reported only direction is noted. When statistical significance is not reported the result is not included in assessing strength of association. **Consistency of association is determined as follows: High consistency (>80% of relevant studies show an association of similar strength in the same direction); moderate consistency (>50% relevant studies show an associa tion in the same direction); low consistency ( 50% of relevant studies show no effect) ; not consistent (directions of effect vary) Extracted data is organized by factor in the Appendix , Table 4. Two identified factors which need further contextual explanation are discussed below. Political Polarization Two Canadian studies link ed political affiliation to COVID -19 attitudes and behaviours. Pickup et al. (2020) conducted a large survey of almost 10,000 Canadians and weighted results to match Canada's demographics. COVID -19 Guideline Following 6 They report that supporters of the Liberal Party are more likely to be 'very concerned' about the virus (46%) than those who support the Conservative Party (39%), Bloc Quebecois (33%), and People's Party of Canada (PPC) (29%) . Supporters of the Liberal, Green, and New Democratic Parties were slightly more likely to report making behavior changes (making 63% of recommended changes , on average) than supporters of the Conservative Party (59% of changes) , PPC (51%), and Bloc Quebecois (60%). Pennycook et al. (2020) , in a pre- print survey based on a convenience sample of 644 Canadians and representative US and UK surveys (1,975 total respondents) , report that those who identify as conservative (calculated as the \" mean of social and economic liberal -conservatism \") believe more misperceptions, perceive lower COVID -19 risks, and make fewer behavior changes than those who identify as moderates or liberals. However, the authors caution that their data also showed that \" accurate beliefs about COVID -19 were broadly associated with the quality of one's reasoning [ability] regardless of political polarization. \" The Role of Media A nationally representative Canadian survey (n=2, 022) by Bridgman et al. (2020) reports that misperceptions about the virus were associated with lower adherence to public health guidelines even when controlling for other attitudes and demographic factors. They report that e xposure to traditional news media is associated with more accurate knowledge and better adherence to social distancing guidelines than exposure to social media sources . Exposure to social media is associated with a decrease in accuracy of knowledge and lower adherence to social distancing. Importantly, \"association between social media exposure and social distancing non- compliance is eliminated when accounting for effect of misperceptions, providing evidence that social media is associated with non-compliance through increasing misperceptions about the virus.\" A UK study by Allington et al. (2020) , relied on three surveys , of which the smallest had 949 convenience- sampled participants . Authors report a \"strong positive relationship between use of social media platforms as sources of knowledge about COVID -19 and holding one or more conspiracy beliefs.\" T he study also reports \"positive relationship between use of legacy [traditional] media as a source of knowledge about COVID -19 and following [public health guidelines] ; however, this effect was small and of borderline significance.\" A pre -print German survey of 1,575 members of the public and 128 experts by Rothmund et al. (2020) reports that consuming public television was strongly associated with the development of \"science- consistent evaluations\" of information and guideline adherence in the general population. However, this study does not report statistical significance. Seeking information online from sources other than social media may be associated with increased adherence. A survey conducted in the United States (n= 1,449) reports that \" Those who primarily get their news from radio or social media report slightly less social distancing, while those who primarily get their news from websites tend to report more. \" (Pederson and Favero 2020) . 2. What interventions can create more positive attitudes toward following guidelines with the goal of improving guideline adherence? Almost all the recommendations for promoting guidelines adherence from the literature are speculative. V ery few interventional studies or quasi -experimental studies have been published to date. Authors generally offer logical suggestions based on findings rather than evidence from tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviours. Emphasizing the perceived threat of the pandemic ( Folmer et al. 2020; De Neys et al. 2020) may be a means of promoting adherence to public health guidelines . This approach is supported by Folmer et al.'s (2020) Dutch survey of 2, 005 participants and De Neys et al.'s (2020) international survey of 1657. Promoting knowledge of the pandemic and public health guidelines is also a logical strategy given that eight studies found associations between knowledge and compliance (see Appendix , Table 4 for details) . COVID -19 Guideline Following 7 As evidence on changing attitudes and behaviors related to COVID -19 is still emerging, medical and pub lic health leaders may benefit from reviewing evidence on attitude and behaviou r change from more widely studied health and societal contexts (e.g., climate change, waste reduction, vaccination or smoking cessation) where theories and frameworks have been established. Details on information sources, recommended messaging, and messaging targeted to specific subpopulations is summarized below from included studies . Sources of Information Yousuf et al. (2020) conducted an uncontrolled experimental study using convenience samples ( n=16,072 [diagnostic survey ] and n=17,189 [post-campaign survey ]) in the Netherlands . They report that a targeted video campaign featuring a 22- year-old male social influencer, and news paper article with infographics , improved handwashing practices by 27% . The campaign was based on social norm theory and aimed at influencing how the public believes people generally do behave and should behave. Content of Messaging Pennycook et al. (2020) argue that \" nudging people to slow down and deliberate before making judgments about accuracy [of information] or sharing on social media could be an effective strategy in the fight against misinformation\" about COVID -19. Everett et al. (2020) report an experimental study using a stratified convenience sample (n= 1,032). They found that messages stressing duty to wash one's hands (i.e., we are obliged to wash our hands for the sake of others) were more impactful than messages stressing that hand washing is virtuous (i.e., hand washing helps you be your best self) . Significant effects of message type were not observed for physical distancing behaviours . A survey from Mexico of 1,022 people found that \"Individuals exposed to more accurate reporting of deaths were more likely to adopt mitigating behaviours sooner and comply with social distancing guidelines than those exposed to 'lagged' data\" (Gutierrez et al. 2020) . De Neys et al. (2020) found that physical distancing behavio ur is linked to perceived threat of the virus. They therefore argue that moral messaging may unproductively shame individuals and that efforts to increase the perceived threat of the virus may be a more effective strateg y to induce adherence to guidelines. Messaging Targeted to Specific Subpopulations Rothmund et al. (2020) , in the preprint mentioned above, differentiate between those who do not follow public health guidelines because they overestimate their knowledge of COVID -19 and those who rate their knowledge on the topic as low. The authors suggest that this latter group is a more promising target for interventions intended to promote guideline adherence. Research Gaps This review highlighted the fact that the literature in this area is of relatively low quality. There is a considerably high risk of bias in many of the studies, often due to concerns about non- rigorous methods of sampling as well as collinearity and residual confounding. In general, the literature would be strengthened by closer ties to theoretical understandings of behavioural determinants from psychology and sociology. A number of important areas remain relatively under explored, including: the impact/role of regulations such as mandatory masking laws and other practical measures ; impact of tailoring specific messaging to particular subgroups of the population; as well as factors influencing particular groups of local interest (e.g. Hutterite populations, First Nations P eoples, those experiencing homelessness). COVID -19 Guideline Following 8 Evolving Evidence Eleven of the included studies are preprints. It is likely that s ome of these studies will not be accepted for publication . Other studies will continue to emerge.

Critical Evaluation of the Evidence Potential artic les were evaluated on three criteria: 1) Peer reviewed or from a reputable source; 2) Clear research question or issue; 3) Whether the presented data/evidence is appropriate to address the research question. Preprints and non peer -reviewed literature (such as commentaries and letters from credible journals) are not excluded out of hand due to the novelty of COVID -19 and the speed with which new evidence is available. COVID -19 Guideline Following 11 Table A-2 is a narrative summary of the body of evidence included in this review. The categories and format were adapted from the Oxford Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine, the Cochrane Library, and the AGREE Trust Gavinder & al., 2020; Brouwers et al., 2010). Table 2. Narrative overview of the literature included in this review. Description Volume 30 studies are included. 2 were experimental, one was a media and 27 were cross - sectional or longitudinal surveys. Quality 11 of the included studies were preprints. Article quality has not been otherwise assessed. For survey studies, a major consideration is the representativeness of the sample. Where studies have not relied on a randomized sample, or engaged in other techniques to account for sampling error, results are at high ris k of bias. Most studies are point -in-time studies, and do not account for change in drivers of attitudes and behaviours over time. A factor that prompted adherence to guidelines in March may not have the same impact in September. Applicability \"Western\" countries have been included to collect information that is more likely to be applicable to Alberta. I ncluded countries vary greatly in their popular cultures and social norms. Consequential diversity may also be found between regions within Canada. Consistency Strengths of associations summarized in this review range from low to strong depending on the factor under consideration. Varied strategies are recommended for efforts to improve adherence to guidelines. Methods References Brouwers, M. C., Kho, M. E., Browman, G. P., Burgers, J.
