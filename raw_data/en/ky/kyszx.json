Services Acupuncture Acupuncture uses fine, sterile needles applied to specific areas of the body to stimulate energy flow. It can help reduce stress and relieve symptoms and side effects related to cancer treatment such as anxiety, nausea, dry mouth and fatigue. Acupressure involves applying gentle pressure to these same points with the hands. The acupuncturist will work with you and your care team to decide if acupuncture or acupressure could be beneficial for you. Available in many outpatient clinical areas, in a group setting, or as a fee-for-service outpatient service.
