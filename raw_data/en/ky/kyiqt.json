The Brauer Institute equips you with the knowledge to maintain a high level of physical and psychological wellness. Preventative medicine is the key to your well-being and thriving during times of stress. My career in Holistic Medicine in the US began at the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 1998. I had the great priviledge to work on the team of [Dr. David Servan-Schreiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Servan-Schreiber) for four years and specialized in teaching guided meditation for cancer care. Systematic evaluations of my classes were conducted and students who completed my courses experienced the following benefits: - 75% improved sleep - 74% reported decreased pain - 82% improved concentration and energy level - 92% decreased anxiety - 100% improved well-being and ability to cope with stress Begin Your Healing Journey Today I invite you to begin your healing journey today and practice daily the Cancer Caring Healing Meditation Protocol, which I recommend to all patients and their support networks. Medicine and Meditation I would like to bring your awareness to a different perception of reality and the importance for your healing journey. In ancient times Medicine and Meditation were closely connected together. In Latin, the words Medicine and Meditation have the same roots! The Latin 'mederi' means to find the right measure or the right balance. And the Latin 'meditari' means to let go or to let happen. Both are important considerations for health and healing ... especially since our Western thinking teaches us to be in control, to achieve, and to make things happen. We are conditioned to always be in charge. The true origin of the Latin roots for Medicine and Meditation teach us that it is equally important to let go and give up control. Healing and Relaxation For me, as a Hebrew speaker, I know that the root of the words Breath and Soul is the same. Conscious Breath Work is, of course, an important part of meditation. In Hebrew, Breath is 'neshima' and Soul is 'neshama' . Also Healing and Relaxation share the same root: 'ripui' and 'rafui' . Our ancestors knew about these important connections. What is missing? Every language has its uniqueness and specific idioms which you can not find in any other language. Certain expressions clearly illuminate the difference in thinking. In America, when you go to your doctor, he or she will ask, \"What is wrong with you?\" In Germany, your doctor will ask,\"What is missing?\" (Was fehlt Ihnen?) Please take a moment and reflect upon these two approaches. You may breathe into your abdomen and invite the answers to come. You may write your insights in a journal. Which one of these two questions makes you feel better? Cancer Caring Healing Meditation Protocol Please start every morning with the 2-minute Evolving Consciousness Statements. Set a positive intention for the day. [https://youtu.be/y7g23o0tfAw](https://youtu.be/y7g23o0tfAw) Write your Happiness Journal Every single student I saw at UPMC had to write a happiness journal. Every day, take the time to write down a few happy memories. It can be as simple as a memory of watching a beautiful sunset, seeing a pretty flower in bloom, or the big ones, e.g. weddings, the birth of a child, etc. The most important factor is consistency. Do this every day! Scientific Research has shown that focusing on happy moments increases your immune system health. It's that easy. Wouldn't you want to have a stronger immune system? In addition, your Happiness Journal can be your resource in difficult times. Just sit for 10 minutes every day and recall the smiles, the light, the joy, the happiness. Dwell in your happy moments, feel them as if they were happening right now and you will begin to feel a shift. And yes, even if times are tough, you are allowed to focus on happiness and well-being.
