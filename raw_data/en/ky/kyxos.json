With the longer daylight hours, the warming temperatures and the sprouting greens, it is the natural and appropriate time of the year for our bodies to eliminate the excesses of winter. I recommend everyone to incorporate a detoxification protocol into their wellness practice for two reasons: One, our world is increasingly toxic with approximately 80,000 chemicals on the market that we are exposed to via our food, water, air and products. Two, our food no longer provides the same level of nutrients that our bodies need in order to disarm all of these added toxins. So we may be running on a deficit. Therefore, the more we support our body's detoxification pathways (the liver, skin, kidneys, etc.) the more we are supporting our body to function optimally. If detoxing is a new concept to you, please note: Detoxing the body doesn't necessarily mean going on a juice fast! In fact, there are many essential nutrients required by the liver to detoxify the body. Consider increasing these nutrients in your diet to support your body's detoxification pathways: 1. Protein The liver requires good quality protein to disarm toxins that enter the body. If you're on a plant-based diet, opt for whole grains, legumes, hemp or pea-based protein powder, and organic soy products. If you incorporate meat into your diet, select ethically-caught wild salmon, SPCA-certified eggs or pasture-raised, grass fed meats. 2. Cruciferous vegetables The liver also requires nutrients from cruciferous vegetables to support detoxification. Cruciferous vegetables include brussel sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and kale. There are lots of delicious ways to use these veggies, such as in a stir fry or by roasting them in the oven. You can even chop them finely and add them raw to salads. 3. Leafy greens Chlorophyll is responsible for giving leafy greens their dark green colour. It is also a blood cleanser. Dark leafy greens include lettuce, spinach, kale, gai lan, and herbs like cilantro, parsley, dill and mint. Add leafy greens to your salads, smoothies, curries and stews. 4. Curcumin Curcumin is a phytonutrient found in turmeric and is also key in supporting the liver's detoxification pathways. Fresh turmeric can be added to curries, stir frys, roasted vegetables, soups and salad dressings. You can even add a pinch to smoothies and herbal teas! I recommend purchasing fresh turmeric (just be careful as it stains all things yellow!) and mincing or grating it into your dishes - starting with a little bit and adjusting to your taste.
