One of our main techniques is called the Neuro Impulse Protocol, or NIP for short. It was developed by a distinguished chiropractor in Australia (Dr Neil Davis*) alongside his team of clinicians. I discovered this technique during my final year of studies at university, and when I met Dr Davis shorty afterward, it hit me like a lightning bolt just how powerful precise neurological-based chiropractic can be. What makes NIP different to regular chiropractic? Within chiropractic that are at least 200 different techniques, all of which work in their own way. Most techniques are orientated in two predominant ways, a structural approach or a neurological approach. The structural approach has a strong mechanical influence, with the idea of using force to mechanically influence the body, either moving bones or manipulating muscles. The neurological approach, also referred to as tonal, is orientated to influencing how the nervous system controls the body. Since the joints and muscles are coordinated by the nervous system, this represents a deeper and more profound way to influence the body, according to the approach used in the Neuro Impulse Protocol. How does Neuro Impulse protocol (NIP) work? The basis of NIP is having a very thorough and precise assessment protocol that can analyse the body is several ways, use the findings of the protocol to identify the exact structures involved, and having the ability to accurately post-check after the adjustment (the treatment). It is important that we can objectively measure dysfunction, perform the treatment, and immediately re-check the body and measure the changes. This is vital because we want to be able to see objective changes in the body, not just rely on the subjective changes like levels of pain. When we see improvements that are measurable, we can be sure you are on the right track and can expect the pain and discomfort to improve too. The main functions that we test for and measure are the movement quality of the joints, the quality of the muscle function, and some neurological tests such as reflexes, how the eyes track, and some postural related outcomes. For instance are the legs balanced and equal, or is one leg longer than the other? Is the pelvis level on both sides, is one shoulder higher than the other, and is the head straight, or does it tilt to one side or protrude forward? These all tell us important information that we can measure and recheck after the treatment. Assessing the body NIP uses a very precise and detailed assessment protocol to pinpoint the patterns of dysfunction. One of the most important elements is assessing the neck, shoulder and low back movement to find restrictions in the joints. The knee bone is connected to the hip bone... One common belief many people have is that the problem is coming from the painful area. Whilst this is partially true, it is not the whole picture, and many issues won't resolve sufficiently if you only address the site of pain. This is because in the body everything is connected and interrelated, especially in the spine. For example, if the pelvis is restricted, in many people it will negatively affect how the hips move, how the neck and shoulders move, and how the head is balanced on the neck. You can quickly see how one issue, let's call it the primary problem, can cause a multitude of secondary or compensatory issues in the body. NIP allows us to measure these findings and pinpoint what and where the primary problem likely is. In this way we can avoid treating many of the compensatory issues that ultimately won't resolve the problem. Most patterns that we will treat are in the joints, particularly in the pelvis and lower back, and at the top of the neck. These areas are more susceptible to restriction because of their location, how they move and how they transfer weight. Sometimes the dysfunction is related to the skull, ligaments, muscles or tendons. Precision is key Using a precise approach in this way, it is possible to make immediate changes to how the body functions, for instance how well the neck can move, how tight the muscles are across the shoulders and pelvis, how well the muscles can activate against pressure, and how balanced the global posture is. Remember, our goal is to make real changes to how your body functions and performs, not simply manipulate the site of pain. Healing is like peeling an onion Another advantage of having a protocol such as NIP is it can tell us where and when to treat. When the testing reveals the issue is in the pelvis for instance, after the adjustment the body will change and lead us to the next pattern. There will be improvement in our objective measures, but now the testing will lead us to the next area we need to address. So the process is like peeling away the layers of an onion. As we address these patterns successfully, the dysfunctions lessen until no or very little dysfunction remains (meaning we want to achieve the best function that your body is capable of). So the restricted and tight movement in the neck and back will resolve, the posture will become more balanced as a result, and your body will be able to move more freely and without pain. Is NIP suitable for me? Our experience is that NIP is suitable for almost everyone. The treatment is gentle so it can be tolerated at all ages, and there is no need to get into difficult or awkward positions. If our assessment shows that NIP is unlikely to help, we can use other techniques that maybe suitable, or refer you to an appropriate therapist that we feel would be better suited to address your needs. *The term Dr in an honorary title used in chiropractic and does not refer to being a medical doctor.
