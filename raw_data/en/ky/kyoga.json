Preparing these documents when you are in good health and keeping them on hand, ready for any emergency, is a smart choice and easy to accomplish. Learn more at www.health.ny.gov. Healthcare Proxy We'll ask you to appoint someone you trust to make health decisions for you in case you are unable to make those decisions yourself. A healthcare proxy lets you appoint a healthcare agent and clearly define the decisions you would prefer your agent to make in the event you become incapacitated and unable to direct your own care. The healthcare proxy also offers you the option of defining any organ or other anatomical donation you may wish to make. Psychiatric Healthcare Proxy information can be provided at your request. Living Will A living will allows you to leave written instructions that explain your healthcare wishes about end -of-life care. If you do not wish to consult an attorney, you can fill out a standard living will form which, when properly witnessed, is legally binding in New York State. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order At your request, a DNR order may be included in your medical record. It instructs the medical staff not to try to revive you if your breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This means that doctors, nurses and other healthcare practitioners will not initiate such emergency procedures as mouth -to-mouth resuscitation, external chest compression, electric shock, insertion of a tube to open your airway, injection of medication into your heart, or open your chest. Do Not Intubate (DNI) If you and your physician have decided to order DNR, medical orders for life -sustaining treatment may also govern the decision to insert a breathing tube under situations that require artificial mechanical support of breathing (ventilation). Placing a tube into the windpipe is a therapeutic maneuver that may be performed before breathing and circulation has ceased. Please discuss with your physician if you wish an order to be written not to perform endotracheal intubation (DNI). Medical Orders For Life -Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) The MOLST form is one way of documenting a patient's treatment preferences concerning life-sustaining treatment. Under New York State law, the MOLST form is the only authorized form in New York State for documenting both hospital and nonhospital DNR and DNI orders. In addition, the form is beneficial to patients and providers as it provides specific medical orders and is recognized and used in a variety of health care settings. For more information, please visit www.health.ny.gov. 11 PAIN MANAGEMENT Pain relief is an important part of your healthcare, your recovery, and your comfort. Controlling pain can help you get well faster. Less pain will help you regain your strength more quickly and allow you to resume normal function sooner. Pain management is a way to recognize and treat discomfort associated with a diagnosis, disease, or treatment. Our healthcare team will work closely with you to achieve a desirable level of comfort. Patients' Pain Bill of Rights As a patient of SBELIH, you can expect: To receive information regarding pain and the management of pain. A concerned staff committed to pain management and control. Dedicated healthcare professionals who respond quickly to reports of pain. State -of-the-art pain management. Your expression of pain to be accepted and managed accordingly. Please use a number from the scale to describe your pain: 12 REQUESTING YOUR MEDICAL RECORD You will be assigned a medical record number that will be used for any future medical care you have as either an inpatient or outpatient at Stony Brook Eastern Long Island Hospital. The contents of your medical record are confidential and will not be released without your written authorization, with the exception of your primary care physician on record for follow up care. New York State law requires all healthcare practitioners and facilities to grant patients access to their own medical records (there are a few exceptions). Patients may request information, as may parents or guardians who have authorized their child's care. If you want to have a copy of your medical records, you must complete a Patient Request for Disclosure Form and submit to the Department of Health Information Management (HIM) at Stony Brook Eastern Long Island Hospital, 201 Manor Place, Greenport, NY 11944. For questions, call 631.477.5232. New York State law guarantees you the opportunity to inspect your medical records.

SBELIH will respond to a patient's request and provide the patient with access to their health information, or written notice of denial, within ten (10) days of receipt of the request. If Stony Brook Eastern Long Island Hospital fails to acknowledge or act on your request, you may complain to your local New York State Department of Health office. If you would like more information, please contact the New York State Department of Health at 300 Motor Parkway, Hauppauge, NY 11788 or (631) 231 -1880.

Safe patient care requires constant dedication and a commitment to excellence. Continued performance improvement processes help the CARE Team set goals and establish \"evidence based practices\" to promote a culture of safety. Evidence Based Practices are established protocols and procedures that ensure optimal care for every patient. These protocols and procedures have resulted in SBELIH lowering their incidence of hospital -acquired conditions such as urinary tract infections and central line associated bacteremias. I.D. Bracelets/Wristbands Wear your hospital I.D. bracelet at all times. If your bracelet comes off, ask your nurse to get you a new one. Check the information on your hospital I.D. bracelet to make sure that your name and date of birth are on it. Make sure staff members check your I.D. bracelet before any procedure, test, or medication is given. The Colors of Safety Along with many other hospitals in the United States, SBELIH participates in an initiative called The Colors of Safety. A patient may be given a colored wrist band that identifies a medical condition so that staff can quickly and accurately assist a patient if necessary. At SBELIH, the following colored bands are used: Red Bands: Allergies Purple Bands: Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Yellow Bands: High Risk for Fall Pink Bands: Restricted Extremity for Blood Pressure/Draw Safe Patient Handling Safe patient handling involves the use of assistive devices to ensure that patients can be mobilized safely and that care providers avoid performing high -risk manual patient handling tasks. Using the devices reduces a care provider's risk of injury and improves the safety and quality of patient care. The Safe Patient Handling Program at SBELIH utilizes proven methods and the latest specialized devices and equipment to keep patients and staff safe when they need to be moved and lifted. The most important assistive devices are the patient transfer devices that help care providers transfer patients from beds to stretchers or wheelchairs and can even help them walk. The lifting equipment uses slings or belts to hold patients securely. 15 YOUR SAFETY CONT. Electronic Medication Administration Record (EMAR) Where available, computerized technology is incorporated into daily care to prevent one of the most common medical mistakes: medication errors. With a scanning device that reads the bar code on the patient's ID band and the dispensed medication, information is recorded at the bedside, reinforcing the \"seven rights\" of medication administration: 1. The right medication 2. To the right person 3. The right dose 4. At the right time 5. The right route 6. For the right reason 7. With the right documentation Questions/Concerns Feel free to talk to your doctor and nurse about any concerns you may have. We welcome your questions. If you do not understand something, ask for a better explanation. You have the right to know. If you think of questions when your doctor or nurse is not present, write down your questions so that you can ask them at a later time. Your Treatment Plan Ask your doctor and nurse about your treatment plan. Make sure that you understand and agree with that plan. Ask a family member or friend to listen with you or take notes when a diagnosis, treatment plan, test result, or discharge plan is explained. This will help you remember the information later. Be informed about your treatments. Ask when the treatments will be given and what they are for. If equipment is used for your care, know what it is used for and what to expect. Question anything that seems unusual or different from what you were told. Your Medication Ask your nurse about your medicines - what they are, what they look like, what they do, when they are given, and what side effects they might have. If you do not recognize a medicine, verify that it is for you. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any allergies or have had previous reactions to any drugs, foods, or latex. Tell your doctor and nurse about all medicines you are taking, including vitamins, herbal remedies, and over -the-counter medicines. Do not take medicines that you brought into the hospital from home, unless told to do so by your doctor or hospital staff. 16 YOUR SAFETY CONT. Limiting Fall Risks Your hospital room is an unfamiliar environment, so please press the nurse call button for assistance with: Getting out of bed, especially at night Making your way to and from the bathroom Reaching objects placed on the bedside table Please also use the following tips to reduce your risk for fall: Ask your nurse to show you how to use the call button. Never allow visitors to assist you in getting out of bed or a chair. Always wear non -slip footwear with rubber treads when walking around. Learn how to adjust lighting and be sure the room is bright enough. If you wear glasses, keep them within reach. Use a cane or walker if needed. Make sure brakes are locked when standing from a wheelchair. Use the bathroom before bed to avoid getting up at night. Notify the nurse if a spill occurs on the floor. Always use the nurse call button to request assistance if: Your bed rails are up (do not attempt to put them down or climb over them). You feel weak, dizzy, or lightheaded. You cannot reach your cane or walker. Please notify the nursing staff of any information that you feel may help contribute to making every patient's stay as safe as possible. At Home Make sure you are clear about discharge instructions including medicines you need and information about a follow -up visit. Be sure you are given a phone number to call if you have questions. Talk with your doctors and pharmacist. Ask questions, and write down what they say. Infection Prevention The most important step to help stop the spread of infections is to wash your hands frequently for 15 seconds, especially after sneezing, coughing, using the bathroom and before eating. You can also use hand sanitizer as an effective method of killing germs on your hands. Staff will welcome your reminder to wash their hands or wear gloves before examining you or giving you your medicine. Practice good personal hygiene. Let your nurse know if your gown or linens are soiled. Get vaccinated, if it is recommended by your physician. Flu and pneumonia vaccines can help prevent illnesses in elderly and high -risk patients. 17 YOUR SAFETY CONT. Oral Hygiene & Proper Brushing More than 90% of all systemic diseases have oral manifestations. Proper brushing is essential for cleaning teeth and gums effectively, and it is critical to overall health and wellbeing. Oral health and general health are inseparable. To properly brush: 1. Place bristles along the gumline at a 45 -degree angle. Bristles should contact both the tooth surface and the gumline. 2. Gently brush the outer tooth surfaces of 2 -3 teeth using a back and forth rolling motion. Move brush to the next group of 2 -3 teeth and repeat. 3. Maintain a 45 -degree angle with bristles contacting the tooth surface and gumline. Gently brush using back, forth, and rolling motion along all of the inner tooth surfaces. 4. Tilt brush vertically behind teeth. Make several up and down strokes using the front half of the brush. 5. Place the brush against the biting surface of the teeth and use a gentle back and forth scrubbing motion. Use a toothbrush with soft, nylon round -ended bristles that will not scratch or irritate teeth or damage gums. Treat yourself to a new toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner if the bristles become worn or frayed. A hard, brittle brush can injure your gums. Remember, don't share your toothbrush with others, it can spread germs. 18 YOUR SAFETY CONT. Guide to Isolation \"Isolation\" means using special protective actions to prevent the spread of infectious agents (germs) in the hospital. The type of isolation you are on depends upon how the germs spread from person to person. The sign on the patient's door indicates if isolation is in use for that patient. If you have any other questions or concerns about isolation, please ask your nurse. Contact Isolation: Patients who are on contact isolation have infections that can be spread through direct person -to-person contact or from items in that patient's environment, because the patient has touched items in the environment. Staff members and visitors must clean hands and wear gloves and a cover gown at the patient's bedside, remove gown and gloves and wash hands or use the alcohol -based sanitizer when they leave the room. Droplet Isolation: Patients who need this isolation have infections that can be spread by coughing and sneezing droplets that carry infectious agents (germs). Everyone who enters the room must clean their hands prior to entering and as they leave the room. Everyone must wear a mask when they are in the room and remove the mask as they exit the room. Respiratory/Airborne Isolation: Patients who need this isolation have infections that can be spread through the air. They must stay in rooms with special air circulation and the door and windows must be kept closed. All persons who enter the room must clean their hands before entering and exiting the room and they must wear a mask when they are in the room. Patients may be asked to wear a mask if they need to leave the room for a test or procedure. 19 YOUR HOSPITAL BILL Your hospital bill includes a basic daily charge that covers your room, meals, routine nursing care and services for ancillary care such as x -rays, laboratory tests and medications, as well as operating fees. If you have insurance coverage, the hospital will bill your insurance company directly for covered services. However, those services not covered by insurance are the patient's responsibility, as well as any co -pays, co -insurance, or deductibles. SBELIH is a participating provider with many health plan networks. Some health plans use smaller networks for certain products they offer, so it is important to check with your insurance provider to verify they have a contract with SBELIH that includes your specific plan. You will receive a bill for any services not paid by your insurance company. The hospital depends upon your prompt payment to meet its financial obligations. Payment of these bills can be made at the Cashier's Office located near the ER entrance.

You should check with the physician arranging your hospital services to determine which plans that physician participates in.

Discharge planning is a service available to you, at no charge, while you are in the hospital to answer any questions you may have regarding post hospital care. Professional discharge planning staff will describe the alternatives available to you based on your medical condition, lifestyle, and financial situation. We will assist you and your family in exploring options and making the necessary arrangements for ongoing care. How will discharge planning help me? The first step involved in making the best possible decision regarding your post hospital care is asking the right questions. Listed below are answers to questions which may help guide you in making an informed decision. Why is it important to plan for post discharge care? We know what will happen from the time of hospital admission through convalescence. You and your family will feel reassured knowing how your needs will be met as you move from one level of care to another. How will I know what will be needed? In collaboration with your physician, professional discharge planning staff will assess your condition and recommend an individualized plan of care after your hospitalization. When should I begin to plan? Advanced planning can allow discharge planning staff to take the most effective steps for dealing with your needs. It is never too early to begin discharge planning. Discharge plans can be modified as your care needs change. Often it may take time to work out specific details of your specialized plan. The sooner you start to plan, the less you will feel under pressure. Planning early will enable you to make sound decisions and to involve those people closest to you. Why should I utilize Discharge Planning Services? If you are unsure which post hospital service you may require, it is best to confer with the professional discharge planning staff. Even if you believe that you know all of the options, be advised that service availability can change and may require extensive research and coordination on the part of the hospital staff. 25 DISCHARGE PLANNING CONT. What type of post hospital services are available? Services in the Home One of the hallmarks of a home care program is the ability to tailor specific services matched to an individual's needs. Home care services can comprise all or part of a comprehensive plan for managing healthcare needs at home. Long Term Home Health Care Program Also known as \"Nursing Home Without Walls,\" offers an alternative to those requiring placement in a residential healthcare facility. Certified Hospice Hospice is a philosophy of care for terminally ill patients and their families. Patients eligible for care under a federally certified hospice program must be receptive to a palliative care program and have a limited life expectancy. Licensed Home Care Agencies State licensed home care agencies generally offer ongoing skilled or paraprofessional services, i.e. nurse's aides and homemaker services, to provide shifts for continuous home care services. Residential Health Care Facilities Primarily designed to provide long -term medical attention and supervision for persons who cannot be maintained in the hospital or home. Adult Homes Adult homes provide a supervised environment for persons who do not require continual medical care. They also offer meals in a group setting, personal care and housekeeping services, as well as activities and socialization. Inpatient Rehabilitation Centers Rehabilitation facilities offer a comprehensive range of services aimed at restoring function for persons who have physically disabling conditions. Some of the therapeutic services offered are activities of daily living, prosthetic/orthotic services, and occupational, physical, and recreational therapy. 26 DISCHARGE PLANNING CONT. Additional Services The following programs may be considered for persons who require limited assistance in the home environment: Emergency Response Systems are an electronic device which enables high -risk individuals to secure immediate help through a central emergency station. Home Delivered Meals may be provided to relieve family members temporarily from caregiving responsibilities. Respite Care is short -term care provided to relieve family members temporarily from caregiving responsibilities. Friendly Visiting/Daily Phone Calling is a volunteer program in which an individual visits or calls a homebound person on a regular basis. Chore Services include shopping, marketing, transportation and heavy cleaning performed by competent persons. Services in the Community Each community has a network of health and social services available for people of all ages. Examples of these programs are adult day care, support/self -help groups, senior citizen programs, housing, and drug and alcohol treatment programs. How are post hospital services paid for? Financing post hospital care can be complex. We urge that you seek professional guidance from discharge planning staff on this subject to address your particular situation. Private financial resources may need to be utilized to pay for services not covered by insurance. Common payment sources are Medicare, private insurance, and Medicaid. We trust that this information has given you an introduction to the broad range of services available after discharge. Our goal is to help you maintain the highest level of independence and quality of life. We stand ready to assist you in formulating a plan of care which is adapted to your unique needs. 27 HOSPITAL SERVICES Medical -Surgical Services The 32 -bed Medical -Surgical Unit and 5 -bed Intensive Care Unit provide streamlined patient care in a beautifully designed contemporary environment.
