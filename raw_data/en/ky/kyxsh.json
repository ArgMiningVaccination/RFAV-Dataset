When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public h ealth care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable then report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When un available, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, per capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,147,772 for BC overall) and for ye ar 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2021 estimates (n= 5,19 4,137 for BC overall). Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: Health Authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data , PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and hospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)). Case data were extracted on January 17, 2022 , laboratory data on January 14, 2022 , PIR vaccine coverage date on January 14, 2022, and PCMS hospitalization data on January 17, 2022 .

The provincial incidence by episode date was 267 per 100K (14,081 cases) in week 1 . Incidence by Health Authority i ncreased from week 49 to week 1 : Fraser Health incidence increased from 41 to 321 per 100K Vancouver Coastal Health incide nce increased from 44 to 194 per 100K Interior Health incidenc e increased from 78 to 258 per 100K Vancouver Island Health in cidence increased from 85 to 244 per 100K Northern Health incid ence increased from 66 to 315 per 100K Testing of MSP -funded specimens has decreased from a peak of ~88,800 in week 51, to ~68,000 in week 52, and continued to decrease to ~58,700 in week 1. The positivity of MSP -funded specimens increased from 5.1% i n week 49 to 33.7% in week 1. The per capi ta testing rates between week 52 and week 1 decreased in all HAs, except Northern Health. Testing rates decreased i n all age groups between week 52 and week 1 , except the 60- 79 and 80+ age group . Age-specific incidences increased across all ag e groups from week 49 to week 1 . Between week 49 and we ek 1, incidence rates increased the most in 20 -29 year -olds (from 70 to 417 per 100K), 30-39 year -olds (from 72 to 346 per 100K), and 40 -49 year -olds (72 to 332 per 100K). The number of hospital admissions has increased since week 49, from 127 hospitalizations in week 49 to 261 hospitalizations in week 1. In week 1, 60 -79 year -olds had the highest number of hospital admis sions (77 hospitalizations). The weekly number of deaths decreased slightly from 22 in week 49 to 18 in week 1. Those aged 80+ accounted for the highest number of deaths in week 1 (14 deaths) . In week 1, 8 new outbreaks were declared, based on earliest case onset date. 9 of the 18 deaths reported in week 1 were associated with care facility outbreaks. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 1 Page 2 of 10 A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Due to changes in testing strategies in BC driven by the Omicron variant, case counts in this report are likely an underestim ate of the true number of COV ID-19 cases in BC. Up to week 1, there have been 280,672 cases for a cumulative incidence of 5,326 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ). The provincial i ncidence by episode date was 267 per 100K (14,081 cases) in week 1 , which has increased from 56 per 100K in week 49. The near 5 -fold increase is due to the emergence of Omicron variant in BC (VoC Reports). Incidence by episode date may increase as data become more complete in recent weeks . As shown in Figure 2 , incidence has increased sharply in all HAs from week 49 to week 1 . Incidence increased most dramatically in Fraser Health (FH) and Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), fr om 41 per 100K in week 49 to 321 per 100K in week 1 for FH, and from 44 per 100K in week 49 to 194 per 100K in week 1 in VCH. Incidence i ncreased from week 49 to week 1 in Interior Health (IH) (fr om 78 to 258 per 100K), Vancouver Isla nd Health (VIHA) (from 85 to 244 per 100K), and Nort hern Health (NH) (from 66 to 315 per 100K). The incidence in week 1 is lower compared to week 52 across all regions, but remains elevated compared to weeks 49 and earlier. These rates may increase as data become more complete. Table 1.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 3 , testing of MSP -funded specimens has decreased from a peak of ~88,800 in week 5 1, to ~68,000 in week 52, and continued to decrease to ~58,7 00 in week 1. The positivity of MSP -funded specimens increa sed from 5.1% in week 49 to 33.7 % in week 1 . As shown in Figure 4 , the per capita testing rates (Panel A) between week 52 and week 1 decreased in all HAs, except NH where testing rates increased from 1,101 per 100K to 1,420 per 100K , where testing rates were highest. Testing rates from week 52 to week 1 decreased the most in FH and VCH, from 1,694 per 100K to 1,255 per 100K in FH, and from 943 per 100K to 696 per 100K in VCH. Percent positivity (Panel B) for MSP -only specimens increased in all HAs in week 1 . Percent posi tivity in week 1 ranged from 29% in IHA to 39.7 % in VCH.

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown by the bars in Figure 5 , testing rates decreased i n all age groups between week 52 and week 1 , except the 60-79 and 80+ age group s where the te sting rates increased from 902 per 100K to 910 per 2,279 per 100K, respectively . Testing rates in week 1 were highest in those aged 80+ . As shown by the black dots in Figure 5 , the percent positivity increased in all age groups. The highe st percent positivity in week 1 was in the 10 -14 and 5 -9 year -olds at 49.9% and 44.8 %, respectively. Case distrib ution and weekly incidence by age group BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 1 Page 5 of 10 As shown in Figure 6, age-specific incidences de creased across all ag e groups from week 52 to week 1 , except for in those aged 80+. Between week 52 and week 1 , incidence rates continued to increase in those aged 80+, from 142 per 100K in week 52 to 142 per 100K in week 183 per 100K in week 1. Age-specific incidences may increase as data become more complete.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of hospital admissions has increased since week 49, from 12 7 ho spitalizations in week 49 to 261 hospitalizations in week 1. In week 1 , 60-79 year -olds had the highest n umber of hospital admissions (77 hospitalizations). The weekly number of deaths d ecreased slightly from 22 in week 49 to 18 in week 1. Those aged 80+ accounted for the hig hest number of deaths in week 1 (14 deaths) ( Table 2 , Figure 8 ). Recent data from VCH showed that approximately 1 in 2 COVID -19 hospitalizations in December in that region were incidental - i.e. they are admitted to the hospital for reasons unrelated to COVID -19. Therefore, the numbers presented here ma y be an overestimate of cases that are hospitalized due to COVID -19 (see Jan. 14 briefing ). Detailed information about outcomes by vaccination status can be accessed at BCCDC COVID -19 Regional Surveillance Dashboard . Cumulatively, there have been 22 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (M IS- C) in BC since January 1, 2020. There have been no new confirmed cases of MIS -C since the last report. The median age of all cases is 9 years old (range from 1 to 16 years old). Table 2.

Age profile, severe outcomes Table 3 displays the distribution of cases and severe outcomes. In week 1 , median age of hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths was 61 years, 62 years and 82 years, respectively, based on Health Authority case line lists onl y (data not shown). Since week 49, there has been a weekly average of 1 death in those <60 years of age, 1 death in 50 -59 year -olds, 2 deaths in 60-69 year -olds, 6 deat hs in the 70 -79 year -olds, and 6 deaths in the 80+ year -olds (data not shown). The number of deaths may increase over time as data becomes more complete.

Earliest dates of onset of outbreak cases are subject to change as investigations and data are updated. d. As of week 46, VCH and FH no longer declar e outbreaks with single staff cases unless there is evidence of transmission within the facility . G. Modeling Current Rt estimates for BC are considered unreliable due to recent and ongoing changes in the ascertainment of case counts, including capacity limitations of PCR testing and the use of rapid antigen tests. H. Wastewater surveillance The BCCDC and Metro Vancouver have b een testing for SARS -CoV-2 in wastewater at five wastewater treatment plants (representing 50% of BC's population) since May 2020 , in order to assess whether COVID -19 virus is present and how it might be changing over time . As shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12 , viral signal from the wa stewater surveillance is consistent with COVID -19 case counts. Results through to Jan. 15, 2022 For each wastewater treatment plant, samples are collected and tested three times per week to assess trends of SARS -CoV-2 in wastewater over time. BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 1 Page 9 of 10 To account for possible effects of wastewater volume, SARS -CoV-2 concentrations have been normalized by dail y wastewater flow. SARS -CoV-2 viral loads remain elevated in wastewater from all five WWTPs in VCH and FHA but have declined from their peak in early January. Figure 1 1. Wastewater surveillance, FHA Figure 1 2.
