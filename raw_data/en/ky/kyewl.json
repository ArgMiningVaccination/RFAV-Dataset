The score is based on changes from the norm of multiple [protein] [biomarkers]including [IL-16], a proinflammatory [cytokine], [apoptosis], and [Hepatocyte Factor](HGF)which serves as a marker for [chemotaxis]of [T-cells]into [epithelium]and cardiac [tissue], among other markers. Elevation above the norm increases the PULS score, while decreases below the norm lowers the PULS score. The score has been measured every 3-6 months in our [patient] [population]for 8 years. Recently, with the advent of the [mRNA] [COVID 19 vaccines](vac) by Moderna and Pfizer, dramatic changes in the PULS score became apparent in most [patients]. This [report]summarizes those results. A total of 566 pts, [aged]28 to 97, MF ratio 11 seen in a preventive [cardiology]practice had a new PULS test drawn from 2 to 10 weeks following the 2 COVID shot and was compared to the previous PULS score drawn 3 to 5 months previously pre- shot. Baseline [IL-16]increased from 35=/-20 above the norm to 82 =/- 75 above the norm post-vac;sFas increased from 22+/- 15 above the norm to 46=/-24 above the norm post-vac;HGF increased from 42+/-12 above the norm to 86+/-31 above the norm post-vac. These changes resulted in an increase of the PULS score from 11% 5 yr ACS [risk]to 25% 5 yr ACS [risk]. At the [time]of this [report], these changes persist for at least 2.5 months post second [dose]of vac.We conclude that the [mRNA]vacs [T cell]infiltration of [cardiac may account the observations of increased [thrombosis], other vascular "}
