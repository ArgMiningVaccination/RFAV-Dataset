Sound healing can be traced back to many ancient cultures like Greece, India, Tibet, Aboriginal Australian, Latin America, Africa and China. In these cultures, sound was used for ceremonies and as a way to heal various physical, mental, and emotional ailments. The ancients understood what modern science is now beginning to discover, that everything is in a state of vibration. The sound from various healing instruments during a session influences our brain wave frequencies and can help bring the brain to a Theta state within minutes. This is the state that occurs when you are in a profound state of relaxation. Seasoned meditation practitioners often are in a theta state while meditating. Theta is also our gateway to learning, memory, and intuition. In Theta, our senses are withdrawn from the external world and focused on signals originating from within. Hence it is very common during a sound healing session to experience subconscious movements of some parts of the body. Some people experience emotions, some see visuals, some experience vibrations in parts of their body. Every individual's experience each time is unique and there is no right or wrong way to experience a sound healing session. Sound healing, has a basis in both neurology and psychology. It has been proven in neurological studies that listening to music makes us more productive and creative; it can relieve stress and, depending on the sort of music, can improve our moods. This is because listening to music floods our brains with dopamine \u2014 the happy chemical. It also releases oxytocin, a natural painkiller and hormone that allows us to bond with and trust people.
