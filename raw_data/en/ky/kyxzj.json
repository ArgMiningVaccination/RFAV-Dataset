We ARE electromagnetic beings. Our trillions of cells are all working through electromagnetism. By providing PEMF stimulation to the body, we allow the cells to \"open up\" and properly intake nutrients while expelling waste. PEMF opens the cells & sets the stage for the other 2 therapies to optimize deeper & further. Step 2: Exercise with Oxygen All of our trillions of cells require oxygen to work. The oxygen we breath is around 21%. With the Hypermax Oxygen Mask from the Super Human Protocol, we are able to deliver around 93%-95% pure oxygen during your exercise session. Why exercise with Oxygen? Because the body & muscles need more oxygen during exercise, in turn allowing you to consume more oxygen and deliver it directly to the now \"open\" cells from the PEMF therapy. Step 3: Red Light Therapy Red Light Therapy or Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a light therapy that promotes tissue repair (skin wounds, muscles, tendons, bones, nerves), reduces inflammation or reduces pain. The red-light therapy begins the repair process by stimulating the damaged cells in the portion of the cell called the Mitochondria which produces energy for the cell. The application of red and near-infrared light to tissue that has been compromised by injury, disease, or degeneration. These wavelengths of light promote ATP production, which boosts energy transport within cells, leading to increased healthy cell function and cell proliferation, which helps to reverse oxidative stress to the cell and ultimately optimizes cell function. As step 3 to the Superhuman Protocol, PBMT optimizes the use of the Oxygen that the Hypermax floods the tissues with, capping off the protocol with optimal energy production for every cell in the body. Dr. Dave's Personal Experience \"Having been on the Super Human Protocol for just over 3 months now, I can see many layers of very measurable improvements starting from early on. First thing I noticed was an increase of moment-to-moment energy throughout the day. On busy days in the office where I may see 14-15 patients, all hands-on, which would typically leave me drained by day's end, now I feel like I can start the day and redo it all over. My endurance in my workouts has gotten to the point where it's difficult to even get out of breath, even with much more strenuous exercise than I'm used to. I awake much more rested and ready to go and my mental clarity has improved measurably. My skin looks better and those that haven't seen me in a while say I look even younger than last, they saw me. And that's just how I feel. I'm looking forward to the 6 month and then 1 year mark of having been on The Protocol.\" Super Human Protcol Certified We are proud to say we are fully certified in providing the full \"Super Human Protocol\" Experience!
