I LIVE A LIFE OF LIMITLESS JOY AND SO CAN YOU. \u2014THE DOLPHINS This book is dedicated to the awakening of humanity in our lifetime, awakening to the silver cord that has always connected us to our personal source of All That Is. And so, I invite you to take a personal journey with me as I recount how I awakened into being truly able to love myself and allowing joy to always light my way. When I think of joy, I think of my friends the dolphins and the frequency of joy they bring into our world. For me, it was the dolphins that awakened me and helped me understand my true multidimensional nature. Through many years of channeling a dolphin I called Ouna, I learned about the energetic system of our physical bodies we call the chakra system. She awakened ancient knowledge and infinite wisdom that became the foundation for much of what I would teach in later years. Being with the dolphins was not to become my life's work as I had once thought. Although for many years I took groups to swim with them in various parts of the world, my last trip was to say farewell to my joy partner in life, my husband, Lee. I always connected easily to Ouna, but after channeling her for five years, one day her energy was not present. Several weeks later, in the company of a few friends, I had a visitation from her. She was not in dolphin form; rather she looked like a brilliant moving shaft of sparkling light. As she moved into my aura, I was lifted out of my body and tears brimmed in my eyes as she softly spoke to me. She came to thank me for allowing her a voice. She was deeply appreciative that I had taken her information and incorporated it in my healing practice, that I had indeed valued her and her wisdom. She told me that because of our experience together, she had ascended in her own consciousness and was now a goddess of light. I remember sitting on Jane Roberts's couch that first night in Elmira and literally feeling the vibration change as Seth began to speak. There was a confidence, a direct purpose in the words being spoken, I felt thrilled and excited all at the same time. That room was filled with people who came together to seek the same thing\u2014connection to something they thought was bigger than self\u2014and in the process revealed authentic self-love. Jane worked very diligently to make sure that the words and ideas being expressed through her were authentic, and I deeply respect that. Because of her impeccable attention to the source of her information, her example paved my future as a conscious channel, allowing me to experience the benefits of clear channeling. The transmissions I received through Jane and Seth are still present, expanded now because I have embodied the teachings and therefore live them. After Seth I found Bashar, an extraterrestrial group of beings channeled through Darryl Anka. During the five years I attended the Bashar sessions, the messages were a little different from those received through Jane; however, the essential ingredient of unconditional love remained consistent. If I were to pick one idea from Seth that still moves me today, it would be the opening remarks in the book Seth Speaks: You create your own reality. From Bashar, it is his classic statement that we are masters of limitation and civilizations from all over the galaxies are watching to see how far we will expand once we let go. And, I must admit, so am I. Now Abraham-Hicks is on the scene with one constant message that is shaking up the status quo and leading the way. Because I believe that our time has come, I see Abraham cheering us on. I can almost hear a chorus of hip-hip-hoorah, here comes Abraham to tip the scale! This book was able to be written with such grace because I caught the love ball from Abraham, stacked it up with all the others I had in my treasure chest and let go of my self-imposed limiting beliefs. I give myself permission to be a voice for freedom and use the language of my life experience to deliver it. We are all in a process of awakening to a greater light that beams from the heart of who we are\u2014ascending, expanding with the wisdom gained, and transmitting and activating the joy with which we came into this life. I want to dedicate this book to the joyous hearts of the dolphins that are an intricate part of who we truly are. Follow me, they say, let me share the joy of the fast-moving waters, sleeking my friends as they swim by. I live a life of limitless joy and so can you. Then, as Activate Joy was completed, and before it could expand into an even greater tool of awakening, the horses pranced gently into my life. A dear friend of mine and graduate of the Inner Focus School had created a magnificent horse farm called Spirit Gate where she rescues and allows these spiritually advanced beings an opportunity to express their true nature in a dance of equine equality, and I was honored to take part in this adventure. Hero, the leader of the herd, began to speak to me, and this continued for many days. He told me of a place in the galaxies where horse consciousness reigns supreme and explained that well-being was the order of this universe. He introduced himself as the shaman of the herd. One of the geldings had a swollen knee and eye infection, and Hero and I worked as a team to heal him. Hero said, I am shaman. If you come to me first, we can work together in harmony to quicken the gelding's healing process. I was transported into another world with a deep awareness of the infinite intelligence of All That Is. Even after writing this book, my blessings continue as I awaken to living in a consistent state of joy. Beyond limitations, I find that unconditional love expands me beyond myself, over and over again. I know firsthand that as each of us accepts and allows the possibilities of living our life beyond limitations, the vistas are neverending and the joy is boundless. Now, I can give this blessing and pass it along to you as you read these words and embody the teachings therein. Thank You. CHAPTER 1 BEING JOYFUL THINK OF SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU SMILE. When we are little children, there is joy in everything. The amazing things of life continuously present reasons for us to be joyful. Joy is dancing in the air within the sunbeams coming through the window. You can see all sorts of marvelous things in those little gleaming lights. It is as if the smiling sun welcomes you into this fantastic human playground. There is joy in being hugged, touched, and loved as you reach out to experience the world. You can smell the sweetness of mom when she enters your room, and feel joy when you hear the coo of her voice as she reaches out for you. Then there is the pleasure of eating, and that particular pleasure of taste that continues to be a real delight for almost all of us. OODLES OF JOY I married at 18; my first child was born within a year. Vividly, I remember one evening several years later when my brother, his wife, and their son came over for dinner. I made spaghetti and put the kids at a small table in my daughter's room just off the kitchen. The adults sat in the dining area, out of the children's sight, but not out of earshot. We talked, enjoying our meal, and listened to the kids giggle. I thought I should go in to see what all the fun was about and, to my surprise, when I walked into the room, there was spaghetti everywhere. Those cute little hands had used sauce and noodles to finger paint the walls and the table. There was spaghetti on the little chairs they were delightfully wiggling on. But the cutest sight was the overturned bowls of noodles hanging upside down on their little heads. They were in such joy. Neither of the kids noticed us, but when they did, the laughter and giggles stopped. There was stillness and silence as the kids awaited their fate, breathing on hold, mouths dropped. The oh no looks on their little faces absolutely stopped me in my tracks. What did the children think would happen? My brother had stepped in behind me. The kids' eyes were as wide as saucers. Just a few moments passed, and my brother and I laughed so hard, we cried. When the kids saw our reaction, after they started to breathe again, they laughed along with us. I have never seen and felt such unbridled joy! To activate joy is such a simple effort and one worth doing as often as you think about it. Think of something that makes you smile and gives you a warm feeling all over, perhaps a memory that brings you into a happy place for a time, that paves the way for future moments of alignment. We are born aligned and activated to joy. Now, it is just a short reach of allowing to give it a place in our lives once again. INSPIRED BY THE BLOOMS Joy is experienced in all of our senses. Another way I can activate joy is by remembering the smell of freshly mown grass, or walking along a path and smelling flowers. I loved to pick flowers as a child. In my mind there were no boundaries, no limitations, and no fences worth paying any attention to that could keep me from the flowers. Flowers spoke to me; they were kissed by the sunbeams I remembered streaming through the window onto my wall. And have I told you how much I love the rain? If Mom didn't watch me closely, I would wander out the kitchen door when it rained, just to stand in awe of what was falling from the sky. Where did those things come from? If I stuck my tongue out, the drops tickled me, and felt good on my face. I had no fear of thunder or lightning, and in Vestal, New York, the thunder really crackled and roared. There is sheer joy in my heart as I recall the awesomeness of it all. Flowers so inspired me, especially tulips, because they looked like little cups for my tea parties. It never mattered to me where they were, I just wanted to pick them. My neighbors knew that when I was walking, my mission was to bring my mom a bouquet of flowers. Sometimes Marion up the street would poke her head out of the door and say, Sandra, don't pull up the roots now, pick them gently. Take just a few today; we need to leave some for the fairies to dance around tonight. As I think back on those warm spring days from my childhood, I am grateful for the blessing of our lovely neighbors. I often wondered if Marion could also hear the sunbeams calling to her. Somehow all the ladies around us found joy in seeing a little girl who loved their tulips so much, knowing the flowers would grace my mom's table that afternoon. REAWAKEN JOY Take a moment and recall the active joy in your childhood. Even if your childhood had stretches of challenges or trauma, as mine did, you can always reach deep and find a positive experience to reflect on because joy follows you wherever you go\u2014you just can't help it. Allow these feelings of well-being and celebration to wash over you. Know that as you allow these or any other good feelings to emerge, you are deliberately aligning yourself with joy. As you reawaken this most natural part of you, let yourself bask in the freedom of that young mind. Relive the joy of running. That was something, wasn't it? Running, swinging, riding that Big Wheel, feeling the breeze on your face and in your hair. Oops, falling! Well, that was part of running. We always fell. The tumble was followed by the sound of Mom or Dad rushing over to see if we were hurt. I always cried harder when I saw them coming because I just loved the fuss they made over me. Joy echoed in my heart at the sound of their concern, the softness of their voices, even the quiet chiding about running, and falling down\u2014all blending into the sound of love. We can reach back into our happy memories to reawaken and activate the innocent joy we once knew. It's interesting to realize that once these pictures begin to bubble to the surface, there are more to come. Joy begets joy. I remember one Christmas morning after all the packages were opened, Mom and Dad upstairs having a rest, I\u2014Grandma\u2014just putting the cinnamon rolls in the oven for breakfast later. It was just too quiet so I tiptoed into my bedroom area to see where my granddaughters were. Basking in the joy of the morning's festivities, I stood for a long time outside my closed door listening to my darling little ones' soft giggles and gentle talking. I opened the door and peeked inside. They were sitting on the floor, licking the huge lollypops I had given them on top of their presents, sticky red stuff all over their faces. They looked up and smiled, inviting me into their vortex of joy. As I joined them and relished in the happiness of children's delight, I was transported back into the spaghetti scene from years ago. While sitting there I made a conscious, deliberate choice to activate joy anytime, for no reason at all, just the way children do all the time. This book is here to serve you, to remind you of what you once knew, and to bring you to a new level of conscious awareness and deliberate choice. Come with me and we will explore ideas, my personal journey, and the places we get stuck, and I will give you tools to help you activate joy so that you may become as you intended: a deliberate creator of joy in this extraordinary world. CHAPTER 2 FINDING YOUR JOY IF JOY WERE A POINT ON THE COMPASS, IT WOULD POINT THE WAY TO HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT. When something excites you and you feel good about it, follow it as far as you can to see where it leads. Excitement breeds the energy of passion. As these good feelings continue to be a part of your process, thoughts form around the feelings, creating a belief pattern. The full-blown pattern, the combination of the tone of your feelings, your mood, and your beliefs, resonates and becomes your point of attraction. Your natural creative spirit has already replaced patterns that are worn out and no longer work for you with new, fresh ideas. All you have to do is allow an attitude of joy to flow into your life. ALIGN WITH WHAT YOU WANT When or if we align with the positive feelings associated with joy, we move toward finding our joy. Aligning is important. By first aligning with what you want, you will get where you want to go much faster. Most of us have spent a lifetime pouring energy into healing old hurts and traumas. I believe those were necessary steps in truly knowing what we do not want in our lives. From those healings, many of us, myself included, emerged with a more refined consciousness and became more aware and deliberate in the choices we are making today. Seeing those old hurts and traumas in a new light has certainly helped in realizing our true worthiness. This book is deliberately focused on fearlessly moving into levels beyond our present "}
