Proper and Improper Storage Units New 2013 VFC Policies Important Update Vaccine Storage & Handling 5 Quick Tips to Improve on Storage and Handling of Vaccine Today! 1. Design a map of where vaccine is in each part of the storage unit and post on outside of unit. 2. Use color coded bins for each vaccine i.e. blue for pediatric vaccines, yellow for adult, green for adolescent. 3. Label each vaccine bin with name of vaccine, age indications and route. 4. Dedicate one shelf in each unit as pediatric vaccine only, adolescent vaccine only, or adult vaccine only. 5. Use a vaccine expiration date table and post on storage unit so all staff will know when vaccine expire. Checklist for Safe Vaccine Storage and Handling http://www.immunize.org/catg.d p3035.pdf Vaccine Storage Labels http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/storage/guide/vaccine -storage -labels.pdf Vaccine expiration Date Table http://www.aimtoolkit.org/vaccine/vaccine/Exp_table.pdf Unacceptable and Acceptable Storage Units CDC does not recommend storage of any vaccine in a dormitory -style (or bar style) combined refrigerator/freezer unit under any circumstances. A dormitory -style refrigerator is defined as a small combination refrigerator/freezer unit that is outfitted with one exterior door and an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. The 2009 NIST research concluded that \"the dorm -style refrigerator is NOT recommended for vaccine under any circumstance.\" A refrigerator unit with a built in freezer compartment is considered dormitory -style and is not acceptable for vaccine storage. A refrigerator unit with no freezer compartment is not considered dormitory -style and is acceptable for vaccine storage. To contact the Maine Immunization Program, please call us at: (207) 287 -3746 or (800) 867 -4775 Acceptable Vaccine Storage Unit: Unacceptable Vaccine Storage Unit: This unit contains a built -in freezer compartment Use of Dormitory Style Refrigerators It is no longer acceptable to store any vaccine received by the VFC program in a dormitory style vaccine storage unit. A dormitory style unit is a small combination freezer/ refrigerator unit with one external door and an evaporator plate (cooling coil), which is usually located an icemaker compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. Emergency Storage and Handling Plan All Maine Immunization Providers (MIP) are required to post their emergency storage and handling plan for publicly purchased vaccine that they receive from the Maine Immunization Program. CDC VFC Requirement - You Call the Shots All MIP providers who receive publicly funded vaccine from the MIP must complete the online training, \"You Call the Shots\", Storage and Handling, Module 10. Charge for Vaccine Administration The maximum regional cap for vaccine administration has changed from $14.37 to $21.58. $21.58 can be charged per dose of vaccine that is Administered. Ex. A child receives 1 DTaP vaccine and 1 polio vaccine. Administration fee would be: $43.16 Unannounced Storage and Handling Visits to Maine Immunization Providers Any MIP provider may be chosen to receive an unannounced storage and handling visit at their provider office. The goal of these visits is to provide guidance and education and to ensure that all Vaccines for Children (VFC) eligible children are receiving properly managed vaccines. Temperature Logs for a New Provider Any facility that wishes to receive and store (VFC) vaccine must submit one week (7 days) of twice daily refrigerator and freezer temperature recordings, including minimum/ maximum temperatures daily to make sure that temperatures are within the appropriate ranges before using the units to store VFC vaccines. Out of Range Temperatures IPV, PCV, Hep B, Hep A, influenza, RV and Hib) should be Maintained between temperatures 35\u00b0F and 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C and 8\u00b0C). The temperature should never fall below 35\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) or rise above 46\u00b0F (8\u00b0C). Set the temperature mid-range to achieve an average of about 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C). This safety setting will provide the best safety margin. Freezer vaccine (Varicella, MMR -V and Zoster) should be maintained between temperatures -58\u00b0F and +5\u00b0F (-50\u00b0C and -15\u00b0C). Provider Educational Requirements Every MIP Provider must receive an educational contact during each calendar year. An educational contact may be any of the following: - An online training - A webinar - An in person classroom style presentation - Attendance of record VFC Compliance Site Visit Every MIP provider will be required to receive a VFC compliance site visit at least every other year.
