One of the first benefits of this therapy is immediate relief and reduced stress. Your skin also heels because it pushes out the dead skin cells from the surface. Benefits The far infrared sauna uses heat energy that penetrates tissues at a low temperature and this allows it to be tolerable to many patients that come in for treatment. When you are in treatment, sweat production boosts circulation of blood in your body and this has many benefits as well. Increased blood circulation has been shown to relieve acne, eczema, psoriasis, burns, lesions, and cuts. Infrared saunas can also help in ridding the body of toxins and heavy metals. Infrared therapy can treat chronic and acute pain as well. Studies have shown evidence of benefits of infrared therapy on high blood pressure, congestive heart failure, headaches, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis.
