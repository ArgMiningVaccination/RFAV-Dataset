The purpose of this Executive Officer (EO) Notice (Administration of the Publicly Funded COVI D-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Billing), the EO Notice: Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility, and the accompanying Questions and Answers (Qs & As) documents, are to set out the terms and conditions for a participating pharmacy's submission of claims for payment (claims) for administering injectable COVID-19 vaccines to eligible Ontarians. Each document is a ministry policy that pharmacy operators must comply with under section 3.2 of the Health Network System (HNS) Subscription Agreement for Pharmacy Operators. Participating pharmacies must comply with all of the terms and conditions set out in the EO Notices and Qs & As. It is a condition of participating that participating pharmacies offer first, second and third or booster doses to all eligible groups, provided that there is sufficient supply of the vaccines. The two (2) EO Notices and the accompanying Qs & As documents are not intended to describe a pharmacy operator's obligations in respect of administering injectable COVID-19 vaccines under applicable legislation, other agreements with the Province of Ontario, or policies of the OCP. Pharmacy operators with questions about their legal obligations outside of the HNS Subscription Agreement should refer to the applicable legislation, other agreement, or OCP policy as appropriate. This EO Notice (Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Phar macies - Billing) replaces the previous EO notice on the same topic respecting the administration of publicly funded COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario pharmacies that was effective, July 14 th, 2022. Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies, Ministry of Health 1 Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pharmacy and Patient Eligibility Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". General Description There is no cost to eligible patients who receive the COVID-19 vaccine when administered at a pharmacy. For each valid claim submitted, a pharmacy will receive $13.00 for the following services: o Providing the patient with details of the process and answering any questions related to the vaccination. o Obtaining the consent of the patient or their substitute decision-maker prior to vaccine administration o Administering the COVID-19 vaccine. o Providing the patient with proper monitoring and written vaccine information as well as after-care instructions following vaccine administration. o Providing the patient with a written receipt of the vaccination with the pharmacy contact information (see below for more details); a pharmacy may wish to issue an electronic receipt as well. (Note: a written receipt can be printed from COVAX ON). o Mandatory scheduling of the second dose o Complying with any requirements to access and use the Provincial COVID-19 Vaccine Solution-COVAX ON under the COVID-19 Vaccine Agreement. Pharmacies are eligible to access personal protective equipment (PPE) from the ministry's dedicated supply, if needed. The ministry's supply of PPE must ONLY be used to support the activity of pharmacies administering the publicly funded COVID- 19 vaccine. Table 1 lists the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccines that are available to pharmacies, including any restrictions on administering the vaccine (e.g. age groups) 1. For clarity, where a patient meets the eligibility criteria for the vaccine2 but is excluded by the restrictions for the vaccine product (see Table 1 below), the vaccine 1 Inclusion of a product in the list of publicly funded vaccines available for pharmacies does not guarantee supply of the product through the participating pharmaceutical distributors. 2 Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies, Ministry of Health 2 Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division cannot be administered to the patient. If a patient does not meet the eligibility criteria for the vaccine,3 the vaccine cannot be administered to the patient even if they are not excluded by the restrictions. Note that certain eligibility criteria may be specific to a particular vaccine/DIN/PIN.

Emulsion Injection 7.5 mcg/mL after mixing with adjuvant Multiple-dose vial of 10 doses Dose: 3.75 mcg VLP / 0.5mL 2 doses (8 weeks apart) * 18 to 64 years of age as per product monograph * Based on the NACI statement , Ontario strongly recommends patients wait 8 weeks after receiving their first dose before getting a second dose. There is emerging evidence that longer intervals between the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines result in more robust and durable immune response and higher vaccine effectiveness and may be associated with a lower risk of myocarditis and/or pericarditis in adolescents and young adults. However, some eligible patient populations may receive their second dose earlier than 8 weeks if necessary, with informed consent. The appropriate minimum dose interval should be determined from the product monograph of the vaccine used for the first dose. ** Patient eligibility criteria at the pharmacy is expected to change as COVID-19 vaccine supply fluctuates and the pandemic situation evolves. NACI guidelines recommend interchangeability of vaccines (or vaccine mixing) which means a patient could receive one vaccine product for the first dose and a different vaccine product for the second dose to complete the two-dose vaccine series. For example, individuals who have received only their first dose of the COVISHIELD or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and who have not yet received a second dose should receive an mRNA (Pfizer (12+ formulation) or Moderna) vaccine for their second dose unless contraindicated. According to NACI recommendations, an mRNA vaccine is now preferred as the second dose for individuals who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine, based on emerging evidence of a potentially better immune response from this mixed vaccine schedule and to mitigate the potential risk of Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) associated with viral vector vaccines. Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". Please also refer to this EO Notice for more Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies, Ministry of Health 5 Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division information regarding third or booster doses with the Novavax vaccine (Nuvaxovid) or viral vector vaccines, as well as booster (fourth or fifth) doses and repeat vaccination series for certain groups. *** The product monograph for the AstraZeneca / COVISHIELD vaccine states that the vaccine can be used in those 18 years of age and older, but see note below regarding the pause in first dose administration. **** See Executive Officer Notice dated May 11, 2021 regarding the Ministry of Health's direction to pause of the administration of first doses of publicly funded AstraZeneca / COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccines in Ontario pharmacies, available here. However, the admi nistration of first doses of the AstraZeneca / COVISHIELD COVID-19 vaccine is not suspended for individuals with allergies to an mRNA vaccine or adverse event following injection (AEFI). Please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". ***** Footnote intentionally deleted. ****** For more information regarding eligibility for third or booster doses (including dosing intervals and half-dosing for specific age groups as well as the vaccines administered for this purpose), please refer to the ministry website for the most recent EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". Pharmacies should be informed and stay current with the vaccine's official indications in accordance with Health Canada's approved product monograph, including information regarding recommended dosing as per the product monograph. Ontario is funding third or booster doses, based on consultations with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and based on evidence and recommendations by the NACI5 and the Ontario Immunization Advisory Committee (OIAC). Refer to the ministry guidance for more information. 5 Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine is currently not authorized by Health Canada for use as a booster dose in Canada. However, a booster is recommended as per NACI for individuals without contraindications to Nuvaxovid who are not able or willing to receive an mRNA vaccine. ******* Based on advice from the OIAC, and in alignment with NACI , the Ministry of Health has issued a preferential recommendation for the use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 5-29. This recommendation stems from an observed increase in the number of reports in Ontario of myocarditis/pericarditis following vaccination with Moderna relative to Pfizer-BioNTech in the 18-29 year old age group, particularly among males. Although risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with the Moderna (50 mcg) vaccine in children 6 to 11 years of age is unknown, with a primary series in adolescents and young adults the rare risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with Moderna (100 mcg) was higher than with Administration of COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies, Ministry of Health 6 Ministry of Health OHIP, Pharmaceuticals and Devices Division Pfizer-BioNTech (30 mcg). See Vaccination Recommendations for Special Populations for more details. Informed consent is required for those age 6 to 29 who wish to receive the Moderna vacci ne, as it is whenever administering a vaccine . ******** The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine generally requires a single dose. However, individuals who received the single dose Janssen vaccine are eligible for a supplementary or booster dose in accordance with the EO Notice entitled \"Administration of the Publicly Funded COVID-19 Vaccines in Ontario Pharmacies - Eligibility\". For more information, please refer to the ministry website for the most recent version of that EO Notice. Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract 6 doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a 6th dose from a single vial. Vial labels and cartons may state that after dilution, a vial contains 5 doses of 0.3 mL. The information in the Product Monograph regarding the number of doses per vial after dilution supersedes the number of doses stated on the vial labels and cartons. Billing Procedures - Summary Claims for administering the publicly funded COVID-19 vaccine can only be submitted electronically using the HNS (see \"Billing Procedures - Detailed\" below).
