You can put on sterile gloves by ensuring your hands are clean and then sliding them into the gloves. Steps Ensuring Your Hands are Clean - 1Choose the proper glove size for you. Sterile gloves come in a wide range of sizes. These can vary by company. Try on several different pairs of sterile gloves until you find the right fit. Once you've found the right fit, you will have to discard the gloves you tried on and put a new, fully-sterile pair on. Feel for the following to identify when you have the right size for your hand: - Ability to move your hands comfortably - No friction on your skin - Little to no sweating - Little or no hand muscle fatigue - 2Remove your jewelry. Although not necessary, consider taking off any rings, bracelets or other jewelry on your hands. These could contaminate your gloves or make them difficult to put on and uncomfortable to wear.
