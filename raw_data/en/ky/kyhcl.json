Detox is the process of removing a specific substance from your body. If your body is addicted to a substance, it has been conditioned to believe it requires it to survive. If you start to limit use of a specific substance, you may start to develop serious withdrawal symptoms. This is one of the most common reasons people relapse quickly after they attempt to get clean and/or sober. How Does Detox Work? The detoxification process can take on different forms depending on the substance involved. For example, detox for opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol each vary in length. Depending on the substance, it can take several days or several months for the body to be rid of a substance. In addition, the length and severity of a detoxification period can be impacted by the following: - What substance(s) were used and if there was more than one - The frequency of substance use and how much was being taken at a time - If the person detoxing has other co-occurring illnesses, including mental health conditions - The person's medical history - The person's age and gender Establishing a detoxification program requires specific steps, and going through detox by oneself can be difficult and life-threatening. It's important to work with an experienced medical professional who can tailor the process to meet a person's specific needs. Trained professionals, starting with a person's physician, have experience helping patients work through the symptoms that accompany detox. Watch Now! Dr. Julie McCarthy talks to us about substance addiction and how to support a family member who is struggling The Process of Detoxing From Substances The detoxification process involves several steps. The details depend on the specific medical professional and the exact nature of the substances to which someone is addicted. Each person will experience detox differently. In addition, each detox process is unique, even if someone has previously gone through the process. The following steps outline the typical detox process. Identification The first step is for a provider to get to know the person who is seeking help. It is important for a provider to know how often someone has been using substances, the amount taken, and how long the person has been addicted to that specific substance. Cessation The next step is for the person with substance use disorder to begin the process of slowly reducing or stopping the use of substances. It's important to do this under a physician's care, with a trained professional who can help with symptom reduction in a hospital or other medical setting. Moderate the Effects After someone stops taking a specific substance, their body must clear the remaining substance from its system. As someone stops using drugs or alcohol, withdrawal symptoms will start to appear. Symptoms can vary depending on the type of substance involved. One of the goals of medical detoxification is to provide support that can help someone manage symptoms. This can include IV hydration, over-the-counter medications, or even prescription medications that might help treat the symptoms and make the withdrawal process more bearable. Monitor the Effects As someone goes through this process, medical professionals will monitor vital signs. These include heart rate, blood pressure, oxygenation, respiratory rate, and temperature. Taper the Treatment Tapering means gradually reducing a person's medication doses. Instead of abruptly stopping substances, the process will end gradually. This way, any rebound or reactive symptoms can be avoided. If other medications are being used to support someone through the withdrawal process, these will also be tapered over the course of several hours to several days. Release The last step is to conclude the detox process and set the patient up for the next phase: effective treatment. After someone has gone through the withdrawal process and has had substances cleared from their system, it's important they build skills to help them stay sober for the long term.
