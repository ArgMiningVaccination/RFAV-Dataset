Nurses have traditionally claimed theirrealm of work and responsibility as distinct from that ofphysicians with an emphasis on patients' comfort andenvironment. Some nurses have adopted \"care\" as nurs-es' particular domain, as distinct from the focus to\"cure\" that is seen to characterize medicine in the mod-ern era (Poirier & Ayres, 2002). Besides, caring is alsoan essential component of the human phenomenon. Asa human phenomenon, caring is crucial for the continualsurvival of our species as social and cultural, as well asbiological beings (Leininger, 1991). Since the mid 20th century, Leininger studied caringand its nature, component, traits, structure, and meaning with many nurses in the world. From many field re-search, Leininger (1991) postulated that the use ofgeneric and professional care knowledge is a powerfulmeans of promoting healthy, well-being, and recoveryfrom illness or disability, or of helping clients and fami-lies. For caring practices to be effective, they must berecognized as caring by patients, viewed through thespecific lens of the patient's culture, his or her concerns,and whatever else meaning in the patient's world. In thestudies on caring, however, a discrepancy emerged be-tween what the lay caregiver perceived as important, es-sential, or possible, and what health professionals per-ceived as optimal (Atwood, 1978). Bowers (1987) foundthat nurses and other professionals lacked an adequateunderstanding of the family caregiver's experience, andThe Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit Myung Ok Cho1 Purpose. The main purpose of this critical ethnography was to examines the process and discourses through which family caregivers experience while caring for their sick family member in a hospital. Methods. This was achieved by conducting in-depth interviews with 12 family caregivers, and by observing their caring activities and daily lives in natural settings. The study field was a unit for neurologic patients.Data was analyzed using taxonomy, discourse analysis, and proxemics. All research work was iterativelyprocessed from March 2003 to December 2004. Results. Constant comparative analysis of the data yielded the process of becoming a successful family caregiv- er: encountering the differences and chaos as novice; constructing their world of skilled caregivers; andbecoming a hospital family as experienced caregivers. During the process of becoming an experienced hos-pital family, the discourse of family centered idea guided their caring behaviors and daily lives. Conclusion. The paternalistic family caregivers struggled, cooperated, and harmonized with the patriarchal world of professional health care system. During this process of becoming hospital family, professional nurs-es must act as cultural brokers between the lay family caring system and the professional caring system.

Professor, Department of Nursing at Dongeui University Acknowledgement: This work was supported by grant No. 2003AA100 from the research Program of the Dongeui University.Corresponding author: Myung Ok Cho, Department of Nursing at Dongeui University, 995 Eomgwangno, June 3, 2005 ; Accepted December 5, 2005Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing (2005) Vol. 35, No. 8, 1461 1475this precluded effective nursing interventions. In the study, the professionals' view of the parent role in hospi-tal care was rarely congruent with the parents' model oftheir role, and this was a source of stress for the parents. Nurse theorists who claim care to be the traditional and essential domain of nursing offer prescriptions fornursing that can help alleviate this discrepancy. Nurseshave sought to involve patients and families in their ownhealth care by teaching and responding to their con-cerns. Swanson(1991) investigated nurses' caring by ask-ing patients, who received nursing care, about their per-ception of the care. In the study, skillful caring practicehas proven to be a powerful influence on the client's re-covery. However, skillful practice as care cannot, itseems, be taken for granted (Kanavagh & Knowlden,2004). Caring is steeped in nursing ideology, profession-al constructs, and broader cultural and social discourse.The notion of caring is affective for it evokes images ofkindness, compassion, and patience. These behaviors areembedded in practice ideology and normalized in pro-fessional nursing models. What is less clear is how thecaring ideology intersects with practice realities and howit might be influenced by the imperatives of the manage-rial health service environment. This leads to speculationabout how care may, thus embedded, serve to promoteand maintain the health status of the client. Again, Leininger's work can provides suggestions on how this end may be achieved. According to culturalcare theory, there are two health care systems in everysociety: the generic (lay, folk) and the professional sys-tems (Leininger, 1991). Generic system refers to cultur-ally learned and transmitted, indigenous, folk knowledgeand skills used to provide assistive, supportive, enabling,or facilitative acts toward or for another individual,group, or institution with evident or anticipated needs toimprove a human way of life, health condition, or todeal with handicaps and death situations. Professionalsystem refers to formal and cognitively learned profes-sional knowledge and practice skills that are taught inprofessional institutions to a number of multidisciplinarypersonnel in order to serve consumers seeking healthservices. As I described so far, and suggested byAnderson (1990), there is a discrepancy between thegeneric folk and professional systems in the notion ofhealth, illness, and treatment or caring. In this situation,nurses need to attempt to bridge over the cultural gapbetween professional system and generic system. For theculture care theorist, culturally congruent care is the bestway to obtain the goal. Culturally congruent nursing care can occur when culture care values, expressions, orpatterns are known and used appropriately and mean-ingfully by the nurse. And this culturally based nursingcare contributes to the well-being of individual, families,group and communities within their environmental con-text. As Leininger (1991) concluded, professional nurs-ing must be built upon generic care. Therefore, we need to study cultural specific care, the generic folk care, to gain an understanding about thissystem of care. Only after this, can we bridge betweenthe two systems. This study was targeted to explore thefamily care that is an essential component of the genericcare system. As a generic care system, family caregivinghas existed throughout history, but it has only recentlycome to the attention of nursing scholars and healthpractitioners. As chronic health diseases increase, manypatients have their health condition managed in a com-munity by their family. In everyday life, the family takescare of their children and older parents for keeping, pro-moting, and recovering health. In the social network,family members internalize the interpretation of socialreality by significant others. Thereby, they habituatedand practiced the cultural value of caring. Thus, genericcultural caring behaviors can be easily observed in afamily. In-patient setting, families are the major sourcefor providing financial support for health care in hospi-tals. Furthermore, in many chronic care facilities inKorea, the family caregiver takes responsibility for theprimary care for their ill family member. These familycaregivers dwell in the ward and take care of their illfamily member. They tend to perform some of the morecomplicated tasks that are ordinarily performed byskilled nurses. That is to say, professional nursing andgeneric family care systems co-exist in chronic care hos-pitals of our society. If these two systems are not in ac-cordance, the quality of caring can not be obtained. Thefirst step towards a goal of good nursing care is an un-derstanding of the caregiving family as a consumer ofnursing care and a care partner. Another notion guiding this study is that caring is a cultural phenomenon. Caring is part of such diverse ba-sic human activities as parenting, counseling, befriend-ing, and healing. All of which activities occur within thesocio-cultural context. In the In-patient setting, althoughnurses and family caregivers may attend to patients incrisis, there is also a concern for the everyday, personalcircumstances in which patients experience illness. This 1462 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8inherent interest in context and lives as they are lived makes theories of nursing relevant to this cultural analy-sis of family caregiving. The meaning of caring is interpreted from the behav- iors that arise from a particular culture's social expecta-tions about its people and which are approved and re-warded as such. Socialized and enculturated as we are,we learn patterns of understanding and behaving in theworld as we know it. Experience of living contributes tonew meaning and understanding, amid new and alwayschanging interpretations, caring remains both embeddedin and reflective of culture (Kavanagh & Knowlden,2004). As critical approaches postulate, culture is neitherpassive nor deterministic but requires active appropria-tion, perpetuation, and transformation through humanparticipation (Barker & Galasniski, 2001). This involvesmeditation between, for example already-learned tradi-tion and the situation of the moment. In this way, cultureis operative in all acts of understanding and caring.Caring is a classic example of hermeneutic problems, forits meanings are often not apparent and requires inter-pretation (Kavanagh & Knowlden, 2004). For the inter-pretation of human behavior, we need to descend to thelowest level. Discourse analysis is a way to fulfill thispurpose. Most of the early studies on family caregiving were surveys of the social supports that family caregiversneeded or desired (Bass & Noelker, 1987; McCaslin,1988; Montgomery & Hatch, 1987), and stress or bur-den and the ability of family caregivers to cope with thatstress (Park & Han, 2000; An, 2002). In these quantita-tive studies, characteristics such as depression, physicalhealth, social isolation, and financial needs were mea-sured (Cantor, 1983; Sexton & Murno, 1985). The re-sults were helpful in identifying certain aspects of thecaregiving experience. However, their focus on the stres-sors in caregiving fed the stereotype of caregiving asonerous work. We need to find other aspects of the care-giving experience, the positive ones. A move away from such exclusively quantitative re- porting came with some scholars such as Corbin andStrauss (1988). Much of the early qualitative research onfamily caregiving was grounded in contemporary as-sumption about the constituency and nature of familycaregivng. Human experiences have their various con-stituents. Exploring the nature of caring is essential tounderstand clients and in providing client-centered nurs-ing practice. But, it is not enough to find some con-stituent of certain human behavior. We need to identify the underlying basis of these constituents. The purpose of this study was to find an understanding of the family caregivers' experiences in a hospital, andfocused on the process and discourse by which they be-come an expert family caregiver. Thus, the question thatguided this research was; \"what do family caregivers ex-perience during the process of caring for their familymember?\" METHODS Research design In this critical ethnography, I adopted an interpretive qualitative approach in which data collection and analy-sis are processed iteratively. This study was designedwith one group of family caregivers. Data collection The fieldwork for the study was conducted in a neurol- ogy unit of a hospital in B city. This for-profit institu-tion's bed capacity was 400. On the unit used for re-search, there are two wards and 100 beds. Prior to con-ducting the study, research permission was obtainedfrom the educational board of the nursing division of thehospital. Participants were self-selected in a purposive,convenience-sampling process after informed consentswere obtained. All participants and informant were pro-vided materials and the purpose of the study was ex-plained, including ethical norms of research, and theirright to discontinue participation whenever they want.Data were generated from 12 primary family caregivers:8 were women and 4 were men; 3 daughters, 3 hus-bands, 5 wives, and the son of a patient. Participants' illfamily had the following medical diagnosis: 8 stroke, 2meningioma, 2 head injury. Ethnographic participants'observation was the major method of collecting and ana-lyzing data. Interviews were the secondary data collec-tion method used in the ethnography. Participant observation and unstructured interview proceeded from March 5, 2003 to December 21, 2003.During 10 months of fieldwork, I engaged in the fieldone day a week from 7:00 to 15:00. The fieldwork pro-ceeded with the question: \"what and how does the fami-ly caregiver care for their ill family?\" The focused inter-views and mini tour participant observations were con-ducted between January 2004 and December 2004 afterthe domain analysis was completed. During this field-Cho The Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit 1463work, I engaged in the field one or two days per week from 6: 50 to 15: 35 or in the evening. This fieldworkproceeded with the question: \"what did they change intheir caring behaviors?\" \"What made the difference incaring patterns among the participants?\" The third field-work was conducted during the 3rd week of December2004. The final fieldwork for confirming the rules forcaring behavior was continued for 7days from 7:00 to17:00. Interviews to collect data enabled participants to dis- cuss in a safe, confidential space their experience of car-ing with their family patients. Each family caregiver par-ticipated in three or more individual semi-structured in-terviews that lasted 20 30 minutes. In the loosely struc- tured interview, I asked all participants broad open-end-ed questions: \"Tell me about your experience on howyou became a primary caregiver for your family\", \"Tellme about your experiences in this hospital\", and \"Tellme the reason why you did such and such activity foryour family\". The interview was audiotape recordedwith the permission of participants. Observation as aparticipant and participation as an observer approachwere selected so as not to disturb the natural behaviorand the privacy of research participants. Participant ob-servations were conducted in the patients' room, in anurse station, and in a lounge on the unit. The researcherparticipated with the family caregivers' hospital lifeevent such as having a meal, discussing with health per-sonnel, and even struggling against other family care-givers as well as caring for their ill family. Participant ob-servations and interviews were conducted until the finalprocess of family caregiving pattern was identified. Data Analysis To make a text, interview data was transcribed verba- tim and observation data was recorded in a field note.Because most of the interview and participant observa-tion proceeded simultaneously, interview data were putin the field note. The text was read and reread in orderthat it could be engaged with as a whole. After this high-lighting process of analysis, the data were examined line-by-line. At this preliminary stage of data analysis, twooperational domains were selected: the discourse andthe process. The second step taken in the study was scru-tinizing the data for significant statements that reflectedthe process of becoming a family caregiver and discours-es behind this process. The purpose of this step of ana-lyzing was to find out how the everyday caring practiceis constructed by and within the context and culture of the in-patient environment. Data analyzing was guidedby the questions; \"What are the dominant discoursesthat shaped and constrained the family caregivers' dailylife and caring behavior?\" and \"How do they exercisethis discourse in the practice of caring?\" The process ofreading and rereading, noting the whole, the parts, andthe parts in relation to the whole, was repeated for eachparticipant's text. Once this process was completed,common themes were sought in all participants' texts. Indeveloping early themes, exemplars from the text wereextracted to demonstrate the similarity or contrast ofpatterns of meaning, common situations, or embodiedexperiences. They were then coded and situated to de-velop additional themes. As the result of the second stepof analysis, the strategies and patterns and ideas of spacewere founded as typical cultural themes. These commonaspects for all participants and typical exemplars wereformed on the basis for discussing the predominant dis-course and process that operate in family caregiving.Thus, in the results section, what and how the partici-pant behaves in relation to the use of space and strategyare examined. For validating contextual data, meaning of the partici- pants' behavior, and analyzing themes, the nurses on theunit were invited to read the text. After description, ana-lyzing theme, and interpreting, the text was returned totheir owners for validation. Ethnic norms were preservedso that participants would not feel dishonored.Participants were made to understand that dialogue andobservation are means of research and that the data willnever be used for any other purposes. The researcher as-sumed no role of superiority during the participant ob-servation and interview process. In order to safeguardtheir privacy, caregiver' names and other identifying in-formation have been altered. Research standards assisted in verifying findings of qualitative research. Three criteria of rigor used in thestudy are credibility, fittingness, and auditability. The de-scriptions of findings that are easily recognized by partic-ipants in this study, as well as other family caregivers,speak to the credibility of the research. Fittingness isconcerned with adherence to research procedure; thefindings of this study reflect the purpose of the study andthe data generated. The purposes, processes, data and re-sults of this study have been widely shared and the deci-sion trail can be followed. The standard of auditabilityhas been met. 1464 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8FINDINGS Becoming a family caregiver The finding indicate that family caregivers have experi- enced in their daily life in the unit as well as caring be-haviors which were shaped by discourses. Family cen-tered idea was the factor guiding the caregiver's behav-iors. They also recount decisions that were debated with-in themselves and with others, often repeatedly such, ashealth condition, economic situations, and family rela-tionships. These inevitably shifted and changed over themonth and years of care giving. Encountering the difference and chaos: being alone Whether they became a family caregiver by choice or demand, participants entered the care system as astranger. As every society has its own culture, hospitalshave their own rules (patterns for behavior) and patternsof behavior. Hospital culture is a professional one.Participants have been \"thrown\" into a new-to-themworld of machinery equipped with technology and spe-cialized professions. These are cultural alien to the care-givers. Between these two caring cultures, the profes-sional hospital and the lay family one, they must endurethe differences and chaos. There is no space for the scared novice family caregiv- er in a speedy, complex, rigid, and formidable profes-sional world. In response, novice family caregivers areoverwhelmed with this unfamiliar environment: It was so terrible. I was absolutely overwhelmed. At first I was so afraid because I didn't know anythingabout my father's condition and what to do for him.He was unconscious. I didn't know whether he wassleeping or dying. A nurse entered the room andtalked to me about something. But, I could not hear aword. She demonstrated the procedure of 'expellingthe sputum' from my father's mouth and neck opening.I 'd never seen a person with a neck opening and nasaltube. How can I do that! As reflected in the above statement, without any knowledge, skill, and experiences- the power basis of thecaring world- participants were overwhelmed. Thesenovice family caregivers were overwhelmed by the speci-fied and complex professional health care system. Therewere various health care personnel on the unit. Thehealth care system specified their role and work. For the novice family caregiver, it was not easy to differentiateamong these personnel. Therefore, they didn't knowwhom to ask for help. An anxious family caregiver wan-dered around the corridor and came to the nurse's sta-tion to ask for help: Participant: Hello, nurse. Could you let me know where can I find some food? I have been starving since yes-terday morning. My husband was admitted yesterday.He had an attack yesterday morning. We were work-ing on a farm. Nursing student: Well. Um, hum, I don't \u2014-. Researcher: You can get some bread or snack in the su- permarket. You can find the supermarket on the 1stfloor. Participant: 1st floor? What floor is this? I am a farmer. I couldn't eat bread or snack. I wish I could have riceand doengangug soup for my breakfast. Researcher: You can have a meal in the hospital restau- rant located on the first floor basement. They open 3times a day. It is 10 now. The restaurant is closed.What room is your husband in? What is the roomnumber? Participant: 53-Ai. What - Well I \u2014- what is it-the last number. Ah I can't remember the last one. Researcher: Ah Ha. Your husband is staying in the other ward of this floor. It is a ward of this unit. So, you canhave a meal in the resting room located at the end ofthis corridor. But, you should prepare food by yourselfin the kitchen. Participant: It was so sudden. I'd never expected it. I couldn't prepare anything. Clothes, foods\u2014. I am sohungry. Oh. The breakfast is over. Now, I have to waitfor lunch. There were nurses in the corridor. The family caregiver couldn't differentiate between the nurse and the student.On admission day, a nurse gave her an orientation in-cluding when and how she could use the dining hall,kitchen, and resting room for meals. On her husband'sbedside table, there was a pamphlet entitled, \"For youradmission and successful hospital life\" Professional dominance, the authority held by the medical profession, might serves in both the therapeuticencounter and in the border public sphere to maintain asocial distance between the professional and the patient.By the virtue of \"custom centered health care\" polices Cho The Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit 1465of the hospital, most of the barriers between the health personnel and the family caregivers were left out.However, the power struggle between the formal caringprofessional and informal private caretaker made anovice family caregiver bewildered, embarrassed, orconfused. The private caretaker hired by a patient and charged for personal care to their patient such as personal hy-giene, clothing, back care, and feeding. They are infor-mal care personnel and included in a lay care system.Often these informal workers tend to act in an unprofes-sional manner, aggressive towards their patients and oth-er professional staff, and are frustrated in nature. For ex-ample, some private caretakers refused to comply withthe unit manager's orders such as to wear a gown; keep areport line; to not leave the patient; and practice correctcaring methods. In front of the nurse, the private care-taker submitted to the nurses' order. In the absence ofnurses, however, they pretended to themselves to bemedical professionals and practiced nursing care andmedical treatment. They persisted in their procedureseven after the nurse announced it was harmful. Theytried to destroy a line of order by reporting patient'ssymptoms and signs to the doctor and requesting a doc-tor's prescription. These private caretakers recommend-ed to the family caregivers or patient's family a treat-ment modality such as acupuncture, physical therapy, orfolk remedy. Occasionally, these insurgents advise tonovice family caregivers \"Don't request nurses becausethey are not productive. The nursing students might beharmful because they know nothing\" and suggest thatfamily caregivers follow their technique. Very often, pri-vate caretakers ordered nursing students: \"You novice!Don't touch my patient. He should take a rest.\" As a re-sult, family caregivers couldn't differentiate the role andactivities of other family caregivers, private caretakers,and formal caring personnel. Furthermore, these private caretakers used medical terminology such as \"saction (incorrect term of suc-tion)\" to differentiate themselves from a lay caregiver,family caregiver, and to boost their confidence. Thenurse's aids also used medical terminology to differenti-ate themselves from lay caregivers. On the other hand,nurses tried to use indigenous terms to help the patient'sunderstanding as reflected in a morning care situation: Patient: Hey! Give me a jagupbook (cloth for working). I need one today.Nurse's aid: Jagupbok? Please give zoobong (trousers) Yes. Here is a zoobong . For the nurse's aid and private caretaker, their jargon is a symbol of professional power. The use of medicalterms or jargon is a means for keeping a group bound-ary. As a result, family caregivers are bewildered in a'word festival'. These novice family caregivers found themselves pow- erless and attempted to adapt to this chaotic 'their'world by a passive assimilation strategy. As a participant,family caregivers yield under pressure of vested power: It was harder for me to endure the complaints of a pri- vate caretaker. She complained about noise from suc-tioning disturbed her sleeping. For a few weeks, my fa-ther had a lot of sputum. I need to do suction day andnight. Of course I was so sorry for the other patientsand caregiver in the room. What should I do? Therewere many people in the room. But, I felt I was alonein the clouds. I couldn't say a word even though Ithought their demand was unfair. I also didn't under-stand the nurse's admission orientation. But, I didn'task the nurse to explain once more because I couldn'tunderstand their jargon. I just said \"yes\", and followedtheir orders. The novice family caregivers followed the procedures of the formal health personnel. They even tried to usethe personnel's term as we can see in a dialogue: Participant: please give me a - what should I say-. Ah- Ah. Hum Ah\u2014\u2014\u2014. Nurse: Can I help you? What do you want?Participant: Ah. Ai. Dress? Utjeogory ? What can I say? Nurse: Ah ha! Upper wear! Did your wife wet her shirt- waist? Here is a Whaneeu(cloth for patient). Participant: Oh yes. You are right! Whaneeu ! He was trying to be involved in the care personnel's group by using the personnel's terminology as the pri-vate caretakers did. In the participant's world, there is aformula: \"you=right, me=wrong\" In this stage, participants tried to discard 'their world' and depended on every personnel to enter the new 1466 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8world of the professional caregiver. These novice family caregivers followed the personnel's advice. They request-ed the nursing student's help for personal care and tech-nical nursing care. They relied on personnel for all thecare, including helping the patient to sit up. All the deci-sions on treatment methods for their patients were dele-gated to the doctor. Thus, all power for caring was givento the professional. For getting help, they came closer to the doctors and all caring personnel. They also tried to keep a personalrelationship with the professionals. For example, thesescared novice family caregivers tried to put their headstogether with the doctor or nurse when they talked. Onthe other hand, they were afraid of getting close to andtouching their patient. A few days after admission, fami-ly caregivers sat down on a couch or stood far from theirpatients. Otherwise, they went around searching forhelp. In an extreme case, a participant failed to assimi-late the care and returned to her home. There were no spaces for a novice family caregivers in a caring world. Family caregivers were 'out-there'. Thus,these novices struggled to blend into this formidableworld using a passive assimilation strategy. Constructing the world of skilled caregiver: being-in As a result of passive assimilation, participants are ac- customed to a new environment and gaining caringskills. This skilled family caregiver encountered caringand daily life \"within-the-world\". They secured theirworld and protected it from outer world of hospital stepby step by: staying with their patients in the same space,searching for information about the patient's healing,searching for selective help, standing up for their patient,making their patient special, and securing their territory. When family caregivers gained caring skill, their sights are turned to their family patient from the health per-sonnel. Participants, once they have tried to stay in thepersonal space of the health personnel, came closer totheir patient. They stayed at the bedside of their patientfor 24hours and their daily activities were designated tofit to the patient's treatment schedule. They lived in aspace of family caregiving. A participant responded to aresearcher's question on a delayed breakfast: Did you take breakfast, professor? Yes. It is too late to have a breakfast. But, it is usual for us. Morningpassed so fast. I am so busy even though I wake upearly in the morning, at 5 o'clock. At that time, thenurses start their work. Check blood pressure, body temperature, and respirations. Ah. They check sugarlevels (blood sugar test) for my husband. After that, Istart work; expelling sputum, bed bathing, skin care,position change, changing diaper, tube feeding or help-ing with a meal\u2014-. We have so much to do in themorning. [How about a bath at 10 or later?] Bath? At10 o'clock? Oh no! We can only use hot water from 7to 9 o'clock. There are several shower booths in anaqua treatment room. All the people in this unit usethe room. So, I should do my work fast to completebathing our patient. After that, I can clean and washmyself for a while. The doctors visit their patients be-tween 9 and 9: 30. During the Dr's rounds, we shouldnot leave our patient. We can have a break after that,between 9:30 and 10. That is our time for takingbreakfast. If I am going to give our patient a goodphysical therapy, I should go to the physical therapyroom before 9 o'clock. She continued in her response to the researcher's ques- tion, \"Why don't you use the resting room for breakfast?It's more comfortable, isn't it?\" by saying: Oh, we certainly know that. There are many conve- nient facilities in the resting room. But, I feel morecomfortable here, near my husband. If I stay there, Imight be very afraid of him falling down, wetting thebed, or calling for me. I need to respond immediatelyto his request. For the skilled caregivers, the resting room and kitchen in the unit is a barrier to keep near the patient. As such,the skilled family caregiver's daily lives within his or herspace are circled as a clock. Participants never quit this'caring clock' even when they know that the patient hasno hope of survival. I know. He couldn't live. The doctor told me\u2014- 'He has no hope'. I think either -. He couldn't get up again.I will continue to do my best nevertheless. There areno other ways. That's my life. For the participant, family caregiving is a way of daily life, not an extraneous or enforced onerous work. Thus,skilled family caregivers never gave up caring for theirpatient. Even though family caregivers are accustomed to tech- Cho The Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit 1467niques for personal caring and a few professional nursing caring techniques, their knowledge and experiences arenot enough to evaluate a patient's health condition andmake decisions for treatment methods. These skilledfamily caregivers did their best for their patient's healing.To do their best, they went around actively searching fortreatment information. They are open to all treatmentmethods: herbal medicine, folk medicine, alternativetherapy, and even religious healing. Herbal medicine isthe most favorable. Very often, family caregivers askedtheir doctor to refer the patient to an herbal doctor.These alternative therapies may result in an improve-ment in the health of the patient, but they may also beharmful. For the family caregivers, to adopt diverse al-ternative healing therapies is an expression that they aredoing their best. Thus the negative effects are not consid-ered seriously. As a participant became a skilled caregiver, they differ- entiate each personnel's role and work. A professionalwas not a participant's hero anymore. Very often, theydid not place trust in the health personnel's nursing careand treatment. These suspicious caregivers persisted intheir methods even though they couldn't understandwhat was going on with their patient's condition anddidn't know what and why a treatment or care was bene-ficial to their patient. They did not depend on health per-sonnel and requested the professional's help selectively: Participant: Hi head nurse, my doctor told me that my brother can start wheelchair ambulation now. Couldyou tell a nurse to help me? Head nurse: Of course, we will do that. I will be there whenever you call me. How about student nurse? Participant: Student? E hum-well-I think \u2014- it would be\u2014 When are you free today? I wish I could start itaround 11: 30. I think it would be good for him to ex-ercise before lunch. For the skilled caregiver, nursing students, once a good caring resource, are not professionals anymore. Withinher world, the caring personnel's role and status haschanged from that of the beginning: a doctor became'my' doctor; a head nurse became a care manager for theparticipant's brother and a co-worker of the family care-giver; staff nurses became direct caregivers and helpersfor a newly introduced caring skill. She is not waiting formedical personnel anymore. Rather, health personnelshould wait to adjust to her caring schedule. The powerrelation in caring between family caregiver and health personnel changed. Family caregivers had the power. Thus, their caring strategy has changed from passive assimilation to \"differentiation\". Their strategy is also re-flected in a pattern of caring behaviors that differentiatesthemselves from other caregivers. They tried to maketheir family special through specific caring techniques.After family caregivers were accustomed to caring skills,they developed patient-specific techniques and imposeda special meaning to it. For example, health personneland private caretaker used a feeding bag for a Levinetube feeding. But, family caregivers persisted in using asyringe instead of a feeding bag. They needed to hold upthe feeding syringe for 15minutes or more to complete atube feeding with a syringe. Family caregivers confessedthe reason: Others use a bag. They hang a bag filled with formula on a pole. During the feeding, they are not concernedwhether the formula dripped or not. Sometimes theyleave the patient or do other things such as talkinggossip with other private caretaker, swing, or cleaningbedside tables. How they can notice a patient's condi-tion and feeling? I know it is more convenient to use aformula bag than a syringe. But, I will never do it. Ithink\u2014 using a bag is-not sincere. I like to care for myhusband with my whole heart. With my tube feedingusing a syringe, I can do my best for him. The trueheart heals a disease. For the private caretakers and nurses, tube feeding is a labor. For the family caregiver, on the other hand, tubefeeding is a means to express and complete their desirefor the best care. Most of the family caregivers washedthe patient's clothes that had already been washed in alaundry. To differentiate their caring from others, andthereby making their patient special, these skilled familycaregivers requested health personnel to give new andclean linen and clothes. They knew that all patients canhave a change of clothes at 10 o'clock. But, they came tothe nurses' station early in the morning and requestedtheir patient's clothes so as to get a new or clean one. Aparticipant washed and pressed clothes with her foot forher husband. She explained the reason as follows: I heard from someone. \"All patient's clothes are washed in a laundry factory. The factory gathers pa-tients' clothes and linens from many hospitals.\" On 1468 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8several occasions, I found dirty and even blood on laundered clothes. I have kept our priest (patient, herhusband) clean-cut. He was always neatly dressed. As Ialways ironed the priest's cloths in my house, I pressedhis cloth with my foot to make it neat. For the family caregiver, her sick family member is not a patient but the person they have loved and respected.Thus, even though a patient has a pathologic body, theperson becomes a social being as a father of a family ora respected leader of a society. Another pattern of caring behavior of the skilled fami- ly caregivers was securing a position to protect themfrom low quality care. Family caregivers tried to keepthe position as a social being as well as a caring con-sumer. To keep their patient's position, they stood for upfor their ill family member. Another means for keeping aposition was expanding and keeping their space. Family caregivers protected the patient's right to have benefits and not to get harmed. Selecting a competenthelper and controlling health personnel and novice fami-ly caregivers' caring is a means to protect their rights asa caring consumer. Participants requested the nursingpersonnel to assist with position change, back massage,and moving a patient. But, they were not welcomed tohelp with tube feeding because of following reason: I am not strong enough to move my brother. Nurses and students are strong. They can help me. It is a sim-ple and trivial work. But, the tube feeding is a very im-portant task. It is a task to put something in. Inside mybrother's body! That's very important for his health.All the diseases came from a disorder of the inside. Wecan't see inside. Back massage or position change arethe work for outside of the body. It can be easily seenand treated. That's not important. Every one can dothat. How can I permit others to do such importantwork! Tube feeding is my job. The participant imposed a value on the human body. Her folk etiology and caring behavior came from thisvalue. For the participant, the disease of the body is seri-ous and the important work for 'inside' is a work of the'inside' person, the family. Thus, the skilled family caregivers refused a vital sign check by the nursing students who became outsiders.They were told, \"not to disturb my husband's (or wife's)rest.\" They prohibited other family caregivers and pri-vate caretaker's behaviors by saying, \"Don't make noise! My patient is sleeping. Don't open the window! My pa-tient is susceptible to a cough. Don't enter my space anddon't touch anything! I need it. I have to live here\" In anextreme case, a family caregiver angered nurses andnursing students during a nurses' morning rounding,with shouting \"Why do you look at my wife? She is notan animal in a zoo!\" As thus, these powerful familycaregivers push caring personnel out of their world andprotect their sick family from a caring they perceived asuseless and even harmful. Family caregivers also keep their territory by securing physical space. As all human society, the family caregiv-er's society has a proxemics, the rules for use of space.At admission, most of the patients use a bed at the en-trance of a room as a new employee is positioned at adesk near the entrance. In this place, patients and familycaregivers feel discomfort and are unstable because theyare open to all people. Skilled family caregivers have aright to move their patient's bed from near the door tonear the window, the 'inside' of the room. In this place,they occupy a wider space than novice caregivers have.They also try to keep a private space by drawing a cur-tain, covering side rails with a sheet, and blocking thefoot side of the bed with a footboard. Very often, thereare struggles among family caregivers over the space. Adominant family caregiver occupied another patient'sspace, and the patient couldn't use the centrally suppliedsuctioning equipment. This occupier projected this prac-tice to health personnel and blamed them: What is a nurse for? They never care for the patient. What on earth! Do they even have a thought? A fool-ish worker might set have one. How clumsy is this! If aperson has a brain, they never installed it here. Nurseshave responsibility to manage a worker. All the central supply equipment was set up on the wall over the patients' bed in a regular setting. In theworld of these skilled family caregivers, there is a formu-la 'me = right, you = wrong'. In their private space, they keep daily necessities such as a washbowl, food, clothes, mirrors, cosmetics, andeven a cooking pan and electronic rice-cooker. Withintheir space, they have their everyday life as a caregiver.Their lives are devoted to the sick family members heal-ing. Skilled family caregivers built their world and con-fined themselves and their patient in this kingdom. Cho The Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit 1469Becoming a hospital family: Being with If skilled family caregivers open the door of their world, they encounter 'our world' and 'being with' thehospital family. In this stage of the process of familycaregiving, the experienced family caregivers internal-ized all their experience and the rules of the hospital.Their caring skill, personal knowledge of caring for theirfamily, and the rules for their behaviors are harmonizedwith professionals and others family caregivers. For theexperienced family caregiver, major power resource ofcaring is not a skill but a wisdom from caring experienceand intuitive knowledge. They do not differentiate themselves from other family caregivers and health personnel any more. Rather, theyencompass an all hospital family. There is openness, con-nection, authentic relations, and amity in the experienceof 'being with'. The authentic family caregivers havetheir sight extended to neighbors. They looked at theirsituation in the context of the whole environment. Forthem, health personnel and other family caregivers arenot objects to struggle and overcome, but colleagues toshare caring, everyday life, and even suffering. At thisstage, all members, the family caregivers, their patient,and the health personnel, are in the same boat. Thus theopen-minded family caregivers became a hospital family. These authentic caregivers do not care for their sick family exclusively anymore. They care with the hospitalfamily: his or her family patient, neighboring familycaregivers and their patients, and co-working health per-sonnel. A participant talked to his wife who stained herdiaper with feces: Oh, my love! Why didn't you tell me, \"Honey, soiled myself\" You can say that. I am here with you. It's mylife to care for you. If I didn't do it (changing diaperand washing), all the sikgu (family) in our room might suffered from a foul smell. It will embarrass you. His wife couldn't say a word and not even hear his voice because she had been in a permanent vegetatestate for 3years. Not a person in the room complained tohim. However, his openness to his wife and other peoplein the room had its eyes toward people's mind. The fami-ly caregiver, who once had been stubborn and closed hisworld to others, became a highly considerate neighbor ofthe hospital families. This generosity came from the con-fidence in themselves, as well as in the health personnel.Their caring skill became more sophisticated through much experience in practical caring. Very often, they findand evaluate the fine changes in the patient's health con-dition more exactly than the health personnel do. As they are experienced and sophisticated in caring skills, their roles become extended. They became a coor-dinator in the hospital family as well as co-workers ofthe health personnel. There are cultural differences be-tween the caring of for-profit health personnel and thepaternalistic family caregiver. The cultural brokers (theexperienced family caregivers) connect with the hospitalfamilies. As their role changed, their caring strategy alsochanged from \"differentiation\" to \"internalization\".Thereby, they became 'being with' the hospital family.Now, they stand for other family caregivers and healthpersonnel as well as his or her patient. One day, after adoctor's rounds, a participant and a ward manager dis-cussed the following: Participant: Did our doctor finish his rounds? Ah\u2014- ha. I was on the stairs. Just for a second. Ah. I should waitfor him in my room. Nurse: Yes. He returned to his office. He has waited for you for 15 minutes. Do you have anything to talk tohim about? May I call him? Participant: Oh. No! I had something to talk to our doc- tor about. But-it's Ok. My wife is badgering me - Nurse: Ah ha! This morning, grandma (participant's wife) looked weak and fatigued, not good. She lookedlike she needs something\u2014- Participant: Yes, she does. Hum - she lost her vigor. Certainly, there is something wrong in her condition.Something wrong is going on. That's an ill omen. Iknow it. She wants to have herbal treatment. Shecoaxed me to talk about it to our doctor. But, I think itis not good for her condition. I had several experiencesof admissions. For spine fracture, stomach surgery, ap-pendicitis etc. According to my experience, westernmedicine is better for her condition. Herbal medicineis not good for such an acute stage of stroke. I know. Isthat right? What's your opinion? Nurse: I agree with you. But, grandma wants to have herbal treatment. I think it is not a bad idea to talk toyour doctor. Just talk to him-your wife wants to haveherbal treatment. Participant: You are right. Yes, I will. But, it might upset our doctor. He is our doctor. Who want to transfer hispatient to another doctor? I don't want to make him 1470 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8disheartened\u2014\u2014 he might misunderstand \u2014 as if we have no confidence in him. Well. It's better to appeaseher. I will try to make my wife understand the situa-tion. This experienced family caregiver is standing up for the patient and the doctor. He is a coordinator betweenhis patient and the health personnel. For the hospitalfamily, the health personnel's needs and position are asimportant as that of his wife. In the world of an experi-enced family caregiver, there is a formula: \"me= right,you= right\" This familiar connection and authentic relation is more frequently expressed among lay caregivers. Patients'family caregivers in a room call each other by kinshipterms such as hyungnim (elder sister-in-law) or au(younger sister-in-law). They shared the suffering and pleasures of their life as well as supplies for daily living.On a patient's recovery such as starting to walk, remov-ing the L-tube, or awakening, they offer a congratulationparty with some cake. If a patient's health conditionworsened, all the patients' family caregivers involvethemselves in caring for the patient. During the absenceof a family caregiver, patients' caregivers are ready toshare personal caring. One morning, a participant wasasking a nurse: I'm gonna drop by my house and come back this after- noon, around 2 or 3 o'clock. I have to clean up thehouse and prepare some foods. My daughter and herhusband will visit tomorrow. An au will feed formula at 10: 30. Could you drop by my husband? Would yousend some nursing students when he needs help at 12o'clock for position changing, and at 2 o'clock for for-mula feeding? The husband of the au has to go to the physical therapy room at 2 pm. So, she couldn't feedmy husband. For the participant, the patients' family caregivers and health personnel are all her caring resources. She is will-ing to involve nursing students in caring personnel. Sheis coordinating these resources for the caring of her hus-band. As thus, she held in all people in the hospital toher world. The skilled caregiver who was dedicated onlyto her or his patient becomes a generous caregiver dedi-cated to all hospital families. Since they have become a hospital family, there are no reasons to struggle to build up a formidable boundary.The experienced family caregivers do not press other pa- tient's family caregivers to give up space. Rather, theyprotect novice family caregivers from the skilled caregiv-er. In a struggle among family caregivers, an experiencedfamily caregiver intervenes in the favor of the novicecaregiver: Au, you are skilled in suction and he (patient) is not wet frequently. The young lady should change her fa-ther's position and diaper all through the night. Anurse visits frequently and conducts suction for him.How difficult for them in this narrow space! Theydon't take a nap all through the night. The experienced family caregivers do not persist in the right to use new and clean clothes and linen anymore.They are pleased to give away their rights to have treat-ment within a convenient schedule or provided with car-ing supplies. For the experienced generous family care-givers a caring environment, the hospital space, the ma-terial for caring and treatment, and the health personnelare not for special patients only, but for the hospital fam-ily. Even though generous family caregivers didn't enforce and intrude on others to keep their position and space,all persons, including health personnel, respect his or herposition and space. The genuineness and openness, notthe physical force or technical skill, is the power of theexperienced coordinator. With this power, the experi-enced family caregivers stand on the top of the hierar-chy. Thus, family centered idea confined within a family (patient and his or her family caregiver) expanded itsrealm to a hospital family. DISCUSSION Family caregivers encountered diverse experiences from when they were newly encountered with profes-sional health care system as a novice to become an ex-perienced caregiver (Figure 1). There is no space for the novice family caregivers in the world of professional caring system of a hospital. Thus, inthe first stage of family caregiving there are two separatedfamilies: patient's family and hospital family. The bound-ary of these two families is differentiated. For the novicefamily caregiver, the professional caring world is too farand formidable to approach. After family caregivers ap-Cho The Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit 1471proached to and entered into the professional realm, they construct a caring world of their own. In this stage of car-ing, they try to keep their world by keeping their bound-ary. Within their caring world, they protect their familyfrom outsiders, the health personnel, and other familycaregivers. Finally, family caregivers open their world tooutsiders. At this stage, two caring world are combinedand harmonized as a hospital family. To provide good care to their family and to adopt themselves to a patriarchal medical market, family care-givers adopt some strategies: passive assimilation by thenovice family caregivers, differentiation by the skilledfamily caregivers, and internalization by the experiencedfamily caregivers. As the family caregivers go on caringfor a devastated family and experience daily life in ahospital, their perspectives also change: 'You are right, Iam wrong', 'You are wrong, I am right', and 'Y ou areright, I am right'. In the process of becoming a hospitalfamily, the power relation also changed: health person-nel dominants, struggling for equalization between fami-ly caregiver and health personnel, and family caregiverdominants. Most of the early studies on family caregiving were sur- vey focused on the stressors in caregiving fed the stereo-type of caregiving as onerous work. In most of earlyqualitative research, family caregiving described as over-whelming, onerous work done by beleaguered saintlywomen. According to Poirer and Ayres (2002), part ofthis image stems from the 19th century, with the unmar-ried daughter, aunt, tireless wife or mother bringing suc- cor and peace to all within her walls. Taking care of one'sfamily with dedication, competence, and equanimity wasseen as natural to women. From the start, this (upper,middle-class, white) image of the intelligent, inspirational,yet totally self- effaced \"angel in the house\" offered a setof psychological contradictions and double binds thathave been the source of much critical revision over thepast two decades (Abel, 2000). In Korean society, the im-age that family caring is the due of a sacrificed powerlesswoman and thereby might be an onerous work seems tostems from the men-centered patriarchal idea. In this study, as we can find in some recent studies, this image is changing. Today both circumstance and choicefind increasing numbers of men are becoming familycaregivers-and adapting with relative ease and willing-ness (Kaye & Applegate, 1990; Neufeld & Harrison,1998; Parsons, 1997). In this study, caring for their fami-ly might be an overwhelming onerous task for thenovice family caregivers and the young daughters forcedinto family caregiving. However, the skilled family care-givers were strong enough to keep their territory andthereby protected their sick family from health person-nel. The experienced family caregivers were respected asa coordinator and a top manager of the lay care system.Their power came from genuineness and openness. Theposition of an experienced family caregiver is that of thehead of a family, the father. The characteristics and im-ages, however, are that of an integrated human being. 1472 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8 Cultural components of family caregiving Process Stage Caring world Relation & Basic idea of Major caring Strategies Major means direction relation resources Becoming Novice Two Health You are Health Passive Dependence Discourse: a family separated personnel right personnel assimilationcaregiver family dominance: Family toward centered ideaprofession Skilled My family in Struggling I am right Family Differentia Protection hospital against caregiver's -tionfamily to health skill personnel: toward my family Experienced Combined, Family We are right Family Internali- Sharing harmonized caregiver caregivers zationHospital dominance: experience family toward both and intuitive world knowledge Figure 1. Cultural map of family caregiving .For some family caregivers, caregiving is an onerous work overriding their usual duties and sacrificing theirneeds. For others, it is the process of human becoming. As Bishop and Scudder (1991) defined caring as a way of being, the experienced family caregivers arrived at theend station through authentic caring. Caring for others isnecessary when they are unable to care for themselves.The necessity for such care gives the caregiver muchpower over the person receiving care. Care can be givenin ways that take self-direction from the one giving care.When we care for others two ways might be taken. Inthe first way, a person will \"leap in\" for another and\"take over for the other.\" This form of care can readilyfoster dependency when the caregiver \"leaps in andtakes away 'care'\". In contrast to dependent care, au-thentic care occurs when the caregiver will \"leap ahead\"in his existential potentiality-for-being, not in order totake away his 'care' but rather to give it back to him au-thentically\". Thus, in authentic care the other is helpedto care for themselves. Family caregiving has often been viewed as supererogatory; that is, as dangerous or burdensomework that is above and beyond the expected responsibili-ties of family membership. This perception was perpetu-ated by a number of published research reports that de-scribed only negative aspects of caregiving. The notionof burden thus became synonymous with caregiving inmuch of the scholarly and popular literature (Callahan,1988; Montgomery, 1989). As recent studies have found,however, caregiving is fulfilling to many people, whowould not give up its rewards to escape its difficulties(Farran, Keeane-Haggerty, Salloway, Kupfere, & Wilken,1991; Given, King, Collins, & Given, 1988; Klein,1989). Most of the participants, except a few sacrificedvictims, were willing to become family caregivers. Forthem, caring for their husbands or wife was a reply to abestowed favor and a means to fulfill their duty as hu-mans. It is also a means to keep a family structure. Thenotion that family caregiving is dangerous also loses itsvoice. Atwood (1978) clearly delineated the ways inwhich families are effectively organized to meet certainneeds of impaired persons in the home, and how theyselectively do not meet other specific needs. The partici-pants of this study also organized the family by selectinga primary family caregiver through a deliberative deci-sional process, and adopted various strategies to givequalified care. The challenges for family caregivers and the healthprofessionals who serve them is to accept that this work can be fulfilling and rewarding even when -and perhapsbecause-it is burdensome while also realizing that thepossibility of such fulfillment should not be demandedof or expected of all family caregivers. In other words,the burden of caregiving should be freely chosen by fam-ily members, women and men alike, with the acknowl-edgement that other family members, friends, andhealth care professionals may be needed to help sustainthis decision. Furthermore, family, friends, and healthcare professionals need to be alert for signals that care-giving must be shared or surrendered, and to help care-givers find the resources necessary to do so. According to Foucault (1991), a critical cultural theo- rist, culture can be reproduced or transformed within so-cial relationships. Cultural practices tend to be repro-duced when hegemonic forces are in place and whenpeople comply with the prevailing order largely becauseit has been taken for granted and accepted. The domi-nant cultural group's agenda goes ahead unchallengedand even unnoticed. Yet culture can also be transformedwhen peoples' consciousness are raised, and they beginto notice hegemony, to realize how dominant groupshave a tendency to silence differences of opinion, and tomarginalize groups that do not conform to mainstreamideas. In this view, power is a resource that is accessibleto all people within society, not just those in authority,and it can be used to challenge and perhaps transformeveryday cultural practice. These phenomena were exposed in the health care cul- ture within the chronic care unit context in which thisstudy is located. At the beginning of family caregiving,formal healthcare personnel had a dominant power. Thenovice caregivers complied with the orders of the power-ful health personnel, and tried to be involved in the newsociety through a passive assimilation. The dependentnovice became an insurgent when they had a powerarmed with caring skills and knowledge of the healthprofession. They began to differentiate the role and ac-tivities of each health personnel and to notice the hierar-chy. With that power, they tried to gain hegemony andto marginalize the weak, the novice family caregiver andeven health personnel. At last, experienced family care-givers construct a new dominant cultural group, the hos-pital family. As we can see in this process of family care-giving, family-centered ideas was the main force to drivethe participants behaviors. They tried to enter, to con-struct and keep, and to live in a family. Cho The Experiences of Family Caregiving in a Chronic Care Unit 1473During this process of family caregiving, successful participants became experienced caregivers, whoopened their world and maintained authentic relation-ships, extending their realm to the hospital family, andsecuring a top hierarchical position in the society.However, not all the family caregivers came to this sta-tion and became winners. Maladapted participants, as anovice family caregiver who failed to adopt into the hos-pital environment, closed their boundaries and stop go-ing through a stage or returned to their world. A formi-dable skilled participant also stopped along the way andclosed his or her boundary. Again, health professionalsneed to be involved and to intervene in the process, andthereby protect family caregivers and patients from anundue sacrificed by a dominant group. Support and helpto find the necessary resources through education andcounseling are needed. The findings in this critical ethnography of family care giving highlights the importance of strong support forthe cultural value of the family centered idea in the areaof professional nursing and family care giving. Duringthe process of becoming an expert family caregiver,nurses and family caregivers worked together as a familywithin the hospital. They even struggled with each otherto be become accepted amongst their colleagues- thestage of 'being-in'- and found themselves interdependentduring most of the process. Nurses need to try to under-stand the process and final results of the process of fami-ly care giving: the process of becoming part of a hospitalfamily. Nurses also need to try to understand the reasonand discourse that shape the behaviors of family caregiving. Then, nurses can be more successful in caring fortheir patients and the patient's family members. Family caregivers need nurses' help during the process of care giving. For the novice family caregiver, nurses areone of strongest of support. During the stage of 'being-in', family caregivers need to accept the nurses' help anduse it as a care resource. In the stage of 'being with', theexpert family caregiver open to and shared with healthpersonnel and other family caregiver. However, they suf-fered from burden of many roles in a hospital family.They need to request nurses' help. Family caregivers arealso nurses' clients as the patients. CONCLUSION As Kavanagh and Knowlden (2004) declared in their narrative analysis of the caring experience, caring is atthe heart of nursing. Today, nurses and family caregivers engage in the work of caring in the clinical setting andthe community. Considering that the primary caregivertakes on much of the patient's care in a hospital, nursesin Korea should understand the family caregiver's caringexperience and daily life in a hospital setting. We canobserve how the lay caring and professional nursing careinteract in this situation. This study aimed to explore theexperiences of family caregivers in a hospital setting. Patients and their families are devastated by chronic illness, hospitalization, and the loss of their job. At theentrance of the professional caring territory, they werenovices who didn't know what to do. Family caregiversshould adapt themselves to this stressful and chaotic en-vironment and care for their family patient in a crisis. Asthey developed caring skills, family caregivers constructa boundary and confined themselves in the caring worldto protect their patient. As they became experiencedcaregivers, they opened the boundaries and maintainedauthentic relations with their patients, health personnel,and other family caregivers. For the experienced familycaregivers, caring is a way of 'human becoming'. Duringthe process of caring, they tried to assimilate, differenti-ate, internalize and coordinate the discourses of domainculture. As thus, paternalistic family caregiving and utili-tarian professional caring are harmonized in the worldof the hospital family. To remain strong and viable, the nursing profession must not only utilize scientific knowledge but must alsolearn the lay care knowledge in order to truly under-stand the patient's meaning of caring behavior. Only inthis way, the culturally congruent nursing care that basedon scientific knowledge can be practiced. The results ofthis research can serve as a cultural knowledge of familycaring. During the process of family caregiving, the relation between family caregiver and health personnel, basicideas of these relation, caring resources, strategies toadaptation, major means of caring are changed. Nurseswho work with family caregivers should adopt and pro-vide different caring strategy according to the stage ofbecoming family caregiver. Not all participants in the study go through the same step of family caregiving. Some are return to formerstage others are lagged in a stage. Probably, they mightcontinue the way to the goal if more opportunity andhelp were given. Nurses can intervene for these stag-gered family caregivers. 1474 Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing Vol. 35, No. 8To produce more detail and useful knowledge for clini- cal nursing, studies focus on why some family caregiverslagged in a stage or return to former stage are needed.Every caregiver, every ailing family member, and everyfamily is unique. Their personalities, ages, values, in-come, housing, and countless other dimensions influencetheir family relationships and their ability or desire totake care of ailing or injured parents, spouses, or chil-dren. It is important for all people involved in familycaregiving to understand, appreciate, and respond tothese complex dynamics. There is no one right way to understand family care- givers and their experience. Professional nurses whowork with families need to develop a theoretical flexibil-ity to accommodate the diverse personalities and situa-tions that they will encounter. Family caregivers need tofind ideas and support in the experiences of others inways that will enable them to think creatively aboutthemselves and their own circumstances. The under-standing of generated discourse analysis is bound bycontext. As any other interpretative qualitative researchmethod, post-structural approaches to inquiry aregrounded in the notion that truth, rather than an objec-tive reality, is local, multiple, and intersubjective. Thisstudy aimed to explore aspects of context-specific familycare practice in what is certainly a partial way. We needmore diverse approaches based on different perspectives,such as feminism or phenomenology. References Aamodt, A. M. (1991). Ethnography and epistemology: generating nursing knowledge. In J. M.
