It just doesn't seem possible. When I was in my 20's and 30's, I thought that 50 was for old people. For better and worse I still feel like I'm in my 30's. However, these days, I see my father's image staring back at me in the mirror and my body certainly requires a bit more maintenance and care. With my oldest child heading off to Emory to start college in just a few months, I'm clearly no spring chicken. But in many ways, I still feel like that same curious young boy who has always followed his passion and inner compass. As I reflect on the last 50 years of my life, and 23 years as a physician, I consistently come back to one emotion which can be summarized in a word: GRATITUDE My wife, Debbie, is the absolute greatest person I have ever met. She is my best friend, my biggest supporter and the one true love of my life. I am blessed with three wonderful, intelligent, loving, and unique children. I am appreciating and enjoying how our relationships continue to evolve as they grow into their pre-teen, teenage and young adult years. I am fortunate to have parents and a sister who are amazingly supportive, and I have been incorporated into Debbie's family as if it was my own. I'm grateful for all my wonderful friendships, many since childhood and some that feel as if they were family. And I am grateful for all of you. I have met so many wonderful people and families through Mindful Pediatrics. I always brag that I have the best patients! Many of you have become my personal friends\u2014and I could easily develop friendships with more of you if we had the time and the circumstances allowed. I wholeheartedly believe that being \"Dr Roy\" is my true calling. Everything that I've lived through, all my challenges and my gifts have uniquely come my way so that I can serve this community and your families. It is my purpose. And I am eternally grateful that many of you have continued to evolve alongside me and my work. "}
