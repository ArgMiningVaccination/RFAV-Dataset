UGT1A1 is the main enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of SN-38 to SN-38G.CONTENTSHSA would like to share with healthcare professionals information regarding the distribution of genetic variants ethnic groups in Singapore. UGT1A1 plays an important role in the drug metabolism of irinotecan. The genetic variants are associated with a higher risk of irinotecan-induced severe neutropenia. Irinotecan is locally registered for the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer and is marketed under the following tradenames Campto\u00ae DBL irinotecan injection concentrate\u00ae (Hospira) Common adverse events associated with irinotecan are diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, and neutropenia. Irinotecan-inducedneutropenia can be severe, occasionally leading to hospitalisation because of a significant risk of contracting life-threatening infections. UGT1A1 variant alleles and their effect on irinotecan metabolism Irinotecan is converted in the body to a metabolite called SN-38, which is 100 to 1000 times more potent than irinotecan itself.1 SN-38 is inactivated bilirubin conjugation. Glucuronidating is UGT1A1 gene, UGT1A1*28 or UGT1A1*6 are present. UGT1A1*28 contains 7, rather than 6, thymine-adenine (TA) repeats in the UGT1A1 promoter region and reduces enzyme expression; UGT1A1*6 represents a nucleotide change from guanine (G) to adenine (A) that causes an amino acid change from glycine to arginine and lowers the enzyme's activity.2 As a result, patients with these variants have higher blood levels of SN-38 after receiving the same dose of irinotecan. Polymorphisms in other UGT genes as well as ABCB1 ,ABCG2 ,ABCC2 and SLCO1B1 genes, which encode proteins involved in irinotecan transport, may also contribute to variation in irinotecan and SN-38 pharmacokinetics and severity of neutropenia, but the evidence is considerably less well developed than for UGT1A1*6 and * 28.3-8 No definitive clinical studies have been published yet on the impact of irinotecan dosage adjustment on response rate based on a patient's genotype. This is an active area of clinical research internationally. Regulatory activities in other countries In 2005, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) amended the product label for Camptosar\u00ae, a brand of irinotecan used in the US, towarn of an increased risk of severe neutropenia among patients who are homozygous forUGT1A1*28 . 9 This decision was reached after reviewing data from several clinical trials that supported the conclusion of a greater risk of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in patientshomozygous for UGT1A1*28 . Their analysis also showed acorrelation between plasmaconcentrations of SN-38 and the probability of experiencing severe neutropenia. 10Another meta-analysis of nine studies (821 subjects) from NorthAmerica and Europe, published in 2007, confirmed a significant association between UGT1A1*28 genotype and severe neutropenia at doses greater than 150 mg/ m2, but no association was seen at lower doses (100-125mg/m2).11In 2008, a clinical study from Taiwan demonstrated that patients who were either heterozygous or homozygous for UGT1A1*28 had a higher rate of neutropenic fever and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.12 continued on Page 2 Photo contributed by National Cancer Centre Adverse Drug Reaction News Published by the Health Products Regulation Group, HSA and the HSA Pharmacovigilance Advisory CommitteeISSN: 0219 - 2152 April 2010 \u008d Vol.12 \u008d No.12 \u008dDOCTORS, DENTISTS & PHARMACISTS CAN CLAIM CONTINUING EDUCATION POINTS FOR READING THE HSA ADR NEWS BULLETIN \u008dcontinued from Page 1 Association between UGT1A1 variant alleles and irinotecan-induced severe neutropenia In Japan, the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) also examined the evidence for an association between UGT1A1 variants and neutropenia. The UGT1A1*28 variant is much less common in Japanese compared to Caucasians (Figure 2). On theother hand, UGT1A1*6 is not uncommon in Japanese, yet is absent in Caucasians (Figure 3). Clinical data obtained in Japanese whowere given irinotecan doses ranging from 60 to 150mg/m 2 demonstrated that patients who were homozygous for UGT1A1*6 orUGT1A1*28 or double heterozygotes (*6/*28) had a lower ability to inactivate SN-38. Furthermore, the rate of Grade 3 or 4neutropenia was 80% in homozygotes or double heterozygotes,24% . In 2008, PMDA updated its product label for irinotecan to alert prescribers of the association between increased risk of serious adverse events andUGT1A1*6 and *28 variants. 15 Local Context HSA has in consultation with the Pharmacogenetics Advisory Committee, reviewed the distribution of UGT1A1 variants in the three major ethnic groups of Singapore \u2014 Chinese, Malay, andIndian using data from the National Cancer Centre 16,17 the National University Hospital,18 and the Singapore Genome Variation Project.19 Among Singapore Indians, the genotype distribution of theUGT1A1*28 variant is comparable to Caucasians (Figure 2), while among Singapore Chinese, the genotype distribution of the UGT1A1*6 variant is similar to Japanese (Figure 3). The prevalence of double heterozygotes (*6/*28) in Singapore is 6.9%, 1.2% and 2.9% in Chinese, Malays and Indians, respectively. 18 In view of the available evidence of greater risk of irinotecan toxicityassociated with UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 variants and its potential impact on our local population, the HSA PharmacogeneticsAdvisory Committee has advised that the package inserts foririnotecan be updated. Consequently, the package inserts of all irinotecan-containing products would be updated to include the following cautionary statements:\"The active metabolite of irinotecan, SN-38, is metabolized predominantly by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT). It has been reported that patients who are (UGT1A1*6/*6 or UGT1A1*28/*28) or heterozygous (UGT1A1*6/*28) in alleleUGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28 of UGT may be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions (especially neutropenia) caused by reduced glucuronidation of SN-38. Added caution should be exercised whenadministering in such patients.\" A genotyping test for UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 variants is available at the National Cancer Centre, Tel: (6436-8320), and testresults will be returned within 48 hours. The era of genomics is producing an abundance of information about genetic variation within and across populations. As studies gradually dissect the information and establish linkages betweengenetic variations and response to drugs, they add to a body of knowledge that will help physicians tailor therapies for the individual characteristics of their patients.

ER niacin/laropiprant is a lipid-lowering agent indicated for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It contains a combination of ER niacin, a lipid-modifying agent and laropiprant, a potent, selective antagonist the prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) receptor subtype 1 (DP1). Laropiprant is a novel agent that is added to the combination to suppress the PGD2 mediated flushing that is associated with the use of niacin. Tredaptive\u00ae has been licensed for use in Singapore since March 2009. Myopathy Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are knownadverse effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and the risk increases with higher doses and concomitant use of certain CYP3A4 inhibitors such as gemfibrozil and ciclosporin. Clinical trial data from 41,050 patients, whereby approximately 60% of them were treated with simvastatin for at least four years showed that the incidence of myopathy was approximately 0.02%, 0.08% and 0.53% at the doses of 20, 40 and 80mg/day respectively. 1 HPS2-THRIVE study HPS2-THRIVE is a double blind, randomised placebo controlled study to assess the long term clinical effects of increasing HDL- cholesterol with ER niacin/laropiprant in 25,000 patients with pre-existing atherosclerotic vascular disease who were receiving simvastatin 40mg daily (plus ezetimibe 10mg daily, where indicated). This study, sponsored by Oxford University, is currently conducted in China, UK and Scandinavia. The study is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in 2012. (i) Interim safety analysis An interim analysis conducted by the independent safety monitoring committeerevealed that the incidence ofmyopathy amongapproximately overall incidenceof 0.08% reportedin the prescribinginformation for simvastatin 40 mg. 1 However, in approximately 3,900 Chinese patients in the same treatment arm, the incidence of myopathy is higher than expected, with an approximate incidence of 0.9%. The risk of myopathy was not increased among 8,600 Chinese, UK,or Scandinavian patients in the control arm (placebo plus simvastatin 40mg or ezetimibe/simvastatin 10mg/40mg). The events of myopathy among Chinese patients resolved with the discontinuation of therapy. No myopathy or rhabdomyolysis related deaths were observed in any patient cohort. Baseline characteristics of randomised Chinese patients were similar to those of Scandinavian and UK patients except that they tended to be younger, diabetic, abstained from alcohol, had lower Body Mass Indexes (BMIs) and lower total cholesterol. 58% of the Chinese were statin naive as compared to 4% of the Scandinavia/UK patients atthe time of screening. It was noted that the use of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs)was more prevalent among Chinese patients with myopathy vis-\u00e0-vis all randomisedChinese patients (52.9% vs 37.5%). In addition, the following factors: age > 70 years,female gender and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus at baseline were also found to be more prevalent among Chinese patients with myopathy than among the entire Chinese study population. No trend was observed with other variables such as alcohol use,BMI, type or extent of statin use prior to enrolment and the use of ezetimibe as acomponent of the background lipid-modifying therapy. (ii) Conclusion The reason for the higher rate of myopathy in HPS2-THRIVE in the Chinese cohort whowere on concomitant Tredaptive\u00ae and simvastatin 40mg with or without ezetimibe 10mg remains unknown currently. HSA is working with the company to update the local product insert of Tredaptive\u00ae to highlight this interim data on myopathy gatheredfrom the HPS2-THRIVE study. HSA's advisory HSA has not received any local reports of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy associatedwith Tredaptive\u00ae or in combination with statins date. Physicians prescribing thecombined therapy of Tredaptive\u00ae with statins are advised to carefully monitor patients for any signs and symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during the initial months or therapy and when dosage of either drug is increased. Healthcare professionals are strongly encouraged to report adverse reactions of myopathy associated with Tredaptive\u00ae or Tredaptive\u00ae with statins combinationtreatment to the Vigilance Branch of HSA. HSA will continue to monitor the development of this safety issue and update healthcare professionals when new information arises. References 1.

Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5-reductase, an intracellular enzyme (DHT). The inhibition of Type II 5 -reductase results in a decrease in serum and tissue DHT concentrations. Finasteride 5mg is indicated for the treatment and control of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by causing the regression of enlarged prostate thereby improving urinary flow and symptoms associated with BPH. At a lower strength of 1mg, it is indicated for androgenetic alopecia to increase hair growth and prevent hair loss. Finasteride has been licensed in Singapore since 1998 and is available under these brands: Proscar\u00ae and (Novem Healthcare Pte Ltd) UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) In December 2009, the UK MHRA completed a review on the risk of breast cancer in men taking different strengths of finasteride for the various medical conditions, and concluded that an increased risk of male breast cancer associated with finasteride use cannot be excluded.1,2 As a precaution, the package inserts of all finasteride- containing products in the UK were updated to include a warning on the risk of breast cancer. UK MHRA's assessment UK MHRA's review took into consideration data from clinical trialsas well as post-marketing reports of male breast cancer associated with finasteride. In addition, the review also considered whether there was a plausible biological mechanism for male breast cancer to occur with the use of finasteride. (i) Clinical trial data analysis Data from studies of 5mg finasteride were reviewed and these include three placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least four years in duration, uncontrolled open-label extension studies and one short-term (less than one year ) placebo-controlled clinical trial. From the data, 11 cases of male breast cancer were observed, of which three occurred in patients treated with placebo. Of the remaining eight cases, there was a case of male breast cancer recurrence in a patient treated with 5mg finasteride during the short-term clinical trial, two cases of male breast cancer in trials of at least one year in duration and five cases of male breast cancer in patients treated with 5mg finasteride during the placebo-controlled clinical trials of at least four years in duration. In an analysis that included the 10 cases of male breast cancer observed in both controlled and uncontrolled trials of at least one year in duration, although the overall incidence of male breast cancer in patients who received 5mg finasteride was not significantly different compared to patients who received placebo (7.8 per 100,000 patient-years vs. 3.8 per 100,000 patient-years; p=0.328), the data showed that there was a trend towards male breast cancer occurring more frequently in patients who had received finasteride, than in those who did not. No cases of breast cancer were reported in men treated with 1mg finasteride in controlled trials up to five years in duration as well as in open-extension studies up to six years in duration. (ii) Post-marketing reports of male breast cancer As of November 2009, 53 worldwide cases of male breast cancer in patients treated with finasteride have been received by the drug manufacturer, MSD. Of these, 50 occurred in patients aged between 54 to 88 years (mean age: 71 years) treated with Proscar\u00ae 5mg while the remaining three cases occurred in patients treated with Propecia\u00ae 1mg.Of the 50 cases of male breast cancer reported with Proscar\u00ae 5mg, 14 (28%) reports could be properly evaluated due to inadequateinformation, in particular the time to onset of breast cancer. The time to onset of breast cancer was estimated to be approximately 44.4 months (median duration: 36 months), basedon 36 (72%) reports. Out of these 36 reports, 27 (75%) casesoccurred after at least one year of finasteride treatment and nine(25%) cases occurred after less than one year of finasteridetreatment. Of the three cases of male breast cancer reported with Propecia\u00ae 1mg, inadequate information and the relatively short times to onset in these cases makes the causal association between male breastcancer and finasteride unlikely. The time to onset of event was threemonths and six months respectively for two cases but was notknown for the third case. In addition, although finasteride was not approved for use in females, four case reports of female breast cancer were received with \"off-label\" use of finasteride in the United States. The time toonset in the female breast cancer cases ranged from 6 to 12 months,which were relatively short periods of exposure. It is also importantto recognise that under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADR)is a recognised limitation as with all ADR-reporting schemes. (iii) Possible biological mechanism A possible mechanism to the increased risk of breast cancer withfinasteride use could be related to its ability to increase endogenoustestosterone and thus oestradiol levels. By inhibiting Type II 5-reductase, the conversion of testosterone to DHT is prevented, thereby resulting in an increase in testosterone level. As oestrogensin men are derived from the conversion of testosterone to oestradioland androstenedione to oestrone, an increase in testosterone withfinasteride use may lead to a rise in oestradiol levels. Local Situation To date, HSA has not received any local reports of male breast cancerassociated with finasteride. HSA is currently working with thecompanies to update the local package inserts of finasteride toinclude warnings to reflect the above safety issue. Healthcareprofessionals are advised to inform their patients taking finasteride to promptly report any changes in their breast tissue such as lumps, pain, gynaecomastia or nipple discharge to their doctors. Healthcare professionals are also strongly encouraged to report any adverse reactions suspected to be associated with finasteride to the Vigilance Branch of HSA. References 1.

This illegal product was detected through an adverse reaction report submitted by a doctor. Details of the case report A 54 year-old Chinese female was hospitalised after she developed difficultyswallowing and was later diagnosed with supraglottic oedema. It was caused by an aggravation of a neckabscess as her infection was not healing well. The doctor also observed that she had Cushingoid features such as \"moonface\". This prompted the doctor to report his suspicion on the association between the traditional medicine and the adverseeffects experienced by the patient. The patient was reported to have taken Huo Luo Jing Dan for 12 years to relieve arthritic pain. The product was packaged as a Traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM) to improve circulation, to relieve pain,rheumatism and arthritis.Upon steroids bythe patient could havesuppressed her immunityleading to the poor recovery from the infection. The Cushingoidfeatures observed were also signs of long-term steroid consumption. HSA's advisory Healthcare professionals are encouraged to ask their patients about the use ofcomplementary medicine while takingtheir medication history. The informationmay be useful to the doctor in making a diagnosis of the patient's condition and identifying potential adverse eventsassociated with complementary medicines. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) would like to bring to the attention of healthcare professionals, post- marketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients treated with Sitagliptin (Januvia\u00ae, Janumet\u00ae, MSD). Sitagliptin belongs to a drugs known as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. The inhibition of the enzyme DPP-4 slows down the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulintropin polypeptide (GIP) thereby prolonging the action of these hormones in glucose homeostasis. Locally, sitagliptin has been licensed as a single agent, under the brand name Januvia\u00ae since April 2007, and as a combination product with metformin under the brand name Janumet\u00ae since April 2008. Post-marketing reports of pancreatitis1, 2 Between October 2006 and February 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been receiving post-market reports of acute pancreatitis in patients treated with sitagliptin and sitagliptin/metformin. As of 9 February 2009, a total of 88 cases of acute pancreatitis were received by the US FDA, including two cases of haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis. The most commonadverse events reported were abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Of these 88 cases of acute pancreatitis, hospitalisation was reported in 58 (66%) patients, four of which were critical cases admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Both patients with haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis required extended stay in the hospital with medical management in the ICU. Further analysis of the reported cases found that 19 (22%) cases of pancreatitis occurred within 30 days of starting sitagliptin or sitagliptin/metformin. A positive de-challenge was also seen in 47 (53%) cases where pancreatitis resolved once sitagliptin was discontinued. It was also noted that 45 (51%) of these cases were associated with at least one other risk factor for developing pancreatitis, such as obesity, high cholesterol and/or high triglycerides. Actions taken by US FDA The US FDA is working with the company to revise the prescribing information in the package inserts of sitagliptin and sitagliptin/ metformin to alert healthcare professionals of this potentially serious adverse event. The prescribing information will be updated to include post-marketing reports of acute pancreatitis such as fatal and non-fatal haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis. Healthcare professionals are also advised to monitor patients carefully for the development of pancreatitis after initiation and dosage increments of sitagliptin, andto discontinue sitagliptin or sitagliptin/metformin if pancreatitis is suspected while using these products. Sitagliptin has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Therefore, it is not known whether these patients are at an increased risk for developing pancreatitis and the medication should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis. Local situation and HSA's advisory To date, HSA has not received any local reports of acute pancreatitis associated with Januvia\u00aeor Janumet\u00ae. The local package inserts for Januvia\u00ae and Janumet\u00ae are being updated with the post-marketing reports of pancreatitis. Physicians are encouraged to monitor their patients carefully for the development of pancreatitis after the initiation or dosage increments of sitagliptin and to advise their patients taking Januvia\u00ae or Janumet\u00ae to look out for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis including persistent severe abdominal pain which may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Early recognition is important in reducing adverse health outcomes. When pancreatitis is suspected, Januvia\u00ae or Janumet\u00ae should be discontinued. Healthcare professionals are also encouraged to report adverse reactions suspected to be associated with the use of Januvia\u00ae and Janumet\u00ae to the Vigilance Branch of HSA. References 1.

These reports were further screened and a total of 3,715 reports1 were analysed and captured into the national database. Majority of reports analysed were associated with pharmaceuticals/biologics (90.6%) followed by vaccines (5.9%),complementary medicines (3.4%) and cosmetics (0.1%) There has been a steady increase in the number of reports received and reviewed year on year. Chart A provides a breakdown of thenumber of reports analysed from 2000 to 2009 based on date of receipt and percentage of serious reports . Gender and age Based on the breakdown of the reports according to ethnic groups,Chinese patients constituted the highest proportion (65.1%), followed by Malays (12.2%) and Indians (11.9%). Majority of AEswere reported to occur in patients in the age group between 50 and 69 years. There were more reports of AEs occurring in females (58.7%) than males. Source of AE reports The reviewed reports were mainly from healthcare professionalsworking in the government clinics (47.9%), followed by public hospitals (39.2%), private clinics/hospitals (7.4%), pharmaceutical companies (5.4%) and community pharmacies (0.03%). Review of AE reports Of all the reports reviewed, 48.8% were classified as serious by thereporters. The top 10 suspected active ingredients commonly reported to cause adverse events are listed in Table 1. Most of the AE reported, as classified by system-organ class were skin-related disorders(22.2%), followed by body as a whole (i.e. general disorders such as pain, fever, oedema) (15.5%), and respiratory disorders (10%). More information is shown in Table 2. Drugs suspected of causing serious blood, hepatic and skin adverse reactions are listed in Table 3 on page 7. AE reports associated with H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Vaccines The H1N1 vaccination programme started on 3 November 2009 with the local distribution of Panvax\u00ae followed by Pandemrix\u00ae.As of 28 February 2010, approximately 425,000 doses have been distributed, out of which an estimate of 250,000 doses have been administered, with Panvax\u00ae being used in the majority of patients.As of 28 February 2010, HSA received 152 reports of suspected vaccine adverse events of which 89% were assessed as non-serious. The medianage of the patients was 21 years (range: 5 months to 82 years). The majority of the events occurred within the first threedays of vaccination. Table 4 shows a breakdown of the common vaccine adverse events.Chart A: No. of AE reports reviewed based on date of receipt and % seriousness 1Not all reports received were reviewed as many reports lacked important detailssuch as names of suspected drugs andAE descriptions.

This is consistent with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) finding that the safety profile of the pandemic vaccine is similarto what has been seen in seasonal flu vaccines, based on the over 150 million doses of vaccines that have been distributed. Seventeen reports were assessed as serious by the reporting physicians. They include six reports of allergic reactions of varying severity: a case of anaphylaxis, exacerbation of pre-existing scleritis, Sweet's syndrome, puffy eyes and facial flushing and Churg-Strausssyndrome. Five of these patients have pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma or are known to be allergic to certain medications. Seven other cases include a case of new onset diabetes, a case of dystonia, a case of persistent vomiting, two cases of facial palsyand two cases of H1N1 infection in patients who received vaccination more than two weeks prior to the onset of influenza illness. It is to be noted that no vaccine or drug is 100% effective and vaccinationfailure may still occur in certain instances. Four of the other cases were reported in children and these include a case of high fever, a case of hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodeand two cases of seizures. All the patients have since recovered or are recovering. Other than the reports involving allergies such as anaphylaxis, puffy eyes, facial edema and vomiting which are known occurrences of vaccine adverse events, it cannot be concluded that H1N1 vaccines caused the other serious adverse events as they could be coincidentevents of natural progression of an underlying disease condition. The causality based on isolated cases of individual events cannot be established definitively as there are no confirmatory testsavailable for diagnosing an adverse event. Further observations are needed to confirm the causal link. Reports on adulterated products Through reports submitted by healthcare professionals, the VigilanceBranch was able to detect drug safety problems associated withadulterated products. These prompted three media alerts with consumer advisories that were issued on illegal traditional medicines found to contain undeclared western medicinal ingredients, namelyAir Ikan Haruan (May 2009), Delima Raja Urat & Cao Gen Bai Lin Wan (June 2009), and Huo Luo Jing Dan (December 2009). The adulterants found in these products were corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine, pheniramine; agents such asindomethacin; and/or slimming agents such as sibutramine. Conclusion The effectiveness of the national adverse events monitoring programmerelies primarily on the active participation of healthcare professionalsto submit suspected adverse event reports. In addition, the quality of the report is also important to facilitate the Vigilance Branch to detect potential safety concern of health products in the market. A recent report published by the WHO's Uppsala Monitoring Centre, the WHO collaborating centre for international drug monitoring programme has placed Singapore in the eighth position in terms of the number of valid adverse event reports contributed to the WHOglobal database, with an estimation of about 480 reports contributed per million inhabitants per year between 2004 and 2009. The Vigilance Branch would like to take this opportunity tothank healthcare professionals for your participation in the national adverse event monitoring of health products.Table 3: Drugs suspected of causing serious blood, hepatic and skin adverse reactions Description WHO preferred termSuspected drug (number in bracket represents number of times the drug has been implicated+) Blood Agranulocytosis/ Clozapine (5), Enalapril (1), (2), (1) Amoxacillin Azathioprine Herbal (1), Allopurinol (7), Alprazolam (1), Amoxicillin Atropine (1), disorders toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)/ Benzylpenicillin or And Tazobactam (1), Risperidone (2), Sulpiride (2), Vancomycin (1) + More than one suspected drug may be implicated in a single AE report.Adverse Drug Reaction News \u008d April 2010 \u008d Vol.12 \u008d No.18 \u008dDOCTORS, DENTISTS & PHARMACISTS CAN CLAIM CONTINUING EDUCATION POINTS FOR READING THE HSA ADR NEWS BULLETIN \u008dOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) associated with bisphosphonates The Vigilance Branch of HSA would like to remind healthcare professionals ofthe risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) associated with the use of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates and alsoprovide an update on the local cases of ONJ that HSA has received with bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption, indicated of postmenopausal andcorticosteroid osteoporosis; Paget's disease; hypercalcemia and bone painassociated with metastatic bone disease. The zoledronic acid. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw ONJ, a severe and disabling bone disorder of the jaw, has been reported with the useof bisphosphonates in the medical literature since 2003. 1 To-date, many reports of ONJ from the literature implicate both theintravenous and oral bisphosphonates. 2-4 According to a recent study published in theJournal of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery in 2009, the risk of bisphosphonates-related ONJ is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000. Thisincidence may increase to 1 in 300 after dental extraction. 3 In another article investigating the prevalence of oralbisphosphonate-related ONJ in Asian population, the estimated prevalence of oral bisphosphonate-related ONJ was found tobe 0.05% to 0.07%. 4 The mechanism underlying ONJ is unknown,but it has been postulated thatbisphosphonates may inhibit new vessel formation, thereby resulting in impaired healing of the jawbone tissue. Welldocumented risk factors for ONJ includes a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy,corticosteroids) and co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection, pre-existing oral disease). The typical signsand symptoms include severe jaw pain, soft- tissue swelling and infection, loosening of teeth, and exposed bone. Local situation To date, the Vigilance Branch of HSA hasreceived one report of possible osteomyelitiswith zoledronic acid use and 11 reports of osteonecrosis associated with several types of bisphosphonates - four after intravenousbisphosphonate use, and seven after oral alendronate use. Of the four reports of osteonecrosis concerning intravenousbisphosphonates, three of the reportsimplicated zoledronic acid and one implicated pamidronate. More details of these 12 reports are listed in table 1 below. continued on Page 9 Table 1: Cases of Osteonecrosis associated with bisphosphonates use reported to HSA since 2004 NoAge, Bisphosphonate Indication forDescription of ADRDate Gender used bisphosphonate of onset 1 71, Male Zometa Multiple Experiences jaw pain, X-ray and 24/05/2004 (zoledronate) myeloma scan of reaction.

Warnings on the risk of ONJ have been highlightedin the local package inserts for all bisphosphonates registered locally. Healthcare professionals should consider the need for dental examination with appropriate preventivedentistry for patients with concomitant risk factors for ONJ (eg, cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and poor oral hygiene) before bisphosphonatetreatment. Additionally, physicians are advised to inform patients to avoid invasive dental procedures if possible, while on treatment withbisphosphonates. Dental surgery may exacerbate the condition in patients who develop ONJ while on bisphosphonate treatment. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse reactions suspected to be associated with the use of bisphosphonates to the Vigilance Branchof HSA References 1.

December 2004, Vol 6; No 3continued from Page 8 Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) associated with bisphosphonates HSA would like to remind healthcare professionals of key safety issues associated with the use of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs). There are four ESAs currently registered in Singapore - epoetin alfa (Eprex\u00ae, Johnson & Johnson), epoetin beta (Recormon\u00ae, Roche), darbepoetin (Aranesp\u00ae, Kyowa Hakko Kirin) and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera\u00ae, Roche). All these ESAs, except Mircera\u00ae, are indicated for the treatment of anaemia in patients associated with renal failure and for treatment of anaemia as a result of chemotherapy in cancer patients. Mircera\u00ae is licensed locally only for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease.Safety issues associated with the use of ESAs Shorter time to tumour progression Several studies conducted in cancer patients showed higher mortality or shorter time to tumour progression in patients randomized to receive an ESA as compared to placebo. The types of cancers investigated include breast, headand neck, non-small cell lung cancers. In some of these trials, patients weretreated with ESA to achieve haemoglobin levels > 12g/dL. This level is higherthan the recommended haemoglobin target level for ESA therapy, which is 12g/dL. Other trials included anaemic patients who were not on chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 2 Cardiovascular-related adverse events In 2006, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published an editorial and two clinical studies (CHOIR and CREATE) in patients with chronic renalfailure not on dialysis. The Correction of Haemogloblin and Outcomes in RenalInsufficiency (CHOIR) and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction by Early AnemiaTreatment with Epoetin Beta (CREATE) trials addressed safety concerns with the use of ESAs in the treatment of anaemia of chronic renal failure (CRF). In these studies, patients who were randomised to receive an ESA to achievehigher haemoglobin levels (13.5g/dL in CHOIR and 13.0 to 15.0g/dL in CREATE)experienced more serious adverse cardiovascular failure hospitalisation, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal strokeas compared to those who received an ESA to achieve lower haemoglobin levels (11.3g/dL in CHOIR and 10.5 to 11.5g/dL in CREATE). Thrombovascular adverse events In 2009, the results of a prospective, open-labelled, randomized, parallel- group study at 80 centres were published.3 The study documented a higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis and similar rates of other clinically relevantthrombovascular events with epoetin alfa versus standard of care for bloodconservation in subjects who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation before spinal surgery. The authors recommended that antithrombotic prophylaxis be considered when erythropoietin is used in the surgical setting. As ESAs collectively have the same mechanism of action, the above safety concerns are applicable to all ESAs. Actions taken by other regulatory agencies In the United States and European countries, the product information of ESAs have been updated to reflect the above safety information.4 In addition, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also requires all healthcareprofessionals to discuss the risks associated with the use of ESAs with theirpatients prior to prescribing ESAs. Conclusion To date, there are no local reports of ADR associated with tumour progression or cardiovascular/thrombotic events in cancer patients using ESAs. The local package inserts of the ESAs carry the above mentioned safety information associated with the use of ESAs. Healthcare professionals areadvised that the target haemoglobin concentration for all indications of ESAsshould not exceed 12g/dL.

The objective is to promote effective andcost-efficient disease prevention and control in line with the aims of the National Childhood Immunisation Programme (NCIP). Physicians can log into the system using accounts linked to their MCR numbers toperform notifications as well as check vaccination details of their patients. Parents can use their SingPass to log into NIR andaccess their children's vaccination details. This system has been established since 2003 and is the source of data for studies onChildhood Immunisations. Currently, the system is maintained by the Research & Strategic Planning Division of Health Promotion Board (HPB). Notification of H1N1 vaccination to NIR Towards the end of 2009, the NIR systemwas enhanced to allow for H1N1 vaccination notifications in preparation for the H1N1vaccination exercise. Notification can be done through various means: e-reporting through the HealthProfessional Portal (HPP) and hard-copy forms specially prepared for this purpose. The patient exposure data is important for the benefit-risk assessment of H1N1 vaccines and this registry of all patientsvaccinated would enable theMinistry of Health (MOH) andHSA to keep track of the numberof doses administered and calculate the incidence rate of any adverse event that mightoccur. The data collected wouldalso allow HSA to identify anybatch-related quality issue of thevaccines. As of February 2010, NIR processed records from 1,140 different sources (hospitals, polyclinics, private clinics, etc) and more than 210,000 notifications, out of the 420,000doses distributed. The vaccination data collected showed that majority of the patients who received the H1N1 vaccination were adults, with the highest uptake in the age group of between 35-44 years. Please refer to Chart A for the detailed categorisation of vaccinationuptake by age group. HSA would like to thank all healthcare professionals for filing the notifications with NIR and strongly encourage those who have not done so to submit H1N1 vaccinee particulars, including the batch number of the vaccine to NIR. The data captured would ensure anaccurate profiling of the safety of H1N1 vaccines. The editorial team would like to thank Mr Andrew Chong, Senior Manager from the Research & Strategic Planning Division of the Health Promotion Board for his contribution to the above article. Cessation of the marketing of Mediaxal\u00ae in Singapore In May 2009, the French Medicines Agency (AFSSAPS) identified very rare cases of cardiac valvular disorders associated with the use of benfluorex (Mediaxal\u00ae, Servier) during its routine post-marketing surveillance. This prompted the re-evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio of the product by the AFSSAPS, which led to the agency's decision to suspend the marketing authorisation of Mediaxal\u00ae in France on 24 November 2009 and cease exportations of the product from 30 November 2009. Servier Laboratories has also stopped the marketing of Mediaxal\u00ae in Singapore as a consequence of the AFSSAPS' decision. Background Benfluorex is an antihyperlipidaemic agent that is used for decreasing the intestinal absorption of triglycerides, decrease lipid synthesis and also facilitate the cellular penetration and utilisation of glucose. It is a derivative of fenfluramine with an appetite suppressant action, which is the reason for its preferential use in overweight type 2 diabetic patients. Mediaxal\u00ae has been marketed in France for at least 30 years as an adjuvant to dietary control in the treatment of overweight type 2 diabetic patients. Cases of cardiac valve disease Between its launch in 1976 and September 2009, a total of 45 cases of cardiac valve disease in patients exposed to benfluorex had been reported to the French national pharmacovigilance system. At the end of September 2009, the AFSSAPS was informed of the preliminary results of the REGULATE Study, carried out by Servier laboratories, which had been initiated before the emergence of the safety signal. The objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of two antidiabetic agents, benfluorex and pioglitazone, as adjuncts to sulphonylurea therapy over a 52-week period.A total of 847 type 2 diabetic patients were included. The preliminary results, based on the comparison of echocardiographic examinations at baseline and after 1 year of treatment, showedthe emergence of functional valvular abnormalities that were trivialbut occurred more frequently withpioglitazone (26.5% vs. 10.9%; p<0.0001). Morphological valveabnormalities were also observed twice as often with benfluorex than with the comparator (2.6% vs. 1.3%; p<0.264). Regulatory actions taken The French Marketing Authorisation Committee examined all data related to the benefit and risk of benfluorex in its current useconditions as \"adjuvant to appropriate diet in overweight diabetics\"and concluded that the modest efficacy data in the managementof type 2 diabetes does not outweigh the risk of cardiac valvedisease. The French Committee hence suspended the marketing authorisation for proprietary medicinal products containing benfluorex with effect from 30 November 2009. Local situation Mediaxal\u00ae has been registered in Singapore since June 1990 forthe treatment of abnormalities of lipid metabolism, which is adifferent indication from that in France. To date, HSA has not receivedany adverse reaction reports associated with the use of Mediaxal\u00ae. In view that the cessation of exportation of Mediaxal\u00ae from France will affect the supply of Mediaxal\u00ae to Singapore, Servier hasvoluntarily ceased the marketing of this product locally with effectfrom 30 November 2009. Physicians who have prescribedMediaxal\u00ae to their patients were advised to re-evaluate thetreatment of their patients and to switch to appropriate alternative therapies.% Vaccination Uptake by Age Group Chart A: Vaccination uptake by age groupApril 2010 \u008d Vol.12 \u008d No.1\u008d Adverse Drug Reaction News11 \u008dDOCTORS, DENTISTS & PHARMACISTS CAN CLAIM CONTINUING EDUCATION POINTS FOR READING THE HSA ADR NEWS BULLETIN \u008dPackage insert amendments reflecting safety issues HSAhas approved the following package insert changes due to safety updates from May 2009to September 2009.

Please also note that there might be some lag timein the availability of the package insert which reflects the latest change(s) 1. Acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel (Coplavix\u00ae, Sanofi- Aventis) Special warnings: Patients with genetically reduced CYP2C19 function have lower systemic exposure to activemetabolite of clopidogrel & diminished antiplatelet responses, generally exhibit higher cardiovascular event rates following myocardial infarction than patients with normal CYP2C19function. Drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 may reduce levels of active metabolite of clopidogrel & reduce its clinical efficacy. Possible interaction between clopidogrel administered concurrently with tenofovir or tenofovir DF- containing DF combination Precautions: dysphagia, oesophageal diseases(including known Barrett's oesophagus), gastritis, reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) & history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Monitor complete blood count of patients with history of clinically significant low WBC or drug- induced leukopenia/neutropenia frequently during 1st fewmonths of therapy & discontinue Abilify\u00ae at 1st sign of clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms/signs of infection & treat promptly. Discontinue Abilify\u00ae in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3) & follow PR QT prolongations, arrhythmias Novartis) Special warning: Activation of latent Polyomavirus infections that may lead toPolyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), esp. to BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), or to JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) observed in patientsreceiving ciclosporin. Often related to high total immunosuppressive burden. Consider in differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal functionor neurological symptoms. Serious &/or fatal outcome reported. 7. Clozapine (Clozaril\u00ae, Novartis) Special precautions: Increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events seen in dementia population though an increased risk also cannot be excludedfor other patient populations. Use with caution in patients with risk factors for stroke & elderly patients with dementia. Studies suggest elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treatedwith antipsychotic drugs are at increased risk of death. Risk factors for higher risk of death include sedation, presence of cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Interactions: CYP-450 1A2inducers eg, tobacco smoke. Plasma clozapine concentration may be increased on sudden smoking cessation. CYP-450 1A2 inhibitors eg, ciprofloxacin. New ADRs: New onset diabetes,obsessive compulsive symptoms, pneumonia & lower respiratory tract infection (potentially fatal). 8. Ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel vaginal ring or arterial thrombosis, with or without hereditary involvement such as Activated Protein C (APC) resistance,antithrombin-III deficiency, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia & antiphospholipid antibodies(anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant). Special increases risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) but increased risk is less thanrisk of VTE in pregnancy estimated as 6 cases per 10,000 pregnancies. VTE is fatal in 1-2% of cases. Most important risk factor for cervical cancer is persistent human papilloma virus(HPV) infection. Long term use may increase risk but may also be due to confounding effects eg, cervical screening & use of barrier contraceptives. Deterioration of Crohn's disease & colitisulcerosa reported in association with use of hormonal contraceptives. Interactions: Concomitant use of antimycotic ovules may increase chance of ring disconnection. May decreaseplasma & tissue concentrations of lamotrigine. New ADRs: Vaginal infection, hypersensitivity, increased appetite, hypoaesthesia, hot dysuria, pollakiuria, penis disorders, amenorrhoea, mass, tenderness,cervical polyp, coital bleeding, dyspareunia, pruritus, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, pelvic discomfort, Premenstrual syndrome, uterinespasm, vaginal burning sensation, vaginal odour, vaginal pain, vulvovaginal dryness, increased blood pressure, irritability, malaise, oedema, sensation of foreign body. 9. Fluticasone (OCD) associated with increased risk of suicide-related events. Conditions may be co-morbid with majordepressive disorder. Same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive disorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with OCD. Close supervisionof patients & those at high risk esp. in early treatment & following dose changes. Clinical trials of antidepressant drugs in adult patients with psychiatric disorders showed increased risk ofsuicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients <25 yrs. Use of fluvoxamine associated with development of akathisia, most likely to occur within 1st fewweeks of treatment. Increasing the dose may be detrimental in such patients. Nausea, sometimes accompanied by vomiting, is the most frequently observed symptom associated withfluvoxamine treatment. Usually diminishes within 1st 2 weeks of treatment. Withdrawal reactions may occur on stopping therapy. Symptoms reported: dizziness, paraesthesia, suicidal ideation & suicidal behaviours reported during therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. 11. Fusidic acid (Fucidin\u00ae, Leo Pharma) Contraindication: Concomitant systemic Fucidin\u00ae & HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors causes significantly increased plasma concentrations of both agents which may result in elevation of creatine kinaselevel & risk of rhabdomyolysis, muscle weakness & pain. ADR: Rhabdomyolysis. 12. Glucagon (Glucagen\u00ae, Novo Nordisk) Contraindication: Hypersensitivity to lactose. Special warnings: Persons givenglucagon in connection with diagnostic procedures may experience discomfort e.g. nausea hypoglycaemia & BP changes, esp. if they have been fasting. 13. Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hiberix\u00ae, GSK) Warnings & precautions: Potential risk of apnoea & need forrespiratory monitoring for 48-72h should be considered whenadministering primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born = 28 weeks of gestation) & esp. for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. Vaccination shouldnot be withheld or delayed in this group of infants. New ADRs reported post-market: Anaphylactic injection, somnolence, apnoea in very premature infants (= 28 weeks of gestation), urticaria, extensive swelling of vaccinated limb,injection site induration. 14. Irbesartan (Aprovel\u00ae, Sanofi-Aventis) Special warning: Not to be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued therapy with angiotensin II receptor antagonists considered essential,patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments with established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, stop treatmentimmediately, start alternative therapy if required. Pregnancy: Not recommended during 1st trimester. Contraindicated in 2nd & 3rd trimesters.15. Montelukast (Singulair\u00ae, MSD) New Upper cholestatic, hepatocellular & mixed-pattern & possibility of resultantgangrene. Subcutaneous administration is contraindicated, as solution is an irritant & may produce necrotic lesions. Precautions: Promethazine is highly caustic to intima of bloodvessels & surrounding tissues. IV administration can cause severetissue injury including gangrene, which may require surgicalintervention including fasciotomy, skin graft, &/or tissue injury injection, & intraneuronal or perineuronal infiltration. Prescriber should be aware of early signof tissue injury including burning or pain at injection site,phlebitis, swelling & blistering. Stop injections immediately ifsymptoms occur. Extreme care is required, if administered via avenous access site in the hand or wrist. All routes of administration can cause damage to tissues. Administer promethazine intravenously if benefits outweigh risks in anindividual patient eg, in emergency situations where IM injectionsare contraindicated. Extreme care must be taken to avoidextravasation or intra-arterial injection. Stop injectionsimmediately if patient complains of pain during injection. Rapid IV infusion may cause transient fall in BP & may increase risk of severe tissue injuries. 18. Sodium valproate (Epilim\u00ae, Sanofi-Aventis) Special warning: Counsel female patients of childbearing potentialregarding risks associated with pregnancy due to potentialteratogenic risk to foetus. Interaction: Panipenem. Undesirableeffects: Hyponatraemia & enuresis (very rare).

Sorafenib (Nexavar\u00ae, Bayer) Special warning: Co- administration of neomycin may cause decrease in sorafenibbioavailability. New ADRs: & precautions: Serious neuropsychiatric symptoms reported post-market:Changes in mood (including depression & mania), psychosis,hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation,aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, & panic, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, & completed suicide. Reported cases may have been complicated by symptoms of nicotine withdrawal in patientswho stopped smoking. Depression, rarely including suicidalideation, reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessationattempt without medication. Symptoms have occurred in patientstaking Champix\u00ae who continued to smoke, most during treatment, some following discontinuation. Events have occurred in patients with & without pre-existing psychiatric disease; somepatients have experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses.Safety & efficacy not established in patients with seriouspsychiatric illness e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, & majordepressive disorder. Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, extremities, & neck (throat & larynx) reported post- market. Infrequent reports of life-threatening angioedemarequiring emergent medical attention due to respiratorycompromise. Other post-market Rare but serious skinreactions, including SJS & erythema multiforme; traffic accidents,near-miss accidents in traffic, or other accidental injuries. 22. Varicella virus vaccine (Varivax\u00ae, MSD) rosuvastatin, vitamin K& thus increase coumarin anticoagulant activity. More frequentmonitoring of coagulation status may be required in change inintake of some foods, food supplements, vitamin supplements,fruit juices, teas, & herbal medicines (eg, green leafy vegetables,broccoli, cranberry juice, glucosamine) as these may affectanticoagulant response.Adverse No.1 \u008dTHE PHARMACOVIGILANCE BRANCH IS NOW CALLED VIGILANCE BRANCH AS IT HAS EXPANDED ITS SCOPE OF SAFETY MONITORING TO INCLUDE MEDICA L DEVICES. \u008d12 with known cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, the Committeeconsidered that an increased risk can also apply to patients for whom sibutramine could be prescribedbecause obese and overweight patients are likely to be at risk of cardiovascular disease. Following thisrecommendation, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced on 21January 2010 that it would suspend the marketing authorisation of sibutramine. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also reviewed the data and concluded that there was a small increased absolute risk (11.4% of patients using sibutramine versus 10% of patients using placebo) of heart attacks and strokes in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease who are using sibutramine. The FDA did not suspend marketingauthorisation of sibutramine in the US but had requested for the manufacturer to add a new contraindication to the drug label stating that sibutramine is not to be used in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, including those with a history of coronary arterydisease, congestive heart failure, tachycardia, peripheral arterial artery disease, arrhythmia or cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) and inadequately controlled hypertension (>145/90 mmHg). The US FDA is also awaiting the full study report of theSCOUT study before making further regulatory decisions. Besides the US FDA, other regulatory agencies such as Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and New Zealand's Medsafe have also not withdrawn sibutraminefrom their markets. Local status In Singapore, all four licensed sibutramine-containing products currently carry sufficient risk warnings on cardiovascular safety. Sibutramine is contraindicated in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, tachycardia, peripheralarterial artery disease, arrhythmia or cerebrovascular disease (stroke or TIA) and inadequately controlled hypertension (>145/90 mmHg). To date, HSA has received three cardiovascular system-related adverse reaction reports that were associated with the use of sibutramine. In these three reports, patients eitherhad a slight elevation in blood pressure or palpitation following the consumption of sibutramine. All three patients have recovered following the discontinuation of the use of sibutramine products. Healthcare professionals are strongly advised to adhere to the licensed indications of sibutramine and not prescribe the drug to patients with the above mentioned contraindications. Based on our review, sibutramine products in Singapore currently carrysufficient warnings with regard to cardiovascular safety. HSA awaits the full study report to determine if further regulatory actions are needed to minimise the risk associated with the product. Appropriate recommendations will be made upon completion of this review References 1. http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/Safetywarningsalertsandrecalls/ Safetywarningsandmessagesformedicines/CON068475 2. http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ ucm198221.htm 3. http://www.ema.eur opa.eu/pdfs/human/refer ral/sibutramine/3940810en.pdfSibutramine and cardiovascular risk - An interim regulatory update Editor-in-Chief Ms Chan Cheng Leng, BSc (Pharm) Adena Joo Deoon Clinical Hiok Hee Clinical A/Prof. Gilbert Lau Kwang Fatt Dr Lee Kheng HockEnquiries, comments and suggestions to: Vigilance Branch Health Products Regulation GroupHealth Sciences Authority 11 not to be reproduced in part or in whole, without prior written approval fromthe editor.

Sibutramine is licensed in Singapore for use as an adjunctive therapy within a weightmanagement programme for obesity (BMI 30kg/m 2 or higher), or overweight patients (BMI 27kg/m2 or higher) if there are associated obesity-related risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or disorders in lipid metabolism. It is marketed locally asReductil\u00ae (Abbott), Ectiva\u00ae (Abbott), Reduxade\u00ae (Abbott) and Slenfig\u00ae (Apotheca Marketing). The SCOUT study and regulatory actions taken overseas The SCOUT study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study in approximately 10,000 obese andoverweight patients with cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes treated over a six year period. The results of the studyshowed that patients treated with sibutramine experienced a 16% increased relative risk of cardiovascular events such asmyocardial infarction and stroke compared with placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio 1.161 [95% CI 1.029-1.311]; p=0.016). European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has completed a reviewof sibutramine based on new safety information from a large clinical trial, the SCOUT study and concluded that thecardiovascular risks of sibutramine outweighs its benefits. It was found that the mean weight loss achieved with sibutraminein all clinical trials was modest, with sibutramine decreasing body weight by approximately 2-4 kg more than placebo.During the review, CHMP also noted that the use of sibutramine in the SCOUT study for most of the patients was not inaccordance with its prescribing information, as sibutramine is contraindicated in patients "}
