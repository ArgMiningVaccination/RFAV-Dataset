FREE MINI CLASS-DEMO T'ai Chi is an ancient Chinese discipline consisting of slow meditative movements. T'ai Chi tones the muscles, increases breathing capacity, lowers stress levels, improves organ function and corrects poor posture. All these things help the body maximize its self-healing potential. T'ai Chi provides more medical benefits than any other single exercise. For aging Americans, preventing falls is a major concern. More than 30 percent of people age 65 and older have at least one fall per year. The sixth largest cause of death for older Americans is complications from falling injuries. T'ai chi was part of a balance study by Harvard, Yale, The Center for Disease Control, Washington University School of Medicine, and Emory University. T'ai Chi practitioners fell and injured themselves only half as much as those practicing other balance training. This is an amazing finding that can change the lives of older Americans. T'ai Chi Chih is a easy form of T'ai Chi which consists of 19 movements and one pose. It is practiced as a slow motion movement done in a relaxed and flowing manner, which deepens breathing and stimulates circulation. This gentle art appears effortlessly easy, yet is quite profound.
