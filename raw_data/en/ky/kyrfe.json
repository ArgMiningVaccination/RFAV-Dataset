There are many causes, including medicines, autoimmune or congenital disorders, infections, transfusions and toxins1. Symptoms can include weakness, dizziness, dyspnoea, jaundice, dark urine, mild pallor or splenomegaly2. Severe haemolysis can cause hepatosplenomegaly, haemoglobinuria and heart failure2. Rarely, immune haemolytic anaemia How can medicines cause haemolytic anaemia? Haemolytic anaemia may occur within hours of exposure to a medicine or after several months of exposure3. There are two main mechanisms by which medicines can cause haemolytic anaemia: immune haemolysis and oxidative damage5. Immune haemolysis Immune haemolysis generally refers to RBC destruction by autoantibodies and/or complement proteins bound to the RBC surface1. The medicine may alter antigens on the RBC, resulting in the production of autoantibodies that cross-react with the unaltered antigen, or the medicine may associate with structures on the red cell and be part of the antigen in a haptenic reaction6. More than 130 medicines have been associated with immune haemolytic anaemia but the most commonly reported cephalosporins, diclofenac, has been reported following high-dose infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin due to the presence of anti-A, anti-B, and occasionally anti-D or other erythrocyte antibodies in the product7. These antibodies coat recipient RBC, producing immune, but not autoimmune haemolysis5. Oxidative damage Medicines with oxidative potential can cause haemolytic anaemia in all patients, but those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (and other inherited conditions) are at higher risk5. G6PD deficiency is an inherited disorder caused by a genetic defect in the RBC enzyme G6PD, which protects RBCs from oxidative injury8. Medicines with oxidative potential that may be unsafe for patients with G6PD dapsone, methylene blue, nitrofurantoin, primaquine, quinolones, rasburicase and sulphonamides5,9. Clinical and laboratory findings There is no single specific diagnostic test for haemolytic anaemia1. Patients with haemolytic anaemia usually have an increased reticulocyte count that is not explained by recent bleeding or recent correction of iron deficiency or other nutrient deficiency1. Patients may also have evidence of RBC destruction, including increased lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and RBC shape changes on the peripheral blood smear1. Immune haemolysis is characterised by a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT; also called direct Coombs test) and/or a positive indirect antiglobulin test (also called indirect Coombs test)1. Management In cases of unexplained haemolytic anaemia, consider medicines as a possible cause. Check the data sheet to determine whether haemolytic anaemia is a known reaction for that medicine ( [data sheets are available on the Medsafe website](../../../Medicines/infoSearch.asp)). Management of haemolytic anaemia is dependent on the cause and severity. Sometimes, discontinuation of the medicine is sufficient. In other cases, interventions, such as transfusion, may be required. Consult a haematologist or transfusion medicine specialist for advice. New Zealand reports Since 2010, the Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) has received 51 reports (with 59 suspected medicines) where the reported reactions included haemolytic anaemia and/or a positive direct Coombs test. Table 1 shows the medicines most frequently reported to CARM, and the number of positive dechallenges (withdrawal of medicine and cessation of symptoms) and rechallenges (restarting the medicine and recurrence of symptoms). Table 1: Medicines most frequently reported to CARM for haemolytic anaemia and/or a positive direct Coombs test, 1 January 2010 to 30 withdrawal of the medicine and cessation of symptoms. - Positive rechallenge: restart the medicine and recurrence of symptoms.
