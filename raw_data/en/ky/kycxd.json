Unlike conventional T cells, which respond to foreign peptides presented by MHC class or molecules through interaction with their TCR, NKT cells recognize antigenic glycolipids presented by the MHC class molecule Mice with deletion of CD1d gene eradicates NKT cells including both type and type . Because the positive selection of these two NKT cell subtypes is strictly or symbiotic microor- ganism has commonly been used to identify and activate NKT cells in vitro. Recently, several endogenous mammalian self lipids have been defined as CD1d ligands recognized by NKT cells, including isoglobotrihexosylceramide (i Gb3) and other phosphatidyl inositol compounds, but these are still controver- sial and need to be further confirmed [5, 6]. However, we found that the infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but not human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1), can profoundly pro-mote EBV-associated CD8 + NKT cell development in humans and human-thymus/liver-SCID (hu-thym/liv-SCID) chimeras, suggesting whether other types of antigen are involved in dif- ferentiation and maturation of NKT cells is still unknown [7-9]. Unlike the T cells, unconventional glycolipid -reactive NKT cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity set the keynote and the tone for the subsequent adaptive immune responses through expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines in response to glyco- lipid antigens. After activation, cells rapidly produce Th1, cytokines and various chemokines, as well as up-regulate co-stimulatory molecules to respond to the infections, tumors and autoimmune disorders [7, 10-12]. Upon expression of CD4 and CD8 molecules, the NKT cells are divided into two main subpopula- tions including CD4+ and CD4- NKT cells, and the of CD4- NKT cells further subdivided into CD4-CD8- double nega - tive (DN) and CD8+ single positive (SP) NKT cells, which is limited in human beings. It is widely believed that CD8 is expressed on a minor proportion of human NKT cells, but it is usually acquired after egression from the thymus [13]. The finding of limited correlation between human thymic CD4+ NKT cells and peripheral CD4- NKT cells, including DN and CD8+ SP, has raised a requisition on the direct evidence for origin of DN and CD8+ NKT cells. Many papers from independent groups have described that CD4+ NKT cells usually produce both Th1 and CD4- NKT cells including NKT cells are skewed more toward Th1 cytokines[14]. Once it occurs, the initial production of Th1/Th2 cytokines may leads to a cor- responding adaptive immunity towards Th1 or Th2 response, Type natural killer T cells: naturally born for fighting Jin-quan TAN1, 2, #, *, Wei XIAO1, #, Lan HE1, 2, * 1Department of Immunology, and 2Laboratory of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Institute of Allergy and Immune-related Diseases and Center for Medical Research, Wuhan University School of Medicine, Wuhan 430071, China Type natural killer T cells (NKT cells), a subset of CD1d-restricted T cells with invariant V TCR, are characterized by prompt produc - tion of large amounts of Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines upon primary stimulation through the TCR complex. The rapid release of cytokines implies that type NKT cells may play a critical role in modulating the upcoming immune responses, such as anti-tumor response, protection against infection, and autoimmunity. As a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, type NKT cells differentiate and mature upon stimulations to achieve and maintain a homeostasis. Orchestrating with other arms of adaptive immunity, type NKT cells show strong cytotoxic effects in response to various tumors in a direct and/or indirect manner(s). This review will focus primarily on type NKT cell development, homeostasis, and effector functions, especially in anti-tumor immunity, and followed by their potential applications in treatment of cancers.

Concerning the effector functions, NKT cells can mediate both protective and regula - tory immunologic functions, including anti-tumor responses, protection against pathogens, maintenance of transplant tolerance, and inhibition of autoimmunity[16]. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in NKT cell biology, mainly focusing on their development, homeostasis, and effector function in anti-tumor immunity. Basic pathway of NKT cell development It is clear that the NKT cells originate from a common pre - cursor pool of CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes, which have undergone random TCR gene rearrangement and expression[17]. Unlike conventional T cells depend on thymic epithelial cells during positive selection, NKT cell precursors are positively selected by CD1d+ DP thymocytes in the thy - mic cortex[18]. Once the interaction between TCRs expressed on DP thymocytes and self glycolipids presented by CD1d- bearing DP thymocytes occurs, NKT cell precursors undergo consecutive differentiation and maturation stages, including CD24+CD44loNK1.1- (stage 0), CD24loCD44loNK1.1- (stage 1), CD24-CD44hiNK1.1- (stage 2), and CD24-CD44hiNK1.1+ (stage3), and ultimately develop into mature NKT cells[1, 19]. The surface CD8 molecule is constantly down-regulated in total NKT cells during initial stages of development, while CD4 is lost in parts of these cells, which results in generation of CD4+ SP and DN NKT cells, but the actual existence of murine CD8+ SP NKT cells is still unknown. However, a fraction of NKT cells expressing CD8 markers, predominantly CD8, are present in normal persons and healthy people with latent EBV infection[9]. It is likely that the unique cellular and molec- ular composition of the EBV-exposed thymus contributes to the differentiation and development of EBV-induced CD8+ NKT cells[9]. Moreover, expression of co-receptors on NKT cell precursors, which might be more favorable targets, facilitate the selection of NKT cells by invasive pathogens. Thymus appears to be important for generation of intermediate NK1.1- NKT cells in mice, but the majority of NKT cells emigrating from thymus to peripheral organs are NK1.1-, suggesting maturation of NKT cells occurs mainly in the periphery, although the acquisition of the NK receptors NK1.1 (CD161 in humans) or Ly49 is not required for thymic emigration[20]. Once committed to the NKT cell factors, cytokines, chemokines, and costimulatory mol - ecules have been documented that are uniquely required for maturation and homeostasis of NKT cells, but dispensable for conventional T cell development. At least two key control points exist in NKT cell development, which govern NKT cell selection to give rise to immature NKT cells branched from the conventional T cell development pathway and NKT cell matu- ration with a series of phenotypic and functional changes, respectively[3, 21]. The basic pathway of NKT cell development is illustrated in Figure 1. The earliest NKT precursors may also be susceptible to negative selection in the presence of strong agonist ligands. A dose- and time-dependent deletion of NKT cells is induced by the injection of high dose of the glycolipid agonist -GalCer to fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) or persistent injection Figure 1. Basic pathway of NKT cell development. In the thymus, NKT precursors originate from a common precursor pool of CD4+CD8+ (DP) thymocytes, which most likely have undergone random gene rearrangement and expression of TCR from CD4-CD8- (DN) thymocytes. Upon the stimulation of glycolipids presented by CD1d-bearing DP thymocytes, NKT precursors undergo a series of differentiation steps and ultimately generate immature NKT cells. Particularly, human CD8+ SP NKT cells can be induced by EBV challenge from NKT cell precursors, but did not exclude the possibility that CD8+ NKT cells develop from intermediate CD4-CD8- NKT cells NKT cells through up-regulation and/or down- regulation of CD4. Most immature NKT cells gain functional and mature phenotypes in thymus in the support of IL-7 and IL-15 secreted from DCs, and then some emigrate from the thymus and others remaining reside in the thymus. Another pathway suggests that some mature thymic NKT cells also migrate to the periphery. NKT, al Acta Sinicanpg to young adult mice[22]. Similarly, the intrathymic NKT cell development is specifically blocked by the TCR-mediated selective signals, which strongly suggests NKT cells are subject to negative selection if they are highly reactive to self-glyco - lipid ligands during their development[23]. However, whether negative selection of NKT cells really exists in vivo during inherent cell development is still unclear, because -GalCer is not considered to be a natural mammalian product. Further-more, over-expression of CD1d resulted in a thymic deletion of high-affinity CD1d-restricted NKT cells in transgenic mice, as well drastically reduced frequency of NKT cells in FTOC, suggesting negative selection of NKT cells may be influenced by ligand expressing cells in the thymus through altering ligand density. Particularly, CD1d expressing thymic selection of NKT cells, and CD4 + NKT cells formed the majority of these deleted NKT cells[22]. Rarity in humans, even deficiency in mice, of CD8+ SP NKT cells suggests a possible mechanism of CD8-mediated negative selection during CD8+ SP NKT cell development. However, Engel and colleagues believe that the exclusion of CD8+ SP NKT cells from murine NKT cells is a by-product of enhanced expression of CD4 molecules on NKT cells, which is regulated by the transcrip- tion factor Poxviruses and [24]. Controls NKT cell development and homeostasis Complete absence of NKT cells in mice deficient in recombi-nase subunits RAG-1 and RAG-2 or the TCR J18 segment demonstrated that successful rearrangement of TCR gene segments V14 to J18 is absolutely necessary to the subse - quent selection of DP thymocytes [25, 26]. The signaling and transcription factors mentioned below act as master regula- tors on the NKT cell lineage, but distinct from conventional T cells[19]. Retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-t (ROR-t), a transcription factor that induces the expression of antiapop- totic molecule Bcl-x L, allows for rearrangement and expression of distal segments in DP thymocytes, which require multiple excisions dependent an extended DP DP thymocytes but with reduced numbers of NKT cells in the absence of the transcription factor Runx1, suggests that Runx1 is quite likely involved in NKT cell selection or subsequent expansion [17]. Invariant NKT cell precursors are selectively blocked at an immature CD44loNK1.1- stage (stage 0 or 1) in conditional ablation of c-Myc in DP thymocytes, but without any perturbation in the development of conventional T cells. However, transgenic expression of BCL-2 to support cell survival did not rescue NKT cell development in c-Myc knockout (KO) mice unlike that in Runx1 KO mice [29, 30]. These findings imply a c-Myc-mediated intrathymic proliferation wave in immediately early stage of NKT cell development in response to selected signals involving the Slam/Sap/FynT signaling axis [30]. The T box transcription factor T-bet is essen- tial to generation of fully mature V14 NKT cells at the transit of stage 2 to 3, which may be associated with some cytokines such as IL-12, IL-15, matura- NF-B family members are also implicated in NKT cell development downstream of SLAM-Sap-Fyn signaling cascade and/or TCR-mediated signals. The NIK-mediated activation of RelB in thymic stroma is a unique contribution to intact generation of immature NKT cell precursors. Blocking NK-B signaling in precursors leads to an impaired expansion of NKT cells predominantly at the transition of stage 2 to 3 [33]. The deficiency of E protein transcription factor HEB seriously blocked the development of NKT cells at the stage 0 but made no difference to conventional T cells because it failed to regu-late thymocyte survival or distal rearrangements of the TCR chain [34]. Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger transcription fac- tor (PLZF) is responsible for the early stages (stage 1 to 2) of NKT cell maturation and production of the functional cytok- ines, even in the absence of SLAM-SAP-Fyn signaling [35, 36]. Recently, the identification of selective function for the tran-scription factor early growth response 2 (Egr2) in maturation and homeostasis of NKT cells also emphasizes the importance of the calcineurin-NFAT-Egr2 pathway in the development of NKT cells. A majority of NKT cells assembled in the liver may be attributable to Id2, which regulates the expression of chemokine receptor CXCR6 and anti-apoptotic molecules to determine the maturation and localization of NKT cells [37]. Human CD4- NKT cells predominantly response to IL-15, whereas CD4+ NKT cells are more responsive to IL-7 by cou- pling with up-regulated receptors, which is consistent with cytokine signaling pathways initiated by IL-15/IL-15R and IL-7/IL-7R. These pathways play a central role in prolifera-tion and survival of NKT cells, but not conventional T cells [13, 38]. Mice with a deficiency in several genes, including IL-2R (CD122), interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), Fyn, Ets, lymphotoxin (LT) hypomorphphic allele of the NIK located in alymphoplasia (aly/aly), leads to a unique reduc-tion in NKT cell number due to close link between these genes and IL-15/IL-15R signaling pathway. NK-like phenotype is acquired by human NKT cells in thymus and does not require peripheral expansion, which suggests that final maturation of NKT cells is completed mainly in thymus, although it does not exclude that CD161 - NKT thymic emigrants may acquire CD161 in periphery as well[13]. In our study, mouse fetal and neonatal NKT cells homogenously express IL-7R (CD127) and respond vigorously to IL-7 in vitro by proliferating and differentiating into mature CD161+ effector cells. Similarly, the maturation of human CD8+ SP NKT cells is also affected, which suggests that IL-7/IL-7R signaling is responsible for the expansion and maturation of NKT cells during fetal and post- molecule-associated protein (SAP), which is responsible for recruitment and activation of the Src kinase Fyn, leads to a deficiency of NKT cell development and results in X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome in humans [40]. Small microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate basic functions such as cellular proliferation, apoptosis, lineage commitment, and differentia- tion in the immune system as regulatory elements[41]. So the deletion of dicer in DP thymocytes resulted in a Acta Pharmacologica and peripheral com- partments, supporting that dicer-dependent miRNAs play a critical role in differentiation and homeostasis of NKT cells[42]. Although the influence of costimulatory signaling, including CD28/B7 and CD40/CD40L, on NKT cell stimulation is con- troversial, reduced frequency of NKT cells in liver and spleen resulted from the blockage of CD28/B7 signaling pathway in vivo through transgenic CTLA-4Ig expression. This may point to a possibility that these signaling pathways are critical in periphery expansion of NKT cells, though, this remains to be formally investigated [43]. Polarization of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in NKT cells The predominant characteristic of NKT cells is rapid produc- tion of various and Th2 cytokines. The ready mRNA cytokines promise a swift production of copious amounts of Th1 and/or Th2 cytokines following stimulation[15]. Human cord blood exhibits a stronger Th2 response after polyclonal stimulation compared to adult NKT cells. However, neonatal NKT cells could be shifted towards a Th1 response under more polarizing conditions, while adult NKT cells are more resistant to shift in cytokine production [44]. Liver-derived DN NKT cells seem more protective than the ones from spleen and thymus. This suggests that different effects of NKT cells on tumor growth also depend on their tissue of origin[45]. This shift or switch between Th1 and Th2 cytokines produced by NKT cells is possibly a requirement of development, or even a byproduct of maturation. Yuling et al have reported that EBV-induced CD8+ NKT cells are prone to express more IFN- under the stimulation of -GalCer, whereas CD4 - NKT cells bias towards secretion of IL-4 and IL-10, which is in accord with the finding that CD4+ NKT cells have the superior capacity to produce Th2 cytokines over CD4- NKT cells including induce Th1 production[7, 8]. This separate immunoregulatory responses of indi-vidual subset of NKT cells, which could significantly affect the direction of an immune reaction. The detailed information on differences of three distinct functional subpopulations of NKT cells is listed in Table 1. Invariant NKT cells could be induced under different con- ditions to mediate opposite effects by altering the balance of cytokine profiles [4]. Activation of NKT cells after -GalCer treatment can alter the balance of secreted cytokines from a Th2-bias to a Th1-bias[46]. The activation/up-regulation of T-bet and GATA-3 is responsible chro-matin remodeling Th1 and Th2 respectively [31, 47]. IFN-- Table 1.

Recon - stitution of NKT cells from ICOS KO mice to NKT-deficient mice failed to develop airway hyperreactivity, because the ICOS/ICOSL interaction contributes to peripheral homeosta-sis of CD4 + NKT cells and production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13[49]. The Th1 and Th2 effects of periphery NKT cells were abolished in CD28-deficient mice under the stimu - lation of -GalCer, while Th1-like function was suppressed in CD40-deficient mice but with rather enhanced Th2 effect, which suggests that CD28- and CD40-mediated costimula- tory signals differentially contribute to the regulation of Th1 and Th2 functions of NKT cells [50]. Polarization of NKT cells is based on intrinsic DC-mediated modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance, which is mainly dependent on IL-12 or IL-4 produced by mature DCs in vivo. To achieve the Th1/Th2 cytokine bal- ance, a negative feedback loop selectively inhibits prolonged Th1 or Th2 responses of NKT cells through counter-regulation DCs up-regulate MHC class and costimulatory molecules in response to the stimulation of CD40 expressed on NKT cells, and activate NKT cells by autocrine IL-12 to express more IFN-. It is clear that NKT cells that are protective against tumors are skewed toward Th1 cytokines, while type NKT cells sup-press tumor immunosurveillance based on their production of Th2 cytokines [53]. The potentially opposite effect of these two subsets of NKT cells was also determined in CD1d KO mice lacking both subtypes of NKT cells with decreased production of Th1 and Th2 cytokines but J18 KO mice lacking reduced IFN- during murine schistosomiasis [54]. J18 KO mice are more susceptible to tumorigenesis and lack anti-tumor CTLs-mediated responses at the early time point, which demonstrates that NKT cells contribute to the natural anti-tumor immunosurveillance through Th1 cytokines during early tumor growth. However, the stimulation of cells surpresses anti-tumor NKT cells define a new immunoregulatory axis of opposing forces analogous to Th1 and Th2 cells since they not only have opposing functions but also counter-regulate each other, and any alterations of this axis may result in infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and tumors. However, the detailed mechanism of suppress- ing anti-tumor immunosurveillance of type II NKT cells is not possible to define completely. Because it lacks specific mark- ers to determine the selective development of type II NKT cells alone. Importantly, this immunoregulatory axis between type and type NKT cells could be a major determinant in the subsequent immune response to any skewing. NKT cells in tumor immunity Understanding of cross talk between various arms, cells and molecules of the immune system is instrumental in achiev- ing novel immunotherapy protocols for cancers. Type NKT cells mediate both protective and regulatory immune func-tions, including anti-tumor responses, protection against pathogens, maintenance of transplant tolerance and inhibition of autoimmunity, whereas type NKT cells suppress anti-tumor surveillance in certain model systems [16, 56]. A large mount of studies demonstrated the anti-tumor activity of NKT cells stimulated by -GalCer or by IL-12 in vivo[57, 58]. Invari- ant NKT cells induce the so called adjuvant effect on anti-tumor immunity by activating other anti-tumor cytolytic cells mainly through the Th1 cytokine cascades, although NKT cells have their own lytic activity and cause direct lysis of various tumor cells [59, 60]. The numerical and functional alteration of circulating V24+V11+ NKT cells has arisen in patients with different types of tumor. The number of circulating V24 NKT cells significantly decreased in patients with colon can- cer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, renal cell cancer, and melanoma. IFN- producing ability of single NKT cell was preserved, whereas the responsiveness of V24 +V11+ human NKT cells was still low in patients with lung cancer, advanced prostate cancer or other undefined advanced cancers except glioma, even after stimulation with -GalCer or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) [61-64]. Significantly enriched NKT cells in surgically resected specimens of lung tumor and colorectal tumor may explain the decrease of circulating NKT cells in quantity[65, 66]. Some lipid components derived from tumor cell membranes have been demonstrated to bond with CD1d and stimulate NKT hybridoma cells, so the dysfunc- tion NKT cells is possibly attributable to tumor-derived ligands [67]. As the first line responder, NKT cells promptly secrete large amounts of inflammatory cytokines to promote cytotoxic effects in response to antigens in a direct and/or indirect man-ner. Activated NK cells have been well characterized in their ability to directly mediate anti-tumor responses through the delivery of cytotoxic effector molecules such as granzyme and perforin EBV-induced CD8+ NKT remarkably, more perforin than their counterpart CD4+ NKT cells, which suggests a direct tumor cell-killing ability of NKT cells in vivo[9]. NKT cells directly eradicate target cells through cell death inducing ligands FasL and TNF-related apoptotic induced ligand (TRAIL) [69]. The recruitment of leu- kocytes into tissues is dependent on a series of adhesive and activation steps mediated by adhesion molecules and interac- tion of chemokine and chemokine receptors, which restrict their tissue and microenvironmental distribution [70-72]. In this regard, NKT cells resemble effector T cells and of RANTES by NKT cells is impor- tant for the recruitment of APCs and the induction of regula-tory T cells. It suggests that NKT cells can influence immune responses by the regulation of chemokines expression, which is likely to shape the ensuing immune responses [73, 74]. In addi- tion, NKT cells can enhance antigen specific B cell response to secrete elevated levels of IgG, which leads to antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxity (ADCC) to lyse cancer cells mediated by NK cells [75]. Moreover, NKT cells facilitate et al Acta Pharmacologica Sinicanpg DCs maturation and also improve migration of more mature DCs towards tumor sites from lymph nodes[76, 77]. Interaction of chemokines and its receptors facilitate licensed DCs for cross-priming na\u00efve CTLs in a helper T cells also induce DCs to up-regulate CCL17 acting with its receptor CCR4 expressed on CTLs, which is dis- tinct from classical interaction of CCR5 and its three ligands, and might permit an additional level of selectivity in attraction prevented the interaction between syngeneic spleen CD3 + T cells and NKT cells, which strongly suggests the synergy of NKT cells is direct cell-cell contact dependent [11]. In turn, murine hepatic NKT cells show negative regulatory activities on recruitment, activation and effector functions of intrahepatic T cells dependent on TLR3 signaling pathway [81]. It is important to note that potency of anti-tumor mediated by NKT cells may also be influenced by the type, complex-ity, and composition of tumor microenvironment in which they interact with neoplastic cells and other immune cells, although NKT cells may not infiltrate all tumors. Inflamma - tory mediators and effector molecules possibly released by tumor-infiltrating immunocytes are a contributing factor in suppression or promotion of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Expansion and activation of other immune effector cells are associated with activation of NKT cells in vivo. Immature DCs are activated by NKT cells to secrete IL-12 and IL-15, which are responsible for the activation of NK cells along with IFN- production. Moreover, activated DCs induced by NKT cells present tumor-derived antigens to CD4 + Tregs and NKT cells promote cell-mediated cytotoxity and maturation of DCs, which are involved in the development of cognate T cell responses[83]. The EBV-induced human CD8+ NKT cells cooperated with syngenic CD3+ T cells to kill or sup- press EBV-associated tumors upon induction of Th1-bias, and the synergy is enhanced by addition of CD4+ NKT cells, which secrete high levels of IL-2 to maintain the transferred cells[7, 8]. Thymic CD8+ NKT cells induced by EBV could significantly drive CD3+ T cells to produce high levels of IFN- combined with autocrine Th1 cytokines to resist tumors, which is consis - tent with IFN--mediated anti-tumor activity of NKT cells malignancies and pro - longed animal survival[7]. In clinical trails, therapeutic strategies mainly focus on the reconstitution of an adequate number of functional NKT cells either by active immunization or adoptive transfer of NKT cells activated in vitro [86]. With identification of glycolipids with high specificity to NKT cells and following high respon- siveness to tumors, -GalCer (KRN700) and its variants have been continuously identified and as powerful anti-tumor immunotherapeutic agents [87]. Exogenous glycolipid -GalCer specially promotes expansion of human CD8+ NKT cells from EBV infected human thymus transplanted SCID chemeric mouse, whereas the moderate cell proliferation eradicate established metastatic tumor foci in models of the mouse liver and lung metastasis. They may exert a greater anti-tumor activity than -GalCer alone [57]. It possibly ascribes this difference to dysfunction of APCs in patients with cancer along with numerical and functional deficits of NKT cells, or free -GalCer anergizes NKT cells after initial activation[88]. Autologous in vitro expanded and activated NKT cells were adoptively transferred to patients with cancers as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy. Endogenous murine NKT cells were also activated and expanded to inhibit tumor metasta- sis through intravenous injection of -GalCer-pulsed DCs at intervals. Faster and more robust secondary immune activa- tion points to the existence of NKT cells activation and/or memory induction [89]. Moreover, in vitro expansion and polar- ization methods of circulating NKT cells facilitate the produc- tion of activated NKT cells and improve therapies based on NKT cells[90]. Some clinical trials with -GalCer-pulsed DCs as a phase I study show obvious tumor regression without severe adverse immunological and clinical responses[91]. Although adoptive transfer of in vitro activated circulating V24+V11+ human NKT cells with -GalCer seems to makes up for the deficiency of number and/or function of endogenous target NKT cells, refusion of expanded and activated NKT cells in vitro is accompanied with potential problems including in vivo premature clearance of activated NKT cells and dysfunction of APCs [92]. In contrast to therapeutic efficiency in animals, few clinical trials to date has succeeded in achieving signifi - cant efficacy against human tumors in vivo, which reflects a species-related difference in NKT cell activity or a planning difference to treat advanced cancer patients and adoptively tumor-transplanted animals. Thus immunotherapy based on NKT cells to bolster anti-tumor immunity might be a potent new tool for modulating immune responses against malignan- cies. Overall, these events that occur in tumor-immunity by NKT cells are illustrated in Figure 2. Since a limited space, detailed description of other important functions of NKT cells, such as protection against infection, maintenance of transplant tolerance, and inhibition of autoimmunity were not included in this review. Conclusion remarks Since NKT cells were discovered nearly three decades ago, there have been great advances in the understanding of NKT cell development, homeostasis, effector function, and thera - peutic applications. However, there are still some perplexi- ties that have not yet been completely resolved in spite of the progress made. Why is there so much individual variation between individuals, even congenic mouse strains and identi-cal twins? In contrast to the mouse, very few CD8 + NKT cells reside in normal person and a significantly increased number of CD8+ NKT cells is found in healthy persons with latent EBV infection. This raises the question what the CD8+ NKT cell 1129www.chinaphar.com Tan JQ et al Acta Pharmacologica Sinicanpg origin and development pathways might be. How could the homeostasis of NKT cells and their production of Th1/Th2 cytokines be properly regulated or controlled in vivo ? Another challenge in the field is to properly manipulate this balance of functional distinctive type I and type II NKT cells in the treat- ment of pathogenic states, particularly, in tumor therapy. Fur- thermore, understanding how to maintain this balance within the normal immune system is vitally important. Immuno - therapeutic approaches targeting NKT cells should break tol - erance and prove to be useful in the induction of more effec - tive immune responses for the improved treatment of cancers, infections and autoimmune diseases. A major paradox is the ability of NKT cells to synchronously promote and suppress immune responses since functionally distinct subpopulations of NKT cells and the communication with other immune arms exist. In order to completely understand the role of NKT cells, significant markers should be identified to differential diag - nosis type NKT cells and more work needs to be done to determine their functions other than the suppressive activity. In conclusion, an important point is that various clinical appli- cations based on NKT cells to treat malignancies, even com - bined with other effectors and tools, possibly become potential immunotherapy for cancers.

NKT cells in tumor immunity. Upon the stimulation with glycolipids presented by CD1d-bearing DCs, activated type I NKT cells up-regulate the expression of CD40, which interacts with CD40L expressed on immature DCs and then leads to the generation of mature DCs. Under the promotion by IL-12 from mature DCs, NKT cells express higher levels of IFN- and IL-2, which induce NK cells and CTLs to kill tumor cells through perforin/granzyme, Fas/FasL, and TRAIL pathway. Likewise, mature CD4- type I NKT cells, including CD4-CD8- NKT cells and CD8+ NKT cells limited in humans, also display strong anti-tumor activity other than the adjuvant effect on activating other anti-tumor cytolytic cells. Additionally, NKT cells help antigen specific B cells to secrete elevated levels of IgG, which possibly leads to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxity (ADCC) to lyse tumor cells mediated by NK cells. To achieve a balance, the protective type I and suppressive type II NKT cells counteract and cross-regulate each other, defining a novel immunoregulatory axis in tumor immunity.
