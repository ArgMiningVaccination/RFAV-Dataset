It's important to tailor this process to each pet individually so we develop a customized plan for managing pain in our patients.

Pet digital radiology Digital radiology allows us to rapidly obtain high-definition x-rays that can be an important diagnostic tool for various patient conditions, including lameness, coughing, heart disease, foreign body ingestion, constipation, and many other disorders that require more than a physical examination and blood tests to achieve a diagnosis. Pet Dentistry We encourage all of our clients to participate in preventative oral hygiene programs such as brushing their pet's teeth daily, dental chews, and other preventive procedures. However, there are times when a patient may require in-patient dental procedures under anesthesia to properly manage more severe cases of periodontal and gum disease, such as a fractured tooth, a tooth root abscess, or possibly an extraction.

Our patients also receive pre-anesthesia blood screening to help us make your pet's surgical procedure as safe and successful as possible. Pet Ultrasound Although humans and animals are different in many ways, some advances in human medicine are also beneficial for veterinary patients. One of these advances, diagnostic ultrasound, has proven to be a powerful tool in veterinary medicine. As a practice, one of our goals is to offer state-of-the-art treatment and diagnostic testing, so we are pleased to offer ultrasound services to provide a higher level of quality care to our patients. Pet microchipping Countless beloved pets are lost or stolen every year. As a result, we strongly encourage that all pets be identifiable via microchip and registered within a national database to increase the number of lost pets reunited with their guardian(s).
