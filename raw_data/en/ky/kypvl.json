We now have consolidated data regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, and the study of large cohorts of healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide has made a significant contribution in this field of research. HCWs have an extremely relevant occupational infectious risk with regard to SARS-CoV-2, and they were among the first groups of people to be vaccinated at the beginning of the vaccination campaigns, and then again with the booster, with very high acceptance rates. Less is known regarding the impact of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in other occupational sectors, even though vaccination has been recognized as a fundamental preventive measure to tackle the occupational risk related to SARS-CoV-2, which is also typical of other professions, and not only of HCWs. Moreover, as the pandemic is continually evolving, mainly due to the effects of new coronavirus variants, new data regarding the preventive effects of the vaccination campaigns in workplaces are currently needed, with particular regard to the need of a fourth vaccine dose and to the effects of the new Omicron-adapted COVID-19 vaccines. According to these premises, this Special Issue seeks manuscripts that address topics related to the prevention of COVID-19 infectious risks through the implementation of vaccination campaigns in the working population. Original articles and reviews regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for the prevention of the occupational risk of infections and the topics of risk perception, vaccine hesitancy and the knowledge and attitudes of workers towards COVID-19 vaccines will be considered. It will be important to collect data from different countries in order to appreciate the diversities in the implementation and effects of the vaccination campaigns, as well as in the compliance of workers according to their different cultural backgrounds. Papers that address themes such as the evaluation of the safety of vaccination campaigns as well as the study of the immune response after COVID-19 vaccines in workers, also including the possible co-roles of other vaccines/viral infections such as, e.g., influenza, are particularly welcomed. Thanks to the contributions received, the final goal of this Special Issue is to provide an updated panorama regarding the role of COVID-19 vaccines for the adequate prevention of occupational SARS-CoV-2 infectious risk.
