Are your parents always 'tellingyou: \"You have to learn to manage your money, better.\" Donot feel that you are the only one with such problems. Busi-nesSmen face the same problems every day. Politicians hearthe same thing every election day. The problem is thateverybody desires more than their resources allow them tohave. How these limited resources are spent. is the founda-tion of economic understanding. Economics is concernedwith decisions people make about how to allocate a limitedset of resources so that their wants and needs can best besatisfied.The lessons in this particular booklet probably will not-help you.make your money go further. It will, however, helpyou understand why things cost so much, especially thingsyou want. It will also help you\" understand why it is thethings you and your friends do not want are usually cheap.It will help you understand some question like those below.1.What kind of car should I buy considering the ener-gy crisis?2.Should I go to college or to work after high schoolgraduation?3.What summer jobs are available?4` What does the future hold regarding my job pros-pects?All of the above questions represent personal matters.Yet economics can provide an added dimension regardingpublic issues that may also concern you. Most high schoolsoffer some form of educational experience regarding drug_education and this area provides an excellent example of ap-plying economics to both a public and private issue. With-out taking a value position on whether Cannabis Sativa,more commonly referred to as \"grass\" should be legalized,let's explore how economics can provide another dimensioncStudent Notes INTRODUCTION Smoke. rsofillarijitanaNowFittc1CostC,BeHigher.

Now This Booklet Is OrganizedThis booklet has a variety of activities and each lessonwill be a little different. There are though, certain thingswhich appear irt.each lesson and it is important that youknow how they work.Whenever you find a newspaper article you will find twosections which follow the article. The first of these is called\"To Guide Your Reading.\" 'rhisAsts some words that mightgive you trouble. Your teachef might add some words to\"this list and this is within the rules. In fact we suggestedthat your teacher do this. None of us is trying to be cruel.All we want to do is help you understand what you read. Ifyou do not know what these terms mean, you will not beable to understand the article. In order to discuss the articlefirst you have to know what-it says.The section \"Some Questions to Consider\" is doing thesame thing. Helping you understand the article. If you cananswer each of these short questions then you understandwhat you just read. The way to find the answers is to goback to the article and read it very carefully.

Then you will be able todo the rest of the lesson, Whatever it might be Sortie varia-tion to this format has been made in later lessons. The Market Systemof the U.S. The fundamental assumption of economics is that allresources and commodities are scarce. There is never enoughof anything to satisfy all the wants and needs of everybody,everywhere, at every time. Some mechanism is necessary fordetermining what commodities will be produced from theresources available, how much those commodities will beworth, and who will get them. Scarcity The ever changing world of the 1970's has caused thepeople in the United States to come to/grips with the realitythat the world of scarcity does exist. That America, the\"land of plenty\" must face up to some very difficult ques-tions regarding the present and future allocation of re-sources.The necessity for economic activity, production and dis-tribution of goods and services, results from the varying hu-man wants and desires of society. When one examines hu-man behavior it appears that human wants are without lim-its. Although at times, we may acquire temporary satisfac-tion, most often. we are desirous of obtaining something pres-ently not in our possession. Often times we may observe oth-er people enjoying something and we think our level of well-being would be elevated. A moments reflection would causeone to recall dreaming \"if only I had that coat, car, motor-cycle, boat, dress, suit, baseball glove . ..,\" I would be muchhappier.The fundamental economic problem is that the meansavailable for satisfying wants are scarce or limited. Regard- IStudent Notes THE MARKET SYSTEM9 1 u r Student Notes 10THE MARKET SYSTEMless of the organization of an economic system, there arelimitations about what can be produced at a given time. Al-though the U.S. is well endowed with natural resources,people are becoming increasingly aware that our wants gobeyond our available resources. Many natural resources arerunning dangerously low. Thus, the world of scarcity doesexist, and mankind must devise a system to enable thepresent and future population to make decisions regardingsuture resource allocation. The Market System The mechanism employed by some societies throughoutthe world is one or another variation on the market system.Here producers and consumers ay bargain, either directly or indirectly, over the prices cresources, goods and ser-vices, using some commonly recognized medium of ex-change.In such a system, the desire of consumers to purchasea commodity helps set its value; when desire is great, thevalue is usually high, especially if a shortage exists in thequantity available. And as that value increases, producersof the desired commodity will be stimulated to provide moreof it, since they will want to sell more at the higher prices.An increase in quantity reduces temporary shortages, inturn, will cause prices to level off, and 'possibly even drop,since competition among consumers wishing to purchasewill be eased as more of the commodity enters the market.Prices rise and tall in the market system both in response tofluctuations in consumer desire and product availability.While a freely operating market system may be effec-tive in setting prices and matching production to consumerdesire, it provides little accommodation to the limited meansof those consumers on the lower end of the economic scale,and it affords less than equal competitive advantage to allproducers offering their commodities in the marketplace.When a society or its government judges that the work-ings of an economy impose special handicaps on some in-dividuals or groups, or that certain factions enjoy an undueadvantage within the market,. economic forces may be modi-fied to compensate for the disparities in competitive ability.Such a situation exists within the current economic en-vironment of the United States. Anti-trust rules, labor regu-lations, product standards, mininum wage requirements, in-come supplements and other laws, programs and guidelines, 1 i 4kall serve to encourage, restrain or augment the interplay of Studentesbasic, market fortes. Yet with air its complexities, the mod-ern economy still provides for the essential, functions of pro-duction, distribution and consumption, and the recognizedprinciples of economics, as civilization itself still come intoplay. I.HO a Market Operates The basic purpose of a marl?et is tdbring producers andconsumers together to exchange resources, products or ser-vices 'for other commodities of value. They may be eithermoney, precious materials or other products or services. Toaccomplish this exchange, the desires of producers to maxi-mize profits and the desires of consumers to purchase goodsand services at the lowest possible price must be broughtinto harmony.The bargaining which. goes on in the market, whetherexpressed directly as in the bidding of an auction, or indi-rectly in selections between competing products, effectsmore than just the prices of commodities being offered cur-rently. What consumers pay for products indicates the levelof their desire or DEMAND for those products.If for example, the price of milk jumped to $5.00 perquart, and a large number of consumers (mothers of smallchildren, for instance) continued to purchase milk at suchan inflated price, it would be obvious that milk is a vitalcommodity and that many people desire it very Rich. Pro-ducers weigh such indications of consumer desire heavily intheir planning for the future. What will be offered in to-morrow's market is directly related to the prices being paidin today's.But once producers have determined which commod-ities consumers desire, they have to answer the equally crit-ical question of how much to provide or SUPPLY. Again,they look to current market prices for some indication.To illustrate: beef is a- popular foodstuff in this econo-my, and many people are willing to pay quite high prices toobtain it,, though as with any commodity, consumers willpurchase more when prices are lower. However beef is firx-,-pensive to produce, prepare and deliver to market. Feed,shelter, labor, and transportation all add costs at every stepfrom farm to table, and those costs increase as more beef isproduced. Although lower prices may stimulate sales, the , THE MARKET SYSTEM11.\"t 'Student Notes / 2THE MARKET SYSTEMJr larger quantity of meat may reduce potentitg profits whichwould not justify increased production; all of which makesproducers less eager to produce when prices deoriase inspite of the increase in sales which may, result.But somewliereoon the scale of all p4ssible prices Whichmight be paid for a commodity there is one price at which itbecomes profitable for producers to provide a quantity ade-quate to satisfy those consumers willing to pay. Economistscall this the EQUILIBRIUM PRICE,. the point at which con-sumer desire and the willingness to purchase, or QUANTITY )DEMANDElfikzactly equals QUANTITY SUPPLIED in theparticular market.The following table illustrates four possible price/quart-)tity relationships in a hypothetical market situation. Col-umn B lists the possible prices at which a particular com-modity could be sold. Columns A and C list, respectively, thequantities consumers would demand and the quantities pro-ducers would be willing to supply at each stated is a price at which many con-sumers would purchase the commodity, but that producerAwould find it too low to be profitable and so would not sup-ply ,any quantity at all. Similarly, many units would bepurchased at $10, but the quantity produced would.not besufficient to meet the demand. If the price were raised.to$20, however, producers would be eager to provide a largequantity, but most consumers would feel either that thecommodity offered is not Worth that price or that they sim-ply cannot afford to pay so much. Few units would bepurchased. The one price at which all the units producedwould be consumed is $15, which is the EQUILIBRIUMPRICE for this hypothetical market.The, results of such \"bargaining\" between pr8ducers andconsumers are evident in any store or supermarket through-out the United States. Each item on sale was produced inanticipation of someone desiring to purchase it. Each priceposted is a bargaining position in the endless negotiationsbetweenuyer and seller.If a store operator finds for in-stance, tt all the beef in his stock has sold out quickly, hemight decide that he can raise his prices and Still sell the 13 same amount, or sell less but make more profit. On the otherhand, if sales are lagging he might find he has to reducehis prices in order to attract more customers and recoverat least part of his expenses before the meat spoils.Millions of independent production, distribution andconsumption decisions combine to provide today's marketwith an astounding variety of goods from around the world,often at startlingly disparate prices. Yet the ultimate deci-sion, and the one toward which all other economic decisionsare directed, is that final choice made by the individual con-sumer:Which products will I buy at the prices offered? Inthe end, it is that decision which either confirms or refutesall the, others made before. ( Fats Affecting Supply and DemandIt becomes apparent early in any study of economicsthat conditions and developments in one area of a marketexert great influence in other areas. All the many factors ofproduction, distribution and. consumption are inextricablyintertwined, the fortunes of every enterprise depend in Waysboth obvious and obscure, on the ups and downs of countlessother economic activities. A shift in the quantity demandedfor one commodity, or a reduction in its supply, will have itseffect on another commodity, perhaps making it an attrac-tive substitute for the first. And expectedly, an increase inthe quantity demanded for the alternative product will putupward pressure on its price; stimulating many consumersto turn still elsewhere for less expensive commodities whichcan be substituted.-As always, we return to the fundamental assumption ofeconomics: scarcity. If consumers wish to purchase morebeef than is immediately available, beef may become scarce,relative to the demand for it, andprices will tend to riseto a new EQUILIBRIUM' PRICE. So, many consumers maywish to forego some beef in favor of some less expensivefOods, perhaps chi ken. Or maybe they will stop buying beefaltogether and bdy all chicken, or some chicken and someprotein-rich grain products, such as soybean meat substi-tues.-As consumers who would normally purchase beef com-pete more actively in the market for chicken and grain prod-ucts, bidding up prices in the proCess, those consumers whowould normally rely heavily on these less expensive com4nod-/ities find they must look farther down the scale of demandfor their substitute foods. They may purchase more beansti Student Notes THE MARKET SYSTEM13 14TEE MARKET SYSTEMand'other vegetables, grains or less expensive innard meats,like chitterlings. The effects of such changes in consumerdemand eventually work their way through the full range offoods available in the marketplace, increasing or diminishingthe desirability of various commodities and readjusting their 'prices.Of course, changes in taste also influence demand, asdoes a rise or fall in the general standard of living within asociety. For instance, where beef was once considered a lux-ury item in the diets of most Europeans or Japanese, thesubstantial rise in incomes which most of these people haveexperienced since the end Of World War II has fostered agrowing taste, and the means to indulge it, for 4trge por-tions of beef in their daily meals. They now compete active-ly in the beef markets of the U.S. and other major meatproducing nations.Such shifts in demand naturally influence quantitysupplied, as producers tailor their production schedules andmarketing plans to gear up for greater output of those goodswhose prices are on the rise. But outside forces, as well, in-fluence supply. Food production is clearly dependent on fav-orable weather cohditions as well as on advances in agricul-tural technology. Likewise, technological developments effect .industrial output, extraction of mineral resources, even theefficiency of service operations like transportation or com-munications.A change in supply, for example, will result in achange in price and a change in quantity demanded. TheArab boycott in 1973-74 is an example of the multiple im-pact the average consumer experienced with the supply cur-tailment of one product, oil. This sudden, sharp reductionin the supply of crude oil resulted in upward pressure on theprice of gasoline which had ripple effects throughout theeconomy. The repercussions of this Arab action was firstdirectly felt by large numbers of people when lines of carsbegan to pile up around service stations r, in 1974, thetidal wave of prices began to gain mo' entum as consumersexperienced the importance of incr;-: energy costs on theproduction and transportation of o er products.Although the price of a gallon of gasoline was heldbelow the market eiluilibrium, the price of a gallon ofgasoline went up. This increase in the price of gasoline,caused demand to shift downward in products such as large-and put an increase or shift upward for alterna-tive forms of transportation such as buses and railroads. Theconequences of the gasoline problem extended into otherrelated markets. For example, automobile related services: Filling stations, body shops, auto parts suppliers, drive-inmovies along with restaurants and fast food outlets whichthrive in areas with a high volume of automobile traffic. Insummary, the effect of the automobile is so dramatic thatone out of every six jobs are related to this all-encompassingindustry.Eventually, even additional areas were affected, such asreal estate prices, properties increasing or decreasing invalue depending on proximity to transportation facilities orto the business establishments which rely on convenient ac-cess by automobile. .Additionally, the supply of one commodity influences thesupply of others, not only through production changes aimedat meeting shifts in demand, but directly in the quantity ofgoods produced using other goods as ingredients or meansof production. The supply of gasoline and other refinedpetroleum products is partially dependent on the supply ofcrude oil; the supply of bread is related to the supply ofwheat and other grains; the supply of Milk is somewhat de-pendent on the supply of cows.Supply has indirect influences, also. Cows need feed togive milk, but they eat grains which are also used to producebread, so the supply of grain available for animal feed com-petes with the supply available to bakeries. Likewise grainproductiOn is dependent on fertilizers, many of which aremanufactured from petroleum, as well as on farm machinerywhich runs on gasoline. So, the supply (and, therefore theprice) of both -milk and bread is very greatly influenced bythe supply of oil, as well as on countless other factors in thecomplex web of economic relationships. Modifying the Market System All the examples drawn here are, of course, arbitraryand take no account of the influences of government on mar-ket forces. In real life, economic activity is constantly guidedby laws and regulations, and government itself plays theroles of supplier and demander in many and diverse eco-nomic situations.The hand of government is probably most apparent intimes of economic stress, when legislative power is appliedto curb inflation, stimulate business activity or otherwisecombat some prevailing economic ill. ,Mechanisms such asprice supports and restraints or minimum and maximum44- Student Notes # 'IliE MARKET SYSTEM15 ,k Student Notes 16ZEE MARKET SYSTEMwage requirements all modify the interplay of market forcesin fairly obvious ways.Price supports tend to generate product surpluses, sinceproducers wish to supply large quantities of goods at theartfficially high prices imposed above the market equilibrium.As a result consumers theri cut back their purchases or sub-stitute less expensive products for inflated-price goods. Pricesupports imposed on farm products from 1929 to 1973 createdhuge surpluses in many food grains that had to be stored,shipped abroad and even destroyed, because the artificialprice floors stimulated suppliers to provide grain in excess ofactual consumer demand. The grain market was neverpermitted to determine its true equilibrium price. As someprices for agricultural products have begun to drop in 1975,one may question the economic wisdom of Congress as agri-cultural price supports are again being considered as a policyalternative.Restraints on prices, on the other hand, tend to createshortages, since producers see limited profitability in supply-ing large quantities of products whose prices are controlled,and thus cut back production or shift resources into pro-ducing goods which are permitted to sell at true equilibriumprices. Such controls on the price of beef resulted in severeshortages in meat markets during the summer of 1973, ascattle raisers refused to supply beef at the artificially lowper-pound prices imposed by government regulation.The effects of government intervention can be seensimilarly in the labor market, though workers have con-siderably less flexibility in offering or withholding their laborthan do businesses- in increasing, reducing or redirectingproduction. Nevertheless, the supply of labor increases(which is to say, more people are willing to work) when theminimum wage is raised, though such a ;vise causes manymarginal jobs to be eliminated by employers seeking toavoid the added expense. Likewise, workers are less stimu-lated to offer their labor when limits are placed on their po-tential earnings, especially with unemployment compensa-tion, welfare payments and other income maintenance pro-grams increasingly available to mitigate the hardships ofunemployment.Government influences the market systeni in less obvi-ous ways. State governments may control interest ceilingson mortgage money which will then have immediate effectson the future availability of houses along with future homeconstruction. In addition, tax laws with their myriad obli-gations, loopholes and deductions, hold vast implicationsfor the conduct of business, the distribution of income and 1 7 the overall economic health of the nation, as do the welfareand other public assistance programs (referred to by econ-omists as \"transfer payments\") that work their influenceon the labor market.Of course, government is also a major participant in theeconomy. As the nation's largest employer, it competesvigorously with private enterprise for workers in virtuallyevery trade and profession, and accounts for a vast portionof the national payroll. With its agencies deeply involved insomany aspects of modern life, it consumes huge quantitiesof nearly every product available, virtually sponsoring en-tire industries, and exerting tremendous pressure on pricesin nearly every market. As the supplier of public services, itmaintains massive defense, police and other bureaucraticestablishments, competes with private organizations in offer-ing education, health care, insurance, finance and otherservices, and draws heavily on the nation's wealth to supportits many diverse activities.But perhaps government exercises its most far-reaching,though often subtle, influence on economic processes whenit attempts to compensate for what are often seen as theshortcomings of the market system. One policy area the gov-ernment has attempted to implement is some form of effec-tive redistribution of income and wealth. However, the realimpact of redistributing income has been somewhat ques-tionable when income generated by the socio-economicgroups at the top and bottom of the ladder are examinedrespectively over time.Since the beginning of time, people have pondered thedisparities in wealth and advantage between various individ-uals or groups; the question \"Why does my neighbor havemore than I?\" is as old as society itself. Under the marketsystem, the person with greater resources is able to purchasemore and better goods, while the person with less is forcedto make do with whatever is left. Increasingly, governments,and by implication the people who support them, have de-cided that such gips in economic advantage should be nar-rowed. They have initiated various programs aimed at in-creasing the ability of people with limited resources to com-pete morel sucessfully in the marketplace. These transferpayments (using the economists' term) shift resources fromthe ,none advantaged, in the form of taxes, to the less ad-vantaged, in the form of direct payments, subsidies, vouch-ers, discounts, tax relief or loans (generally at low or nointerest) . This has the affect of improving the competitiveposition of those people who would otherwise be hardpressedto obtain the products they want and need.Since-transfer payments provide more people with the i c;Student Notes TEE MARE= SYSTEM17 Student Notes 18TAD MARKET 'SYSTEMmeans to purchase, and the -people who receive them gen-erally have a more pressing need to purchase, they tend toincrease the quantity demanded, thus they may put addi-tional upward pressure oh prices, which has the effect of a\"hidden ;cost\" of the government's attempt to correct theeconomic problem of income disparity. Such costs are veryreal and must be paid by everyone participating in the mar-ket, even those people whom the transfer payments are in-tended to benefit.There are hidden costs attached to all government in-tervention in market processes, though by no means arethey exclusive with government. Product standards improvethe quality of manufactured goods, but tend to increase pro-duction costs. Anti-trust 'laws stimulate competition andrestrain monopolistic practices, but dilute the financial effi-ciencies of big company centralization. Health and safetyregulations obviously improve working conditions, and evenbenefit employers by reducing the costs of insurance pay-ments and lost man-hours due to accidents and illness, butthey add overhead expenses that must be recovered in theprices of the goods and services being produced.It is the consumer who often pays the costs of govern-ment intervention in economic life; and correcting problemsin the market system is expensive. But not to act whenproblems occur is expensive too, in both human and rturalresources. The effects of income disparity are the gro*th-ofpoor classes, increased crime, political ferment and social un-settling. The effects of unenforced health and safety regu-lations are unfit working conditions, accidents, occupationaldiseases, deaths and general worker discontent. The effectsof unrestrained business practices are trusts and monop-olies, lowered product quality, price-fixing, accumulation ofwealth and power by elite classes and disregard for publicinterests.All such problems have their influences on the marketsystem, though they might not be reflected directly in themarket's pricing mechanism. In fact, it's necessary to look,beyond price structure to determine the hidden costs of anyproduction or consumptionto what economists refer to asthe concept of SPILLOVER EFFECT.The cost of producing an automobile is basically thesum total of all the parts and materials used in con-structing the car, the cost of wages and benefits to theworkers involved, certain fixed overhead expenses such asfactory space, equipment and utilities, and perhaps designand development costs or the expenses involved in distribut-ing the final product (a rough accounting, but one adequate 1:i for this example). But there are hidden costs of this produc-tion, too. Perhaps the automobile factory emits huge volumesof smoke and soot, polluting the air, dirtying windows, dis-coloring buildings, and aggravating the, medical conditionsof people with lung diseases or severe allergies. These areeffects that \"spill over\" from the process of manufactur-ing automobiles, that generate real Icosts which are notreflected in the auto company's production expenses, butthat somebody will have to pay.Likewise, the price of an automobile is .basically all theexpenses incurred in production, plus a percentage of profitfor the manufacturer and dealer, perhaps some additionalpreparation or transportation charges, and taxes. But aswith producing, there are hidden costs of consuming, too. Acar is really \"consumed,\" after all, by being driven; and asit's driven it emits exhaust fumes, adding to the air pollu-tion caused by the auto factory. It adds to the volume oftraffic, contributing to the need for roads, police, traffic sig-nals and other equipment, and it might even be involved Man accident, generating expenses of repair or medical treat-ment for the driver and possibly several other people as well.There are all kinds of hidden _costs, or spillover effects,attached to all kinds of production and consumption. Theprice of a candy bar might be only ten cents, but if theconsumer of the candy tosses the wrapper on the ground,litter is produced, which generates clean-up expenses for thelocal municipality. This generated expense isn't accountedfor in the market transaction by which the candy is pur-chased, but it is real and it will effect other transactionsin the labor market for instance, when someone is hiredto clean up the litter.Of course, there are alLa positive spillover effects whichcreate benefits beyond the immediate production or consump-tionof a product. If a family grows flowers on its front lawn,the various market transactions involved in producing andconsuming the seeds register only the immediate consump-tion of that particular family. The benefit deriyed from theflowers could result in enjoyment to the household, neigh-bors and people traveling through the neighborhood. Butkeep in mind, the neighbors did not pay for the flowers. Inaddition, the household beautification program could resultin increased property value.Increasingly, government is attempting to moderate thespillover effects of both production and consumptioir andmake the market system reflect hidden costs more accurate-ly.

Considering our future transportationproblems, the government is encouraging mass transit sys-tems through large subsidies. The cost of one education is.largely subsidized by governmental funds because an edu-cated citizenry results in benefits both to the individual andsociety. Thus, when spillover costs result, the governmentdiscourages production. However, when there are spilloverbenefits, the government encourages production. 2i Introductionto Activities v The activities may, be approached from a variety ofstandpoints, however, the intent of the author was to struc-ture ttte activities into three primary areas:1. Scarcitythe purpose of this section is to illustratethat scarcity is fundamental to all societies.2. Market Systemhow the market system answers thefundamental questions faced by all societiesWhat?How? For Whom?3. Role of Governmentthe objective of this section isto raise questions as to when and how governmentshould modify our political system. 221 1Money Trouble Although money is sometimes called \"the root of allevil,\" money is also an important' tool necessary in today'sworld. Money does more than provide the medium of ex-change for the goods and services we may need or want. Itis directly related to our level of living and our ambitionfor the future. Sometimes during one's lifetime, each one ofus may reflect and wish if only I had managed my moneymore carefully I would not be in my present situation.In considering the problems of money management,read the following cases of (1) Bill and Louise; (2) Ronand Marilyn.Borrowing TroubleMore Consumers FindTheir Debts OutpacingTheir PayA Salesman Makes $40,000;Yet He Has to Retrench,And Wife Gets Two JobsThe Plight of a Policeman By DANFORTH W.

The 27,year-old realestatesalesman's annual salary was approaching$40,000, and a franchise he held on the sidepromised more wealth Bonn. \"We'd neverseen that much money,\" Bill says. \"It con- 2,3Student Notes MONEY TROUBLE23 vinced me that I was going to be a big en-trepreneur.\"So, with great expectations, the youngcouple set out to buy a chunk of the goodlife: a $60,000 home, a boat, new furniture,new clothes and what Bill calls his \"toy,\" aLincolnContinentalcomplete withtele-phone.That was last year. This year, Billguesses he'll make about $40,000 again. Butit is unlikely the couple will see much of the\"good life.\" The house is up for sale, theboat is gone, much of the furniture has beenrepossessed, and the Lincoln has been re-placed by a Toyota'. (without a telephone).Louise, meanwhile, has quit her collegecourses and ,now holds two jobs, one ofwhich is the midnight to 7 a.m. stint at alocal electronics plant. And Bill, who tellstheir story in exchange for anonymity, ad.mite to occasional bouts of depression.What happened to Bill and Louise is un-usual. After all, they owe nearly $40,000. Buttheir extreme plight points up a hardshipshared by a growing number of consumersat all income levels these days: In varyingdegrees, their debts now outpace their abil-ity to repay.CASE 2Ron & MarilynTake the case of Ron, a police, officer ina Dallas suburb, and his wife, Marilyn.Right now, his monthly take-home pay,which includes Veterans Administration as-sistance for night-schbol classes, is about$900. Yet almost half that amount$400 amonthgoes toward repaying nearly $8,000in installment debt rung up in the last sev-eral years.How did they acquire that much debt?The couple tick off the answers: the deathof a closerelative,requiringexpensive plane fare to the coast; furniture that fellapart within a year alter purchase, leavinga $500 balance due plus the cost of cheaper,if sturdier, replacements; an illness thatforced Marilyn to leave a $550-a-month salesjob;someunexpected,anduninsured,major dental work; the birth of a daughter; MONEY TROUBLE, (.0and, among other things, an automobilewith an annoying tendency to burn outvalves.\"At one point last year, we thought wewere caught up,\" says Ron, \"but somethingelse happenedI think the car broke downand we went back under water.\"After debt payments and expendituresfor the basicsrent, utilities and foodRonand Marilyn now have about $100 left tothemselves every month. However, Marilynsays, \"we had been able to spend about $35a week on groceries, but with food prices upI'm afraid the increase is coming out of that$100.\"End Case 2Nor does the immediate future appearany too promising for couples like Ron andMarilyn or even wealthier folks like Bill andLouise. In a report entitled \"The Erosion ofConsumer Wealth,\" two Goldman, Sachs &Co. researchers, Robert Giordano andRichard B. Worley, found that \"there is lit-tle reason to expect that the .pressure onconsumers' budgets and, therefore, on theirability to leverage themselves against theeffects of inflation will be relieved in 1974.\"But the rate of increase in installmentdebt is beginning to slacken. For instance,in March, total consumer installment debtrose an adjusted $617 million, less than the$671millionincreaseof February andsharply below the $2.04 billion rise of March1973. These lower rates of increase are due-partly to the automobile sales slump in-duced by the energy crisis. But experts be-lieve that the softening figures may also in-dicatethat many consumers have hadenough and, in the words of the GoldmanSachs report, \"are unwilling to further ex-tend themselves.\"Therels-aletr-evidence -that_ lenders areclamping down.

On her'second evening in the city, she steps outsidefor a breath of air and finds an emaciatedbaby deserted on the doorstep. She takes thebaby in, feeds it, doctors it, bathes it,, andthen goes out searching for the mother, whois nowhere to be found.The next *morning the nun finds a secondstarving baby lying in the street in front ofthe hostel. So she takes the second babyin.Then she goes off to the local police stationto report the missing babies and to seek al-vice.- That advice is to put the babies back inthe street or, the police officer says, youwill find four more babies tomorrow.\"What on earth am I to do?\" the nunsays later in the day. \"Am I to put them outto starve?\" 1.

The PriestHe has been working in the villages ofBangladesh' for more than a decade, andthere is an intensity about him that conjuresup visions of some medieval martyr._Through a long, late evening, he talks ofthe misery he sees all about him, the wors-ening economic conditions, the widespreadhunger in the villages, the seeming hopeless-ness of a nation with too many people andtoo little land or resources. At times, he iscynical: \"A line was drawn around -a slum,and it 'was proclaimed a nation.\" At timeshe is fatalistic: \"These people are like theirrice. Sometimes it bends with the winds,and sometimes it breaks. Sometimes it sur-vives the floods and Sometimes not.\"At one point, he even asks: \"To be rails-tic, does it really matter if a million Ben-galis die? Would it matter more to train adozen dedicated Bengalis who would go outto change the future?\" He has great doubtsabout the value of relief aid, about the logicof \"keeping people alive today so that theirchildren can starve traziOrrow,\" Like somany conversations g Bangladesh, itisboth depressing aninconclusive.Early the next morning; a messenger ar-rives from a nearby village.

As such,he can recommend policies and he can tryto carry out policies, but he cannot decidepolicy matters. That's up to the politicians.And Bengali politicians, more than mostothers, it seems, favor making no decisionat all.So Mr. A., who has seen a lot of recom-mendations ignored and a lot of plansEfheived, conveys a sense of weariness andresignation. \"Bangladesh was born imlucky stars,\" he come in battalion:..

There she requests food for her threechildren.And every morning the camp chairmenrefuses her request\"I have no rations to give,\" says thechairman. \"Of course,\" he adds, \"she nolonger has any children to feed. She hadthree children but they died last year be-cause they had no food. Since then she is in-sane.The mad woman is one of some 400,000Biharis who still languish in refugee campsaround Bangladesh. The Biharis are non-Bengali Muslims, originally from centralIndia, who were a privileged minority herein pre-independence days and who generallysupported the Pakistan army during the1971 war. After the war some Maria weremassacred,but most wereconfinedto camps to await some resolution of theirfate. It is now three years later but little hasbeen resolved.The Biharis claim to be Pakistan citizensand demand to be \"repatriated\" to Paid-stan. This is fine with the government ofBangladesh, which would like to be rid of__them. Pakistan, for its part, has accepted,about 120,000 Biharis refugees but does notaccept the principle that Biharis are Paid-stani; it refuses to take 400,000 more Biharts. The last thing any nation on the sub-continent needs is more poor people.There is little Chance for the Biharishere. Millions of Bengalis are seeking jobsand so there are almost none available toBiharis. \"All we can do is beg,\" says thecamp chairman, \"but Dacca is full of Ben-gali beggars and we get nothing.\" Interne.-tional relief agencies initially provided foodfor Bihari camps, but foreign interest hasdwindled, and the agencies now channelwhat aid they have to starving Bengalis.So the Biharis sit and waitand watch . their children die of hunger and disease.\"Should we be left to starve to death inthese camps?\" asks the chairman. \"Inwhose hands lies our future?

Why do we have discriminationIs it be-cause of the inidequacies of the market system, or some-thing more deeply entrenched in people's values that goesmuch beyond our economic system. The reading, \"Have-Nots in Revolt\" gives one perspective from a Black leader.After reading his summary, examine some questions follow-ing the reading and ask yourself to hypothesize some of thecauses for Haves and Have-Nots in today's society. 311Student Notes HAVE-NOTE w rumour33 A Black Leader Foresees an America With. .Have Nots in Revolt!MABRY AMIRI BARAKA was bornLerot Jones in Newark, N.J., 40years ago. He gained his reputationfirst as a jazz critic, then as a poetand pliywright. Dutchman won theObie as the best American play of'`the 1963-64 season. Soon after, thisdramas turned darker, then becamefirmly antiwhite. His art became po-lemical and its message one of blackseparation, black liberation.BarakareturnedtoNewark,where he was arrested during the1967 rioting for illegally possessingtwo pistols. Convicted and sentencedto three years in prison, he was re-tried/ and acquitted. He became po-litically active in Newark and na-tionally as secretary-general of theNational Black Political Conventionand chairman of the Congress ofAfrikan Eftople. He recently astound-ed and angered some of his followersby coming out as a follower ofMarx, Lenin, and Mao. Staff WriterMichael Putney recently met withBaraka at his Newark headquartersand talked with him about thatturnabout and other things.In 1968 the Kerner Commissionpredicted that America was headedtoward two societies, one black andone white. Do you think that hashappened? Or have we headed to-ward a society of haves and have-nots?I think the latter. It was a societyof white and black. But what I thinkthe commission was trying to do wasput the onus for the problem on ra-34HAvE-NoTs ttivourcism. And that was really a trick be-cause we believe that the onus is onthe economic system. But we do feelthat all the people in this countrythe white people, the blacks, thePuerto Ricans, the Mexicans, theIndians, the Asiaticsall the peopleare finally going to be the ones tobenefit frOm this total kind of societywe see. We feel that when people talkabout a pluralistic society that oneday it is going to be a pluralistic so-ciety in the real sense where every-body will have the democratic rightof self-determination.You've been a black liberal, ablack radical, a black separatist, andnow you're into \"scientific social-ism\" and what you call Marxist-Leninist-MaoTse-tungthought.What is it?Basically, it says this: Capital-ism, because of its internal contra-dictions, 'will produce a class of peo-ple that will destroy it. Everythinghas contradictions, which is dialec-tics, and capitalism has one veryprofound kind of contradiction: Thecontradiction between the publicnature of laborthat is, you have touse the masses to workbut themoney that's made from the labor,the profit, is appropriated privately.And by a very few.. The rest of ushave to spend our lives laboring andwe don't own anythifig. The onlything we own is our ability to work.And if you can't work, you're out ofluck.Well, how are the people whomyou think are exploited going to wrest some of the control and theprofits from the system?By revolution. That's the onlycertain way that socialism will cometo Our society. That is, when themasses of people, the great workingmass which capitalismproduces,property-less wage earners, and theseare the very people who will destroyit. When these Masses of people willno longer accept the system as it isand the system reaches a crisis whereit can no longer govern as it used to,then that is the point at which revo-lution is made.How close are we to being at thatpoint?I don't think we're very far. I Some Questions To Considerdon't think we can play the numbersgame, but I think if you'll just goback 10 years ago to 1964 and runthrough your mind the kind ofthings that have happened since1964from Kennedy No. 1 to Ken-nedy No. 2 to Malcolm to MartinLuther King to Portuguese colonial-ism.

It seems both the town and Mr.Cocker! had the same idea: to earn some cashby selling some trash.A year ago, scavengers like Mr. Cockerlwould hardly have faced this kind of competition from the authorities. In the last fewmonths, however, the price of wastepaper hasrisen so high that yesterday's headlines aresuddinly worth fighting over. Prices of scrapmetal are also leaping to new heights.

That means their readers don't much tothrow out, which means theis a shortage ofold newspapers. Demand for' scrap metal, es-pecially steel, 1s up because production isbooming. And increasing exports of both' raperand metal don't help matters at home. (Gar-den State Paper, the country's biggest news-print recycler, says its supplies are being\"raided\" by Asian dealers. Its inventories aredown to just 2,000 tons from a normal level of50,040 tons.)The number of people willing to part withtheir garbage for nothing seems to be gettinglower as the prices get higher.

Nowthe post Is averaging 100,000 pounds of paper.And to get it, says adviser LaMar Wiliam,\"walleye to work harder.\"Even some community-spirited recyclersare taking note of the profit potential.

The sale of their most abun-dant civic productgarbageis enriching theircoffers and also helping to preserve shrinkinglandfill space. The Environmental ProtectionAgency's Resource Recovery Division says 75cities are in one way or another deriving somerevenue from other citizens' discarded news-papers. Less than two years ago, the agencysays, only three cities had similar programs.\"We're talking about adding 3150,000 an-nually to San Diego's revenues,\" says TerryFlynn, public works director for the city. InJanuary, San Diego adoptecla program, simi-lar to others around the country, that requiresprivate ,paper dealers to bid for the right tocollect newspaper from residential neighbor-hoods. The city, meanwhile, is urging people tobundle up their papers for the pickups.In St. Louis, the high price of scrap metalhas turned towing abandoned cars to the junk-yard from a sanitation chore into a profitableenterprise. A towing company is paying thecity for the privilege of carting off the wrecks.\"We've made $50,000 from the cars we've hadpicked up since September,\" says Walter Abell,an assistant to the director of street operatiuw.Cities- and localities do have a problem,though, with scavengers and vandals whobreak laws to get at the junk before the gov-ernment does, or who just steal things thataren't junk at all to sell as scrap. Half of theabandoned cars in St. Louis are being snatchedup by scavengers in violation of a local lawsimilar to the one in Hempstead that bars peaple from taking bundled newspapers. In Cleve-land, there has been a ispete of missing man-hole covers since a local newspaper mentionedthat they Could bring 35 each as scrap.Rural areas aren't immune either.

In the article you read where a paper dealer_refers to waste paper as he really didn't mean thatyou could spend it. He meant that waste paper has becomeso valuable that *pie will pay (or exchange) money for it.The reason for this increase in value is the relationship:between supply and As mentioned in the reading,people just don't have as much paper. The problem is thatyour local newspaper has probably been getting thinner inthe past year or so and this means you have less of it tothrow away.When the supply of did newspapers was large the de-mand seemed low in relation to this supply. Waste paper waschiap- and -it was called junk. Now that the supply of old-waste paper is(and demand is increasing) the priceand we till* of it as being valuable.An interesting point is that communities and companiesthat never paid much attention to what they threw away arenow concerned about saving waste paper and other things.The article you just read also talks about junk cars- andhow the price' of scrap metal has gone up. It used to be thatno one was interested in abandoned cars but now that theprice. of scrap metal is higher people now have incentive tosalvage old cars.One lesson we might learn froM all of this Is that lowprices encourage waste.. If paper, and scrap metal, have lowprices then few people are very concerned about wastingthem. If the cost of these products increases, people wouldbe less likely to waste things.\"l'he point is that it is how much people are willing topay for something that determines how it is. Ifthere is only a limited supply of something and a lot of 'peo-ple want it then it will cost a lot and people will call it valu-able, If no one wants it, it may in value.

This interchange is what determines the price atwhich something is sold. You can sell something for whatsomeone is willing to pay for it. If there is only a little bitaround, and a lot of people want it, then you can get aprice. This works with almost anything whether itis junk cars, eggs, or even illegal drugs. 4 The Egg Problem People often change their minds about how to spendtheir money. If a lot of people decide to start buyingwhat you make then everything is O.K. If the public decidesthey do not like what you have then there is a problem. Itcould mean that you will go out of business.The big question has always been how to get people tobuy certain things when they might not buy them on theirown. Advertisers call it keeping people informed about whatchoices are available. Critics of advertising call it a manipu-lation of the buyer. These critics argue that advertising isa way of getting people to buy things they really do notneed. The advertising companies say they are just informingthe buyer of a wide range of possible decisions.Either way we are talking about a thing which changesthe demand situation. The idea is to get people to buy Wid-gets instead of Gidgetsif you own the Widget factory. If youown the Gidget Company then you want the opposite.In the article that follows you will read about how ixo-ple have stopped buying eggs. Not a good situation if yourbusiness is producing eggs. 47./Stu4ent Notes THE EGG PROBLEM4 7 JOURNALCHICAGOAny egg GeorgeGobel serves up at the egg industry's \"milliondollar banquet\" in Atlanta tonight might betaken with a grain of salt. Producers are in-creasinglysensitiveaboutthesubject,itseems, as they face a continuing decline in de-mand for\" their product.That's why egg producers from all over thecountry are shelling out $2,500 a plate for to-night's affair. The drop in egg consumption hasreached the crisis point, producers say, andthey're hoping to raise $1 million tonight-to beused this year to try to reverse the slide. If thisand other fund-raising activities succeed, theproducers say, they will have at least $3 mil-lion to spend this year to defend the egg.Recent Agriculture Depeirtment statisticsbear out the industry's plight. Last year, U.S.egg consumption fell to an estimated 292 a per-son, a drop of 5% from 1972 and the lowestper-capita consumption since 1936. Last year'srate was 27% below the record 403 eggs percapita consumed in 1945.Americans are buying fewer eggs partly be-cause of changed eating habits. They are skip-ping or scrimping at breakfast, a traditionallyegg-oriented meal. But the decline steepened inthe late 1960s as publicly linked cholesterol,contained in eggs and other foods, to heart dis-ease. Last year's drop also was due in part tocutbacks by egg farmers whose prices were In-directly frozen by price controls last summer.The industry, however, regards the \"choles-terol scare\" as it greatest threat.To be sure, the industry has other problems,one of which may soon be in evidence again.That's the overproduction that invariably fol-lows high egg prices. Large white eggs areselling for 78 cents a dozen wholesale in New il'EM EGG PROBLEMYork, up from 52 cents a year ago. Dependingon their efficiency, producers are making aprofit of between 12 and 20 cents a dozen, in-dustry analysts estimate. Farmer's receiptsjumped to nearly $3 billion in 1973 from $1.8 bil-lion in 1972.Profits like these are encouraging egg farm-ers to increase their laying flocks. This, alongwith the normal spring rise in production,could cause prices to fall as much as 25 cents adozen by May, one observer says. If that hap-pens, the present handsome profits will bewiped out, and industry leaders again maybegin recommending stern measures, such asmandatory flockculling,to trim output. Suchpleas for unified action have met with onlymixed success in the past.But nothing has unified egg producers asthe prolonged consumption slide has and, inparticular, the cholesterol issue. \"I think theyrealizethey'rebattlingfortheir economiclives,\" says one observer.The industry will fight back with a massivepromotion campaign aimed at polishing theegg's image. The sales pitch will attempt tomollify consumers fears about cholesterol ineggs, and will aso stress the product's nutri-tion and economy, says Gene C. Masters, an of-ficial of United Egg Producers, a big Atlanta-based cooperative. \"Maybe in the next five to10 years we can slow the downward trend inconsumption and possibly turn it around,\" nr.Masters says.The publicity campaign already has startedwith a series of newspaper advertisements, oneof which features \"the 'seky' egg,\" by notingthat \"cholesterol is The industry also is distributingfreeinformationbookletsdesigned, amongother things, \"to disprove the myth thatt.gg consumption can reduce the risk ofheart disease.\"The Wall Street Journal, 1 -28-74 S 4 To Rde Your Reading CholesterolMoOverproductionReceiptsFlock culling Some Questions to Consider 1.

It seems that we are always runninguut of something. About a year ago we couldn't get enoughmeat. Next we ran out of gasoline Lines over a mile longbecame common. The problem is really one of supply. Whatis the best way to manage a limited supply? Do we just letthe price go sky high and in this way force people to con-serve things? Or, do we have the government step in andmake up some rules so that everybody gets the same amount?No one is quite certain but the two readings which follow ex-plain these two different viewpoints. In the reading that fol-lows the author wants a free market solution. That is, justlet the price go higher if the supply stays the same, or goesdown, and the demand for gasoline stays the same. 4Student Notes GETTING ENOUGH GASOLINE51 52A Bizarre 'SolutionThe good chance that Mr. Nixon'svoluntaryconservationprogramwon't save enough energy to getthrough the winter has some of hisadvisers frantically searching for asolution.Some in the White House favorrationing, and warn that it may behere by January 1. Others, who rec-ognize that peacetime rationing wouldturn into a catastrophic mess, preferto slap on a federal surtax to driveup the price of fuel and cut into de-mand.While intriguing, this approach hassome problems of its own. First no-body knows exactly what the surtaxshould be. If it's too small, it won'tdo the job. If it's too big, it wouldnot only incite general inflation, butalso disrupt general patterns of com-merce beyond need. John Love's off-hand guess that 30 cents a gallonwould do the trick stands a 99.9%chance of being wrong on the highor low side.Additionally, there is the revenueproblem. A penny-a-gallon $1 billion in less than $30 billion.Clearly, the government can't takethat much money out ot the economywithout sending itinto a tailspin.Siphoning even $10 billion out of theeconomy with a dime surtax wouldspell certain recession for 1974.Congress could get this cash into themainstream by raising Social Securi-ty benefits again, which after all haveonly been boosted 50% in the lastthree years. But a more prudent allo-cation would beprovide these sur-plus funds to tlproblem at hand.Use, halfe !honey at hand.mass transit, bait out the bankruptrailroads, etc. And give the otherhalf to the oil companies on the un-derstanding that the companies willdevelop new energy sources, buildnew refinery capacity, and set upcostly exploration projects. This ap- GETTING ENOUGH GASOLINE 4proach has a certain clumsiness thatgives.us pause.So there's reason to look at theabsolutely bizarre scheme designedby Milton Friedman, the well-knowneconomist. Mr. Friedman suggestswhat appears to be a simple, flawlessplan that for some reason has notoccurred to anyone 'in Washington.He think,: the government should letthe price of fuel rise until the market-place figures out, to the tenth of apenny, exactly where supply meetsdemand.The oil companies would indeedmake big profits, which would meanthey would have no reason to cometo government for the capital theyrequire for developing new energysources, building new refinery ca-pacity, and stepping up costly explor-ation. In fact, Congress could wipethe oil-depletion allowance from thebooks. Profit pure and simple wouldbe incentive enough to get the petrol-eum industry racing every which wayto find oil. If Congress, in its wisdom,also decontrolled natural gas prices,it would have to jump out of the wayor be trampled by the competitiveforces it would unleash.It should not be forgotten that theFriedman plan would not onl putprofit in industry's pqcket. Half oftheincreasedrevenues would bepaid to the Treasury in the form ofcorporate incometaxes.Congresswould not have to pass a surtax toget new money for mass transit,bailing out the bankrupt railroads,etc. The oil companies will be happyto collect this money and turn itover to the government.Granted it's a' radical plan. Butit appears so straightforward andsimple compared to the alternativesthere's, no reason it should not be atleast considered. It could be just thethJ mg. The American economy is soresilent, so flexible that we believeit might even adjust to a free-marketsystem, bizarre as that might seem.

This in-volves the government controlling the supply so that every-body gets his fair share. It is quite different from the otherarticle you read. 45Student Notes THE CABE FOR RATIONING55 s \"The Case for Gasoline Rationing By WALTER W. HELLER(Modified for Materials)The current debate, over gasoline ration-ing versus huge price or tax increases isbeclouded by neglect of one simple fact:that the price increases required to marchsupply and demand in the short run arevastly greater than those required to do thejob in the long run.In the short runsay, in a few months toa year or soeven vast price run-upswon't suck a great deal more oil out of theearth. But estimates by Houghalcier andVerleger suggest that \"the long-run elas-ticity of supply of petroleum may be ashigh as 1.0.\"That is, a 10% rise in pricewould lead to a 10% increase in domesticoutput.Similarly, on the demand side, studiesindicate that, in the short run, a price riseof 10% would cut gasoline demand about 2%to 2.5%. But in the long runthat is, afteran adjustment period of two to three yearsthe estimated cutback would be aboutthee times as large. The inference is clear:to cope with today's Arab oil crisis, a hugeprice jump would be needed. To cope withour chronic energy problem calls for a muchmore modest rise.How to bridge the gap? Gasoline ration-ing is the instrument of choice for the tran-sition. Even with its well-known defects,,itsadvantages over massive price increasesfor the short run seem compelling. If wesimply let prices run to the heights that willclear today's,..market, they will not only risefar above the long-run equilibrium level,but generate unconscionable profitsin thetens of billions of dollarsfor the petroleumindustry.The price solution does not avoid thedisruptiveeffects of skyrocketing pricestoday and skidding prices after the transi-tion.The all-out price solution, would sharplyincrease the risks of putting the price-wagespiral beck into orbit. .56THE CASIO IPOR riATIONING9 9 \\'In other words, if seeking ma-'', +minablecertaintya commodity in con- siderably 'shorter supply today than gaso-linerationing is the way to get it: certain-ty for the government in achieving the de-aired cutback in gasoline use and certaintyfor the consumer in getting a basic allot-ment of gasoline without paying ransom.In addition, if we adopt a simple andswift rationing system, using either negoti-able coupons or a basic ration plus couponsauctioned by the government, the level ofthe auction price could tell us a lot aboutthe changing degree of supply-demand im-balance. As the price drops, it would giveus automatic signals for the phase-out ra-tioning.As a transitional device, then, rationingwins out on its merits over the alternativesof savage price or tax increases. Whatmakes the case well nigh conclusive arethree interrelated political facts of life:The Public preference for rationing isoverwhelming. The Harris Poll shows a71-21 acceptance ratio for rationing and a78-17 rejection ratio for gasoline tax in-creases.Speed is of the essence, and power toration is 'about to be put Into the Presi-dent's hands. A simplified coupon systemcould go into effect in weeks.But how do we answer if Simon says,implicitly or explicitly, \"Who needs it?\"Who needs rationing when rising prices,voluntary and compulsory curbs on petro-leum use, and a toughened system of allo-cations and guided price changes are al-ready working to balance Supply and de-mand?Broadly, the answer is that the policyto date nuts enormous risks of failing tosuppress wasteful and nonessential uses aenergy enough to safeguard the vital usesthat nourish employment, production andincome.The Walt Street Journal, 12-21-78A 0 :I To Guide YourReaarri.RationingEquilibriumTransitionCommodityAllotmentScarcity Some Questions to Consider 1.

M// rStudent Notes ve THE CABE FOR RATIONING 57 The Coming Crisis:(The Specter of World Famine One of the primary difficulties with social science edu-cation is the inability to examine present problems, to an-alyze them, and to project future implications. This compla-cency of mankind, especially in the western world, was mostrecently illustrated in the gasoline shortage of 1973-74.Warnings of future energy shortages were heard severalyears ago, but fell on deaf ears as we merrily moved aheadassuming our technology would solve 411 problems. Suddenly,the carefree world of cheap gasoline, -heating oil and naturalgas in the United States became a thing of the past. Al-though there appears to be a temporary respite with theproblem of energy, the question must be raised, \"Have welearned our lesson?\"Another crisis appearing on the horizon is a possibleuniversal famine. Although there have beep many doomsdayprophets throughout the history of mankind, ReverendThomas Malthus, a 19th century English economist, fearedthat the ever enlarging demands of groping numbers ofmouths to feed could not be fulfilled with existing farmingresources. Although, there are many present day prophetsof doom, many of the more recent forecasters of pessimismare really reincarnations of the Thomas Robert Malthusspeaking through a computer. The study, Limits to Growth,supported by the Club of Rome, is really an updated versionof Malthus' earlier wok. Even though the Reverend mademany contributions to economics, he is primarally remem-bered today for his gloomy analysis of. population trends.He contended in the absence of moral restraint, populationwill outstrip the available means of subsistance. The follow-ing article may provide some background information re-garding our present food crisis. 5Student Notes re THE COMING CRISIS59 Student Notes 60THE COMING CRISISReflection Questions on the ReadingAfter reading the article, \"The Next Crisis; UniversalFamine\", consider the world in two sections, the industrialand underdeveloped. Why have the underdeveloped coun-tries continued to experience critical food shortages?With famines being predicted and actually occurring indifferent parts of Africa and Asia, what do you believe thefuture role of the United States should be regarding foodproduction and distribution? CSome Questions To Consider1. Although the U.S. has had large grain surpluses in thepast, two reasons are givin why the reserves have dwin-dled to nothing. .2. Lester Brown, a former Agriculture Department official,states, \"Americans tnight have to eat less meat a yearfrom iow or watch people starve to death, on the TVnews.\" What policies would you recommend to encourageAmericans to consume less meat? 3. After the Russian wheat deal several years ago, wheatprices tripled within a year. Why? 4. When considering the price of loodstuffs, where competi-tion becomes increasingly intense, explain why the poorcarry the heaviest burden. 5. Prices have risen 9% for sirloin steak, 28% for ham-burger, 103% for rice and 123% for beans over the lastyears. Why did prices progressively go upward with theless desirable To U.S.Supplies, Global Starvation AiSurpluses Dwindle, Prices Soar A catastrophic world famine has suddenlybecome possible again. The prospect ofwidespread starvation has had more seriouspolitical and scientific attention in recentmonths than it as received in years. Thistime the doomsayers aren't just talkingagain about squalor in India, but also aboutshortages, high prices, and maybe even foodrationing in the United States.The age of famine is already upon us,\"says James MacCracken, who directs theChurch World Service and gets pessimisticfeedback from many of the 40 countrieswhere his private relief organization is try-ing to improve food and health conditions.\"It is not unlikely that, about a year fromnow, political leaders may have to ask theAmerican people to do the equivalent, infood, of turning down the thermostat seve-ral degrees,\" says Lester R. Brown, a for-fer Agriculture Department official whohad a reputation as a food supply optimista few years ago.\"In any year iron; now forward, Indiaand Bangladesh could lose as many as 100million people to famine,\" says R. G. An-derson, a plant scientist. He helped createthe \"green revolution\" in food-growing tech-niques that Brown and others hailed a shorttime ago as a way to stave off just suchfamines.World food production has risen slightlyfaster than population over the last coupleof decades, but the new concern is morethan the traditional fear that birth rates willoutstrip harvests. It stems from two majorchanges in the world's food supply and eat-ing habits.No More SurplusesFirst, the enormous American agricultu-ral surplus that used to prevent famineselsewhere has entirely vanished. The lastgrains of wheat or oats or whatever weresold off from Government bins last summer. The 50 million acres of unfilled Amer-ican farmland that used to backstop thatsurplus have also evaporated. The Govern-ment no longer pays farmers to keep landidle, and most of that \"extra\" land is backin production.Second, the rich nations' rising appetitefor meat is pricing basic food supplies be-yond-the reach of poor people. Grain pro-duction has to grow much more rapidly thanpopulation now because rich nations buy upmore and more to feed to pigs and cattle.\"From some viewpoints you can look at thesituation as the poor man's grain beingsiphoned off to feed the rich man's cow,\"says director Max Milner of the United Na-tions' Protein Advisory Group.The .U.S. Food Basket\"The parallels between the food situationand the energy situation are much closerthan most people realize,\" says Nevin Scrim-shaw, professor of nutrition at the Massa-chusetts Institute of Technology. A basicdifference between the food and the oilshortages, however, is that Americans; rethe Arabs of the world food supply. TheUnited States exports almost as much wheatand more corn and soybeans than all therest ofmoreworld put together. It even ex-,ports more rice than any other nation.\"The choice that will come if 'there is adrought in North America,\" says Scrim-shaw, \"is whether you deliberately make adecision to let some countries starve ordeliberately cutback on our use [of grain]to share it with the rest of the world.\" Evenwithout a drought, says Brown, Americansmight have to eat less meet a year from THE COMING CRISIS61 62now or \"watch people starve to death onthe TV newt\"Competing for GrainThe world fell suddenly into this fix in1972, when world-wide harvests declined forthe first time since World War II. It wasonly a small decline, 8 or 4 per cent, but itwas made worse as rich countries competedin the market place for grain to feed theanimals to slake the nations' growing tastefor meat. It takes about five times as muchgrain to produce a high-meat diet as onethat relies mostly on cereals.Thus the Soviet Union, which had alwayspulled in its consumers' belts to get throughprevious lean years, chose instead to followother affluent countries and import grain tomake up for its own poor harvest. The Sovi-ets imported more food in 1973 than anycoluitry ever has in history. When the dustsettled, the American surplus was gone andwheat prices had tripled to more than $5per bushel.\"Five-dollars-a-bushwheat ...overa long period of time dmean that reallytens of millions of people are going to diean earlier death by malnutrition,\" saidJames P. Grant, president of the OverseasDevelopment Council.Last year was a bumper-crop year formost of the world, but growing populationsand a growing taste for meat consumed theentire harvest. The price stayed high andagain there was no surplus. The world'sgrain reserve continued to shrink. PresidentJohn Knowles of the Rockefeller Foundationwarned last month that projected 1974 re-serves are enough to feed the world for only29 days. Four years ago there was a 69-daysupply. It has shrunk from 95. days In 1961.Competition Creates ScarcityFor some people, then, diets have be-come worse- in spite of the bumper 1973harvest. And for the first time, Americansare forced to compete with foreigners forscarce food.Thus the Russian wheat purchases droveworld prices up far above what the hungry4masses in India can afford. But they alsodrove up the price in the United States andmade wheat so scarce that American bakerssay we may have a temporary bread short-age this summer. And thus wealthy Jap-anese can compete with oldinary Americansfor scarce meat, paying ;6:35 per pound inTokyo butcher shops for U.S.-raised rib-eyesteak, while the Americans whop packagedit eat hamburger.The Americans in turn compete withpoorer Guatemalans for beef raised on theirranchos. Scrimshaw says beef productionis increasing in Central America, but beefeating is declining there because Americanconsumers,utbid the natives. THE COMING CRISISThis price competition falls heavily onthe poor, in this country as well as overseas. The wealthy can compete for the poorman's food; the poor man cannot competeat all.Pressures on the PoorThus a steak-eating American who is putoff by last year's 9 per cent rise in the priceof sirloin can still step down to hot dogsand hamburgers. But people who were al-ready eating hot dogs and hamburgers faceprice increases of 34 and.,23 per cent, re-spectively, for these kinds of meat. If theystep down to a poor man's diet of riceand beans they put unbearable pressure onpeople who already had to depend on thosefoods. The price of rice rose 103 per centlast year; beans went up 123 per cent.\"I hazard the guess that most of thatmalnutrition was due to ignorance ratherthan economics,\" Milner says, of the 1960'sdiscovery that many Americans were under-nourished in a land of plenty. \"There werelow-cost sources of food if poor people knewhow to use and prepare them.\"\"But now I think we have reached apoint where [American] poor people, evenif they understand how to buy nutritiousfoods at the lowest prices, are still going tobe in difficulty.\"indeed, after eating more and more beeffor decades, the average American cut hisbeef consumption last year to 109 poundsfrom 116 in 1972. His ration of pork fell tod1.5 pounds from 67.Against this background of high prices,short supplies, and the evaporation of sur-plus Government food stocks, the prospectof even a minor crop failure scares the day-lights out of politicians and food experts.\"For the next year or so we'll be skatingon very thin ice,\" says Ambassador EdwinMartin, who is coordinating the _Americanposition for a world food conference theUnited Nations has called for November atthe suggestion of Henry Kissinger. \"It isn'ta sure thing that there will be a crisis inthe fall, but we'll have to have a lot ofthings going for us to avoid one,\"But the energy crisis means we won'thave everything going for us.

The case of automobile safetylegislation provides an excellent case and point where thequestion may be raised: did the politicians carefully consideralternatives when passing the National Motor Vehicle andTraffic Safety Act in 1966 or was it railroaded through thepolitical system by certain pressure groups in the politicalsystem. Sometimes pressures from different fronts result insudden passage of laws where more time should have, beentakdn discussing the implications if the law is passed. In apolitical frame of reference, the Gulf of Tonkin resolutionand the National Safety Act have many similarities. In bothcases Congress was dealing with a problem and in the processof Making their decision failed to consider both the possiblealternatives and consequences of their decision.

For one thing, motorists' long-simmering _wrath at the inconve-nience and expense has begun to boilover. According to those who arepushing for air bags and other so-called passive restraints (no actionis required of drivers or passen-gers), at least two out 'of five seatbelts lie idle. Repair shops whichspecialize in ridding new cars ofanti-pollution and safety devices, le-gally or otherwise, do, a thrivingbusiness;. in Detroit, a car can becompletely \"debugged\" _for ten dol-lars, in an age inflation a modestsum and one which indicates heavytraffic. Weight-wise and in, dollars-and-cents,roughestimatesare available,too. Depending on safety equipmenthas added 300-odd -pounds to grossvehicle weight, and, with respect AUTOMOBILE SAFETYthe '74s, $300 to the price (over' $500by 1976). All told, including the extragas needed to move the addedweight, safety is costing the not-so-happy motorist a sum approaching$5 billion per year, and the end isnowhere in sight.Like the federal bulldozer, thesafety juggernaut is no economymodel. For its huge outlay, the mo-toring public has precious title toshow. By government decree, all'73s had to be equipped with bump-ers that could meet low speed bar-rier tests, thereby reducing the fre-quency of front and rear damage.While the latter has fallen off, say-ing have been wholly offset by thehigher cost of repairing the newbumpers.Volkswagenhasjust served notice on owners of Beetlesmade between 1968 and 1972 thatseat and shoulder belts, improperlystowed, may be weakened by an ac-cumulation of battery acid on thefloor. Consumers Union has foundfour out of seven federally approvedauto seats for children faulty. In De-cember, 1972, a U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals delayed imposition of man-dated passive restraints because theofficial test dummies (why shouldthey be any different) failed to workright.According to the Department ofTransportation, the effectiveness ofhead restraints\"has been verylow,\" in at least one case, they al-legedly have proven lethal. Jose-phine B. Hubbell, widow of a psychi-atrist who died after striking a head-rest in his Chevy Nova during a rear-end collision, has just won $2 millionin damages from GM (which hasfiled an appeal), And the safety sta-tistics furnished cold comfort. As wewrote last fall, deaths per millionvehicle miles were down, but the de-, \"dit ) cline matched that allegedlyselling razzle-dazzle and Ralph Na-der was still in school.Thanks to the gasoline shortage,however, the free world lately hasturned into a safety laboratory, withwhat can only be viewed as astonish-ing results. According to the Na-tional Safety Council, U.S. vehicle-#miles driven in November and De-cember lagged the year-earlier total-by perhaps 2%. Yet, as speed limitsthroughout the country were low-ered to 55 miles an hour, the numberof highway fatalities in the twomonths dropped 9% and January, U.S.highway 25%. limit of fatalities bythree-fifths.)Even theNationalHighway Traffic Safety Administra-tion seems impressed. It reportsthat 16 states with lowered speedlimits in November showed a 15%-20% drop in the number of highwaydeaths, those which left them un-changed only 2%. NHTSA may notfully grasp the significance of suchstatistics, or may not want to, butthe meaning is clear. In automotivesafety, the U.S., by over-emphasiz-ing the car and virtually ignoringthe driver, has been hurtling towarda dead end. It's time to slam on thebreaks and back up.Robert M.

G 0Student Notes MOTORCYCLES AND PUBLIC SAFETY 6 1. 68Motorcycles and Public SafetyDOES IT seem odd to you, as itdoes to me, that a Governmentthat compels the driver of a 1974automobile to be snug in a safetyharness before his car will start, aGovernment greatly interested in airbags, padded dashboards, andmanner of safety-related bells, buzzers, and flAsthing lightsdoes iseem odd to you that such a Govern-ment permits the operation of motor-cycles on public road?There are few more hazardousways of getting from one place to an-other, short of being shot out of acannon, than by riding a motorcycle.Says Lewis S. Buchanan of theNational Highway Traffic Safety Ad-ministration: \"More than 80 per centof the reported motorcycle accidentsresult in injury or death. A compara-ble figure for automobiles is 10 percent.\"A minimum amount of good will,I think, requires all of us to count to10 before condemning another per-son's choice of fun. Motorcyclistspay taxes too, and they have theirrights. But even though the nation'sroads are for the use of many kindsof vehicles, we may properly drawthe line when the evidence suggeststhat a certain type of machine, be-cause of its very design, is unusuallydangerous to the operator and anypassenger.There is a temptation to say, and-1some people probably do say, that solong as the motorcyclist's risk ismostly to himself, let him be. Afterall,motorcycles very rarely rundown pedestrians, and in any en-counter between a motorcycle and acar, the motorcycle is likely to lose.This attitude, however, fails totake into account that motorcyclescan be the indirect cause of auto ac-cidents. Their presence often startlesand confuses atarm's length will obscure a cyclistonly 100 feet away.\")There is a special danger when amotorcycle approaches a car fromthe rear. There are blind spots in thedriver's rearward vision that usuallydon't affect his seeing another auto,ut seeing the slender motorcycle isother matter.t is unnecessary to serve up alarg'e plate of gore here. You haveheard about the recent motorcycleaccidents that cost an actor an armand a legs that put a Minnesota Vik-ing football player in a wheel chairfor the rest of his life, that left a NewJersey youth paralyzed from theneck down until his grief-strickenbrother shot him dead in a mad actof mercy. But you probably have notheard about many of the less-publi-cized accidents that resulted in 2,747deaths in 1972.It is certain that the number ofsuch deaths will increase greatly inthe next few years. Again quotingBuchanan. \"From registrations ofItss than 600,000 in 1960 the total ofregistered motorcycles has grown toabout 4 million. It is likely that anadditional 600,000 registrations [havebeen] added during 1973. It is prob-able that the use of motorcycles willcontinue expansion until about 10per cent of all registered vehiclesare motorcycles.\"The National Highway TrafficSafety Administration, which is partof the Department of Transportation,recognizes the special hazards ofmotorcycle riding. And the agency isconscientiously pushing such safetyprecautionsasUnprovedcyclist training,crash helmets,periodiccycle inspection, and daytime use ofthe headlight.If all the states adopted all themotorcycle regulations the FederalGovernment has urged, and if all thestates enforced the legislation al-ready on their books, Washingto of- ficials contend, the hi cycle death rate would be ruced.But even after allat can bedone has been done weleft with MOTORCYCLES AND PUBLIC SAFETY the nature of the motorcycleIt is not a suitable machine to minglewith cars, buses, and trucks on pub-lic thoroughfares.

Roberts Jr.The National Obaerven 1249-'73 MOTORCYCLES AND PUBLIC SAFETY69 Future Fear During the Winter of 1974 and continuing through theSummer of 1975, the U.S. has experienced one of the worstrecessions since the 1900's. Unemployment has skyrocketedto the unprecedented height of over 10% in some states andthe prospects for a rapid recovery depend on many unpre-dictable variables. One of the variables, possibly the mostcritical, is the future available supply of energy. One furthercomplication is that a large portion of our supply is foreignand its availability is dependent on the political mood of theArabs.However, before one becomes overly depressed, the pastrecord of performance within the U.S. economy should notbe overlooked. Although there have been ups and downs inthe economy over the past four decades, the real growth(ability to produce goods and services) has averaged about4% through our history. Thus, if past performance 'providesStudent Notes any indication of the future, the U.S. economy has always-been able to come back. p.FUTURE FEAR7/ Future FearIs the Economy SlidingInto DeclineAnd Facing Low GrowthBitter Polities of Income Pies By JAMES P. GANNONStaff Rcporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNALThere is one dimension of the nation'seconomic condition that can't be found in allthe official statistics, the economists' fore-casts, the government reports. It is intangi-ble, immeasurable, btit important.It comes across strongly when business-men and economists are asked to- look fiveto 10 years ahead, and to think out loudabout what sort of American economic situ-ation they foresee. Call it, future fear.It takes varying forms: A feeling that theU.S. is sliding down the British path of de- Student Notes 72w'FUTURE FEAR4,4 cline toward economic stagnation. A beliefthat resource scarcities point- toward slowgrowth and Political strife over how to sliceup a static nationalincome pie. A convictionthat a political system that rewards politi-cians who deliver short-term benefits can'tcope with long-term economic problems re-quiring sacrifice. A fear that we haven'tlearned from our past economic blundersand are doomed to repeat them.A decade of economic, political and so-cial turmoil produces somber moods andsaber musing. Perhaps these visions aresimply exaggerated extrapolations of the re-cent past into the near future. Waves of eco-nomic pessimism have swept over the U.S.before, especially during the Great Depres-sion, only to ebb away amid subsequentprosperity. And since the current worriesare focusing on the years just ahead, theyaren't talking about the possibility that sci-entific advances later on could overcomethe energy problems that confront the econ-omy now.Another word of caution: These viewsaren't from a crosssection of America;they come mainly from business people andeconomistsmost, though not all, conserva-tives. Most of these are people with a majorstake in the status quo, and with a fear thatit is crumbling.But even if their worries are way off-base as forecasts, they have some signifi-cance as influence on Americans' currentthoughts and actions. Thus they're worthhearing. Some Questions-to Considera) How will the supply of energy affect our futurelifestyle? b) Will the future result in more government in-volvement within the economy? c) What are future job propects for the high schooland college graduates? d) What kinds of jobs will be in greater demandin five years, in 10 years? e) What implications does a no-growth economyhave fob' different socio-economic groups? 6,i Many people maintain different positions regarding thefuture of the U.S. economy. Some of the variance in positionmay be due to one's socio-economic position. However, one'sage may flavor how he feels about the economy. Read eachof the following and respond to the questions.The ExecutiveFletcher Byrom pullsthe Cellophanewrapper off a ham sandwich, pops the plas-tic lid from a Coke and invites a visitor tolunch in his Pittsburgh office, where he'schairman of Koppers Co., a diversified in-dustrial concern. Mr. Byrom isn't a typicalcorporate chief executive. He reads bookson philosophy and social change. He leadsseminars forhis middle managers. Hethinks a lot, broods a lot.\"I see the potential for significant im-provement in our economy, but I don't thinkit will be realized,\" he says. \"In five to 10years, we will be moving strongly in thedi,- on of state control of capital-intensivedustries. It is already too late for the elec.tric utilities. Our political system just won'tallow corporations to make the profits theyneed.\"Look, we've got a political system thatwon't work. A Congressman has to get reelected every two years. The time frames ofour office holders are incompatible with theproblems we face. We keep proceeding withad hoc responses to crises. We're basicallyescapists. We don't want to admit we havean energy problem, so even now we stilldon't have a energy policy in this coun-try.\"His solution is sweeping: a constitutionalconvention to redefine the goals of U.S. soci-ety, overhaul the political system (perhapsa one-term, nine-year presidency and longerterms for Congressmen) and establish aneconomic planning body to set long-termpolicies.Mr. Byrom rejects the notion he's a pes-simist \"I think we're in terrible trouble, butI'm suggesting we have a way out. The sys-tem has to be changed. I see no other way.The only concern I have is whether or notwe have enough time\"The Executive .. He refers to the possibility of more state control of cer-tain industries. What would be some advantages and dis-advantages? What are some advantages and disadvantages to hissuggested modification of the political system? The ProfessorRobert Lekachman, who teaches eco-nomics at the City University of New York,is hardly a conservative. \"I'm from the re-spectable old left,\" which means wearing ashirt and tie and \"belief in occasional hair-cuts,\" he says with a smile. Without anydrama, he sketches out a coming age ofscarcity.\"I think we are entering a lang period ofslower growth. I take seriously the resonrcescarcities. We've reached the end of cheapenergy. Energy 'shortages will act as a dragon growth. Incomewill be shifting out ofthis country to the oil producers. The pros-pects for improvement in the Americanstandard of life thus are much less thanthey've been.\"This has very intriguing political impli-cations. I think we are going to enter a pe-nod where the politics are going to centeron income redistribution. This is a verypainful sort of politics. You see, in the poli-tics of growth, you' can say that there isgoing to be more for everybody. But in thepolitics of redistribution, if someone is goingto get more, someone else is going to getless. This means more confrontation be-tween groups.\"In a slow-growth society, people whohave jobs and incomes would have to sup-port growing numbers who don't, the profes-sor says. This would cost the middle classdearly, he thinks. \"It's going to cost allupper and middle-income people dough.You won't be able to finance things just byraising taxes on people in the $150,000-a-year bracket. There Just aren't' enough ofthem. You'll finance it by taxing people inthe $25,000-and-up brackets. And that in-eludes professors.\" suggests, \"We've reached the endof cheap energy.\" How will rising costs of energy affect ourlife style?How is income from energy being shifted to other coun-tries? How does the increasing prfce of energy result in in-come redistribution?rHave class consider implications of the last paragraphas they become productive members of society in futureyears.

But chances are today's infants will becoping with essentially the same kind ofauto power plant you're using when they'reold enough to drive.No other conclusion seems reasonableafter hearing an engineering report sessionsponsored here by the division of advancedautomotive power systems of the EnergyResearch and Development Administration.The technical experts devoting their skillsto producing an alternative to the conven-tional gasoline engine are the fiist to con-cur.But there's every reason to believe thatthe days of the spark-ignition, piston-typeauto\"engine are numbered.

GAS SAVING ENGINES?And don't sniff at the idea of tinkeringwith today's vehicles to produce limitedsavings for the short term. Because of thefairly long road life of motor vehicles, clpy-errunent analysts figure bringing the nation-al average fuel consumption up to 28 milesper gallon in 1980 would save more gasolineby the end of the century than having a 40m.p.g. car Introduced in 1985 or a 80 m.p.g.car in 1990.Modifications of existing engines alreadyare on drawing boards, and some are get-ting to the experimental hardware stage.Federal energy officials are pinning theirhopes not just on improvements in the gas-oline-combustion process but also on moreefficient transmissions with infinitely vari-able speed, improved accessory drives, andeven devices for using exhaust heat to im-prove engine efficiency.Such stop-gap measures could buy timeto put revolutionary engine changes intouse. But time is not all that's needed: En-gineering skill is required to polish up thealternative power plants, and plenty ofmoney is needed to effect the manufactur-ing changeoyer.Research-and,develoPment executives fortwo of Detroit's Big Three auto makersagree- roughly on the requirements. Fromthe time a satisfactory, tested experimen-tal engine is completed, they estimate itwill take a minimum of 10 years and ;500million to bring it to full prpduotion.And there's always the risk. \"If the in-dustry were to 'go to the gas turbine andwe had some kind of flap of the type thaturfaced on the catalyst isiXterni for auto-pollution control], something unknown andunforeseen, the industry could go bankrupt,\"says George Huebner, Chrysler director ofresearch.Huebner is the leading advocate of thegas-turbine system and has guided Chryslerresearch through six generations of tur-bines.
