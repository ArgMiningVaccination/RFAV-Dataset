I had almost forgotten (or is supressed the correct verb?) but, to be entirely truthful, a long time ago (in the mid 1970s), I even experimented with this odd therapy myself. When I worked as a [junior doctor in a homeopathic hospita](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scientist-Wonderland-Searching-Finding-Trouble/dp/1845407776)l, several of my collegues practised homeopuncture and taught me how to do it. Essentially, you inject homeopathic remedies into acupuncture points. My colleagues told me that this approach is more powerful than each method alone. I tried it several times but remained unconvinced. Recently, a German Heilpraktiker (Andreas Maier), reminded me of all this. Here is what he states on his [website](https://naturheilpraxis-maier.de/homoeopunktur/) about homeopuncture: In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture in addition to the herb medicine as well as certain movement therapies (eg. B. Gong Qi) constituting an important element in the treatment of diseases. By stimulating energy points with the help of fine needles will then attempts to harmonize the flow of vital energy. a disruption of vital energy because (also called Qi), is considered in Chinese medicine as a cause of any disease. Only when the energy flows freely through all the tissues and organs of the body, the organism can develop normally and is healthy. A similar approach is also the Homeopathy, which originated at the other end of the world, namely in Germany. Samuel Hahnemann (1755 - 1843), the discoverer of this method of healing, also saw a failure of the life force as a pathogenic factor. By smallest stimuli the homeopath tries to eliminate these disease-causing disorder and bring about healing. Unlike in the acupuncture reduced drug doses to be used strictly in accordance with the [principle of similarity ](https://www.homoeopathie-heute.de/ueber-homoeopathie/entwicklung-und-konzept/) are selected. Mid-19th century was the German physician Dr. August consecration firmly (1840- 1896) that disease with painful spots may accompany the body. These pain points are often far from the actual disease process. The phenomenon was known to the Chinese for thousands of years in Europe, however, no one had yet busy. Dr. Weihe, himself a keen homeopath, was in the treatment of his patients finally see that by the suitably chosen homeopathic healed not only the disease, but also disappeared the painfulness of the points. It was surprising that certain homeopathic remedies appear to be well-defined points had a direct bearing on the body. A few years later, the Chinese medicine and acupuncture also reached the European continent, they took Weihe discoveries closer look. A comparison of the so-called consecration points with acupuncture points showed significant matches. The more than 300 known Weihe points are also used therapeutically since both diagnosis. Because they can provide information on the pathological processes in the body and on the displayed homeopathic. thus the Hom\u00f6opunktur brings together the findings from Chinese medicine and homeopathy. The treatment can be done differently. On the one hand the consecration points can be traditionally stimulated with fine needles, concomitant administration of homeopathic medicine. With the help of injection preparations, means may also be injected directly to the point. ________________________________________________________________ (sorry about my friend's poor English; I hope you could make sense of it) I don't think I need to tell you what the evidence tells us about homeopuncture. Yes, you guessed it: nothing! But the idea of combining SCAMs is fascinating nevertheless. So, let me suggest a few further SCAM combinations that might be attractive: - acupuncture + massage (sorry, that already exists under the name of shiatsu) - colonic irrigation + coffea (that to is already taken by the Gerson guys) - art therapy + homeopathy (too late: this one too already exists; [painting homeopathy on the body surface](https://www.amazon.de/Medizin-zum-Aufmalen-Hom\u00f6opathie-Fallbeispiele/dp/3863743555/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1XSDQ0L9LGSK&keywords=hom%C3%B6opathie+zum+ausmalen&qid=1569752423&sprefix=homoeopathie+zum+aufmalen%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-3)) - detox + meditation (no, the health retreat/wellness entrepreneurs might get upset) I am clearly not very successful at finding viable SCAM combinations. Let's look for something innovative, something that nobody has yet thought of. How about: - homeo-laugh (homeopathy followed by an explanation what homeopathy is resulting in laughter; not sure that this would sell all that well) - kinesiology colour taping (instead of using random colours for kinesiology tape, this approach uses the wisdom of coulourtherapists to match the patient's individual colour requirements; this means the therapists needs dual qualifications and can thus charge double - I think that might be attractive!) - autologous slapping therapy (this combination of slapping and [autologous blood therapy](https://edzardernst.com/2019/09/autologous-whole-blood-therapy-another-very-surprising-scam-does-it-merit-further-study/)(ABT) means the therapist has to hit so hard that the patient develops sizable haematomas which are the ABT part of the intervention; perhaps a bit risky, as some patients might call the police) - effective reverse energy transfer counselling, ERETC (the patients is counselled that his money can, with the help of the therapist, be converted into pure healing energy; to make it work, the patient needs to transfer it to the account of the therapist - the more the better) I think I like ERECT best; in fact, I will start work on it straight away. It still needs to be perfected, but once it's up and running, it will be just great and, as the name already makes clear, effective - not for the patient, but for "}
