When changes occur at a cellu lar level between neurons, this is known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity has been proposed to be a key mechanism underpinning the learning and memory formation that occurs following afferent input (i.e., incoming stimuli from movement and sensa tion) . However, synaptic plasticity in the human brain follows a positive loop cycle where incoming stimul i can lead to excessive synaptic strengthening (long -term potentiation ; LTP ) or weakeni ng (long -term depression ; LTD ). To prevent overexpression of LT P or LTD, regulatory mechanisms termed ' homeostatic plasticity ' promote stability during synaptic plasticity . A large body of evidence suggests that short - or long -term changes to synaptic pl asticity takes place following afferent input. Similarly, evide nce also suggests synaptic plasticity is altered in individuals experiencing incoming stimuli that are painful . However, no study has examined homeostatic plasticity during pain . Published s tudies that have examined homeostatic plasticity in individuals wi th pathology have been conducted in neurological conditions such as writer's cramp, and chronic migraine. These studies provide preliminary evidence that impaired homeostatic plasticity is asso ciated with altered synaptic high primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, altered cortical organisation, increased pain perception , and sensorimotor dysfunction . As altered synaptic plasticity and similar clinical features have been observed in individuals with xx chronic mu sculoskeletal pain , it is possible that homeostatic plasticity is impaired during pain. Thus, the broad goal of this thesis was to explore the effect of pain, using a clinical chronic musculosk eletal pain population and an experimental pain model, on homeo static plasticity in the M1. To address this broad goal, three primary research studies were conducted. In study one, test-retest reliability of M1 homeostatic regulation , induced and assessed using non - invasive brain stimulation , was examined in ten , right-handed, healthy volunteers at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks . To induce M1 homeostatic plasticity, a double anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocol was app lied. This involved two blocks of excitatory anodal tDCS applie d in succession for 7 -minutes and 5 -minutes with a 3 -minute rest period in between (doubl e tDCS protocol). Following the double tDCS protocol, moderate -to-good test-retest reliability (ICC= 0. 43 to 0.67) was observed for M1 homeostatic plasticity when induced and assessed at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks . Thus, study one provide s the first data that, by using the double tDCS protocol , M1 homeostatic plasticity can be induced and ass essed reliably over time in healthy individuals . Further, t hese data provide the foundation for assessment of M1 homeostatic plasticity using repeated measures , and longitudinal study designs in humans. Using the double tDCS protocol described above, study two investigate d homeostatic plasticity in the M1 of 50 indiv iduals with non-specific chronic low back pain (cLBP), and xxi 25 healthy, pain -free, controls. In individuals with non -specific cLBP, the first block of 7- minutes anodal tDCS increased M1 excitabi lity consistent with the response observed in healthy, pain -free, controls (P<0.003) . However, in contrast to healthy, pain-free controls, the application of a second block of 5-minutes anodal tDCS failed to reduce M1 excitability in individuals with non-specific cLBP ( P0.1). Results from study two provide evidence of impaired M1 homeostatic plasticity in individuals with non -specific cLBP. These data may explain previous observations of altered synaptic plasticity and pain persistence in individuals with non-specific cL BP. In study three , the double tDCS protocol described in study one was used to investigate homeostatic plasticity as experimentally induced muscle pain developed, peaked, and resolved. Twenty -one, right -handed, healthy individuals were en rolled in the s tudy for twenty -one days. Muscle p ain was induced using nerve -growth factor (N GF) injected into the right extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle on three occasions: day 0, 2, and 4. Homeostatic plasticity was assessed in the M1 on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 14, with an online diary that included measures of pain intensity, muscle soreness, disability, and sleep quality administered on alternative days from day 1 to 21. A normal M1 homeostatic response was observed on day 0 (P<0.001), and day 14 (P<0.001). However, the progressive development of experimentally induced muscle pain altered M1 homeostatic plasticity in otherwise healthy individuals on day 2 (P=0.07), day 4 (P=0.7), and day 6 (P=0.5). These xxii data provide the first information on M1 homeo static plasticity as pain develops, peaks, and resolves. These three studies provide original and novel data on M1 homeostatic plasticity during pain. First, M1 homeostatic plasticity was establish ed as reliable across two weeks in healthy individuals . Second, stud y two, and study three suggest homeostatic plasticity is impaired during pain as participants failed to regulate excessive increases in M1 excitability during painful stimuli . The findings from study two is based on a cross sectional study design in a clinical chronic musculoskeletal pain population, while study three used an experimental pain model . When viewed together, the work presented in this thesis deepens our understanding of M1 homeostatic plasticit y in response to pain and suggests that homeostatic pla sticity may be responsible for altered synaptic plasticity that has been observed in a number of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions. However, longitudinal studies in clinical pain populations are needed to extend the work presented in this thesis to f ully understand the role of homeostatic plasticity during pain. If homeostatic plasticity is demonstrated to underpin the development of pain, therapies tha t seek to target altered synaptic plasticity may need to target homeostatic, rather t han synaptic pl asticity mechanisms to improve treatment effectiveness, and patient responsiveness to therapy. xxiii Thesis overview Neuroplasticity, broadly understood as 'the way the brain changes itself' , underpins learning, and memory formation. Change in neuronal conne ctions take place in response to new situations, changes in the environment , and alterations to afferent input (i.e., incoming stimuli from movement or sensation ) (Bryan et al., 2003; Joseph, 2013; Ko lb & Gibb, 2011 ). Originally, the adult human brain was thought to be immutable (Cajal, 1928; Hubel & Wiesel, 1962, 1970) . However, the discovery that the brain can change and adapt throughout life has led to a su rge of investig ations on neuroplasticity in a variety of clinical conditions , and as a potential target for t he treatment and prevention of pathology (Boudreau et al., 2010; Flor, 2002; Nitsc h, 2002) . A large body of research has focussed on mechanisms that underpin change in the human brain (Citri & Malenka , 2008; Joseph, 2013) . This body of work has identified a number of fu nctional and st ructural mechanisms , including th e expression of long -term potentiation (LTP) - and long -term depression (LTD) -like changes in synaptic plasticity, thought to underpin brain changeability. However, synaptic plasticity follows a positive feedb ack loop, where it is possible to have too much LT P or LTD formation (Joseph, 2013; Turrigiano, 1999) . As a result, in addition to mechanisms that promote change , the human brain is governed by mechanisms that prom ote stability (Turrigiano & Nelson, 200 0, 2004) . These mechanisms, termed homeostatic plasticity plasticity , and ensure that a balance between change and stability is maintained within neural networks at all times (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . Thus, homeostatic control is essential to ensure healthy brain activity. However, to date, investigation of thi s mechanism in healthy populations and those with clinical conditions is limited. Previously published studies exploring homeostatic plasticity in clinical populations have been conducted only in individuals with writer's cramp, and chronic migraine (Karabanov et al., 2015) . Evidence from these st udies suggest an association between impaired homeostatic control and clinical symptoms of pain and sensorimotor dysfunction (Anta l et al., 2008b ; Cosentino et al., 2014b; Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone & Pisani, 2011) . As similar clinical symptoms including pain, and sensorimotor dysfunctio n are observed in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Apk arian et al., 2009; Apkarian et al., 2011) , it is possible that homeostatic plasticity may also be impaired in these individuals . Therefore , the broad goal of this thesis was to explore the effect of pain on homeostatic plasticity in the hu man primary mot or cortex (M1). To answer the overarching goal, three primary research studies were conducted. Study one aimed to determine whether methods used to induce and assess homeostatic plasticity in the M1 were reliable over time in human subject s. Study two examined homeostatic plasticity in the M1 of individuals with non -specific chronic low back pain. Study three xxv examined the effect of progressively developing muscle pain (induced using repeated injection of nerve growth factor [NGF]) on M1 homeostatic plasti city in otherwise healthy individuals. The specific aims and hypotheses for each study were as follows: Study one Aim: To determine test-retest reliability of M1 homeostatic plasticity in healthy individuals when induced and assessed usi ng two successi ve blocks of excitatory non - invasive brain stimulation at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Hypothesis: Homeostatic plasticity will be reliably induced and assessed in the M1 of healthy individuals at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks . Study two Aim: To investigate homeostatic plasticity in the M1 of individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain, and healthy, pain-free, controls using two successive blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation applied tively . xxvi Hypothesis: Individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain will fail to display a reversal of excitation towards inhibition following two successive block s of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation consi control plasticity will be observed in healthy, pain-free, controls following two successive blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulati on. Study three Aim: To investigate the influence o f progressively developing muscle pain on homeostatic plasticity in the human M1 elicited using two successive blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation . Hypothesis: Normal homeostatic response observed following two blocks of anodal transc ranial direct c urrent stimulation will be reduced after four days of sustained muscle pain.

Each chapter is presented as it has been pub lished or submi tted for review. A critical review of the literature specific to chapters two to four is provided in the introduction and discussi on sections of each chapter. Prior to this, chapter one provides an in -depth critical review of pertinent liter ature on synapt ic plasticity, and the mechanisms that support change and stability within neural networks. Following this, available literature o n homeostatic plasticity, and the methods for assessing homeostatic regulation in humans are discussed. This is followed by a review of literature that examined homeostatic regulation in clinical populations . Chapter five includes a narrative synthesis of the findings of all three studies, their contribution to the field of homeostatic plasticity during pain and fu ture directions , their clinical implications , and limitations . 1 Chapter 1: Introduction and literature review This chapter provides an overview of synaptic plasticity mechanisms thought to underpin brain changes and a daptability to afferent input . First, homeostatic plasticity is introduced as a mechanism that regulates synaptic plasticity. Then current methodologies used to induce and assess homeostatic regulation are discussed . This is followed by a review of studies investigating the role of ho meostatic plasticity in pathology . The chapter ends with a rationale for each study included in this thesis. Chapter 1 2 1.1 Neuroplasticity Neuroplasticity has been defined as the ability of the brain to change and adapt to affere nt input (i.e., incoming stimuli arising from movement, sensation, and nociception) (Bryan et al., 2003; Joseph, 2013; Kaas, 2001; Kolb & Gibb, 2011 ). take place only during the postnatal devel opment al period , and believed to be hard -wired and immutable in the adult brain (Cajal, 1928; Hubel & Wiesel, 1962, 1970) , neuroplasticity is now understood to be a process of neural change and adaptability through out life (Merzenich et al., Ottersen & 2002; Stahnisch & Nitsch, 2002) . Fundamental to neuroplasticity are the functional unit s of the nervous system known as ' neurons ' (Joseph , 2013; Mayford et al., 2012) . Neurons are nerve cells that relay sensory or motor information through electrical signals known as action potentials (Cuevas, 2007; Mosier, 2010; Stuart et al., 1997 ). An action potential is generated through voltage gated channe ls that are activated following a triggering event ( e.g., afferent input arising from touch or heat ) (Feher, 2017; McCormick, 2014) . Here , an influx of sodium ions through voltage gated sodium channels produce an action potential characterised by increased positive charge within a neuron . As communication between neurons is cent ral to neuroplasticity, an action potential generated in one neuron is conv eyed to another through junctions known as a ' synapse '. Chapter 1 3 Synapses are gaps between neurons that allow information to move from one nerve cell to another (Mayford et al., 2012; S\u00fcdhof & Malenka, 2008) . Information relayed between neurons through synapses are central to neuroplasticity, and the brain's ability to adapt and change in response to afferent input (Cohen & Greenberg, 2008; Green & Bavelier, 2008) . When the brain a dapts, new synapses are formed, or old synapses streng thened, weakened or (Bi 1986) . This process determines the magnitude of neuroplastic change and is known as synaptic plasticity at a cellular level (Mayford et al., 2012; et al., 2005) . 1.2 Synaptic plasticity is the modification between neurons (Feldman, 2009; Joseph, 2013; Pascual -Leone et al., 2005) , and is central to incorporating transient learning experiences to permanent memory traces in the human brain (Fernandes & Carvalho, 2016; Hebb, 1949; Pascual -Leone et al., 2005) . Mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity for learning and memory formation have been divided into two categories: ' short -term synaptic plasticity ', and ' long-term Ramirez -Leone et 2005) . Chapter 1 4 Short -term synaptic plasticity is a rapid process that involves immediate change to synaptic strength on a sub -second timescale (Zucker & Regehr, 2002) . ownregulates synaptic plasticity whi ch leads to short -term learning and memory formation (Citri & Malenka, 2008) . In contrast, long -term synaptic plasticity lasts from hours to days or even years following afferent input (Daoudal & Debanne, 2003) . Long -term synaptic plasticity may lead to permanent changes in brain function, and primarily involves structural changes to neurons that contribute to information storage and memory formation (Alberini, 2009; Grutzendler et al., 2002) . The following secti ons discuss short - and long -term synaptic plasticity during learning and memory formation. 1.2.1 Short -term synaptic plasticity Manipulation of incoming stimuli has been sh own to drive mechanisms of short -term synaptic plasticity (Jacobs & Donoghue, 1991; Zucker & Regehr, 2002) . These mechanisms include unmasking and activation of silent synapses (Atwood & Wojtow icz, 1999; Ziemann (AMPA) receptors (Atwood & Wojtowicz, 1999; Isaac et al., Chapter 1 5 1995; Liao et al., 19 95). Due to the absence of AMPA receptors , silent synapses fail to mediate synaptic transmission between pre - and post -synaptic neuro ns. However, a common mechanism proposed to activate silent synapses is the insertion of AMPA receptors in the post -synapt ic neuron (Gomperts et al., 1998; Liao et al., 199 9; Lu et al., 2001) . This insertion is argued to release the magnesium channel block on NMDA receptors to allow calcium influx (Contractor & Heinemann, 2002; Lu et al., 2001; Sweatt, 2010) . An influx of calcium ions switches a silent synapse to an active synapse , and allows action po tential s (or information) to flow from one neuron to another (Kerchn er & Nicoll, 2008; L\u00fcscher & Frerking, 2001) . Alternatively, a widely accepted mechanism of short -term synaptic plasticity is activity driven changes to synaptic strength between neurons (Bliss & Lomo, 1973; Bli ss Cooke, al., 1977; Mulkey & Malenka, 1992) . Initially demonstrated in the first region of Cornu Ammon is (CA1) in animal hippocamp al slices, high- and-low frequency repetitive stimulation has been shown to increase and dec rease the excit ability of post - synaptic neuron s such that synaptic strength is either enhanced (termed ' long-term potentiation; LTP ') or reduced (termed ' long-term depression; LTD ') (Bliss & Lomo, 1973; Lomo, 1966; . Chapter 1 6 Following early observations, a large body of research ha ve demonstrated activity driven changes to short -term synaptic plasticity (i.e., LTP and LTD induction ) in a number of brain regions (Malenka & Bear, 2004; Martin et a l., 2000; Sacchetti et al., 2001; 2008) . These studies indicate the activation of NMDA type glutamate receptor s is central to activity -dependent short -term synaptic plasticity, and is known to involve several requirements for LTP - LTD induction (B\u00fctefisch et al., 2000; Hell, 2014; Lisman et al., 2012; Madison et a l., 1991) . For instance, several pre-synaptic neurons need to 'fire' together to activate post-synaptic neurons to remove the magnesium channel block and allow cal cium influx (Bear & Malenka, 1994; Catterall et al. , 2013; Hebb, 1 949). A fast and large influx of calcium ions enhance s synaptic strength , and trigger s LTP formation, while a slow and less prono unced influx of calcium ions decrease s synaptic strength , and trigger s LTD formation (Catterall et al., 2013; Hell, 2014; Lisman et al., 2012) . Additionally, concurrent activation of pre - and post -synaptic neurons is necessary for LTP and LTD induction (Bi & Poo, 2001; Debanne et al. , 1998) . This requirement is in line with Hebb's postulate or Hebbian plasticity where \"when an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B a nd repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both ce lls such that A's efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased\" (Hebb, 1949. p. 62) . Chapter 1 7 The unmasking and activation of silent synapses, and activity -dependent LTP and LTD formation suggests modulation of synaptic strength between neurons is central to short - term synaptic plasticity (Feldman, 2009; Zucker & Regehr, 2002) . However , evidence also exists for long lasting changes in synaptic efficacy (termed 'long -term syna ptic plasticity') Debanne, 2003) . For example, Engert & Bonhoeffer (1999 b) demonstrated long -lasting increases in excitability in the CA1 neurons of the make long-term synaptic plasticity a candidate mechanism for consolidation of learning and memory. 1.2.2 Long -term synaptic plasticity The m echanisms involved in long -term synaptic plasticity lead to structural changes to neurons that may permanently alter brain function (Ottersen & Helm, 2002; Tra chtenberg et al ., 2002) These and (Maren & Baudry, 1995; al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2013) . Neurogenesis leads to the formation of new neu rons, and has b een observed in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus following afferent input arising from task perfor mance or learning (Dupret et al., 2008; Shors et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2008) , while synapto genesis, Chapter 1 8 that l eads to formation of new synapses, has been demonstrated in the rat hippocampus following stimulation of the stratum radiatum of the same hippocampal slice (Watson et al., 2016) . Increase in dendriti c spine density and change in its morphology have also been observed in rats following spatial learning (Moser et al., 1994; Yuste & Bonhoeffer, 2001) . However, whether the induction or maintenance of LTP and LTD is necessary for these morphological changes and consequently, long-term synaptic 2001) . While some studies have demonstrated these morphologic al changes foll owing LTP and LTD Bonhoeffer, 1998; 2001) Therefore, the role of LTP and LTD during morphological changes that underpin long -term synaptic plasticity is yet to be shown . 1.2.3 Regulation of synaptic plasticity LTP al., et al., 2012) . In line with Hebb's seminal idea that neurons that fire together wire together , LTP and LTD formation occurs based on a positive -feedback mechanism (Brown et al., 2009; van Hemmen, 2001) . This means that the induction of LTP drives further strengthening of a neural circuit (LTP expression), while the induction of LTD drives further weakening of a neural circuit (LTD Chapter 1 9 expression) (Chen & Maghsoodi, 2007) . Left unchecked, this positive feedback loop can lead to excessive strengthening or excessive weakening of a neural circuit (Abbott & Nelson, 2000; Abraham & Bear, 19 96; Turrigiano & Nel son, 2000) . To prevent excessive strengthening (LTP) or weakening (LTD) within a neural circuit, the CLO model , (an acronym derived from the authors' initials ), was proposed by Cooper, Liberman, and Oja (Cooper et al., 1979) . Here , anti -Hebbian rules were proposed in addition to Hebbian rul es, such that s ynaptic strength was modified bidirectionally in a manner that promot ed synaptic strengthening (LTP formation) or weakening (LTD formation) . The authors indicated that the direction of synaptic modification was dependent upon where a neuron' s post -synaptic response stood relative to a given threshold level (termed 'modification threshold ,' m). However, when the m was set to a single value, the CLO model proved to be rigid and unadaptable to continuous LTP or LTD formation relative to incomi ng stimuli (Bienenstock et al., 1982; Cooper et al., 1979) . A few years later, Bienenstock , Cooper , and Munro modified as the Bienenstock -Cooper -Munro (BCM) model ] by proposing a threshold ( m) for bidirectional synaptic plasticity (Bienenstock et al., 1982) . The BCM theory propose d that the m dynamically adapts to the activation history of a neural circuit such that a history of low post -synaptic activity will lower the m for future LTP induction Chapter 1 10 and increase the threshold for LTD. Conversely, a history of high post -synaptic activity will l ower the m for future LTD induction and increase the threshold for LTP (Abraham et al., Nelson, 2000) In other words, excessi ve strengthening of a neural circuit will bias neurons towards weakening (LTD -induction ), while excessive weakening of a neural circuit will bias neurons towards strengthening (LTP-inductio n) (Carvalho et al., 2015; al., 2014) . In this way, homeostatic plasticity is argued to ensure stability is retained in neural circuits. A pictorial representation of homeostatic regulation consistent with the BCM theory is provided in Figure 1.1. 11 Figure 1 .1: Pictorial representation of homeostatic regulation. Picture A demonstrates the bidirectional shift of LTP - LTD induction at the crossover point (m) without prior st imulus. Picture B and C demonstrates shift in the LTP - LTD induction crossover point (m) as predicted by the BCM theory following LTP (B) or LTD (C) priming. T he LTP - LTD crossover point slides to the right of the x -axis ( m'') if preceded by increased levels o f LTP (B). However, if preceded by increased levels of LTD (C), the m slides to the left of the x -axis ( m'). Reprinted brain stimulation , 8(3), 442-454, Copyright (20 15) with permission from Elsevier. A B C Chapter 1 12 1.2.4 Summary The p revious section reviewed short and long term synaptic plasticity and its role in learning and memory formation. While synaptic plasticity is best understood using Hebb's principle, a limitation in this principle is its positive feedback nature that leads t o excessive LTP or LTD formation. To avoid o verexpression of LTP or LTD, several studies suggest stability mechanisms, termed homeostatic plasticity, regulate and maintain synaptic homeostasis during neuroplastic change. Currently proposed mechanisms thoug ht to underpin h omeostatic regulation are critically analysed in the following sections. 1.3 Mechanisms of h omeostatic plasticity Following the discovery of homeostatic plasticity (Bienenstock et & Stryker, 2017) , the BCM theory has now become an influential model to explain synapti c plasticity, and has guided experimental work in the last three decades (Cooper & Bear, 2012; Turrigiano & Nelson, 2000, 2004; Ziemann & Siebner, 2008) . Although the original experiments were conducted in the visual cortex where binocular deprivation lowered the threshold for further LTP induction and normal vision restored this threshold (Bienenstock et al., 1982) , evidence of a sliding modification threshold (m) regulating synaptic modifications has since b een demonstrated in numerous animal (Yee et al., 2017; Yger & Gilson, 2015) and human models (Karabanov 2015; Muller - Dahlhaus These findings estab lish homeostatic plasticity as a key Chapter 1 13 regulator of synaptic plasticity . In particular , global or local bidirectional modifications in synaptic strength between neurons have been suggested to explain homeostatic regulation within neural circuits (Turrigiano, 2008; Turrigiano & Nelson, 2000) . The following sections discuss homeostatic mechanisms at a global and local level in further detail. 1.3.1 . Global homeostatic plasticity As synaptic plasticity positive feedback process, potentiated synapses promot e further LTP formation, while de -potentiated synapse s promote further LTD formation (Abbott & Nelson, 2000; Abraham & Bear, 1996; Turrigiano & Nelson, 2000) . One effective way of preventing runaway LTP - LTD formation is through compensatory increase s or decrease s in overall synaptic strength while simultaneously maintaining synaptic plasticity ( i.e., LTP - LTD) dynamics (Ju et Lissin et al., 1998; O'Brien & al., 2002; Turrigiano, 2011, 2012) . A pictorial representation of compensatory changes in overall synaptic strength representing global homeostatic plasticity is provided in Figure 1.2. 14 Figure 1 .2: Pictorial representation of global homeostatic regulation. Picture A demonstrates runaway LTP formation as afferent input increases LTP induction in surrounding neurons. Picture B demonstrates global homeostatic regulation following afferent input. Here, LTP induction in one neuron results in overall compensation in neuronal activity in surrounding neurons. Note overall change in size of neurons from left to right in pictures A and B.

Chapter 1 15 Bidirectional compensatory changes in overall synaptic strength was first identified in cultured neocortical neurons (Turrigiano et al., 1998) . Here, chronic blockade of neocortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mE PSP) used to index the overall strength of synaptic transmis sion between neurons . Conversely, blocking Gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibition that normally increases neuronal activity, reduced mEPSP amplitude s to baseline levels at 48-hours follow -up. These observations suggest that compensatory modulat ion of overall synaptic strength between neurons stabilise synaptic plasticity following manipulation of synaptic activity (Desai et Gainey et al., 2009; Kim & Tsien, 2008; Turrigiano et al., 1998) . Similar findings have been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro in motor networks (Knogler et al., 2010) , spinal neurons (O'Brien et al., 1998) , and the visual cortex (Desai et al., 2002; Goel & Lee, 2007) . In the mo tor network of the developing zebra fish, tetrodotoxin (TTX) induced activity deprivation upscaled glutamatergic mEPSPs by 25 % at three to four days follow -up, whereas Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) induced increase in activity downscaled mEPSPs by 20 % while maintaining motor neuron activity patterns in swimming behaviour (Knogler et al., 2010) . Likewise, spinal neurons incubated for one week in glutamate receptor antagonist (block s excitatory synaptic transmission ) amplitude mEPSPs, whereas glycine receptor an tagonists (increase s excitatory Chapter 1 16 synaptic activity ) mEPSPs as synaptic plasticity (i.e ., LTP - LTD) dynamics remained unchanged (O'Brien et al., 1998) . Such finding s have been extended to the visual cortex where two days of visual deprivation increased the amplitude of mEPSPs in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex (Goel & Lee, 2007) . These changes reversed following one day of light exposure. Together, these findings extend early observations of Turrig iano et al. (1998) and indicate compensatory changes in overall synaptic strength between neurons underpin regulat ion of synaptic plasticity following incoming stimuli. While there is ample evidence to support global homeostatic regulation within neural circuits (Desai e t al., 2002; Goel & Lee, 2007; Kim & Tsien, 2008; Lissin al., 1998; O'Brien et al., 1998) , the timescale difference between global homeostatic regulation and rapid LTP - LTD formation limits generalisation of findings to all neural networks (Wu & Yamaguchi, 2006; Zenke et al., 2013) . As a result, studies raise the possibility that other rapid forms of homeostatic plasticity must exist to regulate sy naptic plasticity that take place within seconds to minutes (Wu & Yamaguchi, 20 06; Zenke et al., 2013) . Following these reports, a large body of evidence have demonstrated r apid forms of homeostatic plasticity, termed l pre- and post -synaptic junct ions individual neurons. Chapter 1 Unlike global et al., 1998) , local homeostatic plasticity involves rapid compensatory changes to neuron al excitability at pre- and post -synaptic junctions that operate from minutes to hours (Frank et al., 2006; Hou et al., 2011; Ibata et al., 2008; Ju et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2012) . The clearest examples of local homeostatic plasticity was reported at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of Drosophila (Frank et al., 2006) and in cultured hippocampal neurons (Hou et al., 2011) . In the Drosophila NMJ, increased pre -synaptic neurotransmitter release pharmacological blo ckade of post-synaptic glutamate receptors (Fran k et al., 2006) . Similarly, culture d hippocampal neuron s reduce d AMPA receptors at the post -synaptic terminal 30-minutes following increased pre -synaptic activity , whereas reduced glutamate release at the pre-synaptic terminal increased AMPA insertion at the post -synaptic terminal (Hou et al., 2011) . These findings indicate that in addition to global homeostatic regulation, some neurons have potential for rapid compensator y changes at pre- and post -synaptic junctio ns. While homeostatic regulation at pre- and post -synaptic junctions have been well documented, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely equivocal (Figure 1.3) (Ibata et al., 2008; Turrigiano, 2007, 2012; 2012) receptor expression at the silenced post-synaptic terminal , suggestin g AMPA receptor trafficking and accumulation at post-synaptic terminals can lead to local homeostatic regulation (Sutton et al., 2006) . However, in another study, local perfusion of TTX failed to alter AMPA recepto r expression at the post -synaptic terminal (Ibata et al., 2008) . Instead, local homeostatic regulation was observed through modulation of calcium influx and release at the pre - synaptic terminal . Several stud ies hav e reported similar observations suggesting the probability of neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals also ha s a role in local homeostatic regulation (Frank, 2014; Jeans et al., 2017; Lazarevic et al., 201 Weyhersmuller et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011) . These reports suggest local homeostatic regulation take s place either by AMPA receptor trafficking and accumulation at post -synaptic terminals and / or by neurotransmitter release at pre -synaptic terminals . However, w hether these mechanisms interact and contribute to local homeostatic regulation at the same pre- and post -synaptic junction or are restricted to particular pre- and post -synaptic junctions needs further investigation . 19 Figure 1 .3: Pictorial representation of local homeostatic regulation.

Chapter 1 20 1.3.3 Summary At present, studies suggest homeostatic mechanisms regulate synaptic plasticity either by modifying the overall synaptic strength or by inducing local compensatory changes at pre- and post -synaptic junctions. However, as the field of homeostatic plasticity is still in its infancy, several questions remain. For example, whether global and local forms of homeostatic regulation function together or separately within neural networks remain unans wered. Second, cellular mechanisms that underpin homeostatic regula tion are unclear as some studies suggest AMPA trafficking and accumulation at post -synaptic terminals contribute to homeostatic regulation while others indicate neurotransmitter release at pre-synaptic terminals regulate synaptic activity. Finally, the maj ority of studies exploring homeostatic plasticity are limited to computational modeling studies, cultured neurons, and animal models. Whether similar homeostatic mechanisms operate in human s is yet to be definitively determined as existing studies are limi ted to non -invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques that do not directly measure LTP and LTD but rather infer LTP - LTD -like effects. The following sections discuss the evidence for hom eostatic plasticity in humans. Chapter 1 21 1.4 Homeostatic plasticity in humans Following observations in seminal studies, numerous pharmacological studies provide evidence for NIBS induced LTP- and LTD -like plasticity such that homeostatic 2003a) findings have been reported following AMPA receptor agonist ketamine (Di Lazzaro et al., 2003) and calcium channel antagonist nimodipine (Wankerl et al., 2010) . Here, NIBS induced excitability was increased and eliminated respectively. Together, t hese findings suggest NIBS techniques target mechanisms of LTP and LTD , and can be used to inform homeostatic mechanisms expr essed through LTP - LTD -like dynamics the brain (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . In accordance principles of homeostatic regulation , NIBS techni ques have been priming -test paradigm to explore homeostatic plasticity in the human (Bienenstock et al., al., 2015; . Here, the 'priming' NIB S technique is used to modulate prior cortical activity, while the following 'test' NIBS technique is used to demonstrate a Chapter 1 22 homeostatic response characterised as the plasticity response opposite Muller overview of how excitatory and inhibitory NIBS techniques are combined using a priming -test paradigm to elicit a homeostatic response is provided in Table 1.1. Table 1.1. Principles u nderpinning c ombinations of excitatory stimulation to induce and elic it homeostatic plasticity in the human brain. LTD: long-term LTP: long-term potentiation; NIBS: non -invasive brain stimulation . denote excitatory indicate enhanced LTP ( ) or LTD (). Tables in the following sections will use these symbols to indicate type of NIBS (i. e., excitatory or inhibitory) and the direction of induced effect (LTP or LTD). Based upon the principles highlighted in Table 1.1., NI BS techniques including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and p aired associative stimulation (PAS) have been used to explore homeostatic plasticity in the human brain . Each of these te chniques is discussed in the following section, that has Priming Chapter 1 23 been divided into two parts: first, the role of each technique during homeosta tic plasticity assessment or induction is described in section 1.4.1 ; second, evidence supporting the use of these techniques (in line with the principles highlighted in Table 1.1) to explore homeostatic regulation in the human brain is discussed in sectio n 1.4.2. 1.4.1 Utility of TMS, tDCS, and PAS to explore homeostatic p lasticity in the human brain In general, there are three basic forms of NIBS techniques used to explore homeostatic plasticity in the human brain. First, there is t ranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) , which is a safe, non-invasive brain stimulation tech nique used to assess or induce homeostatic plasticity in the human brain (Barker et al., 1985; Klein et al., 2015; Rossi et 2009; Sauv\u00e9 & C rowther, 2014) . Transcr anial magnetic is based upon Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction , where an electric al current in a TMS coil produces a changing magnetic field that induces a secondary electric al current within the human brain (Barker et al., 1985; Di Lazzaro et al., -Dourado et al., 2014) . When delivered as a single form of stimulation (termed ' single -pulse TMS '), the secondary electrical current generated during TMS produces a descending volley that travels down the corticospinal tract to the target muscle, and elicits a muscle response termed a Motor Chapter 1 24 evoked potential (MEP; Fig ure 1.4) (Di Lazzaro, 2013; Di Lazzaro et al., 2001; Klomjai Rossi et al., 2009; Wassermann, 1998) . An MEP is a measure of corticospinal excitability (Di Lazzaro et al., 2017; Rossini et al., 2015; Rothwell et a l., 1999) , and has been commonly used to index homeostatic plasticity in the human brain . In particular, the difference in peak -to-peak MEP amplitude before and after NIBS applied in a priming -test paradigm has been used to represent LTP - or-LTD -like chan ges during homeostatic Sauv\u00e9 & Crowther, 2014) . For example, an increase in MEP amplitude following high levels of LTD -like plasticity induced usin g two successive inhibitory NIBS techniques is interpreted to indicat e LTP- like changes . Conversely , a reduction in MEP amplitude following high levels of LTP -like plasticity induced using two successive excitatory NIBS Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . In this way, the difference in MEP amplitudes before and after NIBS is thought to provide a n index of homeostatic plasticity in the human brain. While s ingle pulse TMS is used to assess homeostatic plasticity, repetitive TMS (rTMS) pulses have been used a homeostatic response through induction of LTP -or LTD rald et Klomjai al., conventional rTMS ( 1 Hz) reduce ( 5 Hz) frequency rTMS increase c ortical Chapter 1 25 excitability through LTP-like changes (Di Lazzaro et al., 2008; Ma eda et al., 2000b; Matheson et al., 2016) . However, w hile there is general consensus on low- and high - frequency rTMS induced effects, substantial variability in the size of the induced effect is commonly reported when these paradigms are applied alone (Hamada et al., 2013) . For instance, 50 % of participants (n=32) reduced cortical excitabili ty (indexed as reduced MEP amplitude s) following inhibitory r TMS (Strigaro et al., 2016) , while 22 out of 30 participants increased cortical ex citability (indexed as increased MEP amplitudes) following excit atory rTMS (Hinder et al., 2014) . Similar findings were reported by Nettekoven et al. (2017) and Maeda et al. (20 00) where only 44 % (n=16), and 34 % (n=36) of all participants responded to excitatory and inhibitor y rTMS respectively (Maeda et al., 2000a; Nettekoven et al., 2015) . These findings suggest rTMS induced LTP-or LTD -like plasticity vary in healthy ind ividual s and may affect the homeostatic response elicited throug h inhibitory or excitatory rTMS. Importantly, studies of variability in the homeostatic response to rTMS protocols have yet to be conducted, and it is unclear whether a similar degree of varia bility is present when rTMS is used to elicit a homeostatic resp onse as when used in isolation. 26 Figure 1. 4. Pictorial representation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in the human brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is performed using an electromagnetic TMS coil attached to a high -voltage discharge system. The magnetic field produced through the TMS coil lasts for approximately 100 \u00b5s, and produces a pulse (2 Tesla) strong enou gh to depolarise cortical neurons. Depolarisati on of cortical neurons produces a descending volley that travels down the corticospinal tract, and results in a muscle twitch. This muscle twitch, recorded as a motor evoked potential (MEP), is used to index c orticospina l excitability (in particular, prima ry motor cortex homeostatic plasticity in hum ans. Stimulus MEP Corticospinal tract Spinal cord Peripheral muscle Peripheral motor nerve Muscle response Electrical current Magnet ic field Induced current Chapter 1 27 A second NIBS technique used to investigate homeostatic plasticity in the human brain involves low amplitude (1 - 2 mA) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied through electrodes placed on the scalp ( Figure 1.5) (Caytak et al., 2015; Nitsche et al., 2008) . Due to weak direct currents, tDCS does not cause n eural firing, but rather is though t to induce LTP -or LTD -like p lasticity through shift in electric charge distribution within cortical neurons (Creutzfeldt et al., 1962; Fregni & Pascual -Leone, & Paulus, Purpura & McMurtry, 1965; Wagner et al., 2007) . Typically, two different forms of tDCS , termed anodal and cathoda l tDCS have been used to induce LTP - and LTD -like plasticity respectively (Nitsche e t al., 2008; et al., 2008; Nitsche et al., 2005; Poreisz et al., 2007) . First, large current densities induce stronger LTP -and LTD -like plasticity, while small current LTD -like 2008; Nitsche & Paulus, 2000) . Second, with the current density held constant, longer stimulation duration result in longer periods of LTP -or LTD -like plasticity, while shorter stimulation duration result in shorter periods of LTP -or LTD -like changes (Nits che et al., 2003c; Nitsche & Paulus, 2001) . While both current density and durati on have been shown to result in tDCS induced LTP -and LTD -like plasticity (Nitsche et , studies Chapter 1 28 recommend modulati ng current duration over current density, as high current densities result in cutaneous pain and reduced focality during tDCS stimulation (Merrill et al., 2005; Minhas et 2011; Nitsche et al., 2003b) . important determinant of the direction of tDCS induced plasticity is the position of scalp electrodes, as the position of the stimulati ng electrodes govern current flow and electrical field distribution (Fig ure 1.5) (Bikson et al., 2010; DaSilva et al., 2011; Moliadze et al., 2010; Wagner et al., 2007) . For instance, with one electrode fixed on th e M1, varying the location of the reference electrode on different regions of the brain was shown to alter electrical field distribution, and thereby the induced LTP - LTD -like effect (Datta et al., 2010; W agner et al., 2007) . Further, s ignificant change in cortical excitability thought to index LTP-and LTD -like plasticity was observed at the M1 only during a motor cortex - forehead electrode placement as opposed to a motor cortex - chin montage (DaSilva et al., 2011; Nitsche & Paulus, 2000; Priori et al., 1998) . These data suggest that with the right parameters and electrode placement, t DCS can be used to induce LTP-and LTD -like et al., 2007a) , and this in -turn can be implemented to explore homeostatic plasticity within the human brain (Antal et al., 2008a; Fricke et al., 2011; Nitsche & Paulus, 2000) . 29 Figure 1. 5.

A B Chapter 1 30 The third NIBS technique is paired associative stimulation (PAS), which involves pairing two stimulation protocols to induce LTP-or LTD -like plasticity (Classen et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2017; Stefan et al., 2000; Wolters et al., 2003) . Typically, peripheral electrical stimulation applied to a peripheral nerve has been paired with TMS to the corresponding contral ateral hemisphere (Fig ure 1.6) (Arai et al., 2011; St efan et al., 2002; Stefan et al., 2000) . The inter -stimulus interval (ISI) between PES and TMS is critical to PAS induced LTP - LTD -like plasticity , such that if the ascending afferent stimulus from peripheral nerve stimulation i s in advance of TMS produced descending volley, the neural circuit undergoes excitation, and LTP -like plasticity is et al., Wolters et al., 2003; Wolters et al., 2005) . However, if the order o f these events is reversed, the neural circuit undergoes inhibition, and LTD -like plasticity is induced -Dahlhaus et al., 2000; Thirugnanasambandam et al., 2011; Wolters et al., 2003) . More specifically, since PAS induced LTP - LTD -like plasticity is contingent upon the order of peripheral or cortical stimulation, specific ISIs are proposed to induce LTP -and LTD -like plasticity (Stefan et al., 2000 ; Wolters et al., 2003) . Following the original experiments, PAS at an ISI of 25 ms (PAS 25 ms) has been commonly used to induce LTP -like plasticity , while PAS at an ISI of 10 ms (PAS 10 ms ) is recommended to induce LTD -like plasticity (Carson & Kennedy, 2013; Classen et al., et al., 2010; Huber et al., 2008; Ilic et al., 2009) . However, use of fixed ISIs to Chapter 1 31 induce LTP - LTD -like plasticity is debatable, as studies suggest PAS induced LTP - LTD -like plas ticity does not only oc cur over a single ISI, but rather across multiple ISIs (Carson & Kennedy, 2013; Dileone et al., al., al., 2006; Wolters et al., 2003) . For example, when assessed with ISIs ranging from -10, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, and 50 ms, LTP -like plasticity was observed not only with an ISI of 25 ms, but also with ISIs above 20 ms (Wolters et al., 2003) . Similar observations were not ed for LTD -like plasticity , where inhibitory effects were observed with ISIs of 10 ms, a nd -10, 0, and 5 ms (Wolters et al., 2003) . However, contrary to these ob servations, Kang et al. (2011), and Dileone et al. (2 010) report no change in LTP - LTD -like plasticity following PAS with ISIs of 10, 25, and 100 ms. These discrepancies could be explained by considerable inter -individual variability between subjects cl al., 2015) . Indeed, inter -individual variability is high during PAS as only 52 % of the total sample (n=27) demonstrated typical PAS 25 ms induced LTP -like plasticity (Muller -Dahlhaus et al., 2008) . Similar observations were noted by Huber et al. (2008) where PAS 25 ms not only induced LTP -like plasticity , but also induced LTD -like plasticity in some participants (26 %). In the same study, LTD - inducing PAS 10 ms was shown to induce LTP -like plasticity in 18 % of participants (Huber et al., 2008) , suggest ing inconsistency in PAS 25 ms and PAS 10 ms induced LTP - LTD -like Chapter 1 32 plasticity may be explained by high inter -individual variability within and between studies (Lahr et al., 2016; Lopez -Alonso et al., 2014; Muller -Dahlhaus et al., 2008) . Whether the same variability exists when PAS is applie d in a priming -test paradigm to elicit a homeostatic response is unknown . Despite this, 15 studies have used PAS induced LTP - LTD -like plasticity to explore homeostatic plasticity in the human brain ( primary motor cortex studies; studies) (Karabanov et al., 2015) . Figure 1. 6. Pictorial representation of paired associative stimulation in the huma n brain. Transcranial magnetic simulation (TMS) is applied (to the primary motor cortex in the picture) immediately before or after peripheral electrical nerve stimulation to a peripheral nerve (median nerve in the picture). Synaptic plasticity is modulate d by tim ing the volleys generated from both peripheral electrical nerve stimulation, and cortical TMS . If the peripheral volley arrives before TMS induced volley is generated , long -term potentiation - like plasticity is induced, conversely , a reversal of sti mulation order induces long -term depression -like plasticity . Transcr anial magnetic stimulation Cortical volley Peripheral electrical nerve stimulation Peripheral volley Chapter 1 33 1.4.2 TMS, tDCS, and PAS to investigate homeostatic plasticity The previous section a ddressed how TMS, tDCS, and PAS are appropriate to asses (single - pulse TMS only) or induce homeostatic plast icity in the human brain. The following section s provide a critical review of studies that have used TMS, tDCS, and PAS in combination (in line with the principles highlighted in Table 1.1) to elicit a homeostatic response in the primary motor cortex (M1), and in brain regions outside the M1. 1.4.2.1 Homeostatic plasticity in the p rimary motor cortex The majority of research on homeostatic plasticity in humans is limited to the M1. Table 1.2 summarises all 17 cross -sectional studies that have used various forms of TMS, tDCS and PAS to investigate homeostatic plasticity in the human M1. The clearest example is provided by Fricke and coworkers (2011) who are the only research group to have systematically investigate d the impact of stimulation duration and inter-stimulus period between priming and test NIBS on the induction of homeostatic response in the human M1 (Fricke et al., 2011) . This study suggests homeostatic plasticity is best elicited in the M1 when two blocks of anodal tDCS for 7 - and 5 -minutes with a 3 - minute interval is delivered in a priming -test paradigm as opposed to two blocks of 5 - minutes tDCS or 7 - and 5 -minutes tDCS with a 1, 10, 20, and 30 -minute break between tDCS blocks (Fricke et al., 2011) . Here, the first block of 7 -mintue anodal tDCS (primer) Chapter 1 34 increased cortical excitability (observed as an increase in MEP amplitudes indicating LT P- like plasticity). Following the application of a second block of 5 -minute anodal tDCS after a 3-mintue interval (test stimulation), a home ostatic response was observed as cortical excitability was reduced (observed as a decrease in MEP amplitudes indicat ing LTD -like plasticity) (Fricke et al., 2011) . Similar findings have been observed following PAS protocols that induce LTP - and LTD - like plasticity (Muller et al., 2007) . Here, MEP amplitudes used to index homeostatic plasticity was reduced when two LTP -like pla sticity inducing PAS protocols were applied in succession to the M1 in 11 healthy individuals. Conversely, when primed using an LTD - like plasticity inducing PAS protocol, MEP amplitudes were increased, suggesting homeostatic regulation of LTD -like plastici ty in the human M1 (Muller et al., 2007) . These findings have also been reported following different combinations of rTMS, tDCS or PAS. For instance, the application of anodal, and cathodal tDCS prior to rTMS (Lang et al., 2004; Siebner et al., 2004) or PAS (Nitsche et al ., 2007b) was shown to result in a reversal of after -effect s when compared to rTMS or PAS applied alone. However, while these findings are consistent with the principles of homeostatic regulation, six studies failed to observe a homeostatic response fol lowing high levels of LTP -or LTD -like Chapter 1 35 plasticity induced using rTMS and PAS (Delvendahl et al., et al., al., 20 17a; Sidhu et al., 2017; Todd et al., 2009) . One explanation for this discrepancy could be the difference in sample size between studies (Faber & Fonseca, 2014) . As highlighted in Table 1 .2, studies that have obser ved homeostatic regulation following rTMS, tDCS or PAS have considerably smaller sample sizes relative to studies that did not observe homeostatic plasticity following high levels of LTP-or LTD -like plasticity . Therefore, it is po ssible that studies that have reported homeostatic regulation following rTMS, tDCS or PAS may have overestimated the magnitude of the homeostatic response leading to Type I error (Cohen, 1969; Hackshaw, 2008; Sedgwick, 2014) . However, that findings of homeostatic regulation are consistent between 11 studies from different laboratories , and none of the studies (including those that did not observe homeostatic plasticity ) have demonstrated a power calculation to estimate the sample size requir ed to detect a true homeostatic response limits the current assumption s. Future studies exploring homeostatic plasticity in the human M1 should demonstrate sample size calculation s to observe true homeostatic responses . Alternatively, studies that did no t observe homeostatic regulation used combinations of rTMS and PAS (Delvendahl et al., 2010; Goldsworthy et al., 2017a; Sidhu et al., 2017; Todd et al., 2009) . None of th ese studies used anodal or cathodal tDCS. This difference in methodology could explain the inconsistency between Chapter 1 36 studies . Indeed, rTMS, tDCS , and PAS are known to induce LTP -and LTD -like plasticity through different cellular mechanisms discussed in section 1.4.1 (Nitsche & Paulus, 2011; Rossini et al., 2015; Stefan et al., 2000) . Hence, it is likely that different combinations of rTMS, tDCS, and PAS have a differential -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015; Future studies exploring M1 homeostatic plasticity in larger populations using similar combinations of NIBS techniques is warranted. 37 Table 1. 2.

Findings in these studies are consistent with the 11 studies that have demonstrated homeostatic regulation in the M 1 (Bliem et al., 2008; Bocci et al., 2014) . The first study to demonstrate hom eostatic regulation outside the M1 was conducted by Bliem and colleagues (2008) at the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) (Bliem et al., 2008) . of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) , LTP- and LTD - like changes in S1 was assessed following a combination of PAS , and a LTP-like plasticity inducing excitatory peripheral high frequency stimulation (pHFS) protocol . PAS and pHFS were applied in a priming -test paradigm for 15 - and 20 - minutes r espectively (Bliem et al., 2008) . PAS induced LTD -like plasticity when followed by excitatory pHFS resulted in LTP-like changes expressed as an increase in SEP amplitude . Conversely, PAS induced LTP-like plasticity when followed by excitatory pHFS resulted in LTD -like changes expressed as a decrease in SEP amplitude (Bliem et al., 2008) . Similar findings were observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) where anodal and cath odal tDCS applied for 20-minutes prior to low - (1 Hz) and high (5 Hz) - frequency rTMS reversed the after -effects when compared to rTMS applied alone (Bocci et al., 2014) . Chapter 1 41 Homeostatic plasticity has also been report ed following NIBS techniques applied to two different brain regions (Hamada et al., 2009; Popa et al., 2013; Potter -Nerger et al., duration) dorsal premotor cortex reversed the aftereffects of PAS (13-minutes duration) on the M1 (Potter -Nerger et al., 2009) . Likewise, inhibitory priming of the cerebellum for 0.6 minutes increased PAS (2-minutes duration) induced LTP -like plasticity in the M1 (Popa et al., 2013) , while the direction of LTP-or LTD -like plasticity in the M1 was determined following excitatory or inhibitory priming of the supplementary motor area (Hamada et al., 2009) . When taken together, these findings suggest that NIBS induced LTP-or LTD -like plasticity is modulated by homeostatic mechanisms that are no t only limited to the M1, but also extend to cortical regions outside the M1 (Tabl e 1.3). While there is evidence to support homeostatic regulation in and between different brain regions, evidence is conflicting for intracortical networks known to influence synaptic plasticity mechanisms in the human brain (Doeltgen & Ridding, 2011; Huang et al., 20 17; Murakami et al., 2012; Siebner et al., 2004) . Two studies (Doeltgen & Ridding, 2011; Siebner et al., 2004) report no homeostatic changes intracortical inhibition NIBS applied in a priming -testing paradigm. However, Murakami et al. (2012) contradict Chapter 1 42 these findings, and suggest homeostatic plasticity within SICI networks following repetitive TMS applied in a priming -testing paradigm (Murakami et al., 2012) . One explanation for this discrepancy is the difference in methodology between studies. To detect subtle changes in SICI and SICF networks , studies recommend measuring SICI and SICF at varying stimulus intensities (Chen et al., 1998) . However, Siebner et al. (2004) and Doeltgen & Ridding (2011) used fixed stimulation intensit ies at 80 % and 70 % of active motor threshold , while Murakami et al. (20 12) used stimulation intensities from 70 to 100 % of active motor threshold . This difference in fixed and varying stimulation intensities may explain the disagreement in findings betw een studies. Future studies using varying stimulus intensities to explor e homeostatic plasticity within intracortical networks is needed . 43 Table 1. 3.

Chapter 1 45 1.4.3 Summary A broad range of NIBS techniques have been used successfully to investigate and demonstrate homeostatic plasticity in the human brain. However, studies exploring homeostatic plasticity in the human brain are mainly limited to cross -sectional study designs in the M1 . As a result, whether M1 homeostatic plasticity can be reliably induced and assess ed over time using NIBS techniques is unknown. Study one (chapter two) was, therefore, designed to address this gap in literature to determine the test -retest reliability of M1 homeostatic regulation , induced and assessed using non-invasive brain stimulation over time . 1.5 Homeostatic plasticity in pathological populations As discussed in the previous section, data on homeostatic plasticity in the healthy human brain is availab le from 26 studies (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . However, there is much less information on homeostatic plasticity in individuals with patho logy, in particular, in individuals experienc ing pain (Table 1 .4). At present, seven cross -sectional studies have explored homeostatic plasticity in writer's cramp and chronic migraine with sample sizes ranging from eight to 14 (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 201 5). Despite small sample sizes, findings from t hese studies are consistent, and suggest i mpaired homeostatic plasticity in writer's cramp, and chronic migraine may have a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions, and Chapter 1 46 contribu te to motor dysfunction and unwanted sensory experiences (Antal et al., 2008b; Brighina et al., 2005; Brighina et al., 2005) . Writer's cramp is associated with abnormal, involuntary movements, and one influential hypothesis is deficient homeostatic control of LTP formation (Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2003; Quartarone e t al., 2008 ; Quartarone et al., 2006) . This notion is supported by two studies that have explored homeostatic plasticity in eight to 10 individuals with writer's cramp (Table 1.4) (Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005) . For example, Quartarone et probed 10 -and -15-minutes duration respectively (Quartarone et al., 2005) in eight patients with writer's cramp (mean \u00b1 standard deviation for history of writer's cramp: 10 \u00b1 10 years), and eight controls. Following cathodal tDCS priming, inhibitory rTMS resulted amplitude, while anodal tDCS priming reduced MEP amplitudes in healthy controls. These findings are consistent with studies that have used NIBS in similar priming -test paradigms to probe homeostatic plasticity in the healthy brain (Lang et al., 2004; Siebner et al., 2004) . However, in contrast, individuals with writer's cramp failed to to tDCS (anodal and inhibitory rTMS, sugge sting impairment in M1 homeostatic regulation. Similar findings were reported by Kang and colleagues (2011) who Chapter 1 47 investigated homeostatic plasticity during motor learning in 10 individuals with writer's cramp (mean \u00b1 standard deviation for history of writer 's cramp: 6.7 \u00b1 6.6 years), and 10 age-matched healthy controls (Kang et al., 2011) . Here, PAS induced LTP - LTD -like plasticity for 15 -minutes was used to prime 30-minutes of rapid thumb abductions, and probe homeostatic plasticity. In line with rules of homeostatic regulation, PAS in duced LTP-like plasticity applied prior to rapid thumb abductions reduced motor learning, while PAS induced LTD -like plasticity applied prior to rapid thumb abductions increased motor learning in age-matched healthy controls. However, individuals with writ er's cram p failed to reduce motor learning when rapid thumb abductions were primed using PAS induced LTP-like plasticity. This deficiency in homeostatic control was later correlated with the clinical severity of writer's cramp (Kang et al., 2011) . Together, these findings suggest impaired homeostatic plasticity in writer's cramp such that not induced when LTP -like plasticity is high. As excessive increases in cortical excitability cannot be regulated, impaired homeostatic plasticity is hypothesised to contribute to uncontrolled muscle function, and the pathophysiology of writer's cramp (Kang et al., 2003; et al., 2008; Quartaro ne et al., 2005) . A pictorial representation of normal and impaired homeostatic p lasticity in healthy individuals and those with writer's cramp following NIBS applied in a priming -test paradigm is provided in Figure 1.7. 48 Figure 1. 7.

Chapte r 1 49 In addition to studies on homeostatic plasticity in individuals with writer's cramp, the other pathological population within which homeostatic plasticity has been investigated is chronic migraine (Antal et Brighina et & Ziemann, 2015) . Consistent findings between five studies that have explored homeostatic plastic ity in individuals with chronic migraine indicate homeostatic impairment in these individuals (Table 1.4). For example, by using tDCS and rTMS in a priming -test explore plasticity in 13 chronic migraineurs (mean \u00b1 standard deviation for migraine history: 14 \u00b1 13 years), and 13 age - sex matched healthy controls. Both chronic migraineurs, and healthy controls displayed similar increases in MEP amplitudes fol lowing cathodal tDCS anodal tDCS primed excitatory rTMS, only healthy controls displayed a reduction in MEP amplitudes. Similar impairments in M1 homeostatic plasticity was observed by Cosentino et al. (2014) in 10 chronic migraineurs (mean \u00b1 standard deviation for migraine history: 15.5 \u00b1 6.8 years) where failure to regulate high levels of LTP -like plasticity was observed specifically before the onset of a migraine attack. This impairment in hom eostatic regulation prior to migraine onset is thought to predispose chronic migraineurs to headache recurrence. However, that Cosentino et al. (2014) did not assess the same individual during different phases of the migraine cycle limits the establishment of a cause and effect relationship between obs erved homeostatic Chapte r 1 50 impairment and its role in triggering migraine attacks (or headache recurrence). Nonetheless, these findings suggest impaired homeostatic plasticity in chronic migraineurs characterised by a failure to regulate high levels of LTP -like pla sticity in the M1 (Antal et al., et al., 2011; al., 2010; Cosentino et al., 2014b) . A pictorial representation of impaired homeostatic regulation in individuals with chronic migraine is provid ed in Figure 1.8. Figure 1. 8.

Likewise , homeostatic plasticity may be impaired in other clinical populations such as chronic musculoskeletal pain where synaptic plasticity has been shown to be altered, and motor dysfunction present . Thus, study two (chapter three ) aimed to explore and understand the role of M1 homeostati c plasticity during pain , using a chronic musculoskeletal pain population i.e., people with non -specific chronic low back pain (cLBP) . 52 Table 1.4.

However, as identified in section 1.5, all studies in pathological popu lations are limited to cross -sectional study designs. With such limitations, it is not possible to determine whether impaired homeostatic plasticity leads to altered synaptic plasticity or vice versa. Thus, the following sections discuss altered synaptic plasticity during chronic musculoskelet al pain, and the potential role of homeostatic plasticity in such individuals . 1.6.1 Altered synaptic plasticity during chronic musculoskeletal pain Several studies have demonstrated altered synaptic plast icity in people with tudies characterise altered synaptic plasticity in chronic musculoskeletal pain as unwanted brain reorganisation that underpins muscle dysfunction, and heightened pain sensitivity (Doyon & Ben ali, 2005; Flor, 2002; Flor, 2003; May, 2008) . For example, in individuals with prolonged complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), cortical representation of fingers one and five in the M1 was reduced in size and shifted towards the direction of the adjacent cortical lip representation when Chapter 1 55 compared to cortical representation of fingers from the contralateral, unaffected side (Maih\u00f6fner et al., 2003) . These findings indicate distorted cortical representation of t he affected fingers, which was later shown to be correlated with pain intensity and sensitivity to noxious stimuli (Maihofner et al., 2004) . A similar change in M1 topography has been reported in individuals with cLBP following cortical maps made with TMS . Here, a shift in the center of gravity of cortical maps corresponding to the deep multifidus and superficial longissimus muscles was correlated with reduced lower back muscle control, pain intensity, and disabil ity (Schabrun et al., 2017b; Tsao et al., 2011b; Tsao et al., 2008) . These observations were also reported in individuals with persistent elbow pain where shift in the center of gravity of cortical maps corres digitorum muscles were associated with higher pain intensity during rest, and at six months follow up (Figure 1.9) (Schabrun et al., 2015c) . These studies provi de evidence that altered synaptic plasticit y occurs in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. One interpretation is that these altered changes , characterised by distorted representation of body parts in the cortex may explain muscle dysfunction, and hei ghtened pain sensitivity in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Schabrun et al., 2015c; Tsao et al., 2011a; Tsao et al., 2008) .

Importantly, i t is noteworthy that in addition to altered synaptic plasticity in the M1, several studies have demonstrated altered synaptic plasticity in brain regions outside the M1 in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Abu -Saad Huijer, these brain regions dubbed the 'pain neuromatrix ', are argued to influence pain perception and experience (Apkarian, 2011; Apkarian et al., 2009; Apkarian et al., 2011; Moseley, 2003) . However, that only one study has investigated homeostatic plasticity in brain Chapter 1 57 regions outside the M1 in any clinical population (Brighina et al., 2002; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) , and that no study has established a tool to explore the relationship between homeostatic regulation and the pain neuro matrix limits its exploration in the current thesis. In summary, as synaptic plasticity is altered in the M1 and influence s clinical presentations in chronic musculoskeletal pain, homeostatic mechanisms that regulate, monitor , and stabilise alterations in synaptic plasticity may prevent these change s (Abraham, 2008; Abraham & Bear, 1996; Antal et al., 2008b; Bear, 2003; Cosentino et al., 2014b) . However, at present, only one study has explored homeostatic plasticit y in cortical areas outside the M1 during pathology (Table 1.4), and no studies have explored homeostatic regulation when mu sculoskeletal pain develops or persists . Thus, the role of homeostatic plasticity during pain is unknown. 1.6.2 Homeostatic regulat ion during pain To date, no published studies have explored homeostatic plasticity as pain develops, peaks, and resolves 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus Several reasons explain this poten tial gap in the field . First, to explore homeostatic plasticity during pain over time, patients must first be assessed at baseline to determine if change in homeostatic regulation occurs as pain develops, peaks, and resolves. However, it is not possible to Chapter 1 58 obtain baseline data from individuals with clinical pain syndromes , as patients are generally only identified once pain is experienced (Apkarian et al., 2009; Loeser & Treede, 2008; Treede et al., 2015) . Second, as patients are identified only when pain is experien ced, patients may develop confounders to research through exposure to treatments, medication use, and other physical and psychological comorbidities (Akobeng, 2008 ; Brookhart et al., 2010; Jackson et al., 2006) . Since it is unethical to stop or regulate treatments and medication use when patients are enrolled in a study, data quality is compromised by these confounders (Broo khart et al., 2010; Emanuel et al., 2000) . While studies attempt to regulate these confounders through well -defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, rigorous pre-screening, a nd post -hoc sub -group analysis, generalisability is often limited (Cleophas & Zwinderman, 2007; Jager et al., 2008) . In response to these ethical and methodological issues , experimental pain models that mimic the temporal dynamics of pain similar to that observed in patient popul ations provide a valuable means to assess pain in a controlled manner (Olesen et al ., 2012; Reddy et al., 2012) . Research ers currently use chemical s, electrical current , heat, pressure or exercise to induce experim ental pain -Nielsen 2004; Svensson et al., 1997) . However, despite the many options, these experimental pain models induce pain only for a short period of time (i.e., nociception Chapter 1 59 lasting 2hours) (Olesen et al., 2012; Reddy et al., 201 2), thus, limiting their usefulness for homeostatic plasticity assessment as pain develops, peaks, and resolves. Recently , repeated i njection of nerve growth factor (NGF) has been used to mimic mechanisms potentially involved in the development of pain (Hayashi et al., 2013; Lewin & Mendell, 1993; 1994; Schabrun et al., 2016) . Defi ned as a naturally occurring neurotrophic protein responsible for mediating inflammatory and immune responses in the adult nervous system, NGF is injected in small bursts to manifest muscle pain over 12 to 14 days (Lewin & Mendell, 1993; Petty et al., 1994; Reddy et al., 2012) . As NGF induced muscle pain lasts for days, it provides a realistic model to investigate the temporal dynamics of homeostatic plasticity during the onset, and progressive development of pain whilst ob taining baseline data prior to pain onset, and controlling for confounders that compromise data quality (Hayashi et al., 2013; Schabrun et al., 2016) . Thus, study three (chapter four) aimed to address the r ole of M1 homeostatic regulation as muscle pain, induced using NGF as an experimental pain model , developed, peaked, and resolved. Chapt er 1 60 1.7 Study rationale The literature and primary research data discussed in the introduction provides indicative evidence of synaptic plasticity and homeostatic regulation following afferent input. However, synaptic plasticity has also been shown to be altered in individuals experiencing pain. Despite this, homeostatic mechanisms that regulate synaptic plasticity has not been investigated in any depth during pain. Further, studies investigating homeostatic plasticity in individuals with pathology are currently limited to neurological populations with writer's cramp, and chronic migraine. These studies suggest M1 homeostatic plas ticity is impaired in individuals with writer's cramp, and chronic migraine, and may have a role in the pathophysiology of these conditio ns. As similar clinical presentations are observed in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, it is possible tha t homeostatic plasticity is impaired during pain . Thus, the broad goal of this thesis was to explore the effect of pain, using a clinical chronic musculoskeletal pain populati on and an experimental pain model, on homeostatic plasticity in the M1. This aim was achieved by three studies that addressed each knowledge gap identified in the introduction. 1.7.1 Study one As identified in section 1. 4 and Table 1.2, the majority of s tudies have explored the use of NIBS techniques to study homeostatic plasticity in the human M1. However, these studies are limited to cross sectional study designs that have not established whether NIBS can be Chapt er 1 61 used to reliably induce and ass ess M1 homeostatic plasticity. Therefore, the aim of study one (chapter two) was to explore the test -retest reliability of NIBS used to induce and assess homeostatic plasticity in the human M1. This was achieved by conducting a longitudinal study on healthy volunteers over 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Two successive blocks of anodal tDCS for 7 a nd 5-minutes, with a 3 -minute interval was used to explore M1 homeostatic plasticity over 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks, as this proto col has been suggested to best elicit a homeostatic response in the human M1 (Fricke et al., 2011) . 1.7.2 Study two As identified in section 1. 5, studies exploring homeos tatic plasticity in writer's cramp, and chronic migraine suggest impaired M1 homeostatic regulation may contribute to motor dysfunction and altered sensory experiences. As individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain are known to experience similar clinic al symptoms , study two (chapter three ) aimed to investigate homeostatic plas ticity in the M1 of individuals with non -specific cLBP. Here, two successive blocks of anodal tDCS for 7 and 5 -minutes, with a 3 -minute interval was used to explore M1 homeostatic plasticity in individuals with non -specific chronic low back pain (cLBP), an d healthy, pain -free, controls. Pain intensity and duration were also recorded to determine an association (if any) between impairment in M1 homeostatic plasticity (if found), and pain profile of individuals with non -specific cLBP. Chapt er 1 62 1.7.3 Study three As ide ntified in section 1.6, synaptic plasticity is altered in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain . As homeostatic regulation ensures stability in synaptic plasticity, it is possible that an impairment in homeostatic regulation could lead to the development of altered synaptic plasticity in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain or vice -versa. Therefore, the aim of study three (chapter four), was to explore the temporal dynamics of homeostatic plasticity as pain developed, peaked , and resolved . Nerve growth factor (NGF) was injected in small amounts to induc e progressively developing muscle pain (Andresen et al., 2014; Hayashi et a l., 2013; Schabrun et al., 2016) , while homeostatic plasticity was explored in the M1 using two successive blocks of anodal tDCS applied for 7 and 5 -minutes, with a 3 -minute interval. To further explore M1 homeostatic plasticity during pain, participants filled in an online questionnaire addressing pain intensity, muscle soreness, level of disability, and sleep quality every alternative day from day 0 to day 21. 63 Chapter 2: Test-retest reliability of homeostatic plasticity induced and assessed using non-invasive brain stimulation in the human primary motor cortex As highlighted in chapter one, present studies exploring homeostatic plasticity in humans are limited to cross -sectional study designs. Therefore, there is the ne ed to explore whether non-invasive brain stimulation can be used to induce and assess homeostatic plasticity over time. The aim of this paper was to explore inter-session reliability in M1 homeostatic plasticity induced and assessed us ing non -invasive brai n stimulation at intervals o f 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. The content of this chapter has been published in Thapa , 2018 (9). doi: 10.1155/2018/6207508 . copy of th e publication is provided in appendix A. Chapter 2 64 2.1 Abstract Homeostatic plasticity regulates synaptic activity by preventing uncontrolled increases (long -term potentiation) or decreases (long -term depression) in synaptic efficacy. Homeostatic plasticity can be induced and assessed in the human primary motor cortex (M1) using non -invasive brain stimulation. However, the reliability of this methodology has not been investigated. Here, we examined the test -retest reliability of homeostatic plasticity induced and assessed in M1 using non -invasive brain stimulation in te n, right - handed, healthy volunteers on days 0, 2, 7, and 14. Homeostatic plasticity was induced in left M1 using two blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for 7 -min and 5 -min, separated by a 3 -min interval. Fifteen motor e voked potentials to single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation recorded at baseline, between the two blocks of anodal tDCS and at 0 -min, 10 -min, and 20 -min f ollow -up were used to assess homeostatic plasticity. Test -retest reliability was evaluated coefficients (ICCs). Moderate -to-good test -retest reliability was observed for the M1 homeostatic plasticity response at all follow -up time-points (0 -min, 10 -min, and 20 -min, ICC range: 0.43 -0.67) at intervals up to two weeks. The greatest reliability was observed when the homeostatic response was assessed at 10 -min follow -up (ICC >0.61). These data suggest M1 homeostatic plasticity can be reliably induced and assessed in healthy individuals using two blocks of anodal tD CS at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Chapter 2 65 2.2 I ntroduction Synaptic plasticity is fundamental to learning and memory in the human brain. However, synaptic plastici ty operates via a positive feedback loop and as a result, has the potential to dest abilise neural networks through excessive synaptic strengthening (long -term potentiation -like effects, LTP) or excessive synaptic weakening (long -term depression -like effect s, LTD) (Ziemann & Siebner, 2008) . To avoid destabilisation, LTP and LTD -like changes are subject to homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that maintain neural activity within an optima l physiological range. Homeostatic plasticity is theorised to rely on the 'sliding threshold' rule, such that the threshold for the induction of LTP or LTD is dependent on activity in the post -synaptic neuron; high post -synaptic activity favours LTD, early st udies investigating homeostatic plasticity occurred in slice preparations in vitro , a growing body of research has used non -invasive brain stimulation to investigate this mechanism in the human cortex (Bear, 2003; G isabella et al., 2003; Huang et non -invasive brain stimulation protocol is used to 'prime' (or condition) the synaptic effects of a sub sequent non -invasive brain stimulation protocol and, LTP and LTD -like effects are indexed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For Chapter 2 66 example, when a 5 -min block of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is preceded at short interval (3-min) by an additional 7 -min block of anodal tDCS, the LTP - like (facilitatory) effect of anodal tDCS on the primary motor cortex (M1) is reversed toward LTD (observed as a reduction in corticomotor excitability to TMS) (Fricke et al., 2011) . a 1 Hz repetitive transcranial m agnetic stimulation (rTMS) paradigm (that has no overt effect on corticomotor excitability when applied alone) with anodal tDCS effects (Siebner et al., . Non-invasive brain stimulation used to evaluate homeostatic plasticity have mainly been limited to the M1 in pathological conditions including writer's cramp , migraine, and et et al., 2014b; Kang et al., 2011; Thapa al., 2018a) . No study has explored homeostatic plasticity in other brain regions that could be involved in pathology including the p rimary somato sensory cortex or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies have explored homeostatic plasticity in demons trate impaired homeostatic control in writer's cramp, migraine, and chronic pain such that the threshold for synaptic plast icity fails t o favour the induction of LTD when post -synaptic activity is high. For instance, in individuals with writer's cramp , a single block of anodal tDCS increases corticomotor excitability consistent with the response observed in healthy controls. H owever, appli cation of a subsequent block of 1 Hz rTMS fails to reverse Chapter 2 67 corticomotor excitability toward LTD in this population (Quartarone et al., 2005) . Additional studies have provided evidence of paradoxical facilitation in both the visual cortex and M1 of individuals with migraine, observed as an increase in visual cortex and M1 excitability in response to 1 Hz rTMS (in contrast to a reduction in the ex citability of both cortices in healthy controls) (Brighina et al., 2005; Brighina et al., 2002) . Studies comparing M1 homeostatic plasticity between healthy individuals and those with pathology have been limited to cross -sectional designs, despite c onditions such as migraine and low back pain being cyclical in nature (Cosentino et al., 2014b; Thapa et al. , 2018a) . To allow longitudinal evaluation of homeostatic plasticity, as well as detailed evaluation of the relationship between impaired hom eostatic plasticity and symptom status, it is necessary to determine whether homeostatic plasticity can be reliably induced a nd assessed over time. To our knowledge , no study has investigated the reliability of M1 homeostatic plasticity. Here we aimed to d etermine the test -retest reliability of M1 homeostatic plasticity, induced and assessed using non -invasive brain stimulation, at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Chapter 2 68 2.3 M ethods and materials 2.3.1 Subjects As no previous multi -day studies of hom eostatic plasticity exist, a sample size calculation was performed using best available data of MEP amplitudes recorded from healthy individuals at 0-min, 10 -min, and 20 -min following an identical double tDCS protocol used to induce and assess homeostatic plasticity in M1 (effect size estimates of 0.4, alpha of 0.05, and power of 0.8) (Thapa et al., 2018a) . Using these parameters, ten participants were required to evaluate the test -retest reliability of non -invasive brain stimulation to induce and assess M1 homeostatic plasticity at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Accordingly, ten, right -handed, h ealthy volunteers (mean \u00b1 standard deviation age: 23 \u00b1 5 years, 5 males) were recruited. Handedness was assess ed using the Edinburgh handedness questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971) . All particip ants were required to meet inclusion criteria as per transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) safety guidelines (i.e. no history of epilepsy, absen ce of metal implants in the skull) (Keel et al., 2001) . Individuals with a history of neurological, musculoskeletal, upper limb or psychiatri c conditions were excluded. A verbal and written description of the experimental procedures was provided to al l participants. Written, informed consent was obtained before testing. The study was approved by the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval number: H10184) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Chapter 2 69 2.3.2 Experimental design Based on intervals used in previous TMS reliability studies (Uy et al., 2002) , corticomotor excitability was assessed, and plas ticity induced in M1, on day 0, 2, 7, and 14. Participants were se ated comfortably with their right hand and arm at rest for each test session. To evaluate change in corticomotor excitability across days, 15 motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to single pulse t ranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded at 120 % of resting motor threshold (rMT) at the beginning of each test session. 15 MEPs were recorded as previous studies demonstrate good -to-excellent within and between session reliability for cortico motor excitability assessment (Bastani & Jaberzadeh, 2012; Chang et 2007; Doeltgen et al., 2009; Kamen, 2004) . To account for any potential changes in corticomotor excitability occurring across days that could influence the homeostatic response, and to ensure a baseline level of corticomotor e xcitability that was consistent between individuals immediately prior to homeostatic plasticity induction, a further 15 MEPs were recorded immediate prior to the induction of homeostatic plasticity (timepoint 'baseline') at an intensity sufficient to evo ke an average MEP of 1 mV peak -to-peak amplitude (S 1mV). This methodology is standard in plasticity Homeostatic plasticity in M1 using two blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for 7 -min and 5 -min respectively, and separated by a 3-min rest period ('double tDCS protocol'). This protocol has been used previously to Chapter 2 70 induce homeostatic plasticity in human M1 (Fricke recording 15 MEPs at S1mV during the 3 -min rest period between the two tDCS blocks (timepoint 'between'), and at 0-min, 10 -min, and 20 -min follow -up (see Figure 2.1). The number of MEPs was selected based on previous studies that have demo nstrated good - excellent reliability when 15 MEPs are used to assess corticomotor excitabil ity within -and-between of corticomotor excitability Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Co., Ltd., Dyfed, UK) and a standard 70 mm figure -of-eight coil. The coil was held over the left hemisphere, at a 45\u00ba angle to the sagittal plane to induce current in the posterior -anterior direction. Optimal coil position was determined by systematically moving the coil in 1 cm increments and locating the site that evoked the maximum response at the lowest stimulator intensity from the relaxed abductor poll icis brevis (APB) muscle (termed the 'hot -spot'). A soft -tip pen was used to mark the hotspot to allow accurate coil and tDCS electrode re -positioning within and between test ing sessions. Participants were requested to precisely re -mark their hotspot using a mirror and a soft - tipped pen or if required, with assistance from a second person, on the days they did not Chapter 2 71 attend the laboratory for testing. Surface electromyography was recorded using surface dual electrodes (Ag -AgCl, Noraxon dual electrodes, inter -electrode distance 2.0 cm) placed in a belly -tendon montage over the relaxed APB muscle (Antal et al., 2008b; Fricke et al., 2011; Qua rtarone et al., 2005) . The ground electrode was positioned over the ipsilateral olecranon. Raw EM G signals were amplified (1000 times), bandpass filtered 20-1000 Hz, and sampled at 2000 Hz (CED 1401 AD, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, United Kingd om) using Signal software (CED, version 5.08 x 86). To evaluate change in corticomotor excitabilit y across days, 15 motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded at 120 % of resting motor threshold at the APB hot -spot. Resting motor threshold (rMT) was defin ed as the minimum TMS intensity required to elicit at least five MEPs 50 \u00b5V in ten consecutive t rials from the resting APB muscle (Rossini et al., 1994) . 2.3.4 of M1 synaptic and homeos tatic plasticity A battery driven, ramp controlled, constant current stimulator (DC -Stimulator Plus, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany) delivered two blocks of excitatory, anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left primary motor cortex (M1 ). The left M1 was targeted to control for hand dominance, as only right -handed individuals were included in this study. The first anodal tDCS block lasted for 7 -min and the second for 5 -min. T he two blocks were separated by a 3 -min rest period. Rubber ele ctrodes, placed in NaCl soaked sponges (5 x 7 cm) were positioned over the hot -spot corresponding to the right APB Chapter 2 72 muscle (anode) as determined above, and over the contralateral supraorbital re gion (cathode). Electrodes were fixed in position with two adju stable rubber straps. Current intensity was ramped up (0 mA - 1 mA) and down (1 mA - 0 mA) over ten seconds at the start and end of stimulation (Nitsche et al., 2008) . Single -pulse TMS was used to monitor corticomotor excitability in response to the first and second block of anodal tDCS. This was achieved by settin g the stimulator intensity to S 1mV at the previously determined optimal scalp site. Chapter 2 73 Figure 2.1 Experimental protocol for days 0, 2, 7, and 14. Corticomotor excitability was assessed at the beginning of each test session using 15 motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded at 120 % of resting motor threshold. To ensur e a consistent level of baseline corticomotor excitability across subjects prior to the induction of plasticity, a further 15 MEPs were recorded at an intensity sufficient to elicit an average MEP of 1 mV peak -to- peak amplitude (S 1mV) immediately before th e first block of 7 -min anodal transcr anial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This intensity was kept consistent for the remainder of the test session. Plasticity was induced using a 7 -min block of anodal tDCS, followed by a second 5 -min block of anodal tD CS, separated by a 3 -min rest period. Fifteen MEPs were recorded at S 1mV between the two blocks of anodal tDCS, and at 0 -min, 10 -min, and 20 - min follow -up. Chapter 2 74 2.3.5 Data analysis Data are presented as means and standard deviations (SD) in text, tables, a nd figures. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software for windows, version 22. Data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro -Wilk test. A one -way repeated measure s ANOVA with factor day (0, 2, 7, 14) was performed to compare i) resting m otor threshold, ii) TMS intensity used to elicit S 1mV, and iii) corticomotor excitability (recorded at 120 % rMT), between days. To examine the change in corticomotor response follo wing the first block of anodal tDCS across days, the amplitude of the MEP a t timepoint 'between' was calculated as a proportion of the MEP amplitude at 'baseline' and analysed using a one - way repeated measures ANOVA with factor 'day'. To examine the change in corticomotor response to the double tDCS protocol across days, the ampl itude of the MEP at each of the follow -up time -points (0 -min, 10 -min, and 20 -min) was calculated as a proportion of the MEP amplitude at time -points 'baseline' and 'between', and an alysed using a one repeated measures ANOVA with factor 'day'. This anal ysis was performed as the magnitude of the homeostatic response is likely to be dependent on corticomotor excitability at 'baseline', and the amount of facilitation achieved followi ng the first block of anodal tDCS (i.e., timepoint ' between'). Bonferroni p ost-hoc tests corrected for multiple comparisons were performed where appropriate. The Greenhouse -Geisser method was used to correct for non -sphericity. Effect sizes from the one -way repeated measures Chapter 2 75 ANOVA are reported using partial eta squared ( 2). Cohen's benchmarks were used to define small ( medium 2=0.06), and large effect 1969; Richardson, 2011) . An intraclass correlation coefficient mod el (ICC 3,k) was used to evaluate the test -retest reliability of the i) resting motor threshold, ii) TMS intensity us ed to elicit S 1mV, iii) corticomotor excitability (recorded at 120 % rMT), iv) corticomotor response to the first block of anodal tDCS, and v) the corticomotor (homeostatic) response recorded at 0 -min, 10-min, and 20 -min after the second block of anodal tD CS, across days 0, 2, 7, and 14. The ICC 3,k model was used to determine consistency between variables across days by accounting for fixed ef fects from the rater and ran dom effects from study participants (McGraw & Wong, 1996; Schambra et al., 2015) . ICC scores 0.20 were considered poor, 0.21 to 0.40 fair, 0.41 to 0.60 moderate, 0.61 to 0.80 good, and 0.81 excellent (Matamala et al., 2018) . Chapter 2 76 Results 2.4.1 Corticomotor excitability , and homeostati c plasticity in healthy individuals at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days , and 2 weeks All data had normal distribution. There was no difference in resting motor threshold (F2,16=0.3, P=0.7, 2=0.03), the TMS intensity 2=0.04) F 2,16=0.4, P=0.6, 2=0.05) between days (Table 2.1). The magnitude of the increase in MEP amplitude following the first block of anodal tDCS was not different between days (c orticomotor excitab ility at timepoint 'between' calculated as a MEP amplitude at 'baseline'; F 3,27=0.4, P=0.8, 2=0.04; Figure 2 .2 and 2.3 ). Similarly, the magnitude of the decrease in MEP amplitude following the second block of anodal t DCS was not differe nt between days at all follow -up time - points (corticomotor excitability at time -points 0-min, 10 -min, and 20 -min calculated as a proportion of the MEP amplitude at 'baseline'; -min, and 20 -min calculated as a proportion of the MEP amplitude at 'between'; Figure 2.2 and 2.3 ). Chapter 2 77 Small effect sizes were observed for rMT ( 2=0.03), the TMS intensity used to elicit corticomotor excitability (assessed at 120 % rMT, 2=0.05), and the corticomotor response to the fi rst block of anodal tDCS ( 2=0.04). Medium -to-large effect sizes were observed for homeostatic responses to the double tDCS protocol when normalise d was for rMT (ICC=0.92, 95% CI 0 .76 to 0.98; Table 2.1) and the TMS intensity used to elicit S 1mV (ICC=0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99; Table 2.1) across days. Moderate -to-good reliability was observed for corticomotor excitability assessed at 120 % rMT across days (ICC=0.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94; Table 2.1). The corticomotor to the first block of anodal tDCS (ICC=0.41, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.84; Table 2.1), and homeostatic responses to the double tDCS protocol at all follow -up time-points across days, demonstrated moderate -to-good -reliability when Table 2.1). Similarly, moderate -to-good -reliability was observed at all follow -up time -points across days, when homeostatic responses were normalised to timepoint 'between' (0 -min: ICC=0.60, CI -0.06 to 0.89; Table 2.1). The highest ICCs were observed for the homeostatic plasticity response recorded at 10 -min follow -up across to 0.12 0.91; 79 Table 2.1.

The corticomotor response to single, and double, anodal tDCS demonstrated mo derate -to- good test -retest reliability in healthy individuals over intervals up to two weeks. These data suggest M1 homeostatic plasticity can be reliably induced and assessed over 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks using two blocks of anodal tDCS and single pu lse TMS respectively . Chapter 2 83 This finding provides a foundation for the longitudinal evaluation of M1 homeostatic plasticity in humans using the double tDCS protocol. Homeostatic plasticity regulates neuronal firing rates in the human brain and ensures neuronal activity is maintained within a stable physiological range (Karabanov et al., homeostatic plasticity proposes that neuronal firing rates are regulated based on the history of post -synaptic a ctivity, such that high levels of neuronal activity reduce the threshold for LTD -induction and promote LTD -like plasticity (sy naptic weakening, lower firing rates), while low levels of neuronal activity reduce the threshold for LTP -induction and promote LTP-like plasticity (synaptic strengthening, higher firing rates) (Bear, 2003; Turrigiano & Nelson, 2004) . Consistent with the BCM theory, studies exploring homeostatic plasticity Turrigiano (Karabanov & Siebner, 2012; & Sidhu et al., 2017) have shown that neuronal activity is modified based on the level of postsynaptic activity (Christova et al., 2015; Fujiyama et al., 2017; Opie et al., 2017b) . For example, studies have shown that two blocks of anodal tDCS produce effects on M1 that fo llow a time -dependent rule consistent Chapter 2 84 with homeostatic mechanisms (Fricke et al., 2011) . Specifically, when 7 -min of anodal tDCS is followed at 3 -min interval by a second, 5 -min block of anodal tDCS, the increas observed with anodal tDCS applied alone is reversed toward inhibition (Fricke et al., 2011) . The nature of t his response mimics the homeostatic rule of a threshold that slides to favour the induction of LTD -like effects (inhibitory response after the second block of an odal tDCS) when post -synaptic activity is high (following the first block of anodal tDCS) (Bear, 2003; Karabanov Ziemann, 2015) . Our data c onfirm the direction and time -course of th ese effects in the healthy brain (increased corticomotor excitability in response to a single 7 -min block of anodal tDCS; decreased corticomotor excitability in response to double tDCS), and extend previous work by demonstrating moderate -to-good test -retes t reliability with medium -to-large effect sizes when homeostatic plasticity is induced and assessed using non -invasive brain stimulation at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Specifically, moderate -to-good test-retest reliability with medium -to-large effect sizes was observed when the magnitude of the homeostatic response was considered relative to 'baseline,' (all ICC 0.43; all 2 0.06; Table 2.1), and when the magnitude of the response was considered relative to the level of facilitation pr oduced following the first block of anodal tDCS (all ICC 0.60; all 2 0.12; Table 2.1). The greatest test -retest reliability (ICC 0.61) with the larg est effect size Chapter 2 85 (2 0.13) was observed when the homeostatic response was evaluated at 10 -mins follow - up. The current data also provide further evidence that resting motor threshold (ICC=0.92, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94) are reliable at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. This findin g is in agreement with previous studies. For example, Malcolm et al. (2006) reported high reliability in motor thresholds (ICC=0.90 -0.97) in healthy volunteer s over a period of two weeks (Malcolm et al., 2006) . Fur ther, good reliability (ICC 0.75) for cortical excitability measures (resting motor threshold, TMS input -output curves, MEP a mplitude, and cortical silent period) have been reported across two testing sessions, each one week apart, in healthy volunteers (Liu & Au -Yeung, 2014) . As changes in resting motor threshold and / or baseline corticomotor excitability are likely to influence the homeostatic response, reliability of these measures over time is an important consideratio n in the assessment of homeostatic plasticity in humans (Brighina et al., 2011; Cosentino et al., 2014b; Karabanov et al., 2015) . Previous studies have used a range of non -invasive brain stimulation protocols to probe M1 homeostatic plasticity in both healthy and clinical populations (Antal et al., 2008b; Kang et al., 2011; 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . In people Chapter 2 86 with non -specific chronic low ba ck pain (cLBP), homeostatic plasticity was assessed in M1 using a double tDCS protocol identical to that investigated here (Thapa et al., 2018a) . The authors demonstrated impaired homeostatic plasticity in this pop ulation characterised by a failure to reverse high corticomotor excitability (induced by t he first block of tDCS) towards inhibition (following the second block of tDCS). Using 5 Hz trains of repetitive TMS, impaired homeostatic plasticity has been reporte d in individuals with episodic migraine during the preictal and post -ictal stages of the m igraine cycle (Cosentino et al., 2014b) . Although data was obtained from different individuals at different stages of the migraine cycle (i.e. the study did not utilise a repeated -measures design), impaired homeostatic plasticity was theorised to contribute to headache recurrence, and migraine transformation from an episodic to a chronic condition (Cosentino et al., 2014b) . Similar observations were reported in the M1 of individuals with writer's cramp where patients failed to reverse high corticomotor excitability toward inhibition when 1 Hz rTMS Impaired M1 in writer's cramp was later reported to correl ate with the severity of symptoms and hypothesised to contribute to aberrant sensorimotor plasticity in this condition (Kang et al., 2011) . These data have been interpreted to suggest that impaired homeostatic plasticity may play a role in the pathogenesis of some clinical conditions. Further exploration of these findings using long itudinal and repeated measures study designs are needed to confirm these hypotheses. Chapter 2 87 It is noteworthy that some studies using repeated non -invasive brain stimulation techniques have demonstrated non -homeostatic interactions in the human M1, where cumulati ve (rather than opposite) LTP o r LTD -like effects are induced (Huang et al., 2011; Jung & Ziemann, 2009; Karabanov et al., 2015) . For example, the application of two successive inhibitory continuous theta -burst sti mulation protocols results in long -lasting MEP depression and no t a reversal towards facilitation as would be hypothesised by the BCM theory (Goldsworthy et al., 2015; Goldsworthy et al., 2012a) . These data suggest that in addition to homeostatic mechanisms, non -homeostatic interactions might also shape non - invasive brain stimulation induced LTP -LTD -like effects. Future studies exploring the interplay between homeostatic and non -homeostatic mechanisms over time are warranted in healthy and pathological populations. This study has several limitations. First, test -restest reliability i n M1 homeostatic plasticity was assessed in one direction only i.e., with a facilitatory priming protocol (anodal tDCS). This approach was selected as previous studies in pathological conditions have shown failure to induce LTD when post -synaptic activity is high (Antal et al., 2008b; Kang et al., 2011) . However, since the polarity and magnitude of synaptic plasticity varies as a function of activation history in the post -synaptic neuron, future studies should seek to dete rmine whether inhibitory priming protocols (e.g. cathodal tDCS) are also reliable over time. Chapter 2 88 Second, this study did not assess homeostatic plasticity in intracortical inhibitory or facilitatory networks. As tDCS to influence intracortical activity (Biabani et al., Nitsche et al., 2003c; Nitsche & Paulus, 2011) , and homeostatic impairment has been demonstrated in intra -cortical inhibitory and facilitatory networks in individuals with et al., al., 2010; Brighina et al., 2002) , future studies should investigate homeostatic regulation in these networks over time . Third, although this study used non -invasive brain stimulation methods similar to previous studies in this field (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) , tDCS applied to M1 using electrodes of 5 x 7 cm2 may have resulted in current spread to surrounding cortical regions (Bastani & Jaberzadeh, 2013; DaS ilva et al., 2011; Nitsche et al., 2008) . Future studies should extend current findings using high density tDCS, as these approaches induce local rather than diffused tDCS effects (Datta et al., 2010) . Finally, our findings are limited to homeostatic plasticity in the heal thy M1 using a double tDCS protocol. Furthe r research is needed to determine the test -retest reliability of homeostatic plasticity induced using other non -invasive brain stimulation methodologies in M1, as well as homeostatic plasticity induced in other br ain regions relevant to different pathologi es (Bliem et al., 2008; Bocci et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2016; Wolters et al., 2005) . Chapter 2 89 2.6. Conclusion These data demonstrate that M1 homeostatic plasticity induced usin g two blocks of anodal tDCS and assessed using single pulse TMS, has moderate -to-good reliability at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks, with the greatest reliability observed when t he homeostatic response is assessed at 10 -min follow -up. These fin dings provide a foundation for the assessment of homeostatic plasticity in the M1 using repeated measures and longitudinal study designs in humans. Chapter 3: Disruption of cortical synaptic homeostasis in individuals with chronic lo w back pain As identified in chapter one, no study has explored homeostatic plasticity in any chronic musculoskeletal pain condition despite similar clinical presentations to writer's cramp and chronic migraine, where homeostatic plasticity is impaired . Therefore, the aim of this chapter was to explore homeostatic plasticity in individuals with a chronic m usculoskeletal pain condition i.e., in individuals suffering from non-specific chronic low back pain. The content of this chapter has been published in Thapa , T., Graven -Nielsen, T., Chipchase, Disruption of cortical synaptic homeostasis in Neurophysiology. 129(5), 1090 -1096. doi: 10.1016/j.clinph.2018.01.060. A copy of this publication is provided in appendix B. The editorial to this chapter is provided in appendix C Chapter 3 91 3.1 Abstract Homeostatic plasticity mechanisms regulate synaptic plasticity in the human plasticity may contribute to maladap tive synaptic plasticity and in chronic muscu loskeletal pain. We examined homeostatic plasticity in 50 individuals with chronic low back pain (cLBP) , and 25 healthy, pain -free, controls . A single block (7 -min) of anodal transcranial dir ect current stimulation ('single tDCS'), or two subsequent blocks (7-min and 5 by 3 -min rest; 'double tDCS'), were randomised across two experimental sessions to confirm an excitatory response to tDCS applied alone, and to evaluate homeostati c plasticity, respectively. Corticomotor excitability was assesse d in the corticomotor representation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle by transcranial magnetic stimulation -induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and at 0-min, 10-min, 20-min, and 30 -min following each tDCS protocol. Compared with baseline, MEP amplitudes increased at all time points in both groups following the single tDCS protocol (P<0.003 ). Following the double tDCS protocol, MEP amplitudes decreased in healthy, pain -free, controls at all time -points compared with baseline (P<0.01), and were unchanged in the cLBP group (P0.1). These data indicate impaired homeostatic plasticity in the primary motor cortex of individuals with cLBP. Chapter 3 92 3.2 Introduction Non-specific chronic low back pain ( cLBP ) is a prevalent and disabling musculoskeletal condition with few effective treatments (Balague et al., 2012) . Although precise mechanisms remain unclear, structural and functional reorgani sation of the sensorimotor cortex has been identified in non-specific cLBP, and is associated with pain severity, pain duration , and movement dysfunction (Kregel et al., 2015; Masse reorganisation in marker of maladaptive synaptic plasticity, and this concept provides the foundation for contemporary theories of pain persistence (Moseley & Flor, 2012) . Importantly, synaptic plasticity homeostatic mechanisms (term ed homeostatic ), that if impaired, could explain aberrant and potentially sym ptom persistence in non-specific cLBP. Despite this, a pathophysiological role for changes in homeostatic plasticity has been overlooked musculos keletal pain. Hebbian or use -dependent synaptic plasticity involves the expression of lasting changes in synaptic efficacy underpinned by long -term potentiation (LTP; synaptic strengthening) and long-term depression 1949) . However, s ynaptic plasticity relies on a positive feedback loop that left unchecked would lead to either too much strengthening and excessive neuronal excitability (L TP), or too much weakening and neuronal silencing (LTD) (Karabanov et al., 2015) . In the healthy brain, homeostatic Chapter 3 93 plasticity mechanisms enforc e stability and maintain brain excitability within a normal range by shifting the threshold for LTP and LTD based on the history of synaptic activity. For example, the threshold of a synapse with a history of high excitability will shift to favour inductio n of LTD (Bienenstock et a l., 1982) . Hom eostatic plasticity can be assessed in humans using non -invas ive brain stimulation. For example, in healthy individuals a homeostatic response is elicited when two blocks of excitatory brain stimulation are applied at short intervals (Fricke et al., 2011) . Homeostatic plasticity is observ ed as an increase in cortical excitability following the first block of excita tory stimuli (synaptic strength ening ) that is reversed towards inhibition (synaptic weakening) when the second block of excitatory stimuli is applied after a few minutes . In this way, the brain corrects for exposure to excessive levels of excitation and prevents aberrant synaptic plasticity (Karabanov et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2012) . Evidence from neurological conditions such as mig raine and writer's cramp suggest a link between impaired homeostatic plasticity and symptoms. For example, these individuals exhibit reorganisation of the sensorimotor cortex (Jia & Yu, 2017; Schabrun al., 2009a) as excessive (Brighina et al., . Impaired is hypothesised to contribute to abnormal cortical reorganisation and sens orimotor symptoms in these conditions as a result of Chapter 3 94 inappropriate and excessive LTP -like effects resulting from a failure to shift the threshold towards LTD when excitability is high (Brighina et al., 2005; Kang et al., Quartarone et al., 2008; Quartarone & Pisani, 2011) . A comparable failure of homeostatic control in cLBP could explain similar observations of maladaptive cortical reorganisatio n and symptom persistence in this population yet, no study has inv estigated homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal disorders. Importantly, impaired homeostatic has been shown to be generalised throughout the sensorimotor system and is not restricted to the cortical representations of affected muscles (Antal et al., 2008b; Brighina et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2008; Quartarone 2005) . For instance, in migraine, impaired homeostatic plasticity is not restricted to the visual cortex a nd is also observed in M 1 representations of 'unaffected' hand muscles (Antal et al., 2008b; Brighina et 2014b) impaired homeostatic plasticity present in the median and ulnar inner vated muscles in writer's cramp (Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2008 ). Together, these findings indicate a g lobal impairment in homeostatic plasticity that has been suggested to provide evidence for a primar y role of impaired homeostatic plasticity in the pathophysiology of these conditions (Antal et al., 2008b; Brighina et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone & Pisani, 2011) . Chapter 3 95 This study aimed to investigate hom eostatic plasticity in the primary motor cortex representation of 'unaffected' hand muscles in individua ls with non-specific cLBP and healthy, pain -free, controls . Similar to indings in individuals with migraine and writer's cramp , it was hypothesised tha t individuals with cLBP would fail to display a reversal of excitation towards inhibition following a second block of excitatory non -invasive brain stimulation consistent with global impairment in homeostatic control. A secondary aim was to examine the rel ationship between the m agnitude of impaired homeostatic plasticity (if present) and the intensity and duration of cLBP. 3.3 M ethods and m aterials 3.3.1 Participants To determine a sufficient sample size to detect a difference in homeostatic plasticity between those with and wit hout cLBP should one exist ( aim 1), a power calculation was performed using a conservative effect size estimate of 0.2, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Using these parameters, 24 individuals were required in each group. However, to ensure there was al so sufficient power to examine a relationship between impaired homeostatic plasticity and pain in the cLBP group, should one exist ( aim 2), a second power calculation using an r value of 0.4, an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8 was per formed. Using these par ameters, a sample size of 47 individuals with cLBP was required. Thus, 50 individuals with cLBP (mean standard deviation age: 45 16 years, 26 men), and 25 Chapter 3 96 healthy, pain -free, controls (age: 43 17 years; 13 men) were recruited. Chronic, non - specific low back pain was defined as the presence of continuous back pain lasting three months or more that was not due to a diagnosable pathology. A verbally administered 11 - point numerical rating scale (NR S) anchored with 'no pain' at zero and 'worst pain possible' at 10, was used to determine pain intensity in the week prior to, and on the day of, testing. Participants were excluded if they presented with low back pain due to lumbar surgery, fracture, lumb ar puncture, malignancy, infection, facet denervation, neuropathic or mixed pain (where pain radiated below the gluteal fold), and healthy, pain -free, controls were excluded if they had a history of cLBP , or any musculoskeletal pain condition . Any particip ant with a history of major circula tory, neurological, psychiatric, respiratory or cardiac diseases, who was taking central nervous system acting medication, or who presented with a cognitive deficit that impaired the ability to understand instructions or provide informed consent was exclud ed. All participants were required to meet inclusion criteria as per the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) safety guidelines (i.e. no history of epilepsy, absence of metal implants in the skull) (Keel et al., 2001) . Participant characteristics are summarised in Table 3.1. A verbal and written description of the experimental procedures was provided to al l participants. Written, informed c onsent was obtained before testing. The study was Chapter 3 97 approved by the institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval number: H10184) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 3.3.2 Experimental design All participants attended two experimental sessions in random order . Experimental sessions were separated by at least seven days to avoid carry over effects as previous studies have demonstrated tDCS when applied for 7 a nd 5-minutes with a 3 -minute interval induce effects that pers ist for up to 60 -minutes (Fricke et al., 2011; Nitsche et al., 2007b) received a single 7-min block of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the primary motor corte x (M1) in one session to confirm the existence of an excitatory response ('single tDCS' protocol; Figure 3.1A). In a separate session, participants were exposed to two blocks of anodal tDCS (7 -min and 5 -min separated by a 3-min rest period) to investigate homeostati c plasticity in M1 ('double tDCS'; Fig ure 3.1B). This protocol has been shown to induce homeostatic plasticity (observed as a reduction in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in response to TMS) in healthy individuals (Fricke et al., 2011) . In both sessions, MEPs were elicited usi ng single pu lse TMS an d recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle ipsilateral to the side of worst pain in individuals with non-specific cLBP and the matched side for healthy, pain - free, controls . The FDI muscle was chosen to allow investiga tion of global impairm ent in homeostatic plasticity consistent with previous studies in writer's cramp and chronic Chapter 3 98 migraine (Antal et al., 2008b; Quartarone et al., 2005) . Motor evoked potentials were recorded at b aseline, and immediate ly follow ing each experimental protocol at 0 -min, 10- min, 20-min, and 30 -min follow -up (Cavaleri et al., 2017) . Participants were comfortably seated with their hand and arm at rest throughout both sessions. No participant reported muscle spasm or discomfort during testing. 3.3.3 Assessment of corticomotor excitability Motor evoked potentials were recorded using surface dual electrodes (Ag -AgCl, Noraxon dual electrodes, product #272S, inter -electrode distance 2.0 cm) placed in a belly -tendon montage on the relaxed FDI muscle (Anta l et al., 2008b; Fricke et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005) . The ground electrode was positioned on the olecranon process. Raw EMG signals were amplified (1000 times), bandpass filtered within a range of 20 Hz (high -pass) to 1 kHz (low-pass) and sample d at 2 kHz (CED 1401 AD, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, United Kingdom) via acquisition software (CED, version 5.08 x 86). The MEP peak -to-peak amplitude was extracted and averaged for analysis. A standard 70 mm figure -of-eight coil connected to a magnetic stimulator (Magstim 200, Magstim Co. Ltd. Dyfed, UK) was used to provide single -pulse TMS. The coil was positioned tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing posterolaterally at a 45 angle from the mid -sagittal pla ne. This orientation i s optimal for the induction of posterior -to-Chapter 3 99 anterior (PA) directed current for trans -synaptic activation of horizontal cortical connections in M1 (Bashir et al., 2013; Brasil -Neto et al., 1992) . The optimal otspot) for eliciting MEPs from the relaxed FDI was determined before each experimental session by systematically moving the coil in 1 cm increments around the motor cortex. The hotspot was marked with a pen to allow accurate coil positioning. The stimulat ion intensity for TMS was adjusted to elici t an MEP amplitude of 1 mV peak -to-peak in the relaxed FDI at baseline, and this intensity was kept consistent throughout each test session. The average amplit ude of 30 MEPs was used for analysis at each time -point. 3.3.4 Transcranial direct current stimu lation In both experiments, a battery driven direct current stimulator (DC -Stimulator Plus, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany) was used to deliver a constant current of 1 mA through saline -soaked sponge electrodes (sur face 7 x 5 cm). The active electrode (anode ) was positioned over the motor cortical representation (hotspot) for FDI as determined by TMS in each participant. The reference electrode (cathode) was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region. Elec trodes were fixed with two adjustable rubbe r straps around the head. Stimulation in this montage has been reported to increase cortical excitability in the underlying M1 that outlasts the stimulation period by 20 - 60 min (Fricke et al., 2011) . Current was ramped up and down over 10 s at the start and end of stimulation to avoid Chapter 3 100 startling particip ants by alternating current transients that cause immediate neuronal firing during tDCS (Nitsche et al., 2008) . 101 Figure 3.1. Experimental protocol : A) Single tDCS protocol: Anodal tDCS was applied to the primary motor cortex contralateral to the side of worst pain in individuals with cLBP and the matched side for healthy, pain -free, controls in a single, 7 -min block. B) Double tDCS protocol: Anodal tDCS was applied to the primary motor cortex contralateral to the side of worst pain in individuals with cLBP and the matched side for healthy, pain -free, controls for a 7 -min block follo wed by a second 5 -min block separated by a 3-min rest period. Motor evoked potentials (elicited using trans cranial magnetic stimulation) were recorded at baseline and at 0 -min, 10-min, 20-min, and 30 -min follow -up in each experiment. Chapter 3 102 3.3.5 Data analysis Data are presented as means and standard dev iations (SD) throughout the text. For all analyses, SPSS software for windows, version 22 was used. A two -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine the TMS intensity used to elicit a 1 mV MEP at ba seline between groups (cLBP and pain -free c ontrols) and protocols (sing le vs. double tDCS). To examine the effect of each tDCS protocol (single vs. double) on raw (non-normalised) MEP amplitudes, separate two -way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for each protocol with factors 'Group' (cLBP v s. pain -free controls) , and 'Time' (baseline, 0, 10, 20 , and 30 -minutes). Where appropriate, post -hoc testing was performed using t -tests with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. The Greenhouse - Geisse r method was used to correct for non -spheri city as required. A Pearson product - moment correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity (MEP amplitude) at each time -point after the double tDCS proto col and pain intensity, and pain duration, respectively. For all statis tical tests a P - value of <0.05 was considered significant. Chapter 3 103 3.4 R esults Table 3.1.

In the double tDCS protocol, the TMS intensity used to elicit MEPs of 1 mV peak -to-peak was 57 \u00b1 14 %, and 56 \u00b1 1 5 % in the cLBP and healthy, pain -free, control groups respectively. There was no Chapter 3 104 difference in the baseline TMS intensity between groups (F 1,73=0.0, in both groups following the single tDCS protocol (Fig ure 3.2A; Table 3.2). There was a main effect of time (F 4,292=6.7, P<0.001), but no main effect of group (F 1,292=0.0, P=0.9) and no interaction effect (F 4,292=1.4, P=0.2). C ompared with baseline, MEP amplitudes incre ased at all time points in both groups -min of anodal tDCS per cent of individuals with cLBP, and 76% of healthy, pain -free individuals exhibited an excitatory response (increased MEP ampl itude relative to baseline) following the single tDCS protocol (Fig ure 3. 4A). 3.4.3 Double tDCS protocol In the double tDCS protocol, the size of the MEP amplitude over time was dependent on the presence or absen ce of cLBP (Fig ure 3.2B; Table 3.2). The AN OVA demonstrated no main effect of time (F 4,292=2.4, P=0.1) but a main effect of group (F 1,292=37.9, P<0.001) and an interaction effect between group and time (F 4,292=7.4, P<0.001). Compared with baseline, healthy , pain-free, controls displayed a reduction in MEP amplitude at all time - points following the double tDCS protocol (post -hoc ure 3.3B). In Chapter 3 105 contras t, individuals with cLBP demonstrated no ch ange in MEP amplitude 3.3B). When individuals with and without cLBP were compared at each time -point, there wa s no difference in the MEP amplitude at baseline (post hoc: t=0.5; P=0.7). However, MEP amplitudes were higher in the cLBP group when compared to healthy, pain-free, controls at all other time -points ( Fig ure 3.3B). Thirty -two per cent of individuals with cLBP and 72 % of healthy, pain -free individuals displayed a normal homeostatic plasticity response (decreased MEP amplitude relative to baseline) following the double tDCS protocol (Fig ure 3.4B). 106 Figur e 3.2.

Chapter 3 111 3.5 Discussion This study is the first to investigate homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal pain. Although individua ls with and without cLBP displayed typical increases in corticomotor excitability in response to the single tDCS protocol, only healthy, pain -free, con trols demonstrated a reversal of excitation towards inhibition following the double tDCS protocol consist ent with normal homeostatic control. These novel data suggest a disruption of homeostatic plasticity in the primary motor cortex of individuals with cLBP that is present regardless of pain intensity or pain durati on, and is not restricted to the representa tion of painful muscles. This mechanism could explain observations of maladaptive synaptic plasticity in cLBP, and could provide a pathophysiological mechanism to explain pain persistence in this condition. Hom eostatic plasticity is an essential form of plasticity in the human brain that ensures neuronal activity is maintained within a stable physiological range (Murakami et al., 2012; Ziemann & Siebner, 2008) . Originall and Munr o, homeostatic plasticity prevents uncontrolle d increases or decreases in synaptic efficacy by linking the effectiveness of LTP and LTD processes to the level of activity in the postsynaptic neuron (Bienenstock et al., 1982) . When activity is high, LTP processes are less effective, favouring LTD and synaptic weaken ing. Similarly, when postsynaptic activity is low, LTD processes are less effective, favo uring LTP and synaptic Chapter 3 112 strengthening. It has previously been argued that changes in the amplitude of the MEP to transcranial magnetic stimulation after successive bloc ks of excitatory non -invasive brain stimula tion reflect changes in the efficacy of synapt ic relays within the corticomotor pathway (Siebner & Rothwell, 2003) , and that reversal of the direction of these changes (towards inhibition) can be used to assess hom eostatic plasticity (Fricke et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005) . Using this model, the present data suggest individuals with cLBP have impaired homeostatic plasticity that manifests as a failure to regulate in creases in corticomotor excitability since excitability is not reversed towards inhibition when postsynaptic act ivity is high. Failure to regulate synaptic plasticity in individuals with cLBP could lead to a dispr oportionately high rate of synaptic strengt hening and maladaptive reorganisation of brain Indeed, have shown increased cortical excitability (Kregel et al., 2015; Wand et , reduced et al., 2017) , and enlarged representations of the back muscles that are posteriorly shif ted and show greater overlap in cLBP (Schabrun et al., 2015b; Tsao et al., 2011b; Tsao et al., 2008) when compared with those of healthy controls. These cortical changes are associated with pain severity, impaired postural control , and reduced coordination of trunk muscles (Janetzki et al., 2016; Tsao et al., 2011b; Tsao et al., 2008) . In addition, the threshold where mechanical Chapter 3 113 pressure turns to pain is lo wer in people with cLBP than controls (Giesbrecht & Batti e, 2005; Giesecke et al., 2004; Imamura et al., 2013; Kobayashi et al., 2009) , and people with cLBP exhibit reduced nocice ptive withdrawal reflex thresholds (Biurrun Manresa al., 2013) reflex receptive fields (Biurrun Manresa et al., 2013; et al., 2011) et al., 1997; et al., 2013) . Together, these findings in dicate an increase in spinal and cortical excitability in cLBP that could be explai ned by excessive synaptic strengthening as a result of impaired homeostatic control. Although no studies have examined homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal pain, evidence from neurological populations supports this hypothesis. For example, writer's cramp is characterised by increased M1 exc 2017; Hallett, 2011; Si ebner et al., 1999) , and enlarged and over lapped M1 representations of the hand muscles (Schabrun et al., 2009b) - cortical changes that are similar to those rep orted in cLBP. Several studies have shown impaired homeostatic plasticity in writer' s cramp that is hypothesised to underpin the increased excitability and enlarged cortical representations observed in this condit ion (Kang et al., Quartarone et al., & Pisani, 2011; 2005) . Specifically, the failure of homeostatic plasticity to prevent the positive feedback c ycle of synaptic plasticit y is believed to produce unchecked increase s Chapter 3 114 in synaptic strength that consolidate maladaptive cortical reorganisation as well as the pathological sensorimotor interactions and movement patterns that manifest in writer's cramp (Quartarone & Pisani, 2011) . Notably, excessive synaptic strengthening in writer' s cramp is not restricted to the circuits clinically affected by dyst onia, but is generali sed throughout the sensorimotor system (Antal et al., 2008b; Quartarone et al., 2008) - a finding consistent with the current observations in cLBP. Th is finding is also consistent with previous reports of a generalised alteration in cortical excitability that extends beyond the cortical representation of painful muscles in chronic pain conditions (termed ' pain- motor integration'), including cLBP (Flor et Schwenkreis et al., 2003; Tsao et al., 2011b; Tsao et al., 20 08). As such, it is plausible that impaired homeostatic plasticity may also influence pain-motor integration cortical excitability, reinfo rcement of unwanted movement patterns (poor postural control, and coordination), and unpleasant sensory experiences. Accordingly, should future studies confirm the relevance of imp aired homeostatic plasticity to cLBP, thera pies that seek to target neurop lasticity in persistent pain may need to target homeostatic , rather than synaptic, plasticity mechanisms. For example, previous studies have shown that patterned peripheral electrica l stimulation applied to reduce cortical ex citability (induce synaptic wea kening; where Chapter 3 115 homeostatic plasticity is known to be impaired, improves cortical organisation and reduces symptoms (Schabrun et al., 2009a) . Sim ilar treatments, designed specifically to c ounter excessive synaptic strengthening, could also be effective in cLBP. Further, an impaired ability to control increases in cortical excitability in cLBP may suggest that commonly used treatments known to promo te synaptic strengthening (e.g. motor retra ining, exercise) may require reconsideration in this population to avoid reinforcing aberrant synaptic plasticity, and inducing detrimental effects on symptoms. Further work is required to test these hypotheses. Examination of individual level data reveal ed a portion of healthy individuals (38%) who displayed impaired homeostatic plasticity, and a portion of cLBP individuals (32%) whose homeostatic control was normal. A lthough the reasons for this are unclear it i s possible that impaired homeostatic plasti city in healthy individuals could predispose to the development of chronic pain in future. However, longitudinal exploration of this mechanism within the same individua l is needed to understand the relevance of in dividual variability in both the healthy an d diseased brain. Notably, there was no association between the magnitude of impaired homeostatic plasticity and pain intensity or pain duration. However, all participa nts were experiencing LBP that had persisted for a substantial period of time (average d uration of 12.7 \u00b1 14.4 years ). It is possible that homeostatic impairment develops in the sub -acute or early phases of cLBP and thus, was Chapter 3 116 already present, regardless of small differences in symptom status in indiv iduals tested in this study. Investigation of homeostatic plasticity in other brain areas, and during the acute, sub-acute , and early phases of cLBP is warranted. This study has several limitations. As the firs t exploration of this mechanism in cLBP we utilised a cross -sectional design. It is ther efore not possible to determine whether homeostatic plasticity is impaired as a cause or a consequence of cLBP or to investigate the relationship between impaired homeo static plasticity and fluctuations in pain ov er the clinical course of cLBP. Future stud ies should utilise longitudinal study designs with multiple measures of homeostatic plasticity and pain to provide comprehensive examination of this mechanism and the s ymptoms of cLBP. In the present study, the experimenter was not blinded to participant g roup and future studies should ensure blinding to reduce the risk of bias. In addition, our sample presented with a long history of cLBP. Different changes in homeostat ic plasticity could be present in the acute o r sub - acute phase of low back pain. Further studies are required to disentangle the relationship between different phases of cLBP and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Finally, this study did not include evalua tion of spinal nociception (either through no ciceptive withdrawal reflexes or laser evok ed potentials). Previous studies have demonstrated spinal hyperexcitability in people with cLBP (Biurrun Manresa et As transcranial magn etic stimulation provides an indication of ex citability throughout the Chapter 3 117 corticomotor pathway it is possible that changes in spinal excitability in people with cLBP may have contributed to the current findings. It is unclear whether changes in spinal excitab ility may drive altered homeostatic plasticit y through the upregulation of afferent input to the cortex or whether impaired homeostatic plasticity drives an increase in spinal excitability. Future studies should seek to clarify the interaction between spin al mechanisms and homeostatic plasticity in p eople with and without cLBP. 3.6 Conclusion This study is the first to explore homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal pain condition s. These unique data suggest a disruption of synaptic homeostasis in individ uals with cLBP that manifests as an inabili ty to counter excessive increases in corticomotor excitability. Further research is required to determine whether impaired homeostatic plasticity drives maladaptive synaptic plasticity and synaptic a failure control Chapter t hree suggest s homeostatic plasticity is impaired in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, as findings from chapter three are limited to a cross - sectional study desi gn, it is not possible to determine whether homeostatic plasticity is impaired as a cause or consequence of musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, chapter f our aimed to address this limitation by assessing homeostatic p lasticity during the development, persisten ce, and resolution of experimentally induced sustained muscle pain over 14 days . The content of this chapter is currently under review in the Journal of Pain. Chapter 4 119 4.1 Abstract Aberrant synaptic plasticity is widely hypothesised to underpin chronic pai n. Yet, synaptic plasticity is controlled and regulated by homeostatic mechanisms that have received limited attention in pain. Here , we aimed to investigate homeostatic plasticity in the human primary motor corte x (M1) in response to the progressive devel opment, maintenance and resolution of pain over 14 days. Nerve -growth factor was injected into the right elbow extensor musculature of 21 healthy individuals on days 0, 2, and 4 to induce progressively developing, sustained muscle pain. Pain and disability were monitored until day 21. Homeostatic plasticity was induced in left M1 using two blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for 7 -min and 5 -min, and separated by a 3 -min rest peri od. Motor -evoked potentials (MEP) assessed the homeostatic response on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 14. On days 0 and 14, MEP amplitude was increased following the first block of tDCS ( P<0.004) , and decreased following the second block tDCS ( P<0.001), consisten t with a normal homeostatic response. er, on days 2 ( P=0.07) and 4 (P=0.7), the decrease in MEP amplitude after the second block of tDCS was attenuated, representing an impaired homeostatic response. These data provide new insight into the maladaptive plasticity hypothesis in pain. Our finding s demonstrate a disturbance in homeostatic plasticity after 2 days of pain that could explain aberrant synaptic plasticity, and contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions. Chapter 4 120 4.2 Introduction Synaptic plasticity plays a key rol e in neural adaptation, and is fundamental to memory, learning, and recovery after injury or illness (Joseph, 2013; Martin et al., 2000; Nudo, 2013; Ziemann & Siebner, ). and structural m echanisms underpin synaptic plasticity in the human brain, including th e dynamic expre ssion of long - term potentiation (LTP) and long -term depression (LTD) -like changes in synaptic efficacy (Hebb, 1949; Joseph , 2013; Martin et . Numerous studies postulate that aberrant synaptic plasticity contributes to the development of chronic pain Apkarian et al., May, 2008; Morton et al., 2016) . However, i n addition to plasticity mechanisms that promote neural 'changeability ', the human brain is governed by plasticity mechanisms that promote stability (Turrigiano, 2012; Turrigiano, 1999, 2006; & 'homeostatic' mechanisms prevent overexpression of LTP and LTD based on the principle of a 'sliding synaptic threshold ', such that high post -synaptic activity el icits a compensatory response that biases the synaptic threshold towards LTD, and low post -synaptic activity biases the synaptic threshold tow ards 2015) . Thus , homeostatic mechanisms are responsible for the control and regulation o f synaptic plasticity and a disturbance in this mechanism could plausibly drive the aberrant synaptic plasticity observed in musculoskeletal pain conditions. Chapter 4 121 Despite the importance of homeostatic mechanisms to healthy brain function, there has been limited investigation of this mechanism in pain. However, studies in several chronic pain states including migraine (Antal et al., 2008b; Brighina et 2002; Cosentino et al., 2014b) , and low back pain suggest global disturbance in homeostatic control. This is observed as a reduction in the normal LTD -like response to experimental pr otocols shown to induce extended LTP -like e ffects in healthy individuals (i.e. two successive blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation [t DCS] or high magnetic stimulation [rTMS]). modul reorganisation, increased pain perception, and sensorimot or dysfunction in these chronic pain conditions (Brighin a et a l., 2005; Brighina et al., al., 2018a) . Whil e it is reasonable to assume that sustained pain may contribute to the global disruption of homeostatic control, there has been no longitudinal investigation of homeostati c plasticity in pain , in particular, in cor tical areas corresponding to the affected muscle . How and when changes in homeostatic control develop in the transition to sustained pain or how they relate to the symptoms of pain is unknown. This information is essential to enhance our understanding of h omeostatic plasticity in humans and to und erstand the impact of sustained pain on this fundamental neural mechanism. Chapter 4 122 Using a clinically -relevant, human pain model to induce progressively developing, sustained mus cle pain, homeostatic plasticity was invest igated in M1 using two successive blocks o f anodal tDCS as pain developed, peaked, and resolved, over the course of 14 days. We hypothesised that several days of sustained pain would alter homeostatic plasticity (reduce the normal LTD -like response observe d following two blocks of anodal tDCS in pain-free, healthy individuals (Fricke et al., 2011) ) in the human M1. 4.3 Methods and materials 4.3.1 Participants Twenty -one, right -handed, healthy individuals (mean \u00b1 standard deviation age: 23 \u00b1 4 years, 12 males) par ticipated. Handedness was assessed using th e Edinburgh handedness questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971) , and a transcranial magn etic stimulation (TMS) safety screening questionnaire was completed prior to study commencement (Keel et al., 2001) . Individuals with a histo ry of neurological, psychiatric, musculoskeletal or upper limb conditions were excluded. All participants received written and verbal description of experimental procedures and provided written informed consent co nsistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. Experimental procedures were approved by the local human research ethics committee (H10184). Chapter 4 123 4.3.2 Experimental design Homeostatic plasticity was induced in M1 using two blocks of anodal tDCS applied for 7 - min an d 5-min respectively, separated by a 3 -min rest period (Fricke al., 2011; Thapa & Schabrun, 2018) . Corticomotor excitability was monitored by recording 15 motor evoked potentials (MEPs) to single pulse transcran ial magnetic stimulation (TMS) i) before tD CS, ii) between the two tDCS blocks (used to evaluate the plasticity response to a single block of anodal tDCS), and iii) 10 -min a fter the last tDCS block (used to evaluate the homeostatic response; Figure 4.1A). We have previously shown that the homeostat ic response induced and assessed using this tDCS protocol has moderate -to-good between session reliability in healthy individuals at intervals of 2, 7 , and 14 days (ICC=0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.91) with the greatest intra-session reliability observed at 10 -min following the tDCS protocol (ICC > 0.61, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.89) . Progressively developing, sustained muscle pain was induced by repeated injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the belly of the extensor carpi radials brevis muscle (m. ECRB) at the end of the experimental session on days 0, 2, and 4. The number of injections used was determined from previous studies w here t he duration of NGF induced sustained muscle pain was depend ent upon the number of injecti ons used (Bergin et al., 2015; Hayashi et al., Lewin et al., 2014; al., 1994; Schabrun et al., 2016) . Homeostatic responses were assessed on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 14. Homeostatic responses recorded on day 0 reflected normal homeostatic regulat ion in the absence of pain and served as a baseline comparison , while homeostatic plasticity assessed on days 2, 4, 6, Chapter 4 124 and 14 reflected homeostatic regulation during pain development and resolution. Pain severity, disability, and sleep quality were assesse d online (via SurveyMonkey) every second day from day 1 to day 21 (Figure 4.1B). Following consent, participants were sent emails or text messages as reminders to fill in the questionnaires. 4.3.3 Induction of M1 homeostatic responses Homeostatic response s were elicited in M1 using two blocks of anodal tDCS. This pr otocol has been used previously to investigate M1 homeostatic responses in both healthy and clinical populations (Fricke et al., 2011; Thapa et al., 2018 a; Thapa & Schabrun, 2018) . A battery driven, ramp controlled, constant current stimulator (DC-Stimulator Plus, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany) was used to deliver anodal tDCS at an intensity of 1 mA. Current was ra mped up and down over 10 seconds at the sta rt and end of stimulation (Nitsche et al., 2008) . Rubber electrodes, placed in s odium -chloride soaked sponges (5 x 7 cm), w ere positioned over the left M1 hot -spot corresponding to the ri ght m. ECRB (anode; see below for hot -spot determination), and over the contralateral supraorbital region (cathode). Two adjustable rubber straps were used to fix the electrodes to the head. 4.3.4 Monitoring of corticomotor excitability Single -pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to monitor corticomotor excitability in response to the first and second block of anodal tDCS. Transcran ial magnetic Chapter 4 125 stimulation (TMS) was performe d using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Co., Ltd., Dyfed, UK) with a monophasic current waveform. A 70mm figure -of-eight coil was positioned over the left hemisphere at a 45\u00ba angle from the sagittal plane. The o ptimal coil position was determined by loca ting the site at which the maximum muscle respo nse from the relaxed right m. ECRB was evoked (termed the 'hot -spot'). A soft -tip pen was used to mark the hot -spot on scalp for TMS coil and tDCS electrode re -positioning within and between sessions. On d ays not attending the laboratory for testing, p articipants were requested to precisely re -mark their hotspot using a mirror and a soft -tipped pen or if required, with assistance from a second person . Surface elect romyography (EMG) was recorded from the rig ht m. ECRB using disposable, surface electrodes (Ag-AgCl , Noraxon dual electrodes, inter -electrode distance 2.0 cm). The ground electrode was placed over the ipsilateral acromion. EMG signals were amplified (1 000), bandpass filtered 20 -1000 Hz and sampled at 2000 Hz (CED 1401 AD , Cambridge Electronic D esign, Cambridge, United Kingdom) using Signal software (CED, version 5.08 x 86). All s ignals were stored on a computer for offline analysis. TMS intensity was adjust ed at baseline on each day of testing to pr oduce an average MEP of ~0.5 mV peak -to-peak am plitude in 15 trials (Burns et al., 2016; Cosentino et al., 2014b; Schabrun et al., 2016) . A further 15 trials were recorded at the baseline TMS intensity between the two tDCS blocks to evaluate the response to the first tDCS protocol ( plasticity response), and at 10 -min follow -up to evaluate the response to the second tDCS protocol ( homeostatic response). Chapter 4 126 4.3.5 Induction and assessment of sustained muscle pain After c leaning the skin with alcohol, a dose of 5 g (0.2 ml) sterile, recombinant human nerve growth factor (NGF ; Lonza Australia Pty Ltd ) was given as a bolus injection into the muscle belly of right m. ECRB on days 0, 2, and 4 using a 0.5 -ml syringe wit h a disposable needle (31G) . The injection site was located 5 cm distal , and 1 cm lateral from the lateral epicondyle along a line from the lateral epicondyle to the midline of the wrist (Bergin et al., 2015) . An online diary consisting of an 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NRS) anchored with 'no pain ' at zero and 'worst pain possible ' at 10 , a modified 7 -point Likert muscle soreness scale anchored with 'a complete absence of soreness' at zero and 'severe muscle soreness, stiffness or weakness that limits the ability to move' at 6 (Hayashi et al., 2013; Schabrun et al., 2016) , the patient -rated tennis elbow evaluation questionnaire ( PRTEEQ), and an 11-point numerical sleep rating scale anchored with 'extremely poor sleep (shallow, unrefreshing)' at zero and 'excellent sleep (de ep, refreshing)' at 10, were administered every second day from day 1 to day 21 (Macdermid, 2005) . 127 Figure 4.1. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) protocol: two blocks of anodal tDCS (the first of 7 -min duration and the second of 5 -min duration, separated by a 3 -min rest perio d) were applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to t he right (painful) extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle. Fifteen motor evoked potentials (elicited using transcranial magnetic stimulation) were recorded at bas eline, during the 3 -min rest period, and 10 -min after the last b lock of tDCS. B) Every a lternate day, from day 1 to day 21, participants completed an online diary consisting of an 11 -point numerical pain rating scale, a modified 7 point Likert muscle soreness scale, the patien t rated -tennis elbow evaluation questionnai re (PRTEEQ), and an 11 -point numerical sleep rating scale. M1 plasticity was assessed and induced at the beginning of each experimental session on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 14. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was injected in to the belly of the right ECRB on days 0, 2 , and 4. Chapter 4 128 4.3.6 Data analyses There was no missing data. For all analyses, SPSS software for windows, version 22 was used. A one way -repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed to examine differen ces in the i) TMS intensity used to elicit MEPs of 0. 5 mV , and ii) the amplitude of the mean MEP, recorded at baseline with factor day (0, 2, 4, 6, and 14) . To examine the change in the MEP amplitude in response to tDCS, a two -way repeated measures ANOVA w as performed on ra w data with factor day (0, 2, 4, 6, and 14 ), and time (baseline, between , 10-min). As the magnitude of the homeostatic response is likely to be influenced by the amount of facilitation achieved following the first block of anodal tDCS, data reflecting the Ratio were analyse d using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA w ith factor day. A one -way repeated measures ANOVA was used to explore changes in pain severity, muscle soreness, sleep quality, and disability with factor day (1, 3, 5....21 ). Shapiro -Wilk tests were used to asses s normality. Data that violated normality were log transformed. If normality was violated after transformation, a Friedman repeated measures ANOVA on ranks was conducted. The Greenhouse -Geisser method was used to cor rect for non - sphericity . Post -hoc tests were performed using either the Wilcoxon si gned -rank test or Chapter 4 129 Bonferroni t-tests adjust ed for multiple comparisons. Significance was set at P<0.05. 4.4 Results 4.4.1 TMS intensity and MEP amplitude at baseline There was no difference in the TMS intensity required to elicit average MEPs of 0.5 mV peak -to-peak, or in the amplitude of the mean MEP recorded at baseline between intensity: 2(4)=6.2, P=0.2; MEPs at 4.1. Mean \u00b1 deviation (N=21) for i) transcranial magnetic stimul ation (TMS) intensity (percent of maximum stimulator output, MSO) required to evoke a motor evoked potential (M EP) of 0.5 mV peak -to-peak amplitude at baseline and ii) MEP amplitude recorded at baseline (prior to tDCS), on each day .

There was no change in sleep quality across days (F11,220=1.9, P=0.1; Figure 4.2D). 132 Figure 4.2. Mean \u00b1 standard error (N=21) for ( A) pain intensity (numerical rating scale scores), ( B) muscle soreness (Likert scale scores), ( C) disability (Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluatio n Questionnai re score), and ( D) sleep quality (numerical rating scale scores). Pain intensity, muscle soreness, and disability increased at day 1 and remained elevated at day 15 compared with day 0 (*P<0.004). Chapter 4 133 4.4.3 The homeostatic response in M1 is alter ed after 2 da ys of sustained muscle pain The progressive development of sustained muscle pain altered the MEP response to single and double tDCS (raw data; time x day interaction: F8,160=3.5, P<0.001; Figure 4.3). A single block of anodal tDCS increased M EP amplitudes on days 0, 2, 4, and 14 (post -hoc baseline vs. between; P<0.004; plasticity response -raw data ; Figure 4.3). The MEP amplitude was not significantly increased following single tDCS on day 6 (post -hoc baseline vs. between: P=0.09; plasticity re sponse -raw da ta). However, examination of the ratio data for the plasticity response revealed that the increase in MEP amplitude was not significantly different across days ( F4,80=1.7, P=0.1). Following the second block of anodal tDCS, MEP amplitudes were reduced, con sistent with a normal homeostatic response, on days 0, and 14 (raw data; post hoc between vs. 10 min; P<0.001). However, there was no significant reduction in MEP amplitudes on days 2, 4, and 6 (raw data; post hoc between vs. 10 min; day 2: P=0.07, day 4: P=0.7, day 6 P=0.5; Figure 4.3). These findings were supported by analysis of the ratio data for the homeostatic response which was different across days ( F4,80=4.0, P=0.005). Compared with days 0 and 14, the ratio was smaller on day 2 ( P=0.02 7), and day 4 (P=0.022) with a similar tendency observed on day 6 ( P=0.076). On day 4, the MEP amplitude was increas ed following the second block of anodal tDCS (Figure 4.3).

Chapter 4 136 4.5 Discussion This study is the first longitudinal investigation of homeostatic plasticity in the transition to sustained musculoskeletal pain. We demonstrate tha t M1 homeosta tic plasticity is altered in response to the development and resolution of sustained muscle pai n. Specifically, the homeostatic response was disrupted after two days of progressively developing muscle pain, with the greatest impairment observe d at day 4. T hese unique findings have relevance for our understanding of the maladaptive plasticity hypothe sis in pain which has focussed almost exclusively on synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Altered homeostatic control could plausibly explain the aberran t synaptic pl asticity reported in chronic pain and may contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition, pro viding new avenues for understanding and treatment. 4.5.1 Homeostatic plasticity Early studies investigating homeostatic plasticity occurred in sli ce preparatio ns and in Nelson, 2004) . However, with the advent of non-invasive brain stimulation, a growing body of work has examined this mechanism in the intact human cortex (for review see (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus homeostatic plasticity is typically achiev ed using non -invasive brain stimulation to 'prime' the response to a subsequent period of stimulation. In the primary Chapter 4 137 motor cortex, LTP and LTD -like effects can be indexed us ing TMS. For example, a single block of anodal tDCS can induce an increase in the motor evoked potential amplitude to TMS and this response is thought to reflect the engagement of LTP -like processes (Fricke et al., 2011) . However, when preceded at short interval by a second block of anodal tDCS, this effe ct is reversed, and a reduction in motor evoked potential amplitude (LTD -like effect) is observ ed Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, . These effects are interpreted to reflect homeostatic plasticity such that a period of high LTP formation (excitation) causes the synaptic t hreshold to f avour the induction of LTD. Although a range of non -invasive brain stimulation techniques h ave been used to examine homeostatic plasticity in the human M1 (Karabanov et & emann & Sieb ner, 2008) , only one study has examined the reliability of the homeostatic response over time (Thapa & Schabrun, 2018) . That study demonstrated that two blocks of anodal tDCS can reliably induce M1 homeostatic p lasticity at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks in healthy individuals, supporting the use of this measure in the present study. 4.5.2 Homeostatic plasticit y and pain A wide range of neuronal inputs are known to result in the inductio n of LTP - and LTD - like synaptic plasticity (Classen et al., 2004; Stefan et al., 2000) . Despite this, the impact of sustained periods of pain on homeostatic mechanisms that regulate synaptic plasticity is Chapter 4 138 unknown. Preliminary s tudies in animal models of central pain syndrome (Wang & Thompson, 2008) and neuropathic pain (Xiong et al., 2017) suggest a l ink between pain - induced hyperalgesia and altered homeostatic plasticity. In humans, studies of pain and homeostatic plasticity are restricted to patient populations with migraine (Antal et al., 2008b; Bri ghina et et al., 2005; Cosentino et al., 2014b) and chronic low back pain (Thapa et al., 2018a) . These studies report altered M1 homeostatic plasticity that is hypothesised to contribute to excessive cortic al excitability, enlarged cortical representations , and symptoms in these conditions. Notably , cyclic impairments in homeostatic control are associated with the initiation, continuation , and termination of pain in migraine patients (Antal et al., 2008b; Cosentino et al., 2014a; Cosentino et al., 2014b) . However, where in the transition from acute to chronic pain altered homeostatic plasticity develops has not been investigated. The current study is the first to exa mine whether sustained pain impacts the M1 homeostatic response. Repeated intra -muscular injection of NGF sensitises muscle nociceptors and dorsal horn neurons (Hoheisel et al., 2007) resulting in pain and dysfunct ion that mimic symptoms of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions (Andersen et al., 2008) . For example , inject ion of NGF in duce s comparable pain, hyperalgesia , and functional limitation to patients with chronic lateral elbow pain of ~26 weeks duration (Bergin et al. , 2015) . Using this model , the present data provide the first evidence that Chapter 4 139 several days of sustained pain is sufficient to alter the M1 homeostatic response. Consistent with studies in chronic migraine, t he temporal p rofile of the altered homeostatic r esponse mimicked the trajectory of pain development. Specifically, two days of sustained muscle pain altered the M1 homeostatic response, with the greatest disturbance in homeostatic control observed around t he time of gr eatest pain severity. As pain resol ved, so too did the alteration in homeostatic plasticity, returning to normal at day 14 (see Figure 4.4). The functional relevance of altered homeostatic plasticity in response to several days of sustained m uscle pain re quires further investigation. One p ossibility is that altered homeostatic plasticity in the early stages of pain represents an adaptive response that prevents memory encoding of pain -driven synaptic patterns of activity. Evidence from human an d animal stud ies suggest that high levels of LTP , as would be expected if homeostatic mechanisms fail to bias synaptic thresholds toward LTD, impairs subsequent learning (Kang et al., 2011; Rioult -Pedotti et al., 20 00). For exa mple, the learning of a motor skill in humans re sults in high LTP formation that has been shown to interfere with the learning of subsequent motor skills (Shadmehr & Brashers -Krug, 1997) . Similarly, spatial learning is impaired following high leve ls of hippoca mpal LTP in animals (Moser et al., 1998) . Some support for this hypothesis can be drawn from studies that report impaired motor learning in people wi th acute (Sterling et al., 2001) , and chronic pain (Boudreau et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2011) . Alternatively, it is tempting to speculate that Chapter 4 140 altered homeostatic plasticity represents an impairment that if maintained over weeks to months (i.e. when pain does not resolve as expected) allows consolidation of maladaptive patterns of synaptic p lastici ty that underpin sensorimotor symptoms and dysfunction in clinical conditions. Indeed, studies in writer's cramp suggest that prolonged periods of afferent input in the absence of effective homeostatic control lead to excessive synaptic strengthenin g that consolidates unwanted movement patterns (Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone & Pisani, 2011) . In the context of chronic musculoskeletal pain, movement dysfunction has been hypothesised to contribute t o chronicity of symptoms by altering the load on surroun ding tissues, presumably resulting in a prolonged alteration of afferent input (Hodges, 2011; Hodges & Tucker, 2011) . In the present study, homeostatic plas ticity was ex amined using an excitatory priming protocol only. This approach was selected as previous studies in chronic pain have reported impaired M1 homeostatic plasticity characterised by a failure to reduce the MEP amplitude (slide the threshold towar ds LTD -like e ffects) following two blocks of excitatory anodal tDCS (Antal et al., 2008b; Kang et al., 2011) . Further research is required to understand the impact of sustained pain on homeostatic mechanisms induce d using inhib itory priming protocols. In addition, the administration of th e double tDCS protocol to elicit a homeostatic response and the implementation of TMS to assess this response was conducted by the same assessor from a previous test retest reliabil ity study including these Chapter 4 141 techniques but involving the hand muscle (Thapa & Schabrun, 2018) . Future studies will need to establish intra - and inter -session reliability of the operator with assistance from individualised T1 s cans and Brai nsight to extend current findings whilst taking into account the capacity for plasticity when targeting painful and non -painful muscle groups (Chen et al., 1998) . Further, w hile the implementation of t he double tDC S protocol is in line with previous studies, the use of 5 x 7 cm2 electrodes may have resulted in current spread to brain areas close to the M1. Use of high definition tDCS in future studies can help locali se tDCS effects and homeostatic regul ation to spec ific brain regions . Lastly, the impact of sustained pain on homeostatic plasticity in other brain regions known to play a key role in pain perception (i.e. primary somatosensory cortex, inhibitory networks was not investigated in the current study. Further work is needed to comprehensively disentangle the influence of sustained pain on homeostatic plasticity in humans. 4.6 Conclusion This study provides unique insight in to the influen ce of progressively developing, sustained muscle pain on homeostatic plasticity in the human M1. Impaired homeostatic plasticity developed in parallel with the pain trajectory - manifesting after two days of sustained pain and returning towar d baseline as pain resolved at day 14. Altered homeostatic control could plausibly explain the aberrant synaptic plasticity reported in Chapter 4 142 chronic pain and may contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition, providing new insight into the maladaptive plasti city hypothesi s in chronic pain. 143 Chapter 5: General discussion The primary aim of the thesis was to explore the effect of pain, using an experimental pain model and a clinical chronic musculoskeletal pain population, on home ostatic plast icity in the human primary motor cortex . This chapter provides a discussion of findings from all three studies, with novel insight into homeostatic plasticity in pain and directions for future research. Clinical implications, and limitations a re also discu ssed. Chapter 5 144 5.1. Contribution of the thesis to the body of evidence This thesis provides novel and original data on homeostatic plasticity, and the influence of pain on homeostatic regulation, in the human primary motor cortex (M1) . Although mechani sms that underpin neural change (i.e. synaptic plasticity) have been well characterised in healthy and clinical populations (Bear & Malenk a, 1994; Citri & Malenka, 2008) , homeostatic mechanisms un derpin neural stability have received limited attention (Karabanov et al., 2015) . In particular, how pain influence s homeostatic plasticity in the motor cortex , and whether disruption of homeostatic regulation contributes to th e clinical and neurophysiological manifestations of clinical pain syndromes is unknown. Understanding both sides of the neuroplasticity 'coin' ( i.e., change and stability) is essential to advance our knowledge of the healthy human brain an d of disease mech anisms underpinning a range of pathological conditions. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have been used to induce and assess homeostatic plasticity in the human brain (Karabanov et al., 2015; Zieman n et al., 2008) . Here, NIBS techniques are applied using a priming -test paradigm to elicit a homeostatic response. For example, successive application of anodal tDCS has been demonstrated to elicit a homeostatic response in the human M1, such that LTP -like plasticity (increased MEP amplitude) induced by a single block of anodal tDCS is reversed toward inhibi tion (decreased MEP amplitude) when preceded by an additional block of anodal tDCS (Fricke Chapter 5 145 et al., 2011) . Similarly , homeostatic plasticity has been following excitatory rTMS when primed by cathodal tDCS (Lang et al., 2004) . Despite the use of these protocols to investigate homeostatic plasticity in the healthy human brain in 26 previous studies, the reliabil ity of these techniques has not been established. To provide a foundation for the use of these techniques in longitudinal study designs and to advance an essential metric of homeostatic measurement in the human M1, study one of this thesis investigated the reliability of the homeostatic response induced by anodal tDCS in the M1 of healthy humans at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. This study demonstrated moderate -to-good test -retest reliability for the induction (using anodal tDCS) singl e-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation) of homeostatic plasticity in the hum an M1 over a two -week period . Although a number of studies have explored homeostatic plasticity in the healthy human brain, studies exploring homeostatic plasticit y in individu als with pathology are restricted to seven studies in neurological patients wit h writer's cramp, and chronic migraine (Karabanov et al., 2015) . The paucity of research , these studies su ggest impaire d homeostatic plasticity is associated with high M1 excitability, altered cortical reorganisation, increased pain perception, and sensorimotor dysfunction (Antal et al., 2008b; Cosentino et al., 2014b; Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005) . As similar clinical and neurophysiological manifestations are reported in individuals with chronic Chapter 5 146 musculoskeletal pain (Apkarian, 2011; Apkarian et Schabrun et 2016; Schabrun et al., 2017b; Tsao et al., 2011b; Tsao et al., 2008; Tsao et al., 2011c) , it is plausible that homeostatic plasticity may also be impaired in these individuals. To explore this hyp othesis, stud y two compared homeostatic regulation in the M1 of people with non -specific chronic low back pain (cLBP) and age- and sex-matched healthy, pain -free, individuals. This study demonstrated impaired homeostatic plasticity in the M1 of individuals with non -specific cLBP. The findings of study two provided unique insight into homeostatic plasticity in people with non-specific cLBP . However, these data raise a critical question: where in the transition from acute to chronic pain does impaired homeos tatic plastic ity develop? As previous studies on homeostatic plasticity in pathological populations have been cross - sectional in nature, no longitudinal data exist to inform this question. With this knowledge gap in mind, study three examined homeostatic p lasticity in the M1 as muscle pain, induced using an experimental pain model, developed, peaked, and resolved over 14 day s. This study provided the first evidence of altered M1 homeostatic plasticity, that developed in response to several days of sustained muscle pain and returned toward pre -pain values as pain resolved. Chapter 5 147 In summary, e ach of these studies provides an original contribution to the available body of evidence on homeostatic plasticity in the human M1 , and in particular, homeostatic regulation i n the presenc e of musculoskeletal pain. The following section provides a discussi on of the major findings arising from the studies presented in this thesis. 5.2. The induction and assessment of homeostatic plasticity in humans The basic mechanisms underp inning homeos tatic plasticity were initially identified in vitro Coope r et al., 1979; was investig ated using high and low frequency tetanic stimulation applied in a priming -test paradigm (Abbott & Nelson, 2000; 1996; Turrigiano, 2004; Turrigiano, Turrigiano & Nelson, 2000, Here, i nduction of long -term potentiation (LTP) and long -term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy was dependent on the activation history of a neural circuit, such that LTP or LTD was induced in the direction opposite to that observed following priming stimulat ion applied alone . Based on the principles of homeostatic plasticity identified in slice preparations, non - invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) paradigms have been developed to allow the investigation of homeostatic plasticity in humans (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller & Ziemann, 2015) . Techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Chapter 5 148 transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and paired associative stimulation (PAS) have been used to induce an d assess homeostatic plasticity in the human brain (Bliem et al., 2008; Fricke et al., 2011; Lang et 2004; Siebner or inhibitory forms of TMS, tDCS , and PAS are applied n -like changes opposite observed with priming stimulation applied alone. As TMS, tDCS, and PAS have been shown to be appropriate techniques to investigate homeo static plasti city in humans, 26 studies (see Table 1.2, and 1.3 in chapter one) have used these techni ques to induce and assess homeostatic plasticity in the human brain (Karabanov et al., 2015) . Although the major ity of these studies have demonstrated a homeostatic response following their chosen priming -test paradigm, only tDCS has been systematically explored to determine the appropriate stimulation duration and interval between the priming -and -test tDCS protoco ls to induce homeostatic plasticity the human M1 (Fricke et a l., 2011) . Importantly, there has been no investigation of reliability using any form of NIBS in the context of homeostatic plasticity Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . This i s essential i f longitudinal studies are to be carried out that comprehensively investigate homeostatic plasticity in humans . Chapter 5 149 Study one addressed the lack of reliability studies in the field of homeostatic plast icity. Using two blocks of anodal tDCS to ind uce a homeost atic response in M1, s tudy one demonstrated moderate -to-good test -retest reliability in 10 healthy individuals across intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks (Thapa & Schabrun, 2018) . These findings are the first to estab lish the reliability of the homeostatic re sponse over two weeks, and provide a foundation for the longitudinal investigation of homeostatic plasticity in the human M1. However, as homeostatic plasticity was investigated only in one direction (i.e. response to excitatory stimulation ), further investigation using inhibitory forms of tDCS is needed to extend the se findings. In addition, future studies should seek to investigate the reliability of homeostatic plasticity elicited using other forms o f NIBS techni (i.e., rTMS, and PAS) . Notably , test -retest reliability in study one indicates homeostatic plasticity elicited using the double tDCS protocol has a certain degree of variability . Indeed, all three studies in this thesis demonstrated some level of inter -individual variability in homeostatic plasticity following the double tDCS protocol (Figure 5.1A and B). For instance, approximately 90 % of participants (n = 10) demonstrated a norm al homeostatic response following the do uble tDCS pro tocol in study one (Figure 5.2) , while approximately 72 % (n = 25) of the total sample demonstrated homeostatic regulation following the double tDCS protocol in study two (Figure 5.3) . Similar findings were Chapter 5 150 observed in study three , where 7 6 % of all partic ipants (n= 21) responded to the double tDCS protocol (Figure 5. 3). Together, these data demonstrate variability in homeostatic plasticity elicited using the double in homeostatic response follo wing the doub le tDCS protocol may be explained by the low number of responders and non -responders previously reported in tDCS studies (Datta et al., 2012; Horvath et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015) . On average, studies report less than 64 % of the total sample respond to either anodal or cathodal tDCS applied alone (Chew et al., 2015; Horvath et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Lopez -Alonso et al., 2015) . This indicates response to t DCS applied a lone is considerably low , and such reports may in-turn explain variability in homeostatic regulation following the double tDCS protocol in chapter two, three , and four. Further research exploring the implications of inter -individual variabilit y in homeosta tic regulation is warranted in healthy and cli nical populations. Chapter 5 151 Figure 5.1.

The 'pain' group represents data collected from individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain in study two, and data obtained on the day of highest pain intensity (Day 4) in study three. The 'control' group represents data obtained from healthy, pain -free, individual s in study one, study two, and study three on Day 0. Responders to the first block of anodal tDCS were defined as individuals who demonstrated an increase in MEP amplitude, while responders to the second block of anodal tDCS were defined as individuals who demonstrated a decrease in MEP amplitude (homeostatic response) . Individuals who contradicted the definition of responders to the first and second block anodal tDCS were classified as non -responders. 152 Figure 5.2.

Homeostatic regulation and musculoskeletal pain Traditionally, musculoskeletal pain was thought to fit a structural -pathology model where pain was correlated linearly with tissue integrity, and vice -versa (Chen, 2011; et al., Moseley, 2007; Perl, 2007) . An essential feature of this model was the idea that as tissue healed, pain would subside. In the case of chronic musculosk eletal pain, where credible explanation for pain perception was lacking (i.e. when there was no evidence of structural pathology or tissue damage ), or when pain had persisted beyond acce pted tissue healing times, the condition was classified as psychiatric (Clarke & Iphofen, 2005; Glenton, 2003; Newton et al., 2013; Richardson, 2005; Werner & Malterud, 2003) . However, over the last few decades a dramatic increase in our understanding of synaptic plasticity within the central ner vous system, and its relationship to pain perception , has challenged the traditional view of chronic musculoskeletal pa in as a psychiatric condition (Chen, 2011; Melzack & Wall, 1965; Moseley, 2007; Per l, 2007) . It is now well accepted that pain does not always equate to or involve tissue damage (Moseley, 2003; Moseley, 2007; Moseley & Flor, 2012) . The example of dissociation between pain and tissue d amage can be observed in individuals with chronic osteoarthritis (OA) (Bedson & Croft, 2008; Finan et al., . Chronic OA is a well -established peripheral musculoskeletal condition characteri sed by progre ssive cartilage loss, ligament derangement, muscular impairments, and synovial inflammation Chapter 5 155 (Braun & Gold, 2012; Glyn -Jones et al., 2015; Hunter, 2011; 2012) . However, despite clear periph eral changes, studies report a weak relationship between pain intensity and radiographic abnormalities (Bedson & Croft, 2008; Finan et al., 2013; N eogi et al., 2015) . For example, chronic knee OA patients with less pronounced radiographic abnormalities report higher levels of pain intensity when compared to those with moderate to severe radiographic abnormalities (Finan et al., 2013) . Similarly, individuals with cLBP report high levels o f pain and disability despite radiographic abnormalities akin to those of healthy, asymptomatic persons (Chou et al., 2009; Chou et al., 2011; Jarvik et al., 2001; Jensen et al., 1994; van Tulder et al. , 1997) . These findings suggest that pain is not always associated wi th tissue pathology. M aladaptive changes to synaptic plasticity within the central nervous system have instead been suggested to explain this incongruence between pain and tissue patholo gy (Finan et al., & Schneider, 2016; Neogi et al., 2015) . There has been some investigation of maladaptive synaptic plasticity within the central nervous system in individua ls with muscu loskeletal pain (Baliki et al., 2011; Cauda et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2017; Flor et al., 1997; Lloyd et al., 2008; Strutton et al., 2003; Strutton et al., 2005; Tsao et al., 2011b; Tsao et al., 2010; Tsao et al., 2008) . These studies suggest maladaptive changes to synaptic plasticit y characterised by cortical reorganisation, and altered brain morphometry are present in subjects with musculoskeletal pain conditions. Chapter 5 156 For example, a 2.5 cm shift in the s omatotopic re presentation of back muscles in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is interpreted to indicate maladaptive synaptic plasticity within the central nervous system in i ndividuals with low back pain (Flor et al., 1997 ; Lloyd et al., 2008) . These findings are extended by decreased S1, brainstem, and prefrontal gray matter volume shown to correlate with symptom chronicity in cLBP (Apkarian et al., 2004; Schmidt -Wilck e et al., 200 6). Similar findings have been reported in individuals with carpel tunnel syndrom e, where loss in spatially discrete representations of digits two and three in the contralateral S1 (Maeda et al., 2013; Napadow et a l., 2006; Tinazzi et al., 1998) and decreased S1 gray matter density (Maeda et al., 2013) was shown to correlate with reduc ed median nerve conduction velocity. Somatotopic reorganisation in the S1 and reduced medi an nerve conduction velocity have been shown to have a role in pain perception in individuals with carpel tunnel syndrome (Maeda et al., 2013; Tecchio et al., 2 002). Together, these findings support th e maladaptive synaptic plasticity hypothesis in musculoskeletal pain, and suggest maladaptive changes to synaptic plasticity within the central nervo us system may contribute to pain perception , and symptom chronicity in individuals with musculoskeletal pai n conditions . Despite this, the mechanisms that underpin maladaptive synaptic plasticity and the link to the development and persistence of musculoskeletal pain are unknown. Chapter 5 157 Synaptic plasticity provides a mechanism for learning and change in the human bra in through t he bidirectional modulation of synaptic strength, such that a synapse can undergo both strengthening (long -term potentiation; LTP) and weakening (long -term depression; LTD) (Joseph, 2013) . However, syna ptic plastici ty relies o n a positive feedback loop that left unrestrained, would lead to excessive synaptic strengthening or weakening and unstable neural function. In the healthy brain, homeostatic plasticity ensures synaptic activity is maintained within a functional range by s hifting the threshold for LTP and LTD based on activity in the postsynaptic neuron (Karabanov et al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Ziemann, 2015) . For example, high ongoing postsynaptic activity will lead to reduced thresholds for LTD, and increased thresholds for LTP , while low ongoing postsynaptic activity will lead to reduced thresholds of LTP, and increased thresholds fo r LTD (Bienenstock et al., 1982) . In this way , homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are argued to prevent excess ive synaptic strengthening and weakening in the human brain when exposed to exten ded periods of high LTP or LTD activity . Given that synaptic plasticity must be carefully controlled, a disturbance in homeostatic plasticity could plausibly play a role in maladaptive changes to synaptic plasticity observed in individuals w ith musculosk eletal pain . Indeed, the role of homeostatic plasticity during musculoskeletal pain is supported by observations of impaired homeostatic regulation in writer's cramp and chron ic migraine , with authors hypothesising that this impairment Chapter 5 158 could c ontribute to observations of altered synaptic plasticity and clinical symptoms. For example, when exposed to high levels of post -synaptic activity (indexed as an increase in MEP amplitude to TMS) induced using a tDCS or als with writ er's cramp and chronic migraine did not display the reduction in excitability (index ed as a decrease in MEP amplitude to TMS) typically observed in healthy individuals (Antal et al., 2008b; Cosentino et al., 2014b; Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005) . The se observations were later correlated with symptom severity, suggesting an association between homeostatic impairment and uncontrolled muscle activity in individuals with writer's cramp (Quartarone & Pisani, 2011; Quartarone et recurrence in chronic migraineurs (Brighina et al., 2011; Brighina et al., writer's cramp support the potential relevance of homeostatic plasticity to musculoskeletal pain and to contemporary theories of pain persistence that centre on maladaptive synaptic plas ticity (Mos eley & Flor, 2012) , these findings are not without limitations. A major limitation is that impaired homeostatic plasticity has been observed only in t wo studies in individuals with writer's cramp and in seven studies in chronic migr aineurs, with sample sizes ranging from eight to 14 participants in each study . Further, the absence of a sample size calculation in any previous study could indicate Type I error , where homeostatic impairment observed in the Chapter 5 159 study population may not truly exist in the wider patient population (Cohen, To address these limitations, studies included in this thesis explored homeostatic regulat ion during musculoskeletal pain in samples informed by appropriat e sample size calculations . These calculations included conservative effect size estimates of 0.4 to quantify the size of the homeostatic response in healthy individuals and those with musc 2001) , an alpha of 0.05 to false positives (Devane et al., 2004; Gogtay, 2010; Karlsson et al., 20 03), and a power of 0.8 to determine a homeostatic response when one truly exists (Cohen, 1992; Jones et al., 2003; Lieber, 1990) . Data arising from this thesis show that homeostati c plasticity was impaired in 50 individuals suffering from non-specific cLBP (mean \u00b1 standard deviation for musculoskeletal pain duration: 12 \u00b1 14 years) when compared with 25 age-and -sex matched healthy, pain -free, controls (Thapa et al., 2018b) . This is characterised by a f ailure to reduce excessive increases in M1 excitability (ind exed using ME P amplitudes) in individuals with non-specific cLBP following the double tDCS protocol. Study three extends these findings using an identical do uble tDCS protocol that Study 1 showed to be reliable over 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks (Thapa & Schabrun, 2018) . Here, homeostatic plasticity was impaired in the very early stage of sustained pain (within 2 days of pain Chapter 5 160 onset). One interpretation of these data is that impaired homeostatic plasticity arises early in the transition to sustained pain , and in a proportion of people does not resolve , contributing to the development of chronic musculoskeletal pain. This interpretation is supported by impaired homeostatic regulation in chronic migraineurs, where failure to regulate high lev els of LTP -like plasticity is hypothesised to lead to a build -up of cortical excitability, facilitating recurrence of migraine attacks (Cosentino et al., 2014b) . Therefore, it is possible that failure to resolve ho meostatic impairment during the early stage of musculosk eletal pain may lead to increased levels of LTP -like plasticity that facilitate symptom recurrence, and consequently symptom persistence . Further studies are needed to test these hypothes es. Alter natively, change in homeostatic regulation during the ea rly stages of pain onset could imply an adaptive process where homeostatic regulation accommodates to pain onset to prevent pain -driven changes to synaptic plasticity. This hypothesis is in line with studies that have demonstrated high levels of M1 excitab ility prevent subsequent motor learning (Amadi et al., 2015; Jung & Ziemann, 2009; Ziemann et al., 2004) . For example, repeated fast thumb abduct ion that incr eases M1 excitability was shown to occlude the effects of a succeeding excitatory PAS protocol to the M1 (Elahi et al., 2014; Rosenkranz et al., 2007) . Similarly, increase in M1 excitability following task performa nce was occluded when preceded by anodal tDCS (Amadi et al., 2015) . Together, these studies suggest homeostatic Chapter 5 161 plasticity fluctuates in response to afferent input, and altered homeostatic regulation d uring pain on set may represent an adaptive process that aims to prevent pain -driven changes to synaptic activity. A critic al observation in Study 2 was that , impairment in homeostatic plasticity was not restricted to the cortical representations of the mu scles clinica lly affected by low back pain but was observed in the cortical representations of the 'unaffected' hand muscles. However, in study three, impaired homeostatic p lasticity was observed in the cortical representation of the painful muscle. Althou gh not direct ly measured, these observations could suggest that impaired homeostatic plasticity is global when pain is chronic, but localised when pain is acute. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous literature in chronic musculoskeletal pain has shown widespread c hanges to brain areas outside the region of pain (Apkarian, 2011; Apkarian et al., 2009; Apkarian et al., 2011; May, 2008) , while acute pain has been shown to involve brain regions corresponding only t o the painful muscle (Schabrun et al., 2015a; Schabrun et al., 2013) . In addition , previous studies in pathological populations that share clinical symptoms of pain and sensorimotor dysfunction demonstrate impaired homeostatic plasticity in cortical areas associated with and without pain (Antal et al., 2008b; Brighina et al., 2011; Brighina 2005; Quartarone et al., 2008) . Together , these data suggest widespread and l ocal changes to brain areas following chronic or acute pain may explain the global and local impairment in homeostatic Chapter 5 162 regulatio n observed in individuals with non -specific cLBP in study two, and in individuals experiencing experimentally induced sustained muscle pain i n study three. Future studies should seek to directly compare homeostatic plasticity during the acute and chronic stage of pain in cortical areas corresponding to the affected and unaffected muscle using crossover trials . Notably, pain intens ity was not c orrelated with the magnitude of homeostatic impairment in the M1 of individuals with non -specific cLBP. One explanation is that pain intensity is a subjective measure that depends on a number of factors including threat value, and previous exp & et al., 2004; Okifuji & Ackerlind, 2007; Wang et al., 2009) . Therefore, it is perhaps not surprising that object ive physiolog ical measures of homeostatic plasticity did not correlate with subjective measures of pain intensity in study two. More holistic measures of pain intensity such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire may provide a better understanding of the relatio nship between homeostatic regulation and pain in future (Hawker et al., 2011; Melzack, 2005; Waldman, 2009) . Alternatively, there is increasing evidence that the relationship between pain and tissue damage becomes less clear when pain is chronic (Bedson & Croft, 2018; Lluch et al., 2014) . This is explained Chapter 5 163 by numerous factors such as treatment and medication history (Ernstzen et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2012; Hunter, 2001) , modi fiable and non -modifiable lifestyle factors (Docking et al., 2011; Elliott et al., 1999; van Hecke et a l., 2013) , pain perception 2015; Jensen, 2010; Wijma Gorczyca et al., 2013; Innes, 2005; Keefe et al., 2004) which have been shown to explain the chronic pain experience. Therefore, it is possible t hat the relationship between homeostatic plasticity and pain is clearer during the early stages of pain development (Figure 4.4 in study three) as opposed to when pain in chronic . Further studies are needed to explore homeostatic plasticity during the different stages of pain development and persistence in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders . Thus, taken together, the novel findings from this thesis suggests tha t two days of sustained pain is sufficient to alter homeostatic regulation, that thi s alteration worsens as pain is sustained, returns to normal when pain resolves, and is impaired relative to healthy controls when pain has persisted for more than 6 months . These findings expand our understanding of the maladaptive synaptic plasticity hyp othesis in musculoskeletal pain and make an important contribution to the field by providing a foundation for comprehensive longitudinal investigation of homeo static plasti city in healthy and clinical populations . Chapter 5 164 5.4. Clinical implications The rapid increase in therapies designed to target maladaptive synaptic plasticity in chronic musculoskeletal pain make the present findings highly relevant (Moseley & Flor, 2012; O'Connell et al., 2010; Pelletier et al., 2015) . These findings suggest that impaired homeostatic plasticity could be important in the development and persistence of musculoskeletal pain, and if relevance of this mecha nism to clinical outcome is confirmed in future longitudinal trials, homeostatic plasticity could be a viable treatment target in the future. At present, r elatively few therapies have been designed to directly target homeostatic plasticity. For example , patterned peripheral electrical stimulatio n applied to reduce cortical excitability (induce synaptic weakening; LTD) in writer's cramp has been shown to improve cortical organisation and reduce symptoms (Schabrun et al., 2009a) . Similarly, priming of M1 using high -frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; 10 Hz) prior rTMS cortical (Brighina et 2010) , and priming the M1 to induce synaptic weakening using periphe ral electrical stimulation concurrent wit h an excitato ry non - invasive brain stimulation intervention in cLBP improves cortical organisation and pain beyond that of either intervention applied alone (Schabrun et al., 2017a) . Although further work is needed , these findi ngs suggest that priming the cortex to alter the threshold for Chapter 5 165 synaptic plasticity (i.e., LTP - LTD formation) prior to a sec ond treatment may be a useful approach that can promote normal homeostatic plasticity in pain. Potential therapies to target homeos tatic plasticity are an area for future research that could help address the urgent need for more effective treatments in chr onic musculoskeletal pain conditions. 5.5. Limitations The limitations of individual studies have been mentioned and discussed in chapters two, three, and four. Therefore, the following section discusses limitations associated with the overarching framework of this thesis. First, work presented in this thesis is limited to homeostatic plasticity elicited in one directio n only. This approach was selected as previous studies exploring homeostatic plasticity in clinical populations have de monstrated failure to reduce high levels of cortical excitability (Antal et al., 2008b; Cosentin o et al., 201 4b; Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005) . However, a s homeostatic plasticity is bidirectional, and dependent upon the activation history of a neural circuit , it is possible that similar impairments exist following high levels of cortic al inhibition (Karabanov al., 2015; Muller -Dahlhaus & Zi emann, 2015) . Future studies should extend the work presented in this thesis using inhibitory NIBS techniques . Chapter 5 166 Second, findings of this thesis are limite d to M1. As p revious studies have demonstrated impaired homeostatic plasticity in cortical regions outside the M1 (Bocci et al., 2014; Brighina et al., 2002; Hamada et al., 2008; al., 2013; Potter -Nerger et al., 2009; Ragert et al., 2009) , and musculoskeletal pain has been shown to involve widespread changes across a variety of brain regions (Apkarian, 2011; Apkarian et al., 2009; Apkarian et al., 2011; Baliki et al., 2011; May, 2 008), it is possible that impai red homeostatic plasticity may be generalised throughout the cortex. Future studies are needed to explore homeostatic plasticity locally and globally within and between, different cortical regions in people with musculoskele tal pain. Third, the work presented in this thesis is limited to one clinical musculoskeletal pain condition i.e., non-specific cLBP . A growing body of evidence has demonstrated altered synaptic plasticity characterised by increased pain perc eption, and m otor dysfunct ion in a variety of chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions including chronic osteoarthritis (Fingleton et al., 2015; Kittelson et al., 201 4; al., 2014; Shanahan et al., 2015) , patellofemoral pain (Jensen et al., 2008; Te et al., 2017) , and chronic neck pain (Curatolo et al., 2001; Freeman et al., 2009; Sterling et al., 2004; Van Oosterwijck et al., 2013) . It is therefore possible that homeostatic plasticity is impaired in other chronic musculoskeletal pain c onditions and this requires on -going investigation in other studies. Chapter 5 167 Fourth , spinal mechanisms known to be altered during musculoskeletal pain have not bee n accounted for in th is thesis. As previous studies have demonstrated altered spinal excitability contributes to the pathophysiology and clinical presentations seen in musculoskeletal pain (Banic et al. , 2004; D'Mello & Dickenson, 2008 ), it is possible that spinal mechanisms may have contribute d to impaired homeostatic plasticity in study two and study three . The role spinal mechanisms play during homeostati c regulation in individuals with musculoskeletal pain requires further exploration through neurophysiological measures of spinal excitability . Fifth, while altered homeostatic plasticity in study two and study three suggest pain when acute, sustained or chronic influ ence homeostatic regulation differently, no direct comparison of homeostatic regulation in cortical areas corresponding to the affected and unaffected muscle s limits these conclusions . Future studies should look to compare homeostatic plastici ty in cortica l areas corresponding to the affected and unaffected muscles within the same individual to extend findings presented herein . Finally, the investigator was not blind ed to group allocation during data collection and analyses. Investigator blind ing reduces t he risk of bias, and improves internal validity (Day & Altman, 2000; Page & Persch, 2013) . Therefore, to improve data accuracy and to extend the work presented in this thesis, future studies should imp lement invest igator blinding Chapter 5 168 during data collection and analysis (Eldridge et al., 2008; Emanuel et al., 2000; Page & Persch, 2013) . 5.6. Conclusion This thesis provides the first evidence for the reliability of homeostatic plasticity in healthy individuals across two weeks, and for altered homeostatic plasticity in response to pain, using a chronic musculoskeletal pain population and an experimental pain model. Impaired homeo static plasticity in individuals with non-specific cLBP may reflect an inability to counter excessive increases in M1 excitability , while altered homeostatic responses following experimentally induced sustained muscle pain in otherwise healthy individuals suggest homeostatic plasticity is dis turbed after two days of pain, although whether this is an adaptive or a maladaptive mechanism remains unclear. However, these data have relevance for understanding the maladaptive synaptic plasticity hypothesis previou sly reported in musculoskeletal pain conditions. Together, t hese studies provide novel data and extend the field of homeostatic plasticity during musculoskeletal pain. However, further wo rk using longitudinal study designs in clinical populations is required to advance the work presented herein. Future st udies should also examine homeostatic plasticity using similar and / or other NIBS techniques to extend work presented in this thesis. Lastly, if shown to underpin development and persistence of musculoskeletal pain, studies could test Chapter 5 169 novel t herapeutic ap proaches that target homeostatic , rathe r plasticity mechanisms , to improve treatment efficacy , and patient responsiveness to therapy.

Homeostatic plasticity regulates synaptic activity by preventing uncontrolled increases (long-term potentiation) or decreases (long- term depression) in synaptic e cacy. Homeostatic plasticity can be induced and assessed in the human primary motor cortex (M1) using noninvasive brain stimulation. However, the reliability of this methodology has not been investigated. Here, we examined thetest-retest reliability of homeostatic plasticity induced and assessed in M1 using noninvasive brain stimulation in ten, right-handed, healthy volunteers on days 0, 2, 7, and 14. Homeostatic plasticity was induced in the left M1 using two blocks of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for 7 min and 5 min, separated by a 3 min interval. To assess homeostatic plasticity, 15motor-evoked potentials to single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded at baseline, between the two blocks ofanodal tDCS, and at 0 min, 10 min, and 20 min follow-up. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlationcoecients (ICCs). reliability was observed for the M1 homeostatic plasticity response at all follow-up time points (0 min, 10 min, and 20 min, ICC range: 0.43 -0.67) at intervals up to 2 weeks. The greatest reliability was observed when the homeostatic response was assessed at 10 min follow-up ( ICC > 0 61). These data suggest that M1 homeostatic plasticity can be reliably induced and assessed in healthy individuals using two blocks of anodal tDCS at intervalsof 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. 1. Introduction Synaptic plasticity is fundamental to learning and memory in the human brain. However, synaptic plasticity operates via apositive feedback loop and, as a result, has the potential to destabilise neural networks through excessive synaptic strengthening (long-term potentiation-like e LTP) or excessive synaptic weakening (long-term depression-likeeects, LTD) [1]. To avoid destabilization, LTP-like and LTD-like changes are subject to homeostatic plasticity mech-anisms that maintain the neural activity within an optimalphysiological range. Homeostatic plasticity is theorised to rely on the \"sliding threshold \"rule, such that the threshold for the induction of LTP or LTD is dependent on the activity in the postsynapticneuron; high postsynaptic activity favors LTD, whereas lowpostsynaptic activity favors [2 -4]. Although early stud- ies investigating homeostatic plasticity occurred in slice prep-arations in vitro, a growing body of research has usednoninvasive brain stimulation to investigate this mechanismin the human cortex [2 -8]. Typically, one noninvasive brain stimulation protocol is used to \"prime \"(or condition) the synaptic e ects of a stimula- tion protocol, and LTP-like and LTD-like e are indexed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For example,when a 5 min block of anodal transcranial direct currentstimulation (tDCS) is preceded at a short interval (3 min)by an additional 7 min block of anodal tDCS, the LTP-like(facilitatory) e ect of anodal tDCS on the primary motor cor- tex (M1) is reversed toward LTD (observed as a reduction in Hindawi Neural Plasticity Volume 2018, Article ID 6207508, to TMS) [9]. Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimula-tion (rTMS) paradigm (that has no overt e ect on corticomotor excitability when applied alone) with anodaltDCS produces LTD-like (inhibitory) whereas (facilita-tory) e ects [10]. has been used to evaluate homeostatic plasticity in M1 in pathological conditions including focal hand dystonia, migraine, and chronic pain [11-14]. These studies demonstrate the impaired homeo- static control in these populations such that the thresholdfor synaptic plasticity fails to favor the induction of LTDwhen postsynaptic activity is high. For instance, in individ-uals with focal hand dystonia, a single block of anodal tDCSincreases the corticomotor excitability consistent with theresponse observed in healthy controls. However, the applica-tion of a subsequent block of 1 Hz rTMS fails to reverse thecorticomotor excitability toward LTD in this population[15]. Additional studies have provided evidence of paradoxi-cal facilitation in both the visual cortex and M1 of individuals with migraine, observed as an increase in visual cortex and M1 excitability in response to 1 Hz rTMS (in contrast to areduction in the excitability of in healthycontrols) [16, 17]. Studies comparing M1 homeostatic plasticity between healthy individuals and those with pathology have beenlimited to cross-sectional designs, despite conditions suchas migraine and low back pain being cyclical in nature[12, 14]. To allow the longitudinal evaluation of homeostaticplasticity, as well as the detailed evaluation of the relationshipbetween impaired homeostatic plasticity and symptomstatus, it is necessary to determine whether homeostatic plas- ticity can be reliably induced and assessed over time. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the reliability of M1homeostatic plasticity. Here we aimed to determine thetest-retest reliability of M1 homeostatic plasticity, inducedand assessed using noninvasive brain stimulation, at intervalsof 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. 2. Methods and Materials 2.1. Subjects. As no previous multiday studies of homeostatic plasticity exist, a sample size calculation was performed using best available data of MEP amplitudes recorded from healthy individuals at 0, 10, and 20 minutes following an identicaldouble tDCS protocol used to induce and assess homeostaticplasticity in M1 (e ect size estimates of 0.4, alpha of 0.05, and power of 0.8) [14]. Using these parameters, ten participantswere required to evaluate the test-retest reliability of nonin-vasive brain stimulation to induce and assess M1 homeostaticplasticity at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks.Accordingly, ten right-handed, healthy volunteers ( mean \u00b1 standard deviation age: 23 \u00b15 years, 5 males) were recruited. Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh handedness questionnaire [18]. All participants were required to meet inclusion criteria as per transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) safety guidelines (i.e., no history of epilepsy, absenceof metal implants in the skull) [19]. Individuals with a historyof neurological, musculoskeletal, upper limb or psychiatricconditions were excluded. A verbal and written descriptionof the experimental procedures was provided to all partic-ipants. Written, informed consent was obtained beforetesting. The study was approved by the institutionalHuman Research Ethics Committee (approval number:H10184) and performed in accordance with the Declarationof Helsinki. 2.2. Experimental Protocol. Based on intervals used in previ- ous TMS reliability studies [20], corticomotor excitability was assessed, and plasticity was induced in M1, on day 0, 2,7, and 14. Participants were seated comfortably with theirright hand and arm at rest for each test session. To evaluatethe change in corticomotor excitability across days, 15motor-evoked potentials were recorded at 120% ofresting motor threshold (rMT) at the beginning of each testsession. To account for any potential changes in the cortico-motor excitability occurring across days that could in fluence the homeostatic response and to ensure a baseline level of corticomotor excitability that was consistent between indi- viduals immediately prior to homeostatic plasticity induc-tion, further recorded of homeostatic plasticity (time point \"base- line\") at an intensity su cient to evoke an average MEP of 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude (S 1mV).This methodology is standard plasticity [3, 4] .Homeo- static plasticity was induced in M1 using two blocks of anodaltranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for7 min and 5 min, respectively and separated by a 3 min restperiod ( \"double tDCS protocol \"). This protocol has been previously to induce homeostatic plasticity in humanM1 [9, 14]. The corticomotor tDCSwas monitored by recording 15 MEPs at S 1mVduring the 3 min rest period between the two tDCS blocks (time point\"between \"), and at 0 min, 10 min, and 20 min follow-ups (see Figure 1). The number of MEPs was selected based onprevious studies that have demonstrated good-to-excellentreliability when 15 MEPs are used to assess the corticomotorexcitability within and between sessions [21 -25]. 2.3. Assessment of Corticomotor Excitability. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic (TMS) was delivered using a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim Co., Ltd., Dyfed, UK) and a standard 70 mm gure-of-eight coil. The coil was held over the left hemisphere, at a 45 \u00b0angle to the sagittal plane to induce current in the posterior-anterior direction. The opti-mal coil position was determined by systematically movingthe coil in 1 cm increments and locating the site that evokedthe maximum response at the lowest stimulator intensityfrom the relaxed pollicis brevis (APB) muscle(termed A soft-tip pen was used to mark the hotspot to allow accurate coil and tDCS electrode reposi-tioning within and between testing sessions. Participants were requested to precisely remark their hotspot using a mir- ror and a soft-tipped pen or, if required, with assistance froma second person, on the days they did not attend the labora-tory for testing. Surface electromyography was recorded2 Neural electrodes (Ag-AgCl, Noraxon electrodes, interelectrode distance: 2.0 cm) placed in a belly-tendon montage over the relaxed APB muscle [9, 11, 15].The ground electrode was positioned over the ipsilateral olec-ranon. Raw EMG signals ampli ed (1000 times), ltered at 20-1000 Hz, and sampled at 2000 Hz (CED 1401 AD, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge,United Kingdom) using Signal software (CED, version5.08\u00d786). To evaluate the change in the corticomotor excitability across days, 15 motor-evoked potentials (MEP)were recorded at 120% of resting motor threshold at theAPB hotspot. The resting motor threshold (rMT) wasdened as the minimum TMS intensity required to elicit at leastveMEPs 50Vin ten consecutive trials from the resting APB muscle [26]. 2.4. Induction and Monitoring of M1 Synaptic Homeostatic ramp-controlled, constant current stimulator Ilmenau, Germany) delivered two blocks of excitatory,anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to theleft primary motor cortex (M1). The left M1 was targetedto control for hand dominance, as only right-handed individ-uals were included in this study. The rst anodal tDCS block lasted for 7 min, and the second, for 5 min. The two blockswere separated by a 3 min rest period. Rubber electrodes,placed in NaCl-soaked sponges (5 \u00d77 cm) were positioned over the hotspot corresponding to the right APB muscle(anode) as determined above and over the contralateralsupraorbital region (cathode). Electrodes were xed in posi- tion with two adjustable rubber straps. The current intensitywas ramped up (0 mA -1 mA) and down (1 mA -0 mA) over ten seconds at the start and end of stimulation [27]. Thesingle-pulse TMS was used to monitor the corticomotorexcitability in response to the rst and second blocks of anodal tDCS. This was achieved by setting the stimulatorintensity to S 1mV at the previously determined optimal scalp site. 2.5. Data Analysis. Data are presented as means and standard deviations (SD) in text, tables, and gures. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software for windows, version 22. The data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro- Wilk test. A one-way repeated measure ANOVA with the factor \"day\"(0, 2, 7, 14) was performed to compare (i) resting motor threshold, (ii) TMS intensity used to elicit S1mV, and (iii) corticomotor excitability (recorded at 120% rMT),between days. To examine the change in corticomotorresponse following the rst block of anodal tDCS across days, the amplitude of the MEP at time point \"between \"was calcu- lated as a proportion of \"and analysed using a one-way repeated measure ANOVA withthe factor \"day.\" To examine the change in the corticomotor response to the double tDCS protocol across days, the ampli-tude of the MEP at each of the follow-up time points (0 min,10 min, and 20 min) was calculated as a proportion of theMEP amplitude at time points \"baseline \"and \"between,\" and a one-way repeated measure ANOVAwith the factor \"day.\"This analysis was performed as the magnitude of the homeostatic response is likely to be depen-dent on the corticomotor excitability at \"baseline, \"and the amount of facilitation achieved following the rst block of anodal tDCS (i.e., time point \"between \"). Bonferroni post- hoc tests corrected for multiple comparisons were performedwhere appropriate. The Greenhouse-Geisser method wasused to correct for nonsphericity. E ect sizes from the one- way repeated measure ANOVA are reported using partialeta squared. Cohen 's benchmarks were used to de ne small (0.01), medium (0.06), and large e ect sizes (0.14) [28, 29]. An intraclass correlation coe cient model (ICC 3,k) was used to evaluate the test-retest reliability of (i) the restingmotor threshold, (ii) the TMS intensity used to elicit S 1mV, (iii) the corticomotor excitability (recorded at 120% rMT), (iv) the corticomotor response to the rst block of anodal tDCS, and (v) the corticomotor (homeostatic) response recorded at 0 min, 10 min, and 20 min after the second blockof anodal tDCS, across days 0, 2, 7, and 14. The ICC 3,kmodel was used to determine consistency between variablesacross days by accounting for xed eects from the rater and random e ects from and Homeostatic Plasticity inHealthy Individuals at Intervals of 48 Hours, 7 Days, and 2Weeks.

The corticomotor excitability was assessed at the beginning of each test session using 15 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded at120% of resting motor threshold. To ensure a consistent level of baseline corticomotor excitability across subjects prior to the induction of plasticity, further 15 MEPs were recorded at anintensity su cient to elicit an average MEP of 1 mV peak-to-peak amplitude (S 1mV) immediately before the rst block of 7 min anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This intensity was kept consistent for the remainder of the test session. Plasticity was induced using a 7 min block of anodal tDCS,followed by a second 5 min block of anodal tDCS, separated bya 3 min rest period. Fifteen MEPs were recorded at S 1mVbetween the two blocks of anodal tDCS, and at 0 min, 10 min, and20 min follow-ups.3 Neural PlasticityS1mV(F3,27=04,P=07, partial eta squared = 0 corticomotor excitability (assessed at 120% rMT, F2,16=04, P=06, partial eta squared = 0 05) between days (Table 1).

Similarly, the magnitude of the decrease in MEP amplitude following the second block of anodal tDCS was not di erent between days at all follow-up time points (corticomotor excitability at time points 0, 10, and 20 min calculated as aproportion of the MEP amplitude at time point \"baseline \"; 0 min: F 2,16=05,P=05, partial eta squared = 0 06; 10-min: F3,27=17,P=02, partial eta squared = 0 16; 20 min: F3,27=08,P=05, partial eta squared = 0 08; and corticomotor excitability at time points 0, 10, and 20 min cal-culated as a proportion of the MEP amplitude at time point\"between \"; 0-min: F 3,27=12,P=03, partial eta squared = 012; 10 min: F3,27=13,P=03, partial eta squared = 0 13; 20 min: F3,27=12,P=03, partial eta squared = 0 12; Figure 2). Small e ect sizes were observed for rMT (partial eta squared = 0 03), the TMS intensity used to elicit S1mV (partial eta squared = 0 04), the corticomotor excitability (assessed at 120% rMT, partial eta squared = 0 05), and the corticomotor response to the rst block of anodal tDCS (partial eta squared = 0 04). Medium-to-large e ect sizes were observed for homeostatic responses to the dou-ble tDCS protocol when normalised to \"baseline \"(0 min: partial eta squared = 0 06; 10 min: partial eta squared = 016; 20 min: partial eta squared = 0 08) and time point \"between \"(0 min: partial eta squared = 0 12; 10 min: partial etasquared = 0 13; 20 min: partial eta squared = 0 12). 3.2. Test-Retest Reliability. Excellent test-retest reliability was observed for rMT ( ICC = 0 92, 95% CI 0.76- 0.98; Table 1) and the TMS intensity used to elicit S1mV(ICC = 0 95, 95% CI 0.87-0.99; Table 1) across days. Moderate-to-good corticomotor excitability assessedat 95% CI 0.47 -0.94; Table 1). The corticomotor response to the rst block of anodal tDCS ( ICC = 0 41, 95% CI 0.72- 0.84; Table 1), and homeo- static responses to the double tDCS protocol at all follow-uptime points across days, demonstrated moderate-to-good-reliability when data were normalised to time point \"baseline \" (0 min: ICC = 0 58, 95% CI 0.01- 0.88; 10 min: ICC = 0 61, 95% CI 0.03-0.89; 20 min: ICC = 0 43, 95% CI 0.67-0.85; Table 1). Similarly, moderate-to-good-reliability was observedat all follow-up time points across days, when homeostaticresponses were normalised to time point \"between \" (0 min: ICC = 0 61, 95% CI 0.03- 0.89; 10 min: ICC = 0 67, 95% CI 0.12 -0.91; 20 min: ICC = 0 60, 95% CI 0.06-0.89; Table 1). The highest ICCs were observed for the homeostaticplasticity response recorded at 10 min follow-up across days,(normalised 67, 95% CI 0.12 -0.91; Table 1).4. Discussion This study is the rst to examine the test-retest reliability of M1 homeostatic plasticity, induced and assessed using non-invasive brain stimulation, in the healthy human brain. Thecorticomotor response to single, and double, anodal tDCSdemonstrated moderate-to-good test-retest reliability inhealthy individuals over intervals up to 2 weeks. These data suggest that M1 homeostatic plasticity can be reliably induced and assessed over time using two blocks of anodaltDCS. This nding provides a foundation for the longitudinal evaluation of M1 homeostatic plasticity in humans using thedouble tDCS protocol. Homeostatic plasticity regulates neuronal ring rates in the human brain and ensures that the neuronal activity ismaintained within a stable physiological range (BCM) theory of homeostaticplasticity proposes that neuronal ring rates are regulated based on the history of the postsynaptic activity, such thathigh levels of neuronal activity reduce the threshold for LTD induction and promote LTD-like plasticity (synaptic weakening, lower ring rates), while low levels of neuronal activity reduce the threshold for LTP induction and promoteLTP-like plasticity (synaptic strengthening, higher ring rates) Consistent with the BCM theory, studies exploring using repetitive tetanic -35] and stimulation [3, 4, 36-38] have shown that neuronal activity is modi ed based on the level of postsynaptic activity [39 -41]. For example, studies have shown that two blocks of anodal tDCS produce e ects on M1 that follow a time-dependent rule consistent with homeostatic mechanisms [9]. Speci cally, when 7 min of anodal tDCS is followed at 3 min interval by a second 5 min block of anodal tDCS, the increase in the corticomotor excit-ability observed with min anodal tDCS applied alone isreversed toward inhibition [9]. The nature of this responsemimics the homeostatic rule of a threshold that slides tofavor the induction of LTD-like e ects (the inhibitory response after the second block of anodal tDCS) when post-synaptic activity is high (following the rst block of anodal tDCS) [2 -4]. Our data con rm the direction and time course of these eects in the healthy brain (increased the corticomotor excit- ability in response to a single 7 min block of anodal tDCS;decreased the corticomotor excitability in response to doubletDCS) and extend previous work by demonstratingmoderate-to-good test-retest reliability with medium-to-large e ect sizes when homeostatic plasticity is induced and assessed using noninvasive brain stimulation at intervals of48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Speci cally, moderate-to- good test-retest reliability with medium-to-large e ect sizes was observed when the magnitude of the homeostaticresponse was considered relative to \"baseline, \"(allICC 0 43; all partial eta squared 006; Table 1) and when the magnitude of the response was considered relative to the levelof facilitation produced following the rst block of anodal tDCS (all ICC0 60; all partial eta squared [ICC]) estimates for cortical measures recorded across days 0, 2, 7, and 14.

The current data also provide further evidence that the resting motor threshold ( ICC = 0 92, 95% CI 0.76-0.98) and the corticomotor excitability ( ICC = 0 80, 95% CI 0.47 -0.94) are reliable at intervals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks. Thisnding is in agreement with previous studies. For example, Malcolm et al. (2006) reported high reliability in motor thresholds ( ICC = 0 90-097) in healthy volunteers over a period of 2 weeks [42]. Further, good reliability ( ICC075) for cortical excitability measures curves, MEP amplitude, and cortical silentperiod) have been reported across two testing sessions, each 1week apart, in healthy volunteers [43]. As changes in the rest-ing motor threshold and/or baseline corticomotor excitabilityare likely to in fluence the homeostatic response, the reliability of these measures over time is an important consideration inthe assessment of homeostatic plasticity in humans [3, 12, 44]. Previous studies have used a range of noninvasive brain stimulation protocols to probe the M1 homeostatic plasticity in both healthy and clinical populations [3, 4, 11, 13]. In people with nonspeci c chronic low back pain (cLBP), homeostatic plasticity was assessed in M1 using a doubletDCS protocol identical to that investigated here [14]. Theauthors demonstrated the impaired homeostatic plasticityin this population characterised by a failure to reverse highcorticomotor excitability (induced by the rst block of tDCS) toward inhibition (following the second block of tDCS).Using 5 Hz trains of repetitive TMS, the impaired homeo-static plasticity has been reported in individuals with episodicmigraine during the preictal and postictal stages of the migraine cycle [12]. Although data were obtained from dif- ferent individuals at di erent stages of the migraine cycle (i.e., the study did not utilise a repeated-measures design),impaired homeostatic plasticity recurrence migraine transformation froman episodic to a chronic condition [12]. Similar observationswere reported in the M1 of individuals with focal hand dysto-nia where patients failed to reverse high corticomotor excit-ability toward when 1 reported to correlate with theseverity of symptoms and hypothesised to contribute to aber- rant sensorimotor plasticity in this condition [13]. These data have been interpreted to suggest that impaired homeostaticplasticity may play a role in the pathogenesis of some clinicalconditions. Further exploration of these ndings using longi- tudinal and repeated measures study designs are needed toconrm these hypotheses. It is noteworthy that some studies using repeated non- invasive brain stimulation techniques have demonstratednonhomeostatic interactions in the human M1, wherecumulative (rather than opposite) LTP- or LTD-like e ects are induced [3, 45, 46]. application oftwo successive inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimula- tion protocols results in long-lasting MEP depression and not a reversal toward facilitation as would be hypothesisedby the BCM theory [47, 48]. These data suggest that to might stimulation-induced and e ects. Future studies exploring the interplay between homeostatic and nonhomeo-static mechanisms over time are warranted in healthy andpathological populations. This study has several limitations. First, the test-retest reliability in M1 homeostatic plasticity was assessed in one direction only, that is, with a facilitatory priming protocol (anodal tDCS). This approach was selected as previous stud-ies in pathological conditions have shown failure to induce0.60.811.21.41.61.82 Baseline Between 0 min 10 min 20 minMEP amplitude (mV) Time (minutes) Day 0 Day 2Day 7 Day 147 min tDCS 5 min tDCS Figure 2: Group data ( mean + SD) for motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude before the double tDCS protocol ( \"baseline \"), after the rst block of anodal tDCS ( \"between \"), and at 0 min, 10 min, and 20 min follow-ups on days 0, 2, 7, and 14.6 Neural PlasticityLTD when postsynaptic activity is high [11, 13]. the polarity and magnitude of synaptic plasticity variesas a function of activation history in the postsynaptic neuron,future studies should seek to determine whether inhibitorypriming protocols (e.g., cathodal tDCS) are also reliable overtime. Second, this study did not assess homeostatic plasticityin intracortical inhibitory or facilitatory intracortical activity [27, 49-51], in intracor- inhibitory and facilitatory networks in individuals with migraine [16, 17, 44, 52], future studies should investigatehomeostatic regulation in these networks over time. Third,although this study used noninvasive brain stimulationmethods similar to previous studies in this eld [3, 4], tDCS applied to M1 using electrodes of 5 \u00d77c m 2may have resulted in the current spread to surrounding corticalregions [27, 53, 54]. Finally, our ndings are limited to homeostatic plasticity in the healthy M1 using a doubletDCS protocol. Further research is needed to determine thetest-retest reliability of homeostatic plasticity induced usingother noninvasive brain stimulation methodologies in M1, as well as homeostatic plasticity induced in other brain regions relevant to di erent pathologies [55 -58]. 5. Conclusion These data demonstrate that M1 homeostatic plasticity,induced using two blocks of anodal tDCS and assessed usingsingle-pulse TMS, has moderate-to-good reliability at inter-vals of 48 hours, 7 days, and 2 weeks, with the greatest reli-ability observed when the homeostatic response is assessedat the 10 min follow-up. These ndings provide a foundation for the assessment of homeostatic plasticity in the primarymotor cortex using repeated measures and longitudinal studydesigns in humans.

A single block (7-min) of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ('single tDCS'), or 3-min rest; 'double sessions to conrm an excitatory response to tDCS applied alone, and evaluate homeostatic plasticity, respectively. Corticomotor excitability was assessed in the corticomotor of the rst dorsal interosseous muscle by transcranial magneticstimulation-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded before and 0, 10, 20, and 30-min following each tDCS protocol. Results: Compared with baseline, MEP amplitudes increased at all time points in both groups following the single tDCS protocol ( P< 0.003). Following the double tDCS protocol, MEP amplitudes decreased in pain-free controls at all time points compared with baseline ( P< 0.01), and were unchanged in the cLBP group.

Importantly, impaired, could explain aberrant synaptic plasticity and potentially symptom persistence in cLBP.

How- ever, synaptic plasticity relies on a positive feedback loop that left unchecked would lead to either too much strengthening and exces- sive neuronal excitability (LTP), or silencing (LTD) ( Karabanov et al., 2015 ). In the healthy brain, homeostatic plasticity mechanisms enforce stability and maintain brain excitability within a normal range by shifting the threshold for LTP and LTD based on the history of synaptic activity. For example, the threshold of a synapse with a history of high excitability will shift to favour induction of LTD ( Bienenstock et al., 1982 ). Homeostatic plasticity can be assessed in humans using non- invasive brain stimulation. For example, in healthy individuals a homeostatic response is elicited when two blocks of excitatory brain stimulation are applied at short intervals ( Fricke et al., 2011 ). Homeostatic plasticity is observed as an increase in cortical excitability following the rst block of excitatory stimuli (synaptic strengthening) that is reversed towards inhibition (synaptic weak- ening) when the second block of excitatory stimuli is applied after a few minutes. In this way, the brain corrects for exposure to excessive levels of excitation and prevents aberrant synaptic plas- ticity 2015; Murakami et al., 2012 ). Evidence from neurological conditions such as migraine and focal hand dystonia suggests a link between impaired homeostatic plasticity and symptoms. For example, these individuals exhibit reorganisation of the sensorimotor cortex ( Jia and Yu, 2017; Schabrun et ) as well as excessive excitability (Brighina et al., ). Impaired hypothesised to contribute to abnormal cortical reorganisation and sensorimotor symptoms in these conditions as a result of inappropriate and excessive LTP- like effects resulting from a failure to shift the threshold towards LTD when excitability is high ( Brighina et al., 2005; Kang al., 2008; Quartarone and Pisani, 2011 ). A comparable failure of homeostatic control in cLBP could explain similar observations of maladaptive cortical reorganisation and symptom persistence in this population yet, no study has investi- gated homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal disorders. Importantly, impaired homeostatic plasticity has been shown to be generalised throughout the sensorimotor system and is not restricted to the cortical representations of affected muscles (Antal et al., 2008; Brighina et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2008, 2005 ). For instance, in migraine, impaired homeostatic plasticity is not restricted to the visual cortex and is also observed in M1 rep- resentations of 'unaffected' hand muscles et al., 2014 ). Similarly, impaired homeostatic plasticity is present in the 'unaffected' median and ulnar innervated muscles in focal hand dystonia ( Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2008 ). Together, these ndings indicate a global impairment in homeostatic plasticity that has been sug- gested to provide evidence for a primary role of impaired homeo- static plasticity in the pathophysiology of these conditions ( Antalet al., Brighina 2011; Quartarone and Pisani, 2011 ). This study aimed to investigate homeostatic plasticity in the primary motor cortex representation of 'unaffected' hand muscles in individuals with cLBP and pain-free controls. Similar to ndings in individuals with migraine and focal hand dystonia, it washypothesised that individuals with cLBP would fail to display a reversal of excitation towards inhibition following a second block of excitatory non-invasive brain stimulation consistent with global impairment in homeostatic control. A secondary aim was to exam- ine the relationship between the magnitude of impaired homeo- static plasticity (if present) and the intensity and duration of cLBP. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Participants To determine a sufcient sample size to detect a difference in homeostatic plasticity between those with and without cLBP should one exist (Aim 1), a power calculation was performed using a conservative effect size estimate of 0.2, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. Using these parameters, 24 individuals were required in each group. However, to ensure there was also sufcient power to examine a relationship between impaired homeostatic plasticity and pain in the cLBP group, should one exist (Aim 2), a second power calculation using an r value of 0.4, an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8 was performed. Using these parameters, a sample size of 47 individuals with cLBP was required. Thus, 50 individuals with cLBP (mean \u00b1 standard deviation age: 45 \u00b1 16 years, 26 men), and 25 healthy, pain-free controls (age: 43 \u00b1 17 years; 13 men) were recruited. Chronic, non-specic low back pain was dened as the presence of continuous back pain lasting three months or more that was not due to a diagnosable pathology. A verbally administered 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) anchored with 'no pain' at zero and 'worst pain possible' at 10, was used to determine pain intensity in the week prior to, and on the day of, testing. Partici- pants were excluded if they presented with LBP due to lumbar sur- gery, fracture, lumbar puncture, malignancy, infection, facet denervation, neuropathic or mixed pain (where pain radiated below the gluteal fold), and pain-free controls were excluded if they had a history of cLBP. Any participant with a history of major circu- latory, neurological, psychiatric, respiratory or cardiac diseases, who was taking central nervous system acting medication, or who presented with a cognitive decit that impaired the ability to understand instructions or provide informed consent was excluded. All participants were required to meet inclusion criteria as per the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) safety guidelines (i.e. no history of epilepsy, absence of metal implants in the skull) ( Keel et al., 2001 ). Participant characteristics are summarised in Table 1 . A verbal and written description of the experimental procedures was provided to all participants. Written, informed consent was obtained before testing. The study was approved by the institutional Table 1 Participant characteristics.

Experimental protocol All participants attended two experimental sessions in random order, at least 7 days apart. Participants received a single 7-min block of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) in one session to conrm the existence of an excitatory response ('single tDCS' protocol; Fig. 1 A). In a separate session, participants were exposed to two blocks of anodal tDCS (7-min and 5-min separated by a 3-min to investigate homeostatic plasticity in M1 ('double tDCS'; Fig. 1 B). This protocol has been shown to induce homeostatic plas- ticity (observed as a reduction in motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in response to TMS) in healthy individuals ( Fricke et al., 2011 ). In both sessions, MEPs were elicited using single pulse TMS and recorded from the rst dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle ipsilateral to the side of worst pain in individuals with cLBP and the matched side for pain-free controls. The FDI muscle was chosento allow investigation of global impairment in homeostatic plastic- ity consistent with previous studies in focal hand dystonia and migraine ( Antal et al., 2008; Quartarone et al., 2005 ). MEPs were recorded at baseline, and immediately following each experimen- tal protocol at 0, 10, 20 and 30-min follow-up ( Cavaleri et al., 2017 ). Participants were comfortably seated with their hand and arm at rest throughout both sessions. No participant reported mus- cle spasm or discomfort during testing. 2.3. Assessment of corticomotor excitability MEPs were recorded using surface dual electrodes (Ag-AgCl, Noraxon dual electrodes, product #272S, inter-electrode distance 2.0 cm) placed in a belly-tendon montage on the relaxed FDI mus- cle (Antal et al., 2008; Fricke et Quartarone et al., 2005 ). The ground electrode was positioned on the olecranon process. Raw EMG signals were amplied (1000 times), bandpass ltered within a range of 20 Hz (high-pass) to 1 kHz (low-pass) and sam- pled at 2 kHz (CED 1401 AD, Cambridge Electronic Design, Cam- bridge, United Kingdom) via acquisition software (CED, version 5. 08/C286). The MEP peak-to-peak amplitude was extracted and averaged for analysis.A standard 70 mm gure-of-eight coil connected to a magnetic stimulator (Magstim 200, Magstim Co. Ltd. Dyfed, UK) was used to provide single-pulse TMS. The coil was positioned tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing posterolaterally at a 45 /C176angle from the mid-sagittal plane. This orientation is optimal for the induction of posterior-to-anterior (PA) directed current for trans- synaptic activation of horizontal cortical connections in M1 (Bashir et al., 2013; Brasil-Neto et al., 1992 ). The optimal site (hot- spot) for eliciting MEPs from the relaxed FDI was determined before each experimental session by systematically moving the coil in 1 cm increments around the motor cortex. The hotspot was marked with a pen to allow accurate coil positioning. The stimula- tion intensity for TMS was adjusted to elicit an MEP amplitude of 1 mV peak-to-peak in the relaxed FDI at baseline, and this intensity was kept consistent throughout each test session. The averageamplitude of 30 MEPs was used for analysis at each time-point. 2.4. Transcranial direct current stimulation In both experiments, a battery driven direct current stimulator (DC-Stimulator Plus, NeuroConn, Ilmenau, Germany) was used to deliver a constant current of 1 mA through saline-soaked sponge electrodes (surface 7 /C25 cm). The active electrode (anode) was positioned over the motor cortical representation (hotspot) for FDI as determined by TMS in each participant. The reference electrode (cathode) was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region. Electrodes were xed with two adjustable rubber straps around the head. Stimulation in this montage has been reported to increase cor- tical excitability in the underlying M1 that outlasts the stimulation period by 20-60 min ( Fricke et al., 2011 ). Current was ramped up and down over 10 s at the start and end of stimulation to avoid star- tling participants by alternating current transients that cause imme-diate ring during tDCS ( Nitsche et al., 2008 ). 2.5. Statistical analysis Data are presented as means and standard deviations (SD) throughout the text. For all analyses, SPSS software for windows, version 22 was used. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine the TMS intensity used to elicit a 1 mV MEP at baseline between groups (cLBP and pain-free controls) and proto- cols (single vs. double tDCS). To examine the effect of each tDCS pro- tocol (single vs. double) on raw (non-normalised) MEP amplitudes, separate two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted for each protocol with factors 'Group' (cLBP vs. pain-free controls), and 'Time' (baseline, 0, 10, 20 and 30-min). Where appropriate, post-hoc testing was performed using t-tests with Bonferroni cor- rections for multiple comparisons. The Greenhouse-Geisser method was used to correct for non-sphericity as required. A Pearson product-moment correlation coefcient was used to assess the rela- tionship between the magnitude of homeostatic plasticity (MEP amplitude) at each time-point after the double tDCS protocol and pain intensity, and pain duration, respectively. For all statistical tests a P-value of <0.05 was considered signicant. 3. Results 3.1. TMS intensity at baseline In the single tDCS protocol, the baseline TMS intensity (percent of maximum stimulator output) used to elicit MEPs of 1 mV peak- to-peak amplitude was in the cLBP and pain-free control groups respectively. In the double tDCS protocol, the TMS intensity used to elicit MEPs of 1 mV peak-to-peak was 57 \u00b1 14%, and 56 \u00b1 15% in the cLBP and groups Fig. 1. (A) Single tDCS protocol: Anodal tDCS was applied to the primary motor cortex contralateral to the side of worst pain in individuals with cLBP and thematched side for pain-free controls in a single, 7-min block. (B) Double tDCSprotocol: Anodal tDCS was applied to the primary motor cortex contralateral to theside of worst pain in individuals with cLBP and the matched side for pain-free controls for a 7-min block followed by a second 5-min block separated by a 3-min rest period. Motor evoked potentials (elicited using transcranial magnetic stimu-lation) were recorded at baseline and at 0, 10, 20 and 30-min follow-up in eachexperiment.1092 T. Thapa et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 129 (2018) 1090-1096respectively. There was no difference in the baseline TMS intensity between groups (F 1,73= 0.0, P= 0.8) or protocols (F 1,73= 3.8, P= 0.1). 3.2. Single tDCS protocol MEP amplitude increased in both groups following the single tDCS protocol ( Fig. 2 A;Table 2 ). There was a main effect of time (F4,292 = 6.7, P< 0.001), but no main effect of group (F 1,292 = 0.0, P = 0.9) and no interaction effect (F 4,292 = 1.4, P= 0.2). Compared with baseline, MEP amplitudes increased at all time points in both groups following 7-min of anodal tDCS (post-hoc all: t > 3.6, P< 0.003; Fig. 3 A). Sixty-eight per cent of individuals with cLBP, and 76% of healthy, pain-free individuals exhibited an excitatory response (increased MEP amplitude relative to baseline) following the single tDCS protocol ( Fig. 4 A). 3.3. Double tDCS protocol In the double tDCS protocol, the size of the MEP amplitude over time was dependent on the presence or absence of cLBP ( Fig. 2 B; Table 2 ). The ANOVA demonstrated no main effect of time (F 4,292 = 2.4, P= 0.1) but a main effect of group (F 1,292 = 37.9, P<0.001) and an interaction effect between group and time (F 4,292 = 7.4, P < 0.001). Compared with baseline, pain-free controls displayed a reduction in MEP amplitude at all time-points following the double tDCS protocol (post hoc vs. baseline; 0 min: t = 3.4, P= 0.01; 10 min: t = P< = 4.3, P< 0.001; 30 min: t = 3.4,P=0.01; Fig. 3 B). In contrast, individuals with cLBP demonstrated no change in MEP amplitude over time (post-hoc vs baseline; 0 min: t = P= min: t = 1.5, P= 0.7; 20 min: t = 1.8, P=0.5; 30 min: t = 2.5, P= 0.1; Fig. 3 B). When individuals with and without cLBP were compared at each time-point, there was no difference in the MEP amplitude at baseline (post hoc: t = 0.5; P= 0.7). However, MEP amplitudes were higher in the cLBP group when compared to pain-free controls at all other time-points (0, 10, 20 and 30-min; post hoc all: t > 4.3, P< 0.001; Fig. 3 B). Thirty-two per cent of individuals with cLBP and 72% of healthy, pain-free individuals displayed a normal homeostatic plasticity response (decreased MEP amplitude relative to baseline) following the double tDCS protocol ( Fig. 4 B). 3.4. Relationship between the intensity and duration of cLBP and impairment in homeostatic plasticity Neither NRS scores of pain intensity (all time-points: r < 0.2, n= 50, P> 0.1) nor pain duration (all time-points: r < 0.1, n= 50, P> 0.5) were correlated with the change in MEP amplitude in individuals with cLBP after the double tDCS protocol. 4. Discussion This study is the rst to investigate homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal pain. Although individuals with and without cLBP displayed typical increases in corticomotor excitability in response to the single tDCS protocol, only pain-free controls demonstrated a Fig. 2.

Thapa et / 1093reversal of excitation towards inhibition following the double tDCS protocol consistent with normal homeostatic control. These novel data suggest a disruption of homeostatic plasticity in the primary motor cortex of individuals with cLBP that is present regardless of pain intensity or pain duration, and is not restricted to the rep- resentation of painful muscles. This mechanism could explain observations of maladaptive synaptic plasticity in cLBP, and could provide a pathophysiological mechanism to explain pain persis- tence in this condition. Homeostatic plasticity is an essential form of plasticity in the human brain that ensures neuronal activity is maintained withina stable physiological range ( Murakami et al., 2012; Ziemann and Siebner, described by Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro, homeostatic plasticity prevents uncontrolled increases or decreases in synaptic efcacy by linking the effectiveness of LTP and LTD processes to the level of activity in the postsynaptic neu- ron ( Bienenstock et al., 1982 ). When activity is high, LTP processesare less effective, favouring LTD and synaptic weakening. Similarly, when postsynaptic activity is low, LTD processes are less effective, favouring LTP and synaptic strengthening. It has previously been argued that changes in the amplitude of the MEP to transcranial magnetic stimulation after successive blocks of excitatory non- invasive brain stimulation reflect changes in the efcacy of synap- tic relays within the corticomotor pathway ( Siebner and Rothwell, 2003 ), and that reversal of the direction of these changes (towards inhibition) can be used to assess homeostatic plasticity ( Fricke et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005 ). Using this model, the present data suggest individuals with cLBP have impaired homeostatic plasticity that manifests as a fail- ure to regulate increases in corticomotor excitability since excitability is not reversed towards inhibition when postsynaptic activity is high. Failure to regulate synaptic plasticity in individualswith cLBP could lead to a disproportionately high rate of synaptic strengthening that in turn, produces abnormally high cortical excitability and maladaptive reorganisation of brain studies shown increased cortical excitability ( Kregel et al., al., 2017 ), and enlarged representations of the back muscles that are posteriorly shifted and show greater overlap in cLBP ( Schabrun et al., 2015; Tsao et al., 2011, 2008 ) when compared with those of healthy con- trols. These cortical changes are associated with pain severity, impaired postural control and reduced coordination of trunk mus- cles ( Janetzki et al., 2016; Tsao et al., 2011, 2008 ). In addition, the threshold where mechanical pressure turns to pain is lower in peo- ple with cLBP than controls 2013; et al., 2009 ), and peo- ple with exhibit reduced nociceptive thresholds ( Biurrun Manresa et summation Flor et al., 1997; Kong et al., 2013 ). Together, these ndings indicate an increase in spinal and cortical excitability in cLBP that could be explained by excessive synaptic strengthening as a result of impaired homeostatic control. Although no studies have examined homeostatic plasticity in musculoskeletal pain, evidence from neurological populations sup- ports this hypothesis. For example, focal hand dystonia is charac- terised by increased M1 al., 2017; Hallett, 2011 ), and enlarged and overlapped M1 representations of the hand muscles ( Schabrun et al., 2009 ) - cortical changes that are similar to those reported in cLBP. Several studies have shown impaired homeostatic plastic- ity in focal hand dystonia that is hypothesised to underpin theincreased excitability and enlarged cortical representations observed in this condition ( Kang et al., 2011; Quartarone et al., 2005, 2008; Specically, the failure of homeostatic plasticity to prevent the positive feedback cycle of synaptic plasticity is believed to produce unchecked increases in synaptic strength that consolidate maladaptive cortical reorganisa-tion as well as the pathological sensorimotor interactions and movement patterns that manifest in focal hand dystonia (Quartarone and Pisani, 2011 ). Notably, excessive synaptic strengthening in focal hand dystonia is not restricted to the circuits clinically affected by dystonia, but is generalised throughout the sensorimotor system ( Antal et al., 2008; Quartarone et al., 2008 ) - a nding consistent with the current observations in cLBP. This nding is also consistent with previous reports of a generalised alteration in cortical excitability that extends beyond the cortical representation of painful muscles in chronic pain conditions (ter- med 'pain-motor integration'), including 2002; Schwenkreis et al., 2003; Tsao et al., 2011, Fig. 3. Mean (+ SEM) motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes normalised to the baseline MEP amplitude (100%) in the cLBP (n = 50, closed triangles), and pain-freecontrol (n = 25, closed circles) group in response to the single (A), and double (B) tDCS protocols. MEP amplitudes increased in both groups following the single tDCS protocol (main effect of time: P< 0.003). In the double tDCS protocol, the MEP amplitude was reduced at all time-points compared to baseline only in the pain-free control group ( *Pall < 0.01 relative to baseline). The cLBP group demonstrated no change in MEP amplitude compared to baseline (#Pall < 0.001 relative to cLBP group at the same time-point).1094 T. Thapa et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 129 (2018) 1090-10962008 ). As such, it is plausible that impaired homeostatic plasticity may also influence pain-motor integration in cLBP, driving increased cortical excitability, representational shifts, reinforcement of unwanted movement patterns (poor postural control, and coordi- nation), and unpleasant sensory experiences. Accordingly, should future studies conrm the relevance of impaired homeostatic plasticity to cLBP, therapies that seek to tar- get neuroplasticity in persistent pain may need to target homeo- static, rather than synaptic, plasticity mechanisms. For example, previous studies have shown that patterned peripheral electrical stimulation applied to reduce cortical excitability (induce synaptic weakening; LTD) in focal hand dystonia where homeostatic plastic- ity is known to be impaired, improves cortical organisation and reduces symptoms ( Schabrun et al., 2009 ). Similar treatments, designed specically to counter excessive synaptic strengthening, could also be effective in cLBP. Further, an impaired ability to con- trol increases in cortical excitability in cLBP may suggest that com- monly used treatments known to promote synaptic strengthening (e.g. motor retraining, exercise) may require reconsideration in this population to avoid reinforcing aberrant synaptic plasticity, and inducing detrimental effects on symptoms. Further work is required to test these hypotheses. Examination of individual level data revealed a portion of healthy individuals (38%) who displayed impaired homeostatic plasticity,and a portion of cLBP individuals (32%) whose homeostatic control was normal. Although the reasons for this are unclear it is possible that impaired homeostatic plasticity in healthy individuals could predispose to the development of chronic pain in future. However, longitudinal exploration of this mechanism within the same individ- ual is needed to understand the relevance of individual variability in both the healthy and diseased brain. Notably, there was no associa- tion between the magnitude of impaired homeostatic plasticity and pain intensity or pain duration. However, all participants were expe- riencing LBP that had persisted for a substantial period of time (aver- age duration of 12.7 \u00b1 14.4 years). It is possible that homeostatic impairment develops in the sub-acute or early phases of cLBP and thus, was already present, regardless of small differences in symp- tom status in individuals tested in this study. Investigation of home- ostatic plasticity in other brain areas, and during the acute, sub- acute and early phases of cLBP is warranted. This study has several limitations. As the rst exploration of this mechanism in cLBP we utilised a cross-sectional design. It is there-fore not possible to determine whether homeostatic plasticity is impaired as a cause or a consequence of cLBP or to investigate the relationship between impaired homeostatic plasticity and fluctua- tions in pain over the clinical course of cLBP. Future studies should utilise longitudinal study designs with multiple measures of home- ostatic plasticity and pain to provide comprehensive examination of this mechanism and the symptoms of cLBP. In the present study, the experimenter was not blinded to participant group and future stud- ies should ensure blinding to reduce the risk of bias. In addition, our sample presented with a long history of cLBP. Different changes in homeostatic plasticity could be present in the acute or sub-acute phase of low back pain. Further studies are required to disentangle the relationship between different phases of cLBP and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Finally, this study did not include evaluation of spinal nociception (either through nociceptive withdrawal reflexes or laser evoked potentials). Previous studies have demon- strated spinal hyperexcitability in Neziri et al., 2011 ). As transcranial magnetic stimulation provides an indication of excitability throughout the corticomotor pathway it is possible that changes in spinal excitabil- ity in people with cLBP may have contributed to the current ndings. It is unclear whether changes in spinal excitability may drive altered homeostatic plasticity through the upregulation of afferent input to the cortex or whether impaired homeostatic plasticity drives anincrease in spinal excitability. Future studies should seek to clarify the interaction between spinal mechanisms and homeostatic plas- ticity in people with and without cLBP. 5. Conclusion This study is the rst to explore homeostatic plasticity in mus- culoskeletal pain conditions. These unique data suggest a disrup- tion of synaptic homeostasis in individuals with cLBP that manifests as an inability to counter excessive increases in cortico- motor excitability. Further research is required to determine whether impaired homeostatic plasticity drives maladaptive synaptic plasticity and pain persistence in cLBP. 6.

Two separate lines of evidence support the hypothesis that pain-motor integration mechanisms operate in the human cerebral cortex. First, epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS), as well as non-invasive brainstimulation (NIBS) protocols delivered over the primary motor cor- tex (M1), can both improve pain in patients with drug-resistant chronic pain. MCS and NIBS are thought to modulate M1 cortico- fugal descending inhibitory inputs to structures involved in the central processing of pain such as the thalamus and the periaque- ductal 2016; ). Second, experimental pain may affect the excitability as well as plasticity of specic circuits in the human motor system. Accordingly, over recent years, a growing number of authors have investigated experimentally the impact of chronic pain on long-term potentia- tion (LTP)- and depression (LTD)-like plasticity processes in M1, owing to pain-motor integration, in various neurological disorders (Suppa et al., 2013, 2017; Naro et al., 2015 ). In this issue of Clinical Neurophysiology ,Thapa et al. (2018) investigated possible changes in M1 LTP/LTD-like plasticity in indi- viduals affected by chronic low back pain (cLBP). The study design consisted of two separate experimental sessions implying a single or double application of M1 anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). As a measure of M1 plasticity, the authors mea- sured and compared motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, recorded at baseline and 0-30 min after tDCS ended. In healthy subjects, when delivering a single block of anodal tDCS (7 min of stimulation), as expected, MEPs increased in size at all the time- points, suggesting M1 plasticity processes. By contrast, following the application of two blocks of anodal tDCS (rst block of 7 min of tDCS followed by a second block of 5 min of tDCS, with an inter-block interval of 3 min), MEPs decreased in size in healthy controls, owing to homeostatic plasticity mechanisms, in line with a previous observation ( Fricke et al., 2011 ). Conversely, in individ- uals with cLBP, although a single block of anodal tDCS led to nor- mal MEP facilitation, following the two-block tDCS protocol, MEPs remained abnormally facilitated. By demonstrating normal responses to a single block of anodal tDCS but abnormal responsesto the two-block tDCS protocol, the authors provided the rst evi- dence of normal plasticity but abnormal homeostatic plasticity in M1, in individuals with cLBP. Finally, there was no correlation between the patient's clinical features (e.g. pain duration andintensity scored by means of the numerical rating scale - NRS) and the abnormal MEP changes observed after the two-block tDCS protocol. The study of Thapa et al. (2018) is characterized by several strengths. First, the study included a relatively large number of individuals manifesting with cLBP, a common chronic muscu-loskeletal pain disorder with a rather unclear pathophysiology. Second, the study design was based on the experimental investiga- tion of cortical pain-motor integration processes in cLBP, by means of an advanced NIBS protocol ( Fricke et al., 2011 ). Third, by exam- ining and comparing MEP changes induced by a single or double application of anodal tDCS, the authors compared mechanisms underlying plasticity and homeostatic plasticity in M1, both related to pain-motor integration, in individuals with cLBP. Nonetheless, when interpreting the observations reported by Thapa et al. (2018) , several methodological points should be taken into account. The experimental investigation of possible changes in M1 LTP/LTD-like plasticity driven by chronic pain would have ben- etted from the evaluation of the integrity of the peripheral and central nociceptive pathway in individuals with cLBP. To this pur- pose, laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) are currently available to examine the integrity of structures involved in the transmission and central processing of pain ( Cruccu et al., 2010 ). Peripheral or central nociceptive pathway alterations may induce M1 LTP/LTD- like plasticity changes, as demonstrated in different neurological conditions associated with pain of neuropathic as well as non-neu- ropathic origin ( Chang et al., 2018 ). Another comment concerns the sub-optimal description of chronic drug treatments in the individ- uals with cLBP enrolled in the present study. Several pharmacolog- ical agents, commonly used for symptomatic improvement of chronic pain syndromes, potentially affect M1 excitability and LTP/LTD-like plasticity processes et acetaminophen/paracetamol), are all widely used in individuals with cLBP. Virtually all these pharmacological agents may affect measures of M1 excitability and LTP/LTD-like ). A fur- ther comment concerns the physiological interpretation of the ndings reported by Thapa et al. (2018) .

However, the putative mechanisms through which cLBP affects homeostatic plasticity processes in M1 regions beyond those representing painful body representations, such as the intrinsic hand muscles examined here, remain still unclear. Finally, a subgroup of healthy subjects manifested homeostatic plasticity abnormalities similar to those seen in individuals with cLBP and, conversely, several individuals with cLBP were characterized by normal homeostatic plasticity processes. The most likely explana- tion for Guerra et al., 2017a,b ). In conclusion, we believe that the study of Thapa et al. (2018) provides new important information on the effect of chronic pain on M1 LTP/LTD-like plasticity processes, through mechanisms of abnormal pain-motor integration, in patients with cLBP. Future studies will clarify the precise pathophysiological link between abnormal homeostatic plasticity processes in M1 and chronic pain generation or persistence, in individuals with cLBP.
