TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) is an ancient, holistic healing system developed in China over 3,500 years ago. TCM is a whole-body approach to healing, wherein practitioners are trained to locate and treat the underlying root causes of health concerns with long-term benefits. TCM practitioners use herbal remedies and mind/body practices that are millennia old, such as acupuncture, cupping, moxibustion, gua sha, sound healing, auriculo therapy, qi gong and tui na massage. These therapies restore your inner body balance\u2014known as homeostasis in western medicine\u2014and promote optimal wellbeing. Each treatment builds on another, moving you closer to a more vibrant, harmonious, self-caring future VITAL ENERGY WHAT IS QI? Qi is the vital energy that animates your body and protects you from illness. It flows through internal pathways called meridians and provides nourishment to your cells, tissues, muscles, organs, and glands. In modern science terms, Qi is regarded as bioelectricity that regulates our our cells, tissues and organs. PREVENTATIVE + RESTORATIVE WHY TCM? Your health is a priority that's beyond important - even when you don't have any symptoms. Much research has shown that the best medicine is preventive medicine of self-care, and TCM offers a natural and powerfully effective approach to address root causes, keep the body balanced and healthy. TCM can boost your energy and immunity, relieve pain, rebalance your inner system, improve vital organ health, minimize stress and anxiety, promote youthful-looking skin, and even keep many disorders from appearing or progressing. At Redmint, we believe TCM is an integral part of a truly healthy lifestyle and an optimal way to take charge of your health. \"The doctor of the future will give no medication, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, diet and in the cause and prevention of disease\" --- by Thomas Edison GUASHA These specially designed tools are used for full-body and facial massages that break up scar tissue, release muscle tension and reduce the appearance of cellulite. Gua sha facial massage lifts and contours skin for a youthful glow and decreases fine lines and facial laxity. The ancient TCM healing modality of gua sha offers many health benefits including: Eases pain Relaxes and releases the channel sinews Promotes circulation of Qi and blood Rebalances the function of the stomach and spleen Improves facial muscle tone Encourages lymphatic drainage in the skin for a more youthful look Just like cupping, gua sha can also leave red and purple rashes. These rashes are a sign that Qi or blood are obstructed, and they will fade in a few days. CUPPING In this technique, a therapist utilizes various sized suction cups to increase blood flow and circulation. It's great for recovery of soft tissue damage, muscle tension and rehabilitation. The ancient TCM healing modality of cupping offers many health benefits: Relieves pain Relaxes muscles and connective tissues Draws out and releases pathogenic factors of wind and cold, dampness and heat Reduces stagnation and promotes circulation Regulates and invigorates the flow of Qi and blood Reduces fever and inflammation Cupping often leaves reddish-purple, bruise-like marks. These marks will fade after a few days. The color of the marks depends on the amount of stagnation present in your body. As stagnation reduces and pathogens clear with regular treatment, cupping marks become less visible and eventually stop appearing. MOXIBUSTION Moxibustion (moxa) is a powerful TCM healing method that has been used in Eastern cultures for millennia. Moxibustion involves burning a dried herb called Ai Ye above the skin to stimulate and warm acupuncture points, channels, or areas of body. Moxa is extremely therapeutic for people who are weak or fatigued. Moxa can also help with the following: Reduces pain and swelling Enhances reproductive function Strengthens the immune system Activates the circulation of Qi and blood Stimulates circulation and lymphatic flow Moves blockages and clears obstructions Gently simulates and nourishes the body's cellular regenerative process Moxibustion is a form of acupuncture that improves the flow of Qi, by the heating moxa that causes stimulation in the nerves and releasing endorphins to block pain. NATURAL + HOLISTIC HERBAL MEDICINE Herbal medicine and acupuncture are the two most important therapeutic modalities of TCM. In fact, when both are employed holistically, the powerful combination is the best solution for enhancing wellness and maintaining overall health. Over thousands of years, TCM herbology has evolved into an art form all its own. Ancient herbal information has been gathered, compiled, formulated, tested, and handed down from generation to generation. All TCM herbs are classified according to their energetic qualities and functions - as well as the various organs, meridians, and disharmonies they best address. Individual herbs are combined in order to enhance their actions and effects upon the body; when combined, a unique, synergistic formula is created. This combination increases the benefits of a particular herb - and minimizes any side effects. Herbal medicines are used to expedite the healing process and strengthen, support and tonify the body. Herbs have the capacity to address the underlying root causes of many health concerns. When applied topically, these herbs can facilitate the skin regeneration process, resulting in optimal skin health for a natural, healthy looking radiance. Herbal medicine is the ultimate, tried-and-true superfood for your body, soul and glow. THE ART OF WAR HERBAL FORMULATION TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) herbal formulas are based on the philosophy of Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi, a theory similar to synergistic role play in the ancient book \"The Art of War\", or teamwork in modern-day concept. Each of these distinct TCM herbs has its respective role(s) in Redmint's collections of skincare, herbal extracts/drinks. These precise herb blends maximize efficacy and are stronger than any single herb on its own. Jun herb: as the Chief, or General Herb is the principle active herb, delivering the main effect in treating symptoms and discomforts. Chen herb, known as the Prime Minister Herb, strengthens the curative effect of the Jun herb by providing support for it. Chen soothes surrounding inflammation and any co-existing side effects. Zuo herb, as the Assistant Herb, aids in taking care of less important aspects of illness. It further reduces any accompanying side effects and downstream inflammation; moderates, corrects and eliminates any possible harsh toxicity; and harmonizes and integrates the herb blend together. Shi herb, as the Messenger Herb, focuses on optimizing absorption and directs the formula though the fastest and most efficient meridian channels to get to the war zone, or \"health battle ground\". SOUND HEALING Sound tuning forks are a gentle and non-invasive TCM modality. The sound frequencies travel throughout the channels and meridian points of your body, helping to balance Qi and regain your vital energy. Tuning forks are used to: Harmonize the natural cycles of the body Create balance, or homeostasis, in the body Relieve pain Reduce stress and anxiety Sound Therapy is effective in not only achieving a state of relaxation but also has a way of moving through blockages in the body. Sound waves can help release muscular tensions and stimulates the glandular and nervous system. AURICULO THERAPY Auricula therapy is based on the TCM ancient discovery that ears are intimately connected with all organs of the body. By stimulating the ear median points, it can alleviate pathological conditions in other parts of the body and help (not limit to): Pain Management // Sleep discomforts Stress and anxiety // Hormone balances Digestive + Metabolism + Weight loss Memory + Cognitive Performance Dated back in the 2500 BC via The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, Auriculotherapy is an alternative medicine that the ears are a micro system, which regulates the entire body. TCM MODALITIES Each one of us was born with a self-healing ability. Through the use of various holistic modalities, TCM practitioners recharge that self-healing function in your body. These modalities can balance your Qi, giving your body the supports it needs to regain its vitality. What is TCM? TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) is the oldest medical system in the world. It continues to evolve as an essential wellness solution due to its efficacy and long-term benefits.

This system takes a holistic, balanced approach to address the underlying root causes of health concerns, increase vitality, restore the natural self-healing abilities of the body and prevent illness.
