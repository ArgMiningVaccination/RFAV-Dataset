In order to give a full appreciation of the breadth of the business world-wide, and an understanding of ourindustry's role in it, all of the key elements needed to be brought together and put into context under the same cover. We embarked on this project full of energy and enthusiasm. We were armed with our knowledge, experience and the strength of industry consultations that could, with a bit of effort, be translated into a valuable reference source. Our intention as well was to stimulate critical thinking and action on the partof producers, industry organizations and governments alike. The breadth of this document is reflected in the listing of project contributors. Many individuals have contributed to bringing this project to fruition. I would like to acknowledge the time and effort of the following staff from Alberta Agriculture, Food and Ru ral Development, Alberta Economic Development and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada: Peter Pekalski Stankiewicz John Larson Carri Hall MahDoug McMullen Marcy O'Connor Brent McEwan Jeff Yanning Peng Aaron RoslandTed Darling Jaime Mellott Jeff Millang Duane McCartney Jackson Gardner A few special acknowledgments are also in order. Susan Crump provided considerable assistance in laying in industry statistics and organizing inform ation, and thoughts, for the project. Alberta Agriculture's Beef Product Team were, through their i ndustry consultation process, a valuable linkage to the industry. Finally, Darren Chase, my long time peer in the Economics and Competitiveness Division, was an invaluable partner, information source, consultant and sounding board throughout the project. While each of these individuals has contributed to this project in some way, large or small, the responsibility for the conclusions drawn, based on the input and information available, rests with the primary author. My thanks to you all.Dale A. Kaliel Sr. Economist: Production EconomicsBeef Industry Profiles 4Executive Summary This is an extensive document, covering beef industry structure and performance in some depth. As such, this Executive Summary is designed to introduce the context of the study and deliver a thumbnail of the key observations and conclusions drawn. Study Context (Section 1: Introduction) !The beef industry is at a crossroads. Consumers are demanding an increasing variety of safe, nutritious, convenient and consistent foods. The public is demanding, in a somewhat nebulous fashion, that agricultural producers be responsible st ewards of the resources in their control. Beef production margins are generally declining. In or der to maintain its competitive position in global beef markets, the Alberta industry will have to k eep pace with the economic evolution occurring world wide. !The intent of this project is to add to the knowledge set of beef industry participants by providing information on Alberta's current industry status relative to other global beef industry participants. This information and analysis will complement the knowledge of individual producers and provide insight for consideration in their short and long term planning and decision making. !Project objectives revolve around providing information and analysis regarding industry structure, resource use, production, consumption, trade, ma rket fundamentals, and key industry issues, all funneling to an assessment of Alberta's competitive position relative to a group of significant globalbeef producing regions. Countries selected as comp arators include Canada (with specific reference to Alberta and Western Canada), the United States (with attention given to specific state groupings), Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Australia. These countries are referred to as the \"Focus-6\" ( F oreign Other, C anada and the U nited States ). Key Observations and Conclusions (Section 7: Overall Assessment and Conclusions) !At present, the primary Alberta beef industry is relatively competitive with its global peers. The perception of a threat from \"low cost\" countries does not take into consideration the evolving divergence of \"commodity vs. product\" producing regions. !Looking forward to the future, the pace of change in the industry will quicken. This will involve changes throughout the primary and secondary levels in terms of:< how products are produced and moved through market channels, < the technology and business management skills required by primary producers to stay on the leading edge of unit production cost control, < how primary producers work together to attain unit cost efficiencies, < how primary producers work together, and with upstream clients, to attain value chain efficiencies and a product focus, < the relative importance of research, technology development, business knowledge and skills, and < investment and infrastructure development throughout the industry. Intensive production oriented regions will evolve to service higher-valued product-based markets. Extensive production oriented regions will generally evolve to fill the more generic commodity beef markets. This differentiation is not intended to imply that one approach is superior to the other. From a broader perspective, it does imply a rational appr oach to more efficiently meeting the needs of consumers.Beef Industry Profiles 5!A \"Conceptual View of Beef Production and Mark eting Systems\" describes the evolving roles of extensive vs. intensive production systems in adap ting to the notion of beef as a commodity vs. specific beef products. Product-oriented production and marketing channels can be viewed as a series of focused production chains, or distributions, containing:< groups of efficient producers with focused products, < integrated information value chains, < integrated, efficient and consumer-driven product streams, and < (relative) premiums for delivering products with specified attributes. Commodity-oriented production and marketing channels can be viewed as one broad undifferentiated production chain, or distribution, which the market place can access to meet its further value-addedand/or processing needs. This distribution has no definable premium structure and as such specifically requires lowest unit cost sources. !North America is at a vulnerable stage in moving to a product vs. commodity emphasis. To slide back now to a commodity orientation would put the industry in direct competition with South America and, to some extent, Australia. The structure of the North American industry and its prevailing unit cost structures would not support this movement. !While there is considerable concern regarding S outh America as a potentially significant competitor to Canada and the U.S. in global beef markets, b ecause of the predominance in servicing commodity markets, this concern is currently not as great as it is perceived. However, Australia, with its emerging cattle feeding industry and substantial inroads in ex isting value-based markets, should be viewed as a real and imminent threat. !Developed nations and mature industries re-invest in themselves. For the Alberta, and North American beef industries to maintain their competitiveness, the pace of: < production and economic research and technology development, < business management skills extension, < adoption of innovative business arrangements, and < consumer preference and product development research must be quickened. To stay at today's pace, or to reduce public and private re-investment in these areas at this time, would be equivalent to giving up the current, hard fought competitive edge this region enjoys ... likely forever. Supporting logic and rationale behind these observations and conclusions can be found in the following \"Summary of Findings\" section and, from there, the related sections within the body of this report.Beef Industry Profiles 6Summary of Findings The Summary of Findings is designed to: C summarize the detail presented in each of the main study sections, and C act as a \"spring board\" into each of the detailed main study sections, following the key observations and conclusions back through to the root information, analysis and logic paths. The intent of each section is also noted to put context on the summarized findings. Primary Resource Base (Section 2) Intent : describe the resources used in primary beef production by the Focus-6 countries, yielding insight into: <how they produce, <how big they are, and <relevance of industry size. !From the point of view of the resource base empl oyed in beef production, Alberta, and Canada, are small. Compared to the other Focus-6 countries , Canada ranks 5 in terms of cow herd, slaughterth volumes and grazing acreage. !The resource base profiles intuitively advance the understanding that the cost of producing beef cattle, and the associated rates of return on assets, play an important role in establishing a country'scompetitiveness in the global beef complex. For Al berta to have developed the presence it now has in competitive beef markets, the Province's producers and further processing industries must be reasonably competitive. !Moreover, by deduction from the resource profiles, size of the industry is important regarding production of a \"critical mass of the commodity\", sufficient to:C support internal infrastructure within the region, and C gain recognition from importing nations as a reliable, longer term supplier. The combination of an established cow/calf industry, an expanding cattle finishing industry, andrelatively new, world scale packing businesses indicate that the Province has developed, and is building upon the critical mass required to be a global player. !The intensity of production systems employed in each of the regions is generally reflected in their extraction rates (ie. a region's ability to bring slaughter cattle to market relative to the size of its breeding herd). The South American countries employ more extensive production systems (loweranimal productivity; higher age at slaughter; lower stocking rates) and this is reflected in their lower relative extraction rates. Alberta, as a sub-regi on, and the United States, through their higher intensity production systems, have much higher extraction rates and are far more responsive in bringing slaughter cattle to market. Coincidentally, Canada 's overall extraction rate is lower than Australia's and modestly higher than Argentina's. Beef Production, Consumption and Trade / Markets (Section 3) Intent : describe the linkage between the aspects of world production, consumption and trade, yielding insight into: <the magnitude of the market, <the presence and relative importance of the major players, and <factors that can have short and long term effects on the momentum of established production and consumption patterns and trade flows.Beef Industry Profiles 7!The U.S. led the world in beef production in 1999 with a share of 24% of the total. Other regions ranked in descending order by share of production are: the European Union (15%), Brazil (13%), China (10%), Argentina (6%), Australia (4%), Ca nada (3%) and Uruguay (1%). The balance of 24% was produced by the remaining countries. !World-wide production of fresh, chilled and frozen (FCF) beef has grown from 31.8 mmt in 1965 to 57.2 mmt in 2000. North American production over the same period increased from 10.3 to 15.0 mmt. Similar data sources charted global pork and poultry production rising from 42 to 157 mmt during this time frame. !Global major meat production (poultry, pork and beef) has grown from 167 mmt in 1996 to 193 mmt forecasted for 2001. In 1999 shares of global meat production stood at 31% for poultry, 43% for pork and 26% for beef and veal. !On the consumption side, in 1999 the U.S., with 4.6% of the world's population, accounted for roughly 26% of the world's total beef consumption. Canada consumed 2%, the Focus-6 consumed46.7%, the European Union consumed 15.1% and China consumed 10.4%, with the remaining 28% consumed in other nations. This consumption wa s driven by population shares of 0.5%, 8.9%, 6.3%, 21.3% and 63.5%, respectively. !Although the total consumption of beef is important in a broader sense, the characteristics of the products consumed, and the prices paid for the m, are of more long term significance to the beef industry. Beef demand is a longer term, more dynamic notion incorporating: C drivers of longer term per capita consumption tr ends (such as tastes and preferences; cultural factors; product acceptance; income levels and distribution; etc.) C response to prices of the product and its substitutes, and C population. These elements focus on beef as a series of speci fic products as opposed to a generic commodity. The differentiated product vs. generic commodity notion is becoming increasingly important in understanding global consumption patterns and emerging trends. !World beef import and export statistics relay ma ssive volumes and values of products moving internationally. Although the magnitude of these m ovements draws the most attention, the global beef trade hinges on:C the residual volume of beef available for trade after netting out consumption from available production, and C the composition of the products traded in terms of their unit values. For instance, the U.S. produces and consumes vast quantities of beef, it's a net importer of beef in quantity, yet its's also net exporter in terms of va lue. Australia, ranked fourth among the Focus-6 in terms of size of beef herd, leads the world in net b eef trade, both in quantity in value. Canada is a modest net exporter of beef in both quantity and va lue. The differential between average unit export and import values for these countries is quite revea ling. The U.S. imports sizable quantities of lower valued commodity while exporting reasonable quantitie s of much higher valued product. Australia's average export value is much lower, indicating the predominance of lower value commodity exiting the country. Canada's average export and import values are quite close, suggesting a mix of product and commodity moving into and out of the nation. This underpins the notion of intensive productionsystems supporting the creation of differen tiated, higher-valued products for export. !Longer term projections of volume-based world beef market shares indicate gains on the part of Brazil and Canada. More importantly, the estimates show the U.S. moving from a net import to a net export position by the latter half of this decade. This changes suggests a fundamental shift within global trade and may be interpreted in part as a solidification of the product vs. commodity notion. !Historically, Australia, Uruguay and Canada lead th e Focus-6 with respect to export dependence (the percentage of a country's production that is available for export). Projections for American exportBeef Industry Profiles 8dependence shares emphatically drive home the ke y notion of the U.S. becoming an even more dominant player in the beef (volume and value) export complex. Projected export dependence shares for the EU shed little promise for a major breakthrough in that market, unless it's on a value basis. !The implications of export dependence within a c ountry are far reaching. Export dependent countries tend to be more sensitive to their costs of produci ng the commodity. There is added pressure within export dependent countries to deliver lower cost commodity to remain competitive in commodity- based export markets. Furthermore, if the pr oduction and/or productivity growth rate exceeds the population growth rate, export dependence shares a dvance. This impacts extensive vs. intensive production systems in different manners, but with similar effects. !Livestock diseases such as FMD and BSE have two major areas of effect. The first is in long term productivity reductions. These have a greater impact on regions with intensive productions systems. The second, and more immediate impact is on the trade front with producing (and in some cases consuming) nations blocking access. The story on major-scale livestock diseases begins and ends with the value of lost productivity. The extent to whic h countries will go, and the investment they will make in maintaining their disease-free status is di rectly related to the value of lost productivity plus the economic benefit associated with maintaining thei r export business. The greater the productivity and second round economic losses, the more stringent \"dis ease-free\" status countries will be in maintaining this status. Market Analysis, Outlook and Export Market Features (Section 4) Intent : describe the world market and fundamentals, linking the impact of world beef production, consumption and trade to local product values, through a review of: <domestic and world beef and meat markets, examining supply, demand and pricing, and <selected export markets and opportunities in these markets. !The outlook for the Canadian cattle industry remains positive for the short term. Record level market prices, driven in part by recent gains in beef de mand, should benefit from the reduced beef supplies ahead. In the longer term, these prices will come under pressure from increased supplies once the herd expansion of the next cattle cycle is underway. !Market fundamentals and an analysis of cattle pr ice-volume cycles suggest a tightening of North American feeder cattle supplies over the short-run as more heifers are diverted from the feedyard to pasture in order to expand beef herds. As calf cr ops eventually increase, a larger supply of feeder calves will be added to the production mix. The peak in animal production (and the offsetting reduction in prices) is not anticipated for another five to six years. !Although long term price forecasts are difficult to es timate with any degree of certainty, what is more significant is the general trend in pricing and the ability to identify cost benchmarks to deal with the general price trends that are projected. !Forecasted growth in the world economy and a more liberalized trading environment should lead to increased global demand for beef, pork and poultry. Growth in meat production will be constrained by lower beef supplies in the short term, mainly from production and trade uncertainties related to disease outbreaks and drought-related impacts on cattle inventories. !In the longer term, increases in global meat demand will in part be met by increased production from herd rebuilding in the major cattle producing regions of North America and Oceania. World pork and poultry production is also forecasted to rise which will exert more competitive pressure. !The timing and magnitude of outlook elements will be affected mostly by uncertainty about consumer responses to BSE concerns, a continued and deeper slowdown in the U.S. economy, and the impact these events would have on beef demand. W eaker product demand (in domestic and key exportBeef Industry Profiles 9markets) in the face of rising beef supplies over the next decade would not be supportive to cattle prices. Forecast growth in pork and poultry production will pressure world meat prices and beef market share. Locally, increases to feed grain co sts and the reallocation of herd resources will also affect the bottom line for may producers. !In the longer run, beef operations must achieve so me form of competitive advantage - either lower than average costs of production or higher than aver age market returns - in order to stay profitable. !As the beef production system becomes more closely aligned with the end consumer, coordination among participants will continue to increase. Moving from a \"supply-push\" to a \"demand-pull\"system will have a marked influence on beef cattle producers. !The world market is becoming increasingly segmented. Strong demand for grain-fed beef among the leading importers, particularly Japan, South Ko rea and Mexico, should favour higher exports from Canada and the U.S. !The \"Overview of Selected Export Markets and O pportunities\" section provides a brief review of issues, concerns and opportunities over the near term in servicing the following priority market areas: < Mexico < European Union < United States < Japan < South Korea < China Costs and Returns (Section 5) Intent : describe the relative competitiveness of the Focus-6 countries through a review of: <economic and financial performance within each region, in context with the production systems employed in each. <a \"systems approach\" to other considerations affecting the relative competitiveness of countries in beef production. !Classical competitiveness analysis follows the rout e of comparing unit production costs. It assumes reasonably comparable industry structure, production systems and products brought to market. There is considerable variance among the Focus-6 regarding these conditions, particularly:C the structure of the industries (marketing systems, business infrastructure, regulatory control, etc.) varies widely, C production systems ranged from highly extensive to highly intensive, and C the range in commodity vs. product orientation covers almost the full spectrum possible. Even if full unit cost comparability were possible, the relevance would be questionable. Moreover, assessing the competitiveness of a primary industry (producing cattle) can only be done indirectly by interpreting the manner in which it delivers an array of beef products to the market place. !The importance of cost competitiveness is more re levant in assessing how an individual or locale performs within a region's (or country's) pr edominant production system. General cost competitiveness, at the primary level, is necessary at the interface with the global market place. The ability of a region's beef industry, viewed as an a ggregate of individual producers, to bring a definable product to the market in a cost-effective manner is paramount. If this is not present, the ability to maintain a reasonable presence in longer term markets for cattle and beef is diminished. !When comparing production costs between competitive regions, rushing to the conclusion of which nation has the highest or lowest unit cost (either per lb. or per head) can lead to erroneous interpretations. Maintaining strict comparability and reliability regarding economic and financialBeef Industry Profiles 10information among the Focus-6 group was a challenge . However, sifting through the economic and financial information from these countries did reveal a few substantive findings. Ranging over the full breadth of production systems within the group: C the extensive producing regions exhibited lower co sts per head, but these were also accompanied by lower revenues. There was not as much di fferentiation in net returns (primary production margins) as might be expected. C the most significant finding of the economic review was the near identical rates of return on assets across the group. Average returns on assets invested in beef production, ranged in the order of 3% to 5% for 1999. Alberta, as an element of the Focus-6, can be considered as competitive among its peers. Moreover, from a global perspective, there is a reasonable bala nce with regard to cost competitiveness, and more importantly, there is a high degree of competitivene ss within the Focus-6 regarding returns to assets used in the primary production of beef cattle ... regardless of production systems employed. !Reasonable cost competitiveness at the primary level within a region can be considered as a necessary condition for longer term participation in global beef markets. However, there are other considerations throughout the \"value chain\" that can add to, detract from, or overcome minor shortcomings in primary cost competitiveness and affect a regional industry's overall competitiveness at the interface with the global market. For instance:C infrastructure, information systems and business arrangements can reduce total transaction costs throughout the production system, from \"pasture to plate\". A trace back and verification system is a key feature to enable these cost savings. C formal or informal integration throughout the valu e chain improves the efficiency of translating consumer product needs into secondary and primary industry product traits. Not only is the industry more focused on delivering the products de sired by end consumers, but this information is transferred up and down the production chain efficiently. C a positive policy environment can promote environmentally sound production practices, delivery of \"safe\" food products, facilitate producer business management and technical skilldevelopment, and minimize business uncertainty through non-intrusive, producer-driven regulations. The Danish pork industry case holds out an example of a target for the evolution of the NorthAmerican beef industry. Issues and Opportunities (Section 6) Intent : describe the myriad of issues facing the Alberta beef industry today in its quest to solidify and expand its position in the global beef complex. Issues are reviewed by broad \"focus\" area, identifying key areas, observations and opportunities. Focus on Unit Production Costs !Adoption of Management Skills, Information and Technology : The rate of adoption of management skills, information and tools will have to increase significantly for Alberta to maintain its cost effectiveness at the primary level. An ongoing investment in the development of business management skills, targeted at operations with th e long term business goal of economic growth and sustainability, will contribute significantly to the beef industry's prosperity. Key areas include: C producers are resilient, creative, flexible and, in particular, responsive to improving management skills and information use. C create a visible linkage between economic and business management research and downstream extension efforts. Public extension services are positioned to effectively create this linkage and are perceived as knowledgeable, unbiased and relevant. Producers will be better equipped to make better decisions.Beef Industry Profiles 11!Research and Development: Production and Business Management Technology : For the primary beef industry to keep its competitive edge, the pace of production research and technology development will have to be quickened and focused. Moreove r, economic and business management information, research and technology development must be enha nced to complement the production side. Key areas include: C coupling production based research with an economic evaluation and complementary economic research will expedite the flow and adoption of research and technology, creating production and management efficiencies. C integrated beef and forage systems research and technology development, with associated economic analysis and extension, will form the basis for effective long term on-farm resource allocation. Information and technology will be available to adva nce the industry's long term cost competitiveness. !Innovative Business Arrangements : There is reluctance in the industry, based on entrenched business mindsets and/or mistrust, to form business arrange ments that effectively reduce unit production costs. Business alliances, partnerships, cooperatives and jo int ventures regarding input procurement, asset sharing and focused volume-based marketing hol d significant potential for reducing unit production costs. !The Beef Production \"Dichotomy\" : Primary beef producers are pressured to: C match their herds and production systems to the local environment in the most cost effective manner for their farms, and C match their products with what consumers, at arm's length, are demanding. These can, at times, be perceived as being at odd's. The challenge for beef producers is to turn these potentially opposing pressures into a business advantag e. There will be little choice to do otherwise as consumers are focused on food products, not the \"commodity\", beef. Focus on Products !Products, not Commodities : The transition from a commodity to a product business approach must be made by individual business and the industry. Targeting the beef industry, at each level of theproduction chain, to deliver on specific preferences, or requirements of the next successive step in the chain will bring along with it the associated premiums. The direction for the industry will be to import low-valued commodity and direct higher-valued produc t, produced and/or processed locally, into the domestic and export markets that pay premiums. Key areas include: C conscious, strategic alignment of groups of cow/calf and feeder cattle operations focused on meeting the specific needs of the finishing industry. Further development of a forage-basedbackgrounding component would act as a \"bridge\" to meet timing, frame and type needs of intensive lots. C sufficient slaughter cattle volumes would support differentiation and segmentation, at the packer level, of \"carcasses\" into \"product streams\". C strategic organization of the production chain to deliver specific product, packaging and portion traits. C consumer product development, linked to asso ciated product research, keying in on traits, markets and branding schemes. The focus will be on producing what the next leg of the production chain, ending with the finalconsumer, demands. !Innovative Business Arrangements : There is reluctance in the industry, based on entrenched business mindsets and/or mistrust, to develop business arrangements that enhance the ability to meet specific client needs throughout the value chain. Busine ss alliances, partnerships, cooperatives and joint ventures linking specific product needs regarding input specifications, down-stream client needs,strategic information sharing, and focused vol ume-based arrangements hold significant potential in improving overall value chain revenues and reducing un it production costs of value chain participants.Beef Industry Profiles 12!Research and Development: Products, Preferences, Markets and Value-Chains : Product development, market and consumer preference res earch creates market opportunities for Alberta beef products. Increasing the value, volume and share of Alberta beef products in domestic and export markets is key to the long term viability of the industry. It is critical to have a sound understanding ofconsumer preferences and demand drivers in priority markets. The functioning of value or product chains, in terms of participant relationships, perform ance of chains, and the implications of aspects of revenue, cost and risk sharing, are not fully understood. Linked with market area and preferenceinformation, \"product\" research can become more focused. !Adoption of Management Skills, Information and Technology : There is a significant role to be played by smaller value-added processing, retail and food service business in expanding beef's profile in both domestic and export markets. The issue is whet her or not their knowledge base, marketing and business skills, and information systems are sufficient to reach the potential in this area of opportunity. The strength of small businesses lies in the energy and creativity they employ in servicing customer's needs. Business development, market and product information, and management training assistance builds on these strengths. Regulatory compliance, in both domestic and export markets, challenges small businesses. Focus on Investment and Infrastructure !Resource Base : There is concern among producers that it is increasingly difficult to earn a reasonable rate of return (living) and that the value of thei r assets may be in jeopardy. However, the Alberta industry is well positioned to be a significant player in primary beef production. The upcoming generation's producers will be prepared to manage thei r businesses within this \"new reality\". In short, unless there is an unforeseen shift in global beef production, the resource base devoted to primary beef production will likely remain in that use, although the manner in which operations are managed will evolve over time. Assets (equity) will remain in the business but the composition of the farming population will change. !Labour Availability : Difficulties in finding and maintaining capable labour has been voiced as an agriculture-wide issue. Training programs, promoti ng working in agriculture as a career choice, are in part working to fill this gap. However, the fact remains that to maintain qualified labour in the industry, pay and benefits will have to be competitive with other industry sectors. !Role of Industry Organizations : Concern has been voiced as to the future role of industry organizations in the evolution of the beef industry. A few key opportunities exist for producer organizations in the regard:C act as a \"voice of producers\", bringing forward the priorities of the industry to the public policy forum. C act as a \"voice of producers\", working as key partners in developing proactive strategies and operational plans to deal with many of the industry \"issues of the day\". C act as a \"peer voice\", working as a key partner in developing and gaining acceptance for inter- regional trade arrangements. !Investment in Packing Facilities : There is concern that the expansion of the feedlot finishing industry may soon exceed packer capacity in the Province. However, with the shift from a commodity to a product focus, so too will the emphasis of the major packing facilities. What is produced, not how much is produced, will play a major role in further i nvestment in packing facilities in Alberta. Packing capacity in any location will adjust more to accommodate a product emphasis as opposed tocommodity volumes. !Investment in Value-Added Processing : There is concern that, while slaughter capacity has expanded and consumer demand for processed products has in creased, value-added processing in Alberta has not followed suit. On the domestic front, there are opportunities for investment in processing firms to meet refined and differentiated consumer preferences. Value-added processing tends to locate near theBeef Industry Profiles 13market as opposed to the source. Extending expanded processing capacity in any large way to export markets is largely controlled by major packers. Lo cal investment in processing facilities will be driven by targeted, smaller-volume penetration of processed beef into export markets. Focus on Balancing Business, Public and Consumer Needs !Overarching Issue - Public Perception of Agriculture : With urbanization of the population over time, the linkage to, and understanding of agriculture has diminished. Subsequently, public perceptions are formed regarding the actions and motives of the industry that are not founded in fact, science and/or majority. These perceptions can influence government decisions on how the industry should operate,or how they will be controlled. Production t echnology, management systems and producer-driven stewardship standards have undergone positive drama tic changes over time. Collaborative public and private sector efforts to objectively and proactivel y inform the public of these developments, their implications to the public, and the industry's sense of responsibility would improve the image of agriculture. !Business Needs: Business Risk / Disaster Management : Sources and impacts of business risk in agriculture are increasing. The industry requires options for managing risk that respond to \"disaster\" at the industry level while maintaining opportunity for individually-driven business success and failure. \"Disaster\" situations can result in busine ss failures at a broad industry level in the short run while longer term prospects are for viability and growth. The primary beef industry, and individual producers, are recognizing that they bear the respons ibility to manage the bulk of their business risk. They also realize the need to develop the knowledge, skills and information systems to deal with these risks. There is a role for government, however, to offer programs designed to bridge the industry over disaster situations. These programs must find the fine balance between providing sufficient protection to maintain the industry on its long term course , and remaining relatively production and investment neutral. !Business Needs: National \"Herd Security\" : Transmittal of livestock diseases can result in productivity losses and/or reduced public acceptance of b eef as a safe food source. It is the role of government, in consultation and partnership with i ndustry, to define, monitor and police compliance in health of animals and disease control standards. Key areas include: C zero-tolerance in regulations and trade protoc ols regarding FMD and other \"industry stopping\" or catastrophic diseases, C trace back and contingency planning in the ev ent of potentially epidemic diseases, and C risk assessments and common sense in facilitating livestock movement in North America. !Public Needs : Production agriculture has been implicated in compromising air and water quality. As well, agriculture is but one user of public lands that have other business, wildlife and recreational options. The role of the Government, in consultation with stakeholders, is to:C provide balance at the interface of multiple, and often conflicting uses of public resources, and C work with industry to develop acceptable pr oduction and joint-use standards based on \"good science and good sense\". This includes, for exampl e, consistent standards and protocols for siting livestock operations and for humane husbandry practices. Measures are directed to promoting sound, responsib le stewardship and then creating public awareness of same. !Consumer Needs : Consumers demand a safe food supply. Food production systems, from gate to plate, have intensified resulting in increase opportun ities for health related hazards (perceived or real) to occur. It is the role of government to define, monitor and police compliance in food safety standards. Industry recognizes the importance of stringent sanitary and processing standards and generally works with government to ensure compliance. Key areas include:C work proactively with processors, retailers and food service industries to ensure compliance, and C education of the public regarding appropriate ha ndling and preparation of foods to minimize post- purchase hazards.Beef Industry Profiles 14Focus on Trade and Trade Relations !Domestic & North American Level : Integration into a \"North American beef production region\" has been taking place gradually for some time. Consolidation and growth-to-scale of packing andintensive feeding businesses have quickened this process. However, there are still vestiges of regulation and vested interest, based on \"nationalisti c\" fears carried forward to today, that slow this process. A number of inter-related issues revolve around this evolution of Canadian and American beef trade and trade relations. Because of this high degree of inter-relationship, issues are flagged together in a section and opportunities applying in part, or in whole, to all follow separately. Issues < Dependence on the U.S. : Concerns regarding the dependence of the Alberta beef industry on the U.S., as an outlet for product and a supply of feeder cattle, tend to be based on fear of \"losing control of one's destiny\". The level of mutu al knowledge and trust required for free flowing business relationships has not yet fully developed. < Protectionism : When the economy slows, pricing and producer margins, on both sides of the border, tend to be squeezed. This results in grass roots lobbies to \"protect the local industry\" and has brought on responses such as countervailing duty petitions, punitive inspection and grading actions, country of origin labeling requirements and strict enforcement of health of animals import regulations. < U.S.D.A. Inspection & Grading : The \"U.S.D.A. inspected and/or graded\" label has value in the American and international markets for commodity beef. A significant portion of this value is being conveyed to higher-valued beef product stream s. The U.S. has a considerable investment in getting this \"acceptability and related preferen ce\" into place. The recent Canadian grading system changes provide comparability but do not carry the U.S.D.A. label that elicits the market premium. Discontinuities occur in movement and value of product and create market inefficiencies, particularly with respect to essentially identical products. < Brand Labeling : The movement towards branded produc ts, in both domestic and export markets, is an attempt to associate quality characteristic s with a specific set of consumer preferences. Quality is in \"the eye of the beholder\". Although branding may in part circumvent the issue of\"U.S.D.A.\" labeling, if product branding is to be in the purview of international corporate businesses, should the \"Alberta Beef\" label be required? < Disease Control and \"National\" Herd Security : Maintenance of \"national\" herd health presents some difficult trade-offs for Canada and the U.S. regarding freer-flowing, reciprocal movement of cattle and beef. There is suspicion that import regulations are used to unduly restrict trade flowsbeyond the levels required to maintain disease control. Opportunities < Efforts to improve trade relations begin with producers and producer organizations gaining a fuller appreciation of the nature of the industry, particularly the common ground, on both sides ofthe border. < Collaboration of producer organizations at the na tional level to proactively address common trade and policy issues to the benefit of the mutual \"C anadian-American region\" will reflect leadership, commitment and direction to local, state, provincial and federal policy makers. < The role of the various levels of government is twofold: Cact as both a partner and facilitator in the trade relations and issues resolution activities among producer organizations, and Cimplement regulatory, program and policy cha nges reflecting the consensus achieved through the collaborative efforts of producer organizations.Beef Industry Profiles 15< Key areas include: Cincreased knowledge and understanding, by producers, of the nature of the industry across the continent, and the benefits of working together as partners in a global context, Cstrive towards \"grading equivalencies\" to remove product discounts derived through regulation, Cdevelop transparent protocols regarding the movement of livestock between the two countries as well as importation from other countries, Creinstatement of USDA grading of Canadian beef carcasses in the U.S. and removal of country of origin requirements, and Crecognition that the definition of product characteristics, to be encompassed by brands or labels, is specified by consumers, not government or industry. Country of origin, carcass grade, inspection, etc. may or may not play a role in product specifications. The intent is to promote cooperation and transparency between the two countries. !Multilateral Trade and Trade Relations < Beyond NAFTA : The aim of moving beyond NAFTA to include other Central and South American countries (\"Free Trade of the Amer icas\") is to open up market access among the participants. With improved access, however , comes increased competition from other beef producing nations. The opportunity in such ag reements is to solidify the \"commodity vs. product\" approach, promoting the ongoing industry structural evolution towards more \"globalized\" trade in beef. Access will require logical resolution of trade barriers yet maintainthe ability to protect herd health status. < The World Trade Stage : The aim of the WTO agricultural trade agreement (negotiations in progress) is to reduce subsidization and trade barriers globally. Although this brings opportunities to expand trade and rationalize s ubsidization (dumping) activities, a number of needs and trade-offs are brought into play among industries, nations and trading blocks. Keyareas include: Csanitary and phytosanitary concerns among nations, Cprotectionism has made resolution of trad e barriers and impediments difficult, and Cpotential to increase access to North America by subsidized products.Beef Industry Profiles 161. Introduction Background Long term business unit profitability, and competitiveness of the primary beef industry as a whole, is an ongoing concern to Alberta cattle producers. As the industry matures on a global level, maintaining a reasonable return on beef production assets becomes more challenging. Information, as a means to: <improve the cost effectiveness of day-to-day operations, and <lead the development of appropriate long term strategic business plans, has become a valued \"production input\". The inform ation needs of Alberta beef producers, as well as producer organizations, agribusinesses and government agencies, have increased substantially and become much more diverse over the past ten years. Globalization of markets and increased competition are the primary drivers of this need. Currently, each of these client groups accesses informati on from a variety of sources to gain a perspective on the elements affecting their individual operations, or the industry as a whole. Beyond the collection of this basic information, there is an additional investment in converting it into knowledge , a form that is useful for management decisions. The intent of this document is to provide a compilation of key basic information elements (industry structure, markets, costing, competitor profiles, dom estic and international issues review), supplemented by insights and analysis of their influence and impact on the primary Alberta beef industry. It should serve as a comprehensive source of information, which decision makers can fold into their own \"knowledge set\", guiding their short and long term planning and decision making. Objectives With the intent to add to the knowledge set of beef industry participants in mind, project objectives are outlined as follows: 1) describe for the Alberta beef industry regarding: <the structure of the primary industry <the role of \"technology\" as it affects productivity and/or product quality characteristics <types of products and markets served <the economic and financial performance of the industry <domestic market analysis and outlook for the near term 2) describe competitors to the Alberta beef indus try, in domestic and export markets, regarding: <the structure of their primary beef industries <the markets and commodities in which they compete with Alberta <comparative costing, relative to Alberta, in areas of current and potential competition 3) describe domestic and international issues and events that could impact the viability and growth of the Alberta beef industry in serving its current and potential (targeted) markets 4) describe the competitiveness of the Alberta beef industry relative to other producing regions and/or countries regarding landing commodities and products into domestic and global markets Achievement of these objectives should yield the following \"key results\": <industry clients will have an information and know ledge reference upon which they can base their own analysis, planning and decisions to enter, exit, focus, or restructure their businesses (eg. cost control, product focus/positioning), and <industry clients will have information and analysis regarding near term market direction, strengths, opportunities and threats. Considering the breadth and complexity of the gl obal beef complex, information presented has been screened based on its strategic value, either on its own or in support of a broader theme, observation orBeef Industry Profiles 17conclusion. Discussions build from basic industry stru cture through to the interaction of \"players\" in the global beef business in meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers. \"Focus-6\" Group Defined \"Competitiveness\" is a statement of a country's or region's relative ability to economically compete with its rivals in landing product into a defined market. The selection of beef producing regions for this studyis not intended to be exhaustive. Moreover, regions were selected to represent a cross-section of the current and potential major participants in beef markets world-wide. \"Focus-6\" is an acronym for F oreign-O ther, C anada and the U nited S tates. The \"Foreign-Other\" group includes Australia plus the South American countries of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Within Canada, Western Canada is the primary focus. In the U.S ., three sub-regions with a significant portion of beef production activity are frequently singled out. Although there are a number of other regions with significant beef production, the Focus-6 have been sel ected as representative of the majority of the beef production and trade activity in the global beef complex. Approach Comparative information for the Focus-6 regions is presented according to themes. The first section provides a review of the resource base employed in beef production regionally. The intent is to reveal the productive capability of the respective primary beef cattle production sectors. This is followed by a review of global beef production, consumption, tr ade and markets putting the Focus-6, and Alberta in particular, in context with world beef trade. Th e third section delves into domestic and world market analysis, outlook and an overview of selected export markets and opportunities. In Section 4, cattleproduction cost and returns profiles are presented and put into context regarding the \"competitiveness\" of each region with respect to their niche in the global ma rket place. This is followed by a review of issues, opportunities, and challenges facing the Alberta beef i ndustry to maintain and expand its role in world beef markets. The final section draws together th e information presented in the theme areas, and offers conclusions and future direction for Alberta's industry. Cautionary Notes The world meat complex is immense. Many fact ors within this complex, including resources, productivity measures, time, preferences, and relative competitiveness, can affect changes in volumes, values and sources of products. The information he rein provides an introduction at a broader level only. Information comparability in assessing the beef comple x is paramount. However, the nature of the data and multiple sources pose a challenge. Caution is ur ged in interpreting charts. They are intended to represent the significant elements of each component but may not include full volumes and values ofproduction and trade that occurs. From time to time, sources could not provide information on an entirely comparable basis so the clarity of the analysis ma y suffer. The intention is to give reliable relative comparisons of \"presence\" on the world scene. In most instances, international trade in live cattle is not specifically presented although it does filter through in some of the \"carcass weight equivalent\" comp arisons. This element can be significant in trade between specific countries or country groups but is of relatively smaller impact at the global level. Charts and statistics are intended to provide an indica tion of trends and order of magnitude. Observations and conclusions are drawn on this basis and are not the result of rigorous statistical analysis. Caution is advised in interpreting the results and conclusions as \"statistically significant\". Time is a critical element in assessing the perform ance of the global beef complex. Much of the information presented is available on a short term basi s only. Care should be taken in extrapolating short term trends to longer term expectations.Beef Industry Profiles 182. Primary Resource Base Purpose: - to describe Alberta's primary productive resource base (land, labour, capital) as it pertains to the production of cattle and beef- to put into context the size and scope of the Alberta primary beef industry relative to the restof Canada and other competitive regions The intent of this section is to describe the res ources used in primary beef production in the Focus-6 group, plus subsets within Canada and the U.S. In so doing, two key questions are at hand: <how big are they?, and <is size of industry relevant? Production systems in the Focus-6 group have evolved to take advantage of the resources at hand, ie. the beef industry in each region has evolved following the \"best use\" principle. The resources employed receive their best return as applied to beef pr oduction, given the production systems and alternatives available within the region. Contents For each cattle and beef producing region, core industry information is provided in the following areas: Core elements <size of the beef cattle herd <slaughter cattle production volumes <land use relating the forage base available to the production of beef cattle As available, or appropriate, the core information is supplemented by the following: Supplementary elements <number of farms involved in beef production. <beef operation investment <intermediate (feeder cattle) production and feeding capacity A listing of \"key elements\" is provided for each regi on, highlighting the important characteristics to keep in mind when moving forward to 1991 1996Census YearNo. of Farms Beef /i0/i0/i0 Grains & Oilseeds /i0/i0/i0 Other Source: Statistics Canada, Census of Agriculture,

Moving Avg Source: Statistics Canada, Cat. No. 23-603e Beef Industry Profiles 19a) Alberta Farms The Statistics Canada \"Census of Agriculture\" yields insight into the evolution of the Alberta beef industry over the longer term. At the 1996census 24,700 Alberta farms (gross income in excess of $2,500) were classified as \"beef\" operations, ie. the majority of their revenueswere generated from the production of beef cattle. This is compared to 19,500 beef operations 20 years previous. Although the total number of farms increased over the 1976 - 1996 period (from 50.4 to 54.6thousand), a significant shift was occurring in the composition of farms by type. The shares of beef and other (mixed; specialty crops; otherlivestock) operations increased from 38.7% to 45.2% and 15.3% to 26.2%, respectively. This shift was at the expense of the cereals andoilseeds industry, which fell from 46.0% in 1976 to 28.5% in 1996. Investment Average total investment in Alberta beef operations has risen by 45.3%, from $602.0thousand to $874.6 thousand per farm, over the 12 year period ending in 1999. The current asset portion of the balance sheet increased a modest14% while intermediate and long term assets (buildings, equipment and land, primarily) have gone up by 51.4%. As land is a significant partof the extensive operation's balance sheet, the movement in balance sheets tracks along with the increase in land values observed across theprovince. Average beef farm net worth has moved consistently with total asset values indicating, in aggregate, stability in the overall debt structure. Looking at liquidity, operations generally arecarrying sufficient liquid assets to cover debt requirements. On the solvency side, the industry average debt to asset ratios ranged from 13.4%to 16.8%. Although this suggests a stable, solvent industry in aggregate, there will be significant variance on a farm-by-farm basis. Cow Herd there it rebounded to its highest level of 2.1 Beef cow and replacement heifer inventories, m illion head in 1995, and has since tailed off to taken at January 1 each year, are considered as 1.9 million as at Jan. 1 , 2001.

Feed Beef Industry Profiles 20Feeding & Finishing Activity Over time, Alberta has solidified its position as a major beef feeding region, moving light feeder calves and feeder cattle to heavier feeder orslaughter weights. In general, statistics show net imports of feeder cattle into Alberta, from other provinces and the U.S., rising steadily from 138thousand head in 1986 to over 1 million head in 2000(p). These additional feeders complement the output of Alberta's 2 million breeding cows. Slaughter Cattle Production As a result of expansion in Alberta's feeding infrastructure, the production of slaughter cattle in the Province has increased substantially from roughly 1.4 million head in 1984 to 2.5 millionhead in 2000. During the early to mid-90's, slaughter cattle exports expanded to a peak of 732,000 head but steadily dropped back to anestimated 1/3rd of a million head by 2000. Expanded slaughter capacity and markets for Canadian beef have been key drivers in thistransition from live cattle to beef production. Feedlot Capacity Significant investment in intensive cattle feeding operations has taken place over the past decade. The Canfax \"Cattle on Feed\" report indicatesthat, as of Jan. 1, 2001, 63% of the Province's feed yards fall into the 1,000 to 5,000 head capacity range and hold 21% of Alberta'sfeeding capacity. Number of yards in the larger size ranges drops sharply thereafter. The large size operation group (20,000+ head standingcapacity), comprising 5% of the total number of operations, holds 34% of total feeding capacity. Forage Base As beef cattle require a significant portion of their life time diets in the form of forage drymatter, to sustain a sizable and growing beef industry requires a productive and dependable forage base. Alberta's tame hay and pastureacreage has grown consistently from 7.1 million acres in 1976 to an estimated 12.0 million acres in 2000.

However, considerable variation is expected about the \"average\" with respect to individualoperations, farm types and so on. <although the Alberta cow herd is subject to the same cyclical movements as the rest of theworld, there has been visible growth. <Alberta's beef feeding industry has grown beyond the bounds of the roughly 2 millionhead basic cow herd, with placements of an additional million head obtained from outside the province. <growth in slaughter cattle production has mirrored breeding herd and feeding expansion. A short term trend in slaughter cattle exportappeared in the early to mid-90's but dissipated towards the end of the decade. <Alberta's intensive feeding industry is concentrated in larger feeding units with roughly 46% of the total feeding capacity in the hands of operations capable of feeding inexcess of 15,000 head at any given time. <beef industry growth implies a complementary growth in sources of storable and grazableforages. The farm counts \"by type\" are one indication of a transition from grain production to forages. Expanded (cultivated)hay and pasture acreages over time are another.

Moving Avg Source: Statistics Canada, Cat. No. 23-603e Beef Industry Profiles 22b) Saskatchewan Farms Historically, Saskatchewan's agriculture industry has been predominantly based in crop production. With domestic regulatory changesand structural changes in the global grains and oilseeds complex, maintaining profitability and viability in the cropping sector has becomeincreasingly difficult. The transition of Saskatchewan's agriculture industry has two major elements as reflected in numbers of (census) farms over time. Firstly, the total number of farms has declinedsubstantially over the 20 year period of 1976 to 1996 from 65.1 thousand to 55.0 thousand. Secondly, the composition of the farmingcommunity has shifted. Although cereals and oilseed operations dominate, their share has diminished substantially. The number of grainand oilseed operations has declined from 54.0 thousand to 40.1 thousand, an average of roughly 695 per year. Beef operations havesteadily increased from 7,700 to 9,000 over the same period and are expected to show a similar increase in the 2001 Census. Investment Average total investment in Saskatchewan beef operations has generally mirrored Alberta's experience. However, the rate of increase and magnitude of investment are lower. AverageSaskatchewan beef farm investment (per farm) rose by 44.1%, from $401.7 thousand to $578.9 thousand during the period of 1987 to 1999. A host of factors are involved in the \"slow\" growth picture. The poorer returns to croppingand the transition of land to beef may have held land values down. It also takes time to develop momentum in the industry, in terms ofdeveloping a critical mass of operations that can solidify industry volumes and lead the next leg of expansion. Both economic and anecdotalinformation point to significant beef investment opportunities in the Province. Net worths, liquidity and solvency are following similar patterns to Alberta as well.

Their highest cow herd inventory was in 1976 when the provincial tally stood at 1.39 million head. The decline through to 1987 was precipitous, whencow inventories stood at 60.7% of the tally from 11 years previous. The herd has grown back through the next cycle just as aggressively,peaking at 1.32 million cows and replacements in 1996. Similar to Alberta, the slide back since has not been as dramatic and herds are expectedto build through the next cycle. Feeding, Finishing & Slaughter Activity Packing industry consolidation, local herd reductions and the development of large feeding industry in Alberta has lead to a shortage ofusable and or meaningful information on this segment of the Saskatchewan beef industry. With the renewed interest in beef production inthe Province, however, this situation is turning itself around. Anecdotal information will be combined with a few statistics to bringperspective to Saskatchewan's feeding & finishing business. Production of feeder calves is a product of cow herd inventories. Saskatchewan has gone through a period of time where relatively littlebackgrounding and finishing has taken place. Calves and mid-weight farm-raised feeder cattle were predominantly shipped to backgroundingand finishing operations out of the province. This is reflected in the 59.7% decline in slaughter cattle production (aggregated withManitoba) from 429.0 thousand head in 1988 to 177.2 thousand head in 1999. In recent years, however, there has been renewed interest in backgrounding and finishing cattle in Saskatchewan. This has been lead by aresurgence in cow herd numbers, combined with being viewed as alternative land use relative to cereals and oilseeds production. As at Jan. 1/01,the Province has developed finishing yards with standing capacity of approximately 114 thousand head. This complements the existingcritical mass of feedyards in Alberta in servicing the volume requirements of Western Canadian million acres). packing facilities.

Moving Avg Source: Statistics Canada, Cat. No. 23-603e Beef Industry Profiles 25c) Canada The dominance of Western Canada in terms of cow herd and slaughter cattle production is apparent through this section; discussions put into context the contribution of these Provincesto the country's overall beef production. Farms The number of beef farms in Canada has increased from 57.6 to 67.5 thousand over the two decade period ending in 1996. Alberta'sshare has gone from 33.9% to 36.6% during this period, while Saskatchewan's has remained relatively constant, ending with 13.3% in 1996. Investment Average total investment per beef farm in Canada has grown to $684.8 thousand by 1999. By comparison, Alberta averaged higher at $874.6 and Saskatchewan was below thenational average at $578.9 thousand per farm. Longer term balance sheet trends, as presented in the Canadian investment chart, are generally a reflection of a lower margin industry. Liabilities track fairly closely to current assets suggestingthat beef operations, in aggregate, remain relatively current. This is indicates the industry attempts to deal with risk over the longer termby maintaining liquidity and solvency ratios at reasonably high levels. Cow Herd The January 1 national cow herd inventoriesst moved from a mid-70's peak of 5.0 million head, bottomed-out in 1987 at 3.8 million head, and reached a new high of 5.2 million head in 1996. Since this period, herd numbers havedeclined with the down swing in the cattle cycle (to 4.8 million head in 2001) but are expected to rise again with the anticipated pricing pressurebringing more animals into the breeding herd. Longer term industry inventory statistics can also be used to estimate the average turnover, or lifetime, of female breeding stock. At the national level, the breeding herd turns over onaverage every 7 to 8 years. The significance of this turnover is twofold. Firstly, the shorter the responsiveness to market signals of preference. turnaround, the greater the industry's ability toadjust to technological change. Secondly, in Although information on average herd size has terms of meeting the needs of the market place, not been provided directly herein, the average shorter term ability to adjust the characteristic s number of cows on Canadian farms has been on of the breeding herd suggests greater the ri se.

Alberta and Saskatchewan have maintained a reasonably consistent share of the nation's cow herd through expansion and contraction phases. From 1987 to 2001, the share for these two provinces has grown from 62.6% to 65.5%. Slaughter Cattle Production Federally inspected (FI) steer and heifer slaughter statistics give an acceptable proxy ofthe ebb, flow and growth of the Canadian cattle finishing industry. They do not, however, reflect the magnitude, trends and year-to-yearvariation in exports of slaughter cattle. Alberta's share of national fed cattle FI slaughter methodically advanced from 28.6% in 1961 to 75.9% in 2000. The Western Canadian total moved from 57.2% to 79.1% over the sameperiod of time. Given the consolidation of slaughtering facilities, predominantly in Alberta, the convergence of the Provincial and WesternCanadian shares is expected. In terms of magnitude, Western Canadian slaughter has grown from 0.7 million head in 1962. It rose to a mid-period peak of 1.9 million head in 1977 and then slid back to 1.3 millionhead in 1991. Since that time, the volume lost has been regained and built upon, with FI slaughter in the West reaching an all-time highof 2.2 million head in both 1999 and 2000. The Canadian total followed a much similar pattern, with a low of 1.3 million steers and heifersslaughtered in 1962, moving to an all-time national high in 1977 of 2.9 million head, and settling in the vicinity of 2.8 million head in thelast two years of record. Feedlot Capacity Although size distribution statistics for feedlots across Canada are not readily available, cumulative Alberta and Saskatchewan statistics, as great an extent elsewhere in the country. complemented by anecdotal industry knowledge, lead to a few key observations.

The backgrounding segment plays a key role in the cattle production chain. Iteffectively smooths out the supply over time of heavier weight feeder cattle into finishing yards, employing more extensive forage based feedingand grazing systems in doing so. Forage Base Using tame hay, tame pasture and native grazing acreage statistics to represent the country's forage base, the strength of the beef industry inWestern Canada, supported by the forage base, is clear. In 1996, 48.5% of Canada's tame hay acres, 72.4% of the tame pasture acreage and75.0% of the nation's native pasture was situated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Acreage growth to support expanding beef production, is evident from the chart depicting Canadian acreage of tame hay and pasture, andthe proportions attributable to Alberta and Saskatchewan over time. The nation's cultivated forage acreage declined by roughly2.5 million acres from the 1976 to the 1986 census years. These lost acres were regained almost twofold over the next two census periods,bringing the combined Canadian acreage to 26.1 million acres.

Cent of U.S. Herd Source: U.S.D.A./N.A.S.S.: Agricultural Statistics BoardSouthwestNorthern PlainsMidwest% of U.S. Total Beef Industry Profiles 28d) United States The structure of the primary beef industry and production systems in the United States and Canada have much in common. Discussions focus on highlights of the U.S. resource base at anational level. Recognizing the size and diversity of the American industry, explanation at the regional level is also provided. Regionaltitles are used to represent specific state groups and may not conform to other published titles. Farms Over the 10-year period of 1988 - 1997, the number of U.S. farms reporting beef cows hasdeclined 9.9%, ending at 872.8 thousand operations. Regionally, Southwest (TX, OK) beef operations rose by 4.8% to 193.9thousand farms; Northern Plains (ND, SD, MT, WY) declined by 7.6% to 46.4 thousand farms; Midwest (KS, MO, NE) shrunk substantially by11.1% to 112.0 thousand farms with beef cows. Cow Herd U.S. January 1 cow herd inventories have gonest through a couple of cycles during the period 1976 to 2001. At the start of this period thenational herd stood at 51.1 million head. The tally fell sharply and then rose back to the next peak of 45.8 million head in 1982, followed by alengthier trough extending to the next peak in 1996 of 41.6 million cows and heifers. By Jan. 1 2001, the U.S. beef breeding herd stood at st 39.0 million head. Although it may appear that the U.S. herd is in a continued state of reduction, beef production (which is covered in the next section) has not generally followed suit. Over this period oftime, there has been a trend to larger finished cattle and carcass weights offsetting much of this decline in the basic herd count. The average turnover time of the U.S. herd ranged from 6.4 years to 7.7 years, based on theratio of cows to breeding herd inventory. This is marginally lower than for the Canadian herd. Keying in on the major cow/calf areas, from the 1976 peak to the 1996 peak the Southwest's herd shrunk by 1.3 million cows, (11.3%); the balance of the country the combined share of theNorthern Plain's herd declined by 13.1%, or key state groups has risen to 56.2% of the 852.0 thousand cows; and the Midwest's herd American breeding herd compared to 52.3% at contracted by 950.0 thousand cows, or 20.2%. the starting point.Given an even larger reduction of 26.0% in the/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Commercial Steer & Heifer Slaughterings - United States 22,00024,00026,00028,00030,00032,00034,000 1970 1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 1991 1994 1997YearNo. of Head ('000's) 30%32%34%36%38%40%42% Per Cent Source: USDA/ERS/NASSTotal Slaughterings% Heifers of Total Cumulative Shares of Fed Cattle Marketings within U.S. Regions, by Size of 1K-2K Source: USDA / N.A.S.S Agricultural Statistics Board/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Shares of U.S. Commercial Cattle Marketings, by Region, 1999 Southwest 28%Midwest 52%Northern Plains 6% Rest of U.S. 14% Source: USDA / N.A.S.S Agricultural Statistics Board Beef Industry Profiles 29Slaughter Cattle Production From 1976 - 1999, annual U.S. commercial steer and heifer slaughter averaged 28.2 million head, ranging from a low of 26.4 million head (1992)to a high of 31.1 million head (1977). Although there is substantial variation in the proportion of heifers of total slaughter over time (and throughcycles), there appears to be a rising trend. This supports the contention of intermediate term breeding herd reductions in that higher slaughterrates translate into lower heifer retention. Feedlot Capacity States included in the major cattle feeding regions are not exactly the same as those included for the cow herd tally, although theyrefer to a similar area. 1999 marketing statistics, by size of operation within each region, have been converted to cumulative percentages(similar to the Alberta presentation). This offers an indication of concentration of cattle feeding by size of operation. In the Southwest (TX, AZ, OK, CA), feeding activity is almost the exclusive domain of thelarger feeding concerns. Only 9.4% of the cattle marketed in this region originated from lots with a standing capacity of less than 16,000 head. Onthe other end of the spectrum, the Northern Plains area (SD, MN, ID) had 100% of the 1999 fed cattle marketings arising from lots of 16,000head capacity or less. The Midwest region's distribution of marketings by feedyard size was more evenly spread out. 46.7% of fed cattlemarketings arose from operations of 16,000 head capacity or less, with the remaining 53.3% originating from the larger two size categories. Forage Base Compared to the Canadian forage base, U.S. acreage in cultivated forages and native grazing is massive. 1997 total U.S. acreages were 61.1 million acres in tame hay, 64.5 million acres intame pasture and 580.1 million acres in native grazing. Comparably, in 1996 Canadian forage acreage tallied 15.3, 10.7 and 38.6 million acresin tame hay, tame pasture and native grazing, respectively.

U.S. seeded pasture acreage has declined by 23.7 millionacres, or 26.9%, from 1969 to 1997, ending at a total of 64.5 million acres. The three identified \"beef\" regions also experienced a tame pastureacreage reduction during this period, but only declined by 10.4%, from 38.1 to 34.1 million acres. Native grazing acreage tends to be morestatic over time and nationally fell 3.9% over the roughly 30 year period, ending at 580.2 million acres. In 1997, the Southwest, Northern Plainsand Midwest regions had 167.4, 124.8 and 40.4 million acres of native grazing, respectively, comprising 57.3% of the nation's total. Key Elements <although numbers of farms with beef cows have been shrinking at the national level, the major beef regions have declined at a slower rate (U.S. at -9.9% vs. 3 region total at -2.5%). Moreover, while the nation's count of beef operations declined over the late 80's to late 90's, the number of farms with beef cowsactually rose in the Southwest region. <25 years of beef breeding herd inventory data suggests that the U.S. herd has essentially\"restructured\", moving to a lower plateau. Although almost 1/2 of the herd still exists outside of the identified key production areas,there has been a longer term consolidation of herds in this direction. <changes in the size of the cow herd must be taken in context with volumes of beef produced (from the reduced herd) and how the U.S. meets its beef requirements now vs. themid-70's <U.S. commercial steer and heifer production and slaughter has mirrored the pattern of thecow herd inventories over time, with the appropriate lags associated with the beef cycle. Although there is considerablevariation in finished cattle production over time, there appears to be a slight downward trend.

There tends to be less pressure inthis regard in the less populated areas, where the cattle business tends to be migrating./i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Brazilian Cattle Inventories - All Types 140142144146148150152154156158160 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000* YearMillions of Head /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 Cattle Inventories 3 Yr.

Total Brazilian cattle inventories rose by 2.7% over the ten yearperiod from 1991 to 2000(e). Breeding cattle, feeding stock, dairy and draft animals tallied 153.3 million head in 1991, moved to a low of151.0 million head in 1996, then rose rapidly to 157.5 million head at the 2000 estimate. Estimates on the distribution of cattle by use divide the inventories into roughly 21% as dairy cattle and 79% for use as meat. In 1999, thiswas equivalent to 32.2 million head for dairy and 124.7 million head for meat production. Similar share estimates are available based on type of cattle, with cows comprising 32.6% of 1999 cattle inventories, and the proportions forheifers (1-3 years), calves and steers (1-3 years) coming in at 18.3%, 26.2% and 17.1%, respectively. This amounts to approximately41.2 million cows, 28.2 million heifers, 41.1 million calves and 26.9 million steers. Oxen and bulls comprise the remaining 5.8%. Slaughter Cattle Production Brazilian slaughter cattle statistics do not offer the definition among animal types that is available in North American information systems. Total slaughterings began the decadeat 28.2 million head for 1991, climbed gradually, mirroring the inventory counts, through to an estimated slaughter of 35.7 millionhead in 2000. This equates to a 26.6% increase over the course of 10 years. Land Use The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provides aggregateestimates, by country, on land use in agriculture, regarding: C\"arable land\" - generally annual crops plus shorter term forage crops and pastures C\"permanent crops\" - cultivated crops that generally do not have to be replanted aftereach harvest (includes shrubs, fruits, vines, usable for grazing. nuts; excludes trees for wood and timber), and C\"permanent pasture\" - land used permanently A distinction within these groups to define for herbaceous forage crops and generally harvestable forage

Profiles 33directly possible. The sum of these three categories is defined as \"agricultural area\". As of 1998, Brazil had a total of 618.0 million acres of agricultural area. According to FAO estimates, this has remained reasonably flat from 1995 to 1998. Of this total, 457.0 million acresare in permanent pasture, with a portion that may be harvested as forages. Roughly 60% of the arable land is attributable to cash crops,leaving about 55 million acres of cultivated area available for other uses including short term fodder, forages and grazing uses. Key Elements <the structure and production systems of the Brazilian, and for that matter South American, cattle industry is geared to a more extensive approach than observed in North America.Cattle production revolves around using the grazing resource for the beef cow herd through to the finished slaughter product. <Brazil's beef cow herd is large. A rough estimate, separating out dairy types, would peg their inventories in the vicinity of 40.4million head for 1999. <the buildup in Brazilian inventories is beginning to appear in slaughter cattle production, lagged by the extended period of time it takes to move cattle to slaughter weights under an extensive production system. <the momentum displayed in the inventory aggregate, in terms of total head counts, is likely mainly attributable to beef cattle types.Slaughter cattle production should follow suit. <Brazilian acreage available for grazing and forage production is large and growing. Eventhough this acreage is considered of lower productivity per acre compared to North American standards it has considerablepotential to support an expanding beef cattle production system./i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Argentinian Cattle Inventories - All Types 45464748495051525354 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999YearMillions of Head /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 Cattle Inventories 3 Yr.

Deduction is used to estimate this base using theproportion of the types and uses established for Brazil. Argentinian cattle inventories have gone through a period of significant decline. In 1994, total cattle inventories stood at 53.2 million head. They proceeded to drop 9.6% to 48.1 million head over the next four years ending in 1998. The 1999 estimates show a reasonable recoveryback to 49.0 million head. Slaughter Cattle Production Argentinian beef slaughter, including all types of animals, has declined from 1994 through 1999, tracking along with the decline ininventories. They opened the period with total slaughter of 8.9 million head and then hovered in the range of 8.6 - 8.7 million head for the nextthree years. 1998 slaughter fell substantially to 7.4 million head and then rebounded to an estimated 8.1 million head in 1999. Land Use According to FAO estimates, as of 1998, Argentina's agricultural area tallied 417.9 million acres. Compared to Brazil, Argentina's land base is weighted even more so to\"permanent pastures\". 83.9%, or 350.7 million acres of Argentina's total are in long term cultivated or native forages, mainly for grazing. 14.8%, or 61.8 million acres are in \"arable lands\", primarily devoted to annual and/or short term crop use. Key Elements <assuming distribution of cattle by type and by use is similar to Brazil, by deduction, of the 1999 year end total Argentinian cattle inventory, the breeding cow herd wouldamount to roughly 12.6 million head. <disease problems, mainly Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), have pressured substantialreductions in the Argentinian herd.

From that time through to 1999, total beef cattle on hand wavered in the range of 10.3 to 10.6 million head. Separating these 1999 inventories out by type, 39.3% (4.2 million head) were cows, 13.8% (1.5million head) were heifers ( > 1 year old), 22.1% (2.3 million head) were steers ( > 1 year old) and 23.5%, or 2.4 million head, were calves. Slaughter Cattle Production Uruguayan slaughter cattle production varied in the range of 1.4 to 2.0 million head per annum over the period of 1994 to 1999. Roughly 14% to 19% of annual cattle inventories come toslaughter each year. Land Use Although smaller in size, Uruguay's land use pattern is the most dedicated to extended grazing on \"permanent pastures\" of the three SouthAmerican countries reviewed. 91.2% of land classed as agricultural is in long term pasture and forage use. This amounted to roughly 33.4million acres in 1998. Permanent crop acreage was essentially negligible at 0.2%, or 100,000 acres. Annual (or \"arable\") crop covered 3.1million acres (8.5%). Key Elements <Uruguayan cattle inventories went through an early 90's growth phase but leveled off in therange of 10.5 million head, in total, thereafter.

In 1999,22.8% (33.2 thousand) were rated as \"specialty beef properties\" with the majority of revenues arising from beef sales. 19.0 thousand farms(13.1%) and 8.7 thousand farms (6.0%) were rated as \"Grain/Sheep/Beef\" and \"Sheep/Beef\", respectively. For this 3 year period, basically\"non-grazing\" operations averaged about 47.5% of the farming population. Investment Average total investment in Australian specialist beef properties was in the vicinity of $1.3million ($Cdn) for 1998 and 1999. These balance sheets included a land component averaging 30 to 35 thousand acres per farm. Liability levels were reasonably low during this period, with debt/asset ratios in the 9% - 10% range. Cow Herd Over the six years from 1994 - 1999, Australian breeding herd inventories started at a high of 12.1 million head, dropped rapidly in the following year to 11.2 million and then movedback through the balance of the period in the 11.6 - 11.9 million head range. In the absence of comparable longer term data, it is difficult todraw a conclusion on growth or contraction of the Australian herd. Distribution statistics for Australian beef specialist properties reflect common themes regarding the concentration of productionactivity in fewer, larger operations. The small size group (< 300 cows) contained 50.2% of the operations, held 9.7% of the country's cow herd,and was responsible for 15% of the nation's gross sales of live cattle. Operations in the 1,000 - 2,800 cow range comprised 13.9% of thefarms, held 29% of the herd and earned 29% of the gross sales. Although the operations in larger size groups (2,800+ cows) held about40% of the herd, they only generated approximately 30% of the gross sales. feedlot industry.

Putting this intocontext with the cow herd inventories, this is not necessarily a long term growth trend. It appears the Australian herd was building back toprevious levels. Land Use As at Mar. 31 , 1999, Australia's totalst agricultural land base stood at 1.12 billion acres. 5.1% (57.6 million acres) were devoted to cropproduction, 5.0% (55.6 million acres) were in \"sown pastures and grasses\", and 89.9% (1,007.5 million acres) was classified as \"otheragricultural land\". The latter is considered as extensive areas similar in concept, but not necessarily productivity, to North Americannative grazing acreage. This is the underpinning of the Australian \"grazing-based\" beef and sheep industries. In the six years ending at 1999, there has been a shift in land use and a general reduction in landapplied to agricultural enterprises. Cropped acreage has moved up 29.4%, or 13.1 million acres. The area in sown pastures and grasses hasdeclined 23.7%, down from 72.9 to 55.6 million acres. The \"other agricultural land\" category has contracted by 33.9 million acres, or 3.2%.

Generally speaking, industries based on a lower valued land base tend to follow extensive systems. Grazing and/or forageproduction is typically the economic \"best use\" of the land. Regions employing more intensive systems have more pressure from alternativeland uses and, therefore, in the longer term require that beef production be more productive, (ie. produce more of, and a higher valuedproduct) to justify the use of the land in this enterprise choice. Regions are not exclusively devoted to one system relative to another. There is typically a range in intensity of operations, positioned totake advantage of local opportunities and needs.

Beef Production, Consumption & Trade / Markets Purpose: to describe what and how much of Alberta's production of cattle and beef goes into its major markets plus insight into the rationale behind Alberta's presence in these markets. The intent of this section is to link the aspects of world beef production, consumption and trade in such a manner as to reveal: <the magnitude of the market, <the presence and relative importance of the major players, and <factors that can have short and long term effects on the momentum of established production and consumption patterns and trade flows. A key question in understanding the world beef trade is \"relative to what?\". Beef is produced in a wide variety of production situations, each yielding products of varying characteristics or traits. Consumer preferences, and subsequent consumption patterns, va ry world-wide. These preferences, and shifts in these preferences, are impacted by a broad range of in come, social and societal factors. Global trade of the \"commodity\" beef is an example of the principles of \"supply and demand\" in its simplest form. As products become more defined, although these principles still hold, the ability to understand the nuances of pricing and volume movement fades. Dyna mic choices are made in a dynamic production and marketing system. Each of these are based on \"relative to other influencing factors\". Contents Although the components of global production, consumption and trade work together in a dynamic system, they are presented individually in this secti on to highlight important features within each. The section closes by drawing each of the components back together, highlighting the role and interactions ofeach in the global beef and meat complex. Information is organized into the following areas: a) Who Produces Beef ? - identifying the major players in world beef production and putting this in context with the major competing sources of meats. b) Who Eats It ? - identifying the major consuming countries or regions, and touching on factors that drive the consumption of beef relative to other protein sources. c) Who Trades It ? - identifying the major players, and the magnitude of their presence, or market influence, in the global import and export scene, and d) Export Dependence - focuses on the \"residual\", ie. the significance of product available for export after production, consumption, imports and exports have been netted out. The section closes by tying together the observations on each of the components. Insights into the current and future relative performance of the Focus-6 within the global beef complex are offered. Discussions throughout this section tend to center on the Focus-6. The importance of other producing and consuming regions or countries is highlighted to add perspective on their role in the global marketplace, or provide an indication of a potential \"opport unity\", \"threat\" or Selected Countries 510152025303540455055 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 p 2001 fYearMillion Metric Tonnes CWE Source: F.A.S./U.S.D.A (p) = preliminary; (f) = forecastUruguay Canada Brazil Argentina Australia United States Other CountriesEuropean Union China World & North American Beef & Veal Production, 1965 - 2000 30354045505560 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000YearWorld - Million Metric Tonnes 10111213141516 North America - Million Metric TonnesWorld North America Source: F.A.O.

Beef Total world beef production is pressing the 50 million metric tonne (mmt) mark. The Focus-6countries produce roughly half of this total. The world's top four beef producing regions during 1999 were the United States (24.7%; 12.1 mmt), the European Union (15.3%; 7.5 mmt), Brazil (12.8%; 6.3 mmt) and China (10.3%; 5.0mmt). Rounding out the Focus-6 countries in order of the proportion of world production (1999) has Argentina with 5.8% (2.8 mmt), Australia at 4.0% (2.0 mmt), Canada with 2.5% (1.2 mmt)and Uruguay at 0.9% (0.4 mmt). Of note from the \"Other\" 24% of the world's production of beef are Mexico (3.8%), the Russian Federation (3.8%), India (3.4%), and New Zealand (1.1%). These four countriescumulatively produced 12.1% of the world's beef in 1999 (roughly 5.9 mmt) with the remaining spread over the balance of the world'sproducing regions. FAO long term statistics indicate that world- wide fresh, chilled and frozen (FCF) beef production, a subset of the total, has grown from 31.8 mmt in 1965 to 57.2 mmt in 2000.

Short to intermediate-term price signals take considerabletime to be translated into production responses. Major Meats Beef is but one commodity, or \"consumption choice\", in the global meat complex. Poultry, pork, lamb, fish and other meat production comprise a large proportion of alternate animal protein sources. World production statistics forpork and poultry provide perspective into beef's relative role. Global production of major meats (poultry, pork and beef) has ranged from 167 mmt in 1996 to 193 mmt forecasted for 2001. Over this time,annual poultry production has ranged from 50.4 to 59.6 mmt; pork has gone from 69.9 to 84.3 mmt; beef has ranged from 46.6 to 48.7 mmt. At first blush the global beef production complex appears very large. However, beefcomprises a relatively small, but significant proportion of the total meats produced world- wide. Using 1999 as the period of comparisonand looking at only the three major meats, beef'sshare of total production was 26.2%, followed by poultry at 30.2%, and capping out with pork at 43.5% of global production.

There is a subtle difference between consumption and demand for a product. Generally speaking, consumption refers to thedisappearance of a product subject to short term supply (or availability) at a prevailing price. Demand is a longer term, more dynamic notionincorporating: <drivers of longer term per capita consumption trends (such as tastes and preferences; culturalfactors; product acceptance; income levels and distribution; etc.) <response to prices of the product and its substitutes, and <population. Typically, consumption (or disappearance), ashort term observation, cannot be directly related to the longer term relationships of \"demand\" per se. Simplistically, consumption equalsproduction plus/minus change in stocks. This section relays information on consumption. Later sections refer to adjusting productattributes to meet segments of demand. Beef consumption is closely linked to the events occurring with other meats. Some of this interaction will be covered jointly in the Major Meats consumption section. Beef World beef consumption has averaged in the vicinity of 47.0 mmt over the period of 1996 through 2001(f). With the exception of 1996,consumption has varied within 2% of this average. Beef consumption (quantities and shares of total) and proportion of the world's population, by selected countries and regions aresummarized as follows: The U.S. and the European Union constitute the largest share of world beef consumption, driven by the sheer size of their populations.Beef Industry Profiles 47The Focus-6 group, with 8.9% of the world's period.

Other plant-based sources alsoplay a significant role in meeting the dietary protein requirements of the world's population (although this is outside the bounds of thisreview, its affects should be kept in mind). This section provides perspective on the global market place in which beef is one of manyplayers, and helps put the \"supply and demand\" relationships into context. Consumption patterns of meats vary significantly by region, and by country, based on the factors noted previously. Food andAgricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) per capita consumption (PCC) estimates for beef and other meats by selected countries for 2000and projections through to 2010 are provided as reference. The chart illustrates the variability in total meat consumption, and beef as a component of the total. Hong Kong and the United States lead the\"selected countries\" group with a meat PCC of 115.2 and 116.1 kg. per person per year, respectively. Beef's shares of these totals arevastly different, however. In 2000, Hong Kong averaged 11.8 kg compared to the U.S.'s 45 kg. The comparable Canadian average consumptionwas 92.3 kg. of meat per person per year, of which roughly one third was beef. Change in PCC over time is a gradual process. Of the countries presented, beef PCC changes are modest. Brazil, Australia, Canada and HongKong have the largest projected PCC increases over this 10 year period at 3.9, 2.8, 1.6 and 1.5 kg. per person per annum respectively. Argentina, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Japan, Korea and China are projected to increase beef consumption to between 0.5 and 1.0 kg. perperson per year. The U.S. and the European Union are actually projected to decline by 1.8 and 1.4 kg. per year lower than their 2000consumption levels. Increases in other meats' PCC are more aggressive, however. Of the countries presented, Japan is the exception with a predicted increase of only 1.0 kg. per person peryear. At the top end, the U.S. and Korea are expected to increase PCC of other meats by 11.0 and 8.5 kg. Argentina, Australia, Brazil,Canada, Mexico will see increases in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 kg. The Russian Federation, Hong Kong and China are projected to increase PCCof other meats by 4.4 kg., 4.4 kg. and 3.6 kg., respectively. Looking at the population element, according to FAO, the world's population has risen 10.1% from 1992 to 1999, roughly 1.4% per annum. The global total stands at roughly 5.98 billion people at the end of this period. In terms of magnitude, China has the largest population of the countries presented, at about 1.3 billion, or 21.3% of the world's total. The\"Other\" grouping, which includes all of the countries not specified in the chart, accounts for 3.2 billion, Source: F.A.S./U.S.D.A (p) = preliminary; (f) = forecast Beef Industry Profiles 49Population growth varies from region to region as well. Developing regions tend to have higher growth rates, such as South America at 1.58% per annum. The \"Other\" grouping noted abovecontains a broad cross-section of countries but is generally dominated by developing countries. This group has experienced a 1.87% averageannual rate of population growth. The U.S., European Union and China experienced growth rates of 0.91%, 0.26% and 0.98% respectivelyover the period. The Russian Federation actually had a negative growth rate of -0.19%. Total world meat consumption is a product of consumption patterns and population.

The trade in beef among countries relates the \"netting out\" of production less consumption, leaving a \"residual\" available for trade. It is also important to lay over this net the notion that preferences for certain cuts or product types will also affect trade flows. Imports The record of the world's top 10 beef importing countries is used to give perspective to thissegment of trade. Cumulatively, imports of beef by this group has grown by approximately 1.0 mmt, from 3.62 mmt to 4.60 mmt over the 1999to 2001 forecast period. The major players on the beef import scene are the United States and Japan. The U.S.'s large and rising share (1.3 mmt in 1999) relates to feeding its population base and its presence intargeted export markets (as per the following section). Japan's reliance on beef imports (0.97 mmt in 1999) arises from the combination of itspopulation base and the focus of domestic beef production resources on high valued, focused products. Mexico and the Russian Federation are notable in that circumstances occurring in their countrieshave affected their beef import patterns. Mexico's beef imports have risen dramatically from just under 0.1 mmt in 1996 to over 0.4mmt in the 2001 forecast period. Economic and political instability in the Russian Federation, compounded by foreign currency shortfalls,have resulted in relatively large year-to-year variability in beef imports, ranging from a high of 0.7 mmt to a low of 0.35 mmt. Japan, the European Union, Canada, Korea, Egypt and Hong Kong consistently accessed theworld market for their beef supplies over this period, with 1999 import volumes of 0.97, 0.38, 0.26, 0.21, 0.11 and 0.07 mmt, respectively. Key Elements <to give perspective to the magnitude and importance of the beef import volumes of the top 10 group, in 1999 their import volumes were roughly equivalent to:C75% of the product offered into the world market as exports C9.0% of the world's total consumption of beefC2.3% of the world's total consumption of major meats. <the charts express carcass weight equivalent volumes but do not differentiate by type of product imported or the associated value.

USDA (carcass weight equivalent basis) Beef Industry Profiles 52Exports USDA short term statistics on world beef exports show total volumes ranging from 5.1 mmt in 1996 to 5.8 mmt in 2001(f). FAO'sestimate of the value of beef exports pegs this volume at approximately $18 to $21 billion. The Focus-6 share of world beef exports in 1999 was 68.8% of the volume and 47.8% of the value traded. Within this group the break out ofvolume and value sheds some light on the roles of the trading partners within the world. Generally speaking, short term export volumes are tracking in the range of population growth with the value of exports tracking along side. Export value information has been converted to Canadian dollars for consistency of comparison but this requires closer scrutiny due to changesin relative exchange rates. Key Elements <the United States and Australia are the dominant players in beef export circles with 41% of the volume and 32% of the value. <significant differentials between the share of volume vs. the share of value indicate the composition of product traded. A value share for a country in excess of its volume share implies the product traded is of relatively higher value. Particularly,Cthe \"Other\" block moves 52% of the value compared to 36% of the volume. This suggests that the product traded is likelyspecialized, \"value-added\" product, processed to meet a specific market

This comprised 50.2% of the total U.S.value. American exports are focusing on higher valued market segments. Cthe U.S. is the dominant destination for Canadian beef, taking in 80.8% of the volume and 90.4% of the value of product leaving Canada. Over the short time frameof information available, Canadian volumes and value of shipments have expanded significantly. Volume-based in-roads havebeen made into the Japanese, Korean and Mexican markets. Cthe primary destination for Australian beef is the Japanese and American markets, combining for 69.6% of Australian volume and 77.2% of their value in 1999. Productentering the U.S. market, however, is roughly half the unit value of that going to Japan. CBrazilian export volumes have doubled across its major trading partners, and almost tripled in the \"other destinations\" groupfrom 1994 to 1999. In this latter year, a few specific European Union countries absorbed 44.9% of Brazil's export volume and 49.8%of their export value. Average unit values of product shipped are comparable with that coming from Australia but generally lessthan Canadian and American export product values. CArgentinian and Uruguayan trade statistics, by destination, are available for value only. Without volume statistics it is difficult to surmise whether the root of changes is inexchange rate fluctuations, or other event or trend-based factors. Both countries export significant product value to other SouthAmerican countries and have a substantial share of their totals moving into the European Union. <The final leg in the review of global export roughly $350 million. markets is defining Alberta's contribution to CCanada's exports of beef to the U.S. have Canada's beef export trade.

Statistical Database & FAS / USDA Beef Industry Profiles 56d) Net Trade and Export Dependence The progression through production, consumption, imports and exports leads to \"What's Left Over?\", ie. what is the residualcommodity available to meet the consumption needs of countries in deficit. Looking at any one of these elements in isolation can lead tounfounded conclusions. The three key factors driving the world beef complex are: <Net Trade : after production, consumption and imports are accounted for, the magnitude andvalue of the \"residual\" product available for export (if any), <Market Share : the volume- and/or value- based influence a country exerts relative to competitors, and <Export Dependence : a country's dependence on export markets to dispose of production in excess of its needs. For current purposes, export dependence is defined in percentageterms as: = [(1-(Consumption/Production)]*100 Each of these three factors are addressed separately. Net Trade Net export volume statistics are provided primarily for the Focus-6 group to show the relative presence of these countries in world beef trade. Australia leads the field of countries in terms of net export volumes, moving up from 1.0 mmt in1996 to 1.3 mmt in 2001(f). Over the same period, Brazil has increased from 0.13 mmt to 0.59 mmt, Argentina has declined from 0.46 to0.30 mmt, Uruguay has remained relatively constant in the 0.20 - 0.25 mmt range, and Canada has moved from 0.05 to 0.26 mmt in netvolume. The European Union's net export volumes are provided to give perspective to the Focus-6. The Community's volume was highly variable for the period but declined generally from 0.71mmt in 1996 to 0.20 mmt in 2001(f). The EU information is a soft comparable at best.

However, the effect of relative exchange rate movements (ie. shifts among countries) must also beconsidered when undertaking inter-country value-based comparisons. Australia's net export value has climbed consistently from $2.19 billion in 1996 to 2.89 billion in 1999. Brazil has moved from aposition of almost a zero trade value balance to $0.55 billion. Canada has progressed over the four years from $107 million to $0.89 billion.

Re-establishing disease Regions with more intensive production systems are more sensitive to the effects of diseases likeFMD. Extensive production systems do not rely on productivity as keenly to create economic margins. Intensive systems, such as those inNorth America, stake their success and competitiveness on their ability to harvest these efficiencies. FMD knows no borders and tends to be readily transmitted on a regional basis. Once it enters aregion, the likelihood it will be transmitted to surrounding countries rises dramatically. This can be either through trade of infected domesticlivestock or through passage to wildlife and subsequently to domestic stock anywhere along the \"migratory\" path of the wildlife. Detection and eradication are key considerations. FMD is difficult to definitivelydetect in a short time span, giving a chance fordomestic and wild species would imply that free status could take in excess of two years.Summary Statistics - Production, Consumption & Trade (Estimates for the base period of 1999 unless otherwise noted) Canada U.S. Brazil Argentina Uruguay Australia R.O.T.W.

Beef Industry Profiles 614. Market Analysis, Outlook and Export Market Features Purpose: to describe the main market features driving short and intermediate term prices, demand and supply of Alberta cattle and beef products in domestic and global arenas. The intent of this section is to link the impact of world beef production, consumption and trade patterns on local product values. These fundamentals will be the primary drivers of cattle and beef markets over the next decade. Market analysis focuses on the broad fundamentals of supply and demand. Market supply is characterized by the aggregate sum of cattle (and b eef) individual producers want to produce and deliver to the marketplace. Market demand reflects the aggregate volume that all potential buyers of beef (and cattle), in Canada and abroad, are willing to purchas e. Demand for feeder cattle is 'derived' from the demand for beef. Price determination is the interac tion of these market forces which establishes the market price level . Factors which have a bearing on the amount of product being supplied include: the price of cattle and beef, the number of producers (at each level of the beef supply chain), technology and productivityenhancements, the price of inputs, the price of a lternative products which could be produced from the current resource base, and unpredictable events like the weather. The concept of demand relates to consumer choice. The demand for beef (and cattle) shifts over time as a result of such factors as: consumer demographics (population, age distribution, labour force mix), consumer income levels, the supply and price of related goods (both competing and complementary products), health and food safety concerns, consum er tastes and preferences (health and nutrition, convenience), and expectations about future prices and supplies. While a great deal of effort is expended on tracking and reporting supply and price information, demand analysis tends to be much morequalitative by nature. Contents The first two sections, (a) Domestic Market, and (b ) World Beef and Meat Markets, review the domestic market fundamentals in relation to the global marketplace as follows: i) Supply - production and consumption trends - affect of cycles and positioning of Alberta industry - situation for calves, feeders, and fed cattle markets - emerging and/or potential market influences- summary & outlook ii) Price - situation for calves, feeders, and fed cattle markets - affect of cycles and positioning of Alberta industry - summary & outlook iii) Demand - pricing & volumes - macro factors - emerging and/or potential markets - summary & outlook An overall summary of the market analysis is provided in section (c).

Almost 60 percent of these animals are shipped out of Alberta feedyards. In short, while the number of fed cattle heading to markethas increased, the volumes of cattle processed in Canada increased more than 24 percent (or almost one million head) from 1995 to 2000. Live slaughter cattle exports have declined from the 1996 peak of 1.3 million head in response to this added processing capacity. The challenge for industry with the continued growth of Canadian feedyard capacity, and thesuccess of the Restricted Feeder Program for importation of US feeder cattle, is to accommodate the larger fed cattle supplies thatlie ahead. With the increase in cattle inventories which is projected over the next cattle cycle, fed cattle supplies are estimated togrow at a annual rate of just under 5%. The United States will remain an important residual market for the growth in Canadianbeef cattle production. Cattle Supply The Canadian cowherd has been in a liquidation mode for the past five years.

The ability to increase Canadian beef production is in part tied to further increases in Canadian processingcapacity. In the short term, strong retail beef movement and a slight decline in beef production through 2002/2003 will keep beef supplies tight. Cattle Cycles In analyzing livestock markets there are three time dimensions closely followed by industry - cycles, trends, and seasonal patterns. Cycles refer to events that tend to repeat over a periodof years. The cattle cycle is a much-discussed example of this concept and is in large part a response to the biological nature of beefproduction and individual producer's attempts to maximize profits by expanding and contracting their operations. The time it takes to respond tothese economic signals creates a lag between price peaks (bottoms) and inventory peaks (bottoms). In the case of favourable price expectations, anot her two years.

In time, this expansion of the breeding herd Since the price lows of 1996, the cattle industry increases the available cattle supply, which has been quickly trimming inventories. Recent causes prices to turn lower.

Beef Industry Profiles 66ii) Price The integration and interdependence of the Canadian and United States beef cattle marketsis well recognized. For this reason prices are largely determined in a North American context. Due to the significant difference in size of thetwo markets, it is commonly argued that cattle and beef prices are determined in the US market, with Alberta prices reflecting the differentialsfor exchange rates and transportation. While there can be considerable week-to-week variability, the longer term trend for the Albertafed cattle market is about $8 (Canadian) under the Southern Plains market. Cattle prices have been healthy in recent years despite record level beef production. These markets should continue to ride the wave ofstrong demand for beef, low feed costs, and tighter feeder cattle supplies. <cattle markets hit record price levels in 2000 on renewed beef demand and low feed costs. <calf prices improved 20% in 2000 while fed cattle markets were up more than 6% to recenthighs of $1.22 per pound. <high calf prices also meant record level buy-sell margins, sending feedlot breakeven'ssoaring.

Low-costproducers such as the Focus-6 continue to gain export market share while the EU share drops due to BSE concerns. According tothe latest Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) US and World Agricultural Outlook (January 2001) : <productivity improvements and product innovations driven by adoption of new technologies and favorable structural transformation expand production potential. <shocks from disease outbreaks in major importing and exporting countries\u2014FMD in the EU, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, andArgentina; CSF in UK; and BSE in most of the European Union\u2014impact the world meat markets and trade flows. While beef is a global commodity, produced and consumed worldwide, relatively few nations areinvolved in the large-volume trade. Among the major beef exporting and consuming nations, the net trade (defined as exports less imports)constitutes a small (about 10% in 1999) but growing percentage of total beef production. This percentage is almost twice as high forCanada. The Focus-6 beef producing nations are expected to account for over a third of the world beef production by 2005, with net trade increasing to about 13%. By then the Focus-6will account for almost 60% of all beef exports and 24% of all beef imports. With cheaper land and labour costs, major grass- fed beef exporters like Australia, New Zealand and South America will retain their advantage inproducing low-cost commodity beef.Canada's competitive edge lies in producing a high quality, grain-fed product. The root ofsustaining this advantage lies more in product differentiation (witness the extent of branded beef products) and extracting premiums for thisspecialized product. IBP, Inc.'s merging of case-ready beef packaging and the launch of its branded product line represent a significant shift in product development. Branded, case-ready beef alsoseeks to capture processing efficiencies.World Meat Prices $20$30$40$50$60$70$80 1995 1998 2001 2004 2007 2010US Dollars per cwt.

FAPRI estimates global meat consumption to increase by more than 4 kilograms per person over the nextdecade. This translates into more than 2.6 million metric tonnes of increased meat trade. <world price of beef increases by 3.27 percent annually in the next three years, peak price of pork increases by 0.5 to 2.1 percent, while price of poultry sustains an increase of 0.36percent. <higher prices induce growth in world meat production by 0.92 percent for beef, 1.49percent for pork, and 2.51 percent for poultry. For beef, lower production from declining North American fed cattle supplies until herdrebuilding is underway are supportive to prices over the short term. World beef cattle markets tend to reflect the broad spectrum of beef production and trade. Differences in beef production systems - fromanimal genetics, feeding management, and processing technology through to the inclusion of dairy animals in the beef supply mix - andgovernment policies are part of the uniqueness of each domestic cattle market. Beef products are differentiated by such factors as the meat cut,quality, country of origin, and cultural differences. For instance, cattle prices in the grass-fed regions of Australia or South Americawill not compare directly to the major grain feeding region of North America, nor will they compare directly with the EU interventionpolicy price. For Canada, the benchmark remains the United States. Nebraska fed steer price is expected to increase 3.27 percentannually to a peak in 2003. The Alberta market should peak a year earlier with recovery in the Canadian dollar to plus 70-cent levels. North American beef prices are expected to remain strong through 2003 before easing insubsequent years once production and exports increase. South American beef prices will continue to be impacted by restricted meatexports from FMD concerns and foreign exchange issues. Until some level of consumer confidence for European beef purchases isrestored, EU cattle prices will also remain under pressure./i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0 /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0Major Beef Importers 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,000 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 Mexico /i0/i0/i0/i0/i0/i0S.

Global real GDP is projected to range between 3 to 4 per centannually to 2010. While the U.S. economy is expected to slow in 2001, longer term growth averages 3.5%.<rising per capita incomes (for example, at 6 percent in Asia), increasing population, market liberalization, and continuing urbanizationboost world meat demand. <FAPRI projects world beef, pork, and poultry import demand to increase annually by 2.71,3.38, and 1.82 percent, respectively. <largest increase in imports will come from Japan, Russia, Taiwan, South Korea, andMexico (for NAFTA partners). FAPRI projects an increase of more than 30 per cent in beef trade over the next decade. The United States is regarded as capturing the bulkof export potential, becoming a net exporter of high quality beef over the next decade. This increase in beef demand by importing nationswill in part be met by increased beef production as North American inventories start to rebuild following the past five years of liquidation.<Canadian beef export demand increases more than 30 percent, or 180,000 metric tonnes, over the next decade. <BSE crisis has sharply reduced European beef demand (another 10% for 2001). Animal destruction schemes across the EU havesimilarly reduced beef supplies and moderated price declines. Meat demand is forecast to gradually recover through 2003. Rising consumer incomes and trade liberalization in developing nations represent a significant opportunity for longer term growth in global beef demand. Industrialization, andincreases in discretionary incomes, leads to greater demand for food items. Ultimately, these consumers begin to broaden their diets toinclude more animal protein and higher valued import meats. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) estimates that overhalf of this increase in the global demand for meat products will originate in China and the developing areas of Asia. The potential existsfor beef production to capture a share of this demand for animal-based protein.Calf Price Cycle: 2001-2010 (Annual Price - Alberta 5-600 lb.

Record level market prices, driven in part by recent gains inbeef demand, should benefit from the reduced beef supplies ahead. In the longer term these prices will come under pressure from increasedsupplies once the herd expansion of the next cattle cycle is underway. Market fundamentals and an analysis of cattle price-volume cycles suggest a tightening of North American feeder cattle supplies over theshort-run as more heifers are diverted from the feedyard to pasture in order to expand beef herds. As the calf crops begin to increase, alarger supply of feeder calves will be added to the production mix. The peak in animal uncertainties related to disease outbreaks and production (in terms of calf numbers) is not drought-related impacts on cattle inventories. anticipated for another five to six years if this cattle cycle holds true to form.

A few things to keep in mind when reviewing these projections: 1) they are not \"forecasts\" of future values, 2) a number of variables, for instance the weather, can impact agriculture in a fashion that one cannot reliably predict, and 3) each annual data point (price or quantity) is represented by a single number which is in fact the mid-point of a prediction range and generally, the farther out the benchmark in terms of years the wider the confidence interval. These baseline reports, generated from econometric mode ls of world agricultural markets, are designed to project the course of commodity markets under a no policy change scenario.Beef Industry Profiles 74d) Overview of Selected Export Markets & Opportunities Mexico Concerns/Issues The dumping case against the U.S. provided Mexico has an expanding population and a shrinking availability of fertile farmland. Mexico is subject to periodic droughts and feedcosts are high. Currently, Mexico is in the process of rebuilding its livestock populations with the help of government programs. In addition to Canada, Mexico also has free- trade treaties with the U.S., Chile, Costa Rica,Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, the European Union, Israel and Nicaragua. However, negotiations to include most agriculturalproducts in the European Union FTA have been postponed for three years. Canada is the second largest exporter of beef products to Mexico, after the U.S. Emerging competitors may come from South and CentralAmerican countries, particularly if a Free Trade of the Americas agreement is signed. The Mexican government is planning to extend value-added tax (VAT) to foods that are currently exempt, as part of its initiative to raise Mexican buyers are importing more productsits tax income.

Long range projections are that Mexico andCanadian exporters with an opportunity to expand their presence in the Mexican marketplace. Mexican buyers began importingCanadian beef at the time of U.S. tariff restrictions. They are largely continuing to buy the Canadian product, having establishedrelationships with Canadian packers and becoming aware of the quality and yield of Canadian beef. Supermarkets and distributors used to buy their imported beef through the services of brokers.Now they often deal directly with the Canadian packers. These packers often extend credit for up to 21 or 34 days - the kind of extended creditpreviously provided only by brokers. The Canada Beef Export Federation office in Monterrey provides a local presence for members and hosts incoming buyer missions to Canada.

United States Concerns/Issues Those Canadian livestock producers who wish The Canadian and US cattle and beef markets are highly integrated with relatively free movement of beef, beef products and live cattle. All meat products imported into the United States are required to bear the country of origin label on the container in which the products areshipped, as well as the establishment number assigned by the foreign meat inspection system and certified by the US Department ofAgriculture (USDA). These new country of origin labeling requirements could create a conflict with international trade agreements andbe viewed as a technical trade barrier, depending on how they are implemented. Anecdotally, northwestern states are complaining that American cattle prices are being depressed due to the volume of Canadianfattened cattle being imported into the US. The USDA passed a Final Ruling on regionalization (1997), eliminating federal testing requirements for brucellosis for Canadian cattle being exported the US. However, manystates continue to require Canadian cattle be tested and vaccinated.to market their animals as organically raised must meet a number of requirements. Animals for slaughter must be raised under organic management from the last third of gestation; fed100 percent organic feed; entirely free of hormones to promote growth and antibiotics (only vitamin and mineral supplements areallowed). The state of Wyoming has proposed that all meat from a foreign country must be labeled to identify the country of origin. This is counter to the direction of other initiatives in accordancewith the Canada-United States Record of Understanding on Agricultural Trade (signed December 4, 1998). A coalition including the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Farm BureauFederation, the Food Marketing Institute, the National Meat Association, and American Meat Institute, are petitioning the USDA to considerthe use of a voluntary \"Beef: Made in the USA\" label. This could be considered to be a trade barrier for imported beef from Alberta and couldbe argued upon the basis of National Treatment.Beef Industry Profiles 76While some parts of the Canadian beef grad ing on feed as opposed to retaining them for system are getting extremely close to the USDA breeding purposes.

This presents a good into the supply chains of the stores given our history of safety and quality. Japan Opportunities / Strengths achieving the full potential of its beef export Based on 1999 estimates, imported beef will account for 64% of Japan's total meat supply.The quantity of beef imports should increase by 2% per year over the next five years and is anticipated to reach over 750,000 MT from thecurrent 680,000 MT. Production of domestic beef has fallen in response to competition from imports and stagnant sales of Japanese BlackBeef. In addition, the number of Japanese farming operations has fallen due, in part, to a lack of successors for family farm operationsand concerns with pollution caused by farming. The United States and Australia dominate Japanese beef imports with 48.1% and 45.9% respectively. However, other countries, including Canada, have made headway and areexpected to increase their share of the Japanese beef import market at the expense of the US and Australia. 40-45% of beef produced in Alberta is shipped to the US and a considerable amount of that isexported to Japan. Clearly, Alberta is notvalue. Through targeted promotion and industry-wide improvements, Canada shouldattain 8% of the beef market share in Japan with Alberta beef making up the bulk of exports by 2005. Furthermore, Japan's decision to ban cloven- hoofed meat imports from Europe in response tothe outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease may have significant impact on the international meat market. The EU is one of Japan's largestsuppliers of pork products and although there is some frozen stock available in Japan, the supply is limited and prices have increaseddramatically. If the price of pork continues to rise, it is expected that Japan will seek out alternative sources of meat. North America iscurrently unable to meet the demand for pork and there is speculation that the value of meat such as beef and poultry will rise as Japanmodifies its demand. With barley-fed meat becoming an increasingly recognizable brand quality, Alberta is in an ideal position to takeadvantage of the import shortfall and increase its beef exports to Japan.Beef Industry Profiles 77South Korea Opportunities / Strengths Korea will remain a highly volatile market for In 1988, the Korean government was petitioned by the United States, Australia and New Zealand to liberalize its beef market under GATT regulations. In response, the Korean governmentagreed to a 14,500 MT beef import quota in 1988. The National Livestock Cooperatives Federation (NLCF) was given the duty ofdistributing imported beef. However, protests by Korean farmers and beef exporting countries, lead to the establishment of the LivestockProduct Marketing Organization (LPMO) to administer the quota in 1988. In 1990, Korea agreed to progressively increase the import quota and to establish the \"Simultaneous Buy and Sell System\" (SBS) fortourist hotels and restaurants. This system is granted a portion of the general quota and negotiates with the packers and exports directlyon product specifications and price. The SBS system has been expanded and by 2001 all beef import sales will be done using this system. In2000, there were 12 companies purchasing under the SBS system. This will open up in 2001 to all companies. Domestic cattle numbers in Korea have fallen in step with increased beef imports. However,imported beef. In the past six months demand for beef in Korea has dropped dramatically. This is in response to the negative publicity in the Korean media covering the BSE situation inEurope. Moreover, deep fear and pessimism over the liberalization has caused producers to reduce cattle feeding and the country's cattleinventory now stands at 1.71 million head, down 18.2% from last year. With decreasing cattle inventory and lower beef supply, the price of Hanwoo beef, Korea's domestic breed, has risen - thereby weakeningits competitiveness. There is also concern that liberalization will bring a rash of new importers/distributors into play resulting inexcessive build-up of inventory and further declining beef prices. It is expected that Korean consumers will return to their long-term beef consumption pattern after the issue with BSE and FMD are resolved. Korean consumer tastes lead to high quality beef creating a demand for chilled beef that is expected to account for 40% of all Korean beefimports by 2003. Canadian beef is recognized as very high quality and, with only 8% of the Korean beef market share, is in an excellentposition to increase its presence in that market. China Opportunities / Strengths will increase from 1.89 in 1998 to 2.23 kg. in At only 3 kg. per capita, representing only 8% of total meat consumption, beef consumption in China is very low. Despite this, import of beef, offal and processed beef increased from 7,819tons in 1997 to 24,647 in 1999. Canada accounts for 9.1 % of those imports and enjoys the fastest rate of growth, up 14 times between1997 and 2000. Increases in per capita income, the level of urbanization and population growth are positively affecting consumption of beef products in China. Based on surveyed data, percapita consumption of beef in cities and towns will increase from 5.58 kg. in 1998 to 6.73 kg. in 2005 while in rural areas per capita consumption2005 (calculated in retail weight). Urban consumers' expenditures on beef consumption outside the home have increaseddue, in large part, to more disposable income and a higher standard of living. Beef is difficult to prepare at home and consequently,consumption of processed beef has become popular. In addition, fast food restaurants have become established in urban areas and areencouraging shifts in meat preferences and consumption patterns. Canadian beef producers are focused on gaining entrance into the high-end beef market represented by hotels and restaurants. Expansion into this market is seen as a long-term goal and one that will becomemore prominent as China's economy grows.Beef Industry Profiles 78China's entry in the WTO will greatly enhance In 1996, AFRD signed a Memorandum of access of foreign meat into the Chinese market .

Costs and Returns Purpose: to describe the economic and financial performance of segments of the Alberta beef industry, leading to a statement of the (static) competitiveness of Alberta industry relative tocompetitors in our primary markets. The intent of this section is to provide beef pr oduction cost, returns and financial information for the Focus-6 group, keying in on the major industry compone nts. Based on the information provided in earlier sections, a gap is appearing in the \"cost competitiv eness\" logic based on the nature of the product (or commodity) being produced. A relative comparative a dvantage in the production of beef cattle is only one of the elements defining competitiveness. Howe ver, each region must be cost-effective in these areas.

Regional variability of enterprise profits is displayed by therange from a $39/cow loss in the Peace region to a $168/cow profit in the Fescue Grassland area. One of the major routes to long term profitability in cow/calf enterprises isthrough control of unit production costs. The chart portraying returns to equity for low and high unit cost herds offers somesupporting rationale. Those herds with higher unit costs did not return a profit to all factors of production from the lowerprice period of 1995 to the relatively higher priced period of 1999. The low cost operations turned a profit in the lastthree years of this period.

The herdsizes indicate that the estimates were based on smaller operations which typically have a more difficult time incovering total economic costs. IRM (Integrated Resource Management) program information from North Dakota,Kansas and Iowa (not presented herein) is more difficult to put into a comparable format, but does give an indication thatlarger units focusing primarily on cow/calf production do display lower per cow costs and improved profitability. Alltold, the U.S. cow/calf sector is likely far more cost effective than the estimates portray. Cattle Feeding Finish-to-slaughter margins, based on Canfax estimates, are similar to those provided earlier for Alberta feed yards. The costing and margin estimates areindicative of a fast moving business where cash flow management is key (ie. covering periods of negative returns with workingcapital brought forward from positive periods). Once again, the estimates are more representative of mid-sizedoperations and the larger operations, with economies of scale will display an upward shift in margins.Statement of Farm Revenues & Expenses - 1999 Brazilian Beef Operations - $Cdn (Extensive Cow/Calf to Finishing) Large Average* Farms Revenues -- $ per Bred Female -- Cattle Sales 278.97 271.96 less: Livestock Purchases (0.57) (0.60) 10.13 16.26Fuel & Utilities 9.80 8.15Repairs & Maintenance 11.08 8.90 Miscellaneous Cash Expenses 26.26 25.84 Paid Labour & 46.74 43.62 142.91 Capital Costs 32.94 Total Costs 181.21 174.13 Farm Income 97.18 97.23 Return on Capital 5.6% 5.9% Total Assets ($ / Bred Female) $1,743 $1,635 Bred Female Inventory FNP Consultoria, Brazil, 2000 * Overall average constructed from 3 average size group reports. Beef Industry Profiles 86Competitor Economic Profiles (cont'd) ii) Brazil The Brazilian, and for that matter South American, beef industry is a significant mind set shift from production practices observed inNorth America. Economic performance is indicative of the extensive, low cost approach employed in that country. It also reflects theorientation towards production of lower-valued \"commodity\" beef. The average farm size portrayed in the estimates, 3,087 acres, is not that different from the Canadian scene. The large unit group, however,is just that, averaging 18,550 acres per farm. Brazilian beef farm costing profiles have been compiled from FNP - Brazil based on information gleaned from their accounting and consulting activities. To put this in context, theestimates are likely more comparable with the \"top management\" profiles presented in the Alberta section. Costing estimates are based on an all inclusive system from breeding through to sale ofslaughter animals. Feed costs are low reflecting the absence of concentrates. Grazing costs are low reflecting the low intensity managementsystem. Compared to North America, unit revenues and costs are significantly lower for both the average and large size operation. The net, however, is within range of the Canadian estimates atroughly $97/cow for the average and \"large\" groups. Return on capital, that all important \"comparator\" between regions, is in the 5% - 6% range.

The Australian industry has weathered somedifficult financial circumstances yet the top 25% of farms have shown a reasonable net return for the 1998/99 period. Farm acreage for the Australian \"beef specialist\" farms comes in at a national average of 29,000acres and a top quartile average of 76,000 acres. These support breeding herds of 300 and 700 cows, respectively. Converting the top quartile farm totals to a \"per bred female\" basis, value of production averaged$488 per cow and total costs (excluding valuation of contributed labour) came in at $310 per cow yielding a net farm income for thisgroup of $178 per cow. Allowing for an imputed operator labour cost of $55 brought the overall net to $123 per cow. Once again, comparing to primary beef industries world wide, the rate of return oncapital for the Australian industry average 0.2% overall and 4.6% for the top management group. There is one significant element missing from the Australian costing and that is in reference to their expanding grain-fed finishing sector. Although this is a relatively small proportion of the business they, as a country do, approximately half of the fed cattle output istargeted into the higher valued Japanese market. The Australian industry is making a move in some small way from \"commodity\" beef to\"product\" beef. For this reason, the Australian industry is emerging as a potential competitor to the North American industry.Transaction Costs Search costs Negotiation costs Monitoring and enforcement costs Policy Environment Competition regulationsTaxation & investment regulations Education & training of labour force Other regulatory incentivesVertical Supply Chain Linkages Information flows Quality Pricing efficiency Operational efficiencyProduction Costs & Efficiency Economies of Scale Productivity Competitive Pressure X-inefficiencies Managerial slackCompetitivenessFactors Affecting Competitiveness Factors affecting competitiveness Interaction between factorsAdapted from: Hobbs, J., \"Dimensions of Competitiveness: Lessons from the Danish Pork Industry, CAFRI, 2001 Beef Industry Profiles 90d) Other Considerations in Competitiveness Conventional industry competitiveness \"Operational efficiency\" refers to the cost- assessments focus on production cost and returns at the primary level. There are elements within the primary industry, however, inaddition to considerations from the farm gate to the consumers' plates, that can have a significant effect on an industry's overall competitiveness.

The farm level Danish pork industry is not considered globally \"competitive\" in the traditional sense. At the industry level, theopposite is most certainly the case.

The interrelationships among these elements and their (direct and indirect) effect oncompetitiveness is portrayed schematically in the diagram below. Transaction costs refer to costs associated with: <information search (products, prices, quality) <negotiating and carrying out a transaction <monitoring and enforcement (to ensure adherence to the terms of the transaction) Transaction costs affect competitiveness because they influence the efficiency with which priceand quality information flow along asupply chain, the incentives forinvesting in specific assets, and thenature of vertical linkages betweenproducers, processors and distributors. The closer the vertical supply chain linkages , the more the industry is able to respond to the quality needs of differentmarkets, enhancing pricing efficiencyand operational efficiency. \"Pricingefficiency\" refers to the effectivenesswith which price signals are transmittedfrom consumers back to producers andthe extent to which, in response to thesesignals, the market system efficientlyallocates resources and coordinatesproduction and marketing. effectiveness of the marketing and supply chain activities involved in moving products fromproducers to consumers. Policy environment influences competitiveness through competition regulations, taxation andinvestment regulations, education and trainingof the labour force, etc. Lack of competitive pressure (from other firms or industries) allows inefficiencies to creep intothe system in the form of \"X-inefficiencies\" or managerial slack. Production costs and efficiencies embody managerial and/or scale economies and productivity. They relate to those factorsdirectly affecting unit production costs. Some of the key features of the Danish pork industry influencing competitiveness are: Production Costs & Efficiency <productivity in the Danish herds is comparable to that observed in Canada and the U.S. <new producers entering the industry must complete a series of agricultural college courses, improving managerial skills and technology adoption, which enhancesproduction efficiency. <hog slaughtering is concentrated in the hands of three major firms, offering scale economies.Beef Industry Profiles 91Vertical & Horizontal Coordination <the bulk of Danish hogs are marketed through three farmer-owned cooperatives <these co-ops belong to an umbrella organization, Danske Slagterier (DS), which consults and negotiates with outside bodies on behalf of the industry, formulates industrystrategies and conducts market research, which is linked to breeding, technology and product quality research, providing the industry withinformation on requirements of different markets. The role of DS is key in that it encourages close vertical cooperationthroughout the value chain. Policy Environment <the government requires education and training on the part of new primary producers. <the industry implemented a voluntary on-farm quality assurance program (covering traceability, transportation, environmental standards, animal welfare, food safety, etc.) inresponse to demands of international markets and domestic policy makers. Transaction Costs <the traceability component of the quality assurance program is used proactively up anddown the value chain ensuring quality and product definition. There are a multitude of areas in which this system reduces transactioncosts throughout the value chain from producers to consumers. <market specific contracts, with a built-in audit component, reduces transaction costs throughout the value chain, as well. Competitive Pressure <recent merger activities have potentially lessened the competition in the industry.Comparison to the \"Beef Complex\" There are a number of similarities and differences, on a region-by-region basis, between the Danish pork case and what isevolving in the global beef complex. A few of the more relevant examples include the following:<integrated \"value chains\" are becoming more commonplace in the intensive North American industry. As packers and processors focus onserving product markets, their demands on the feedlot industry become more specific, and this specificity is moved through to cow/calfproducers as well. The use of contractual arrangements and premium pricing grids has advanced significantly. <live cattle pricing information in North America is relatively transparent with bids related to quantity and quality criteria. <economies of scale are progressing on this continent, especially in cattle finishing and slaughtering operations. <the Canadian cattle identification program offers traceback capabilities in the event of disease outbreaks. This same system offersconsiderable upside in terms of creating management information throughout the production chain. <the policy environment is promoting sound, humane production practices, environmental responsibility and food safety. For the established, intensive-style beef (product) system in North America to havesurvived and prospered in the face of extensive- style beef (commodity) systems in South America and Australia, many of these \"non-production cost factors\" must have evolved. Moreover, putting these in context with the developing finishing industry in Australia(moving higher-valued product into Japan), this is likely the competition the North American industry must be most aware of.Summary Statistics - Costs and Returns (Estimates for the base period of 1999 unless otherwise noted) - - - - Production Margins (1) - - - - Cow / Calf (2) Finishing $ / Cow R.O.A.

Issues and Opportunities Purpose: to highlight strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats pertaining to the long term growth of the Alberta beef industry. Focus is on over-arching areas of performance of theindustry from grass - to - consumer, industry level concerns and opportunities, governmentroles, responsibilities and partnerships. The intent of this section is to investigate the myri ad of issues facing the Alberta beef industry today. Along with each issue, opportunities in terms of potential actions, solutions, markets and industry development are presented. Key areas with in each issue and opportunity are highlighted. Contents : Issues and opportunities are organized into the following \"Focus\" areas: a) Focus on Unit Production Costsb) Focus on Products c) Focus on Investment and Infrastructure d) Focus on Balancing Business, Public and Consumer Needse) Focus on Trade and Trade Relations Discussions of each issue drive at necessary actions, directions and/or opportunities to build toward long term viability and growth of the industry in a local, national and global context. Sources : Issues identified and included in this section came from a broad range of sources. These include: - consultation with individual producers and businesses, - the product of AFRD's Beef Product Team consultations with industry, and- consultation with a broad cross-section of Alberta Agriculture staff. The thoughts and opinions expressed under each issue are a direct result of, or formulated upon, input provided from each of these sources.Beef Industry Profiles 95a) Focus on Unit Production Costs The North American beef industry is maturing. As a result, margins for producing beef cattle will naturally narrow over time. This places significant pre ssure on the primary sector to be the \"low cost\" source of product to remain competitive. Human cap ital and resources exist in Alberta to meet this challenge ... but the drive to ever lower costs will always be with us. Adoption of Management Skills, Information and Technology Issue : The primary beef industry is entering an erawhere business management skills are becoming increasingly important for producers to manage within an environment of narrowing marginsand higher risk. The rate of adoption of management skills, information and tools will have to increase significantly . Opportunities : Producers tend to focus first on adopting production technology to achieve efficiency intheir operations. Benefits are perceived as more immediate. Presentation of production technology in an \"economic analysis anddecision framework\", tailored to local applications, will enhance adoption. Ongoing investment in development of business management skills, targeted at operations withthe long term business goal of economic growthand sustainability, will contribute significantlyto the beef industry's prosperity. Alberta producers are diverse in terms of location, resources employed, business goals andfinancial status. This provides a challenge to effective delivery of management extension products, services and technology. However, asan \"extension audience\", producers are resilient, creative, flexible and at this time in particular, responsive to improving on business management information and skill sets . Key Areas : <As \"cost of production\" is a natural progression from \"production,\" it's a logical point to start extending \"management\" topics. <Tailor extension activities, information and technologies to different audiences and needs. <Although the aspects of marketing, financial, economic and risk management each requirespecific attention, they also need to be linked through the overall business planning process.<Create a visible linkage between economic and business management research anddownstream extension efforts. Public extension services are positioned to effectively create this linkage and are perceived asknowledgeable, unbiased and relevant. Public research and extension services also recognize and promote the integration of private serviceproviders in creation and application of business management information and analysis systems. <Risks and benefits associated with emerging \"business arrangements\". Research and Development: Production & Management Technology Issue : Commitment to research has been the mainstayof developed economies, yielding technology- based efficiencies and, indirectly, substantial public benefits. For the primary beef industry to keep its competitive edge, the pace of production research and technology development will haveto be maintained and focused. Moreover, not only have producers recognized the symptoms of declining margins, they have indicated the need for the information andprocesses to manage within that environment. Economic and business management information, research and technologydevelopment must be enhanced to complementthe production side. As the industry matures over time, countries that stay actively in the forefront of research and technology development will be the survivors. Those not making the investment will slowlylose prominence, market share and competitiveness. Their industries will diminish and, for all intents and purposes, disappear.Beef Industry Profiles 96Opportunities : <evaluation of alternative feeding management Alberta, with partners, has a significant syste ms (eg. straw-based rations, alternate day investment in the creation of beef production feeding) research, information and technology. Coupling <evaluation of alternative grazing management this with economic evaluation and systems (eg. swath grazing, stockpiled complementary economic research, will expeditethe flow and adoption of research andtechnology, creating production andmanagement efficiencies . This will act to reduce individuals', and the industry's, unit cost of bringing beef cattle to market. Significant opportunities exist at the beef/forage interface. Harvested and grazed forages need tobe recognized as a \"manageable crop\" and a valued input to beef production. Integrated beef/forage systems research and technology development, with associated economic analysisand extension, will form the basis for effectivelong term on-farm resource allocation. Unit cost reduction in both the forage and beef production will be the focus. Presenting this research in an economic evaluation frameworkwill improve the understanding and adoption by producers. Key Areas : <economic and financial research information, benchmarks and management tools relating tofarm level decision makers. <focused technology development regarding breeding and feeding. <mapping of human genome (80% overlap with bovine) may provide opportunities for breeding beef animals specifically for growth,feed efficiency, carcass quality and disease resistance. <productivity-based research into harvestable, grazable and combined-use forages by region and season of usegrazing, grazing annual forages, native range use alternatives) Innovative Business Arrangements Issue : The paradigm of operating businesses as soleownerships, or owner/operated entities, restricts producers from achieving attributes of \"scale economies\". There is reluctance in the industry, based on entrenched business mindsets and/or mistrust, to form business arrangements thateffectively reduce unit production costs. Opportunities : Business alliances, partnerships, cooperatives and joint ventures regarding input procurement,asset sharing and focused volume-basedmarketing hold significant potential for reducingunit production costs Key Areas : <information / intelligence gathering and sharing <machinery and equipment sharing <strategic management and sharing of land- based assets (forages and grazing) <input procurement in volume <volume-based marketing Beef Production \"Dichotomy\" Beef producers in \"extensive\" production systems (ie. cow/calf through backgrounding) are driven by the two following overarching pressures: a) matching their herds and production systems to the local production environment, striving for the \"type of cow\" that gives them optimal returns on their own farms b) match their products with what consumers, at arm's-length, are demanding. These two forces are not always in synchrony ... but the long term success of the industry relies on meeting the latter. Some creativity, at the farm level, will be required in finding a way to do both.Beef Industry Profiles 97b) Focus on Products Consumer needs and preferences are becoming increas ingly diverse, creating a whole series of market opportunities. The question for the Alberta beef industry is, \"How can these be translated to: - a reasonably definitive set of messages for producers upon which they can make longer term production & investment decisions?\" - a basis for the formation of 'value chains'?\" One thing is clear. A product focus is about 90 different in terms of business approach and industryo structure from the original roots of the industry. Products, not Commodities Issue : Historically, beef production has been commodity oriented. Cattle were raised, slaughtered and people ate \"beef\". With globalization, growing populations and rising standards of living, the consuming public isdemanding product with specific characteristics. These demand signals, and the concept of products, are being passed down through theretail, processing and production chain. The transition from a commodity to a product business approach must be made by individualbusinesses and the industry. Opportunities : From the cow/calf producer's gate, each ensuing member of the beef production chain, from the backgrounder to the retailer or food servicebusiness, relies on consistent and sufficient volumes of inputs to be transformed into specific products to meet clients' needs. The Western Canadian beef industry produces sufficient volumes of cattle to support strategic valuechain alignments. The primary focus of thisalignment is to target the exchange of\"products\" at each intermediate step, ending upat the final consumer with a beef \"product\" withspecific characteristics to meet a demand. bridge between the cow/calf and finishing The \"product chain\" is a continuum of musts and wants. Musts include the notion of food safety which is the responsibility of the wholechain. Wants include a set of increasingly refined characteristics. For live cattle, this includes attributes such as consistency, frametype, feed conversion, and cutability. Consumer wants include degrees of \"flavor\", consistency, convenience, and healthfulness. Musts areexpected. Wants, especially the more creative and specific ones, yield a premium. Targeting the beef industry to deliver on specific wants, or preferences, will bring the associated premiums.The United States is a net importer of beef in quantity, but a net exporter of beef in valueterms. Their industry direction is built on the concept of importing low-valued commodity and directing high-valued product, produced and/or processed locally, into the domestic and exportmarkets that pay premiums . Products created through intensive production systems (grain-fed) are strategically placed into the premium markets. Extensively produced beef commodity(grass-fed) is not a priority for their industry, and one in which they are not likely competitive. Moreover, a shift to intensive systems by theextensive, commodity-based regions, would not necessarily make them competitive in the product-based markets relative to their resourcebase and \"best use\" criteria. The Alberta, and Western Canadian industries share the U.S. model. Expansion and developmentalopportunities are directly linked to the successof the combined industries. Key Areas : <conscious, strategic alignment of groups of cow/calf and feeder cattle operations are required to meet the needs of specific feedingindustry segments. <further development of a forage-based backgrounding component would act as a industry, to meet the timing, frame and type needs of intensive feedlots. <sufficient slaughter cattle volumes would support differentiation and segmentation, at the packer level, of \"carcasses\" into \"productstreams\". <niche marketing chains, including organic, GMO-free, and other specific product,packaging and portion traits, involve \"gate to plate\" production systems and can service narrow value-based markets. These should beviewed as limited access markets, not necessarily suitable to the broader-based industry as a whole.Beef Industry Profiles 98<product development, keying-in on salable value chain that best suits their resource base. characteristics such as convenience, For processors, retailers and exporters, this consistency, flavour/tenderness. implies aligning sufficient upstream suppliers to <consumer product development focused in meet their downstream client demands. domestic and export markets with income and consumption growth potential in terms of th e The growing trend towards case-ready beef nature of products derivable from North products is a prime example of building on theAmerican production systems. \"products vs. commodities\" approach through <marketing activities focused on beef products, i nnovative business arrangements.

Closer linkages with <whereas the demand for commodity beef may the feedlot industry, communicating desired be declining overall, the demand for beef frame , size and finish, will be necessary. This \"products\" is on the rise. information, in turn, must be passed along to Innovative Business Arrangements Issue : The paradigm of operating businesses as sole ownerships, or owner/operated entities, relies onthe \"marketplace\" to deliver inputs and return value for outputs. There is reluctance in the industry, based on entrenched business mindsets and/or mistrust, to develop businessarrangements that enhance the ability to meetspecific client needs throughout the value chain.Pursuit of innovative business arrangements, up and down the product chain can yield both market premiums and cost reductions. Opportunities : Business alliances, partnerships, cooperatives and joint ventures linking specific product needs regarding input specifications, down-stream client needs, strategic information sharing, andfocused volume-based arrangements holdsignificant potential in improving overall value chain revenues and reducing unit production costs of value chain participants. Building on the \"product vs. commodity\" focus, knowledge of targeted product areas can beshared throughout the value chain. In the intermediate term, the knowledge of desiredproduct characteristics, plus the associated premiums and production costs, will form choice points for potential value chain participants. Members of the value chain, from primary producer to retailer, will be able to formulateinvestment and operational plans targeted atproducing to meet the value chain's, andultimately the consumers', needs. For primary producers, this means selecting the product orbackgrounding and cow/calf businesses, along with the premium structure associated with becoming part of this particular value chain. Key Areas : <creating volume premiums in feeder cattle sales through joint ventures or cooperativeswith the focus on martialing consistent, uniform packages. <information sharing among value chain partners regarding input characteristics required relative to targeted product characteristics. <strategic product adjustments to fill the needs of downstream chain participants. <recognition that both premiums and risks must be shared among value chain participants. <recognition that not all of a \"product chain\" participants' output will fit into the \"product-based\" stream. \"Commodity-based\" markets will remain as an integral component of the beef production system , providing a (lower- valued) market for output that does not fit intothe product-based stream. Research and Development: Products, Preferences, Markets & Value-Chains Issue : Similar to the production and management technology R&D issue, product development, market and consumer preference research creates market opportunities for Alberta beefproducts. Increasing the value, volume andshare of Alberta beef products in domestic andexport markets is key to the long term viability ofthe industry.Beef Industry Profiles 99Opportunities : <performance of business arrangements in In the intermediate term, in order to penetrat e information transfer, value- and risk-sharing. markets and maintain share, it is critical to have Improved knowledge base, incorporated into a sound understanding of consumer preferences working arrangements, will reduce \"failures\" and demand drivers in priority markets . This knowledge, gained through economic and demographic research, will lead short through long term product development. The functioning of value or product chains, in terms of participant relationships, performanceof chains (in whole or in segments), and theimplications of aspects of revenue, cost and risksharing, are not fully understood . To facilitate the industry's movement into the new businessorganization frontiers, it is appropriate to conduct and disseminate economic and management research for the benefit of all. Considerable private and public sector product development research is undertaken regardingbeef products. Linked with market area and preference information, \"product\" research can become more focused . Key Areas : <demand drivers / preferences in priority domestic and export markets: dietary changes;cultural and religious influences; shifts and growth in disposable income; specified product attributes relative to food preparationnorms, flavour and texture expectations. <beef does not share many of the traits of pork and poultry that drive their growth. However,much can be learned from the concepts of how they are presented to the consuming public. Beef products, in many instances will bedifferent from competing proteins ... this can be used as a strength rather than viewed as a weakness <food safety and the perceptions of beef as a safe, healthy food, are a must. Beef must have transparent product integrity. <with changing demographics and disposable incomes, convenience and consistency of quality take on greater prominence as producttraits. \"Case-ready meats\", \"minimal preparation\" packages and \"meals-to-go\" are examples. <defining live animal traits linked to product requirements.and the tendency to shift back to \"old ways\". Adoption of Management Skills, Information and Technology Issue : While larger, \"corporate\" packing, processingand retailing concerns tend to have well defined product, promotion and market area business strategies, there is a significant role to be played by smaller value-added processing, retail and food service businesses in expanding beef'sprofile in both domestic and export markets. The issue in this area is whether or not theirknowledge base, marketing and business skills,and information systems are sufficient to reachthe potential in this area of opportunity . Opportunities : A considerable amount of venture and/or equity capital exists in the small business world. The strength of small businesses lies in the energy and creativity they employ in servicingcustomers' needs. Business development,market and product information, andmanagement training assistance builds on thesestrengths . Regulatory compliance, in both domestic and export markets, challenges small businesses . Improved knowledge of local regulatoryrequirements, plus those associated with placing product in out-of-province or export markets, would strengthen these businesses. Key Areas : <marketing, operations and business management / planning skill development. <information and training in building food safety into operational plans. <information and training directed to increasing both domestic and export market expertise.Beef Industry Profiles 100c) Focus on Investment and Infrastructure The primary differences between devel oped and lesser developed economies are: - the magnitude of private sector equity in businesses, combined with - public and private investment in infrastructure, linking the businesses, and their products, to markets. Maintaining public investment in infrastructure is a challenge as there are many competing demands and differences of opinion as to how these funds should be directed. However, private sector equity view s public infrastructure investment as a statement of commitment to the industry ... shared visions and shared benefits require shared commitments. Resource Base Issue : The maturation of the industry placesconsiderable economic pressure on primary producers. The further back in the production chain, and the closer the ties to the land asset,the greater the pressure on margins. There is concern among producers that it is increasingly difficult to earn a reasonable rate of return(living) and that the value of their assets may bein jeopardy . Moreover, for producers desiring to pass on their farm to the next generation (ie.more than an economic tie to their farms), the economic viability of these operations in the hands of their heirs is a concern. Opportunities : The resource base in Alberta in terms of land,labour and capital (investment and human), the critical mass of the industry (5 largest \"rearing\" th and feeding area in North America), its proximity to (premium) markets, and the local production and availability of feed inputs (grain and forages) at reasonable cost, indicate that the industry is well positioned to be a significant player in primary beef production . The \"production cost focus\" emphasizes improving management skills. The upcoming generation's producers will be prepared to manage their businesses within this \"newreality\" . This includes effective within-farm (resource allocation) decisions, longer termstrategic business decisions (product focus; innovative business arrangements) and increased emphasis on technology adoption. The \"product focus\" emphasizes, again, strategic product plans tied to innovative business arrangements. Value chain opportunities will arise that offset pressures on margins and asset values.Key Areas : <unless there is an unforeseen shift in global beef production, the resource base devoted to primary beef production will likely stay inbeef production. <how beef operations are managed and the products produced will evolve over time. <assets (equity) will stay in the beef industry. The composition of the farming population (ie. the equity holders) will change. Labour Availability Issue : Scale of operations, regarding magnitude ofinvestment and pressures to incorporate and manage new technologies, have increased the need for skilled hired labour (to supplementoperator and family sources). Difficulties in finding and maintaining capable labour has been voiced as an agriculture-wide issue . It extends beyond primary agriculture toprocessing and value-added businesses. Opportunities : Training programs are emerging, particularly through vocational colleges, promoting working in agriculture as a career choice . A variety of production and management short courses are also available through public, private and industry organizations focused on skill andknowledge improvements and technology awareness. The labour market is competitive, particularly in Alberta where the oil and gas, forestry and high technology industries offer lucrative pay andbenefits. Agriculture has little choice but to compete in pay and benefits. Agriculture must also explore use of equity and/or profit-sharingas part of the terms of employment.Beef Industry Profiles 101Key Areas : <create appeal for agriculture as a career choice <offer competitive pay, benefits, security and training opportunities. <if the labour is worth it, pay it. Role of Industry Organizations Issue : The Alberta beef industry has a rich heritage of active producer organizations. These have acted to benefit the industry through learningopportunities, producer forums, and as a unified voice in representing their membership at the interface with governments. Although theseorganizations, representing segments of the beef industry, do not always agree on issues, they do together represent the bulk of beef producers. What is the role of these organizations in the future? Opportunities : There are many broad-based issues comingforward that will have a direct impact on the way beef producers do business and as a result, on their \"bottom lines\". Industry organizations are key partners in developing proactive strategies and operational plans to deal withthese issues . Producers listen and relate to their peers. As the beef industry moves outside the confines of Alberta to a truly North American \"market\", producers working with their peers from acrossborders will tend to come to common ground more readily than working through third party intermediaries. Industry organizations are key partners in developing and gaining acceptance for inter-regional trade arrangements . Key Areas : <strategy and action plan development regarding issues such as: food safety, animal welfare, codes of practice, siting regulations,disease control, industry development. <inter-regional trade relations regarding access to and movement of feeder and slaughtercattle; reciprocal disease control protocols. <a common vision for the future of the beef industry must be shared among producerorganizations. Harmony and a sense of common purpose, both among producer organizations and in organization -government working relationships, are critical.Investment in Packing Facilities Issue : Alberta has two modern packing / processing facilities with large kill capacities to service Western Canada. Currently, these plants are notrunning at their full (technical) capacity. In some circles, however, they may be considered as at, or near, their practical capacity. Expansion of the feedlot finishing industry may soon exceed packer capacity in the Province . Opportunities : As the beef industry shifts from a commodity to a product focus, so too will the emphasis of the major packing facilities. Decisions on the focusof packing facilities are made at the corporate level on a North American basis. Cargill-High River has recently been upgraded to service theJapanese market. IBP will likely follow suit in a similar \"value-based\" market. The movement to case-ready products will likely require largerscale of slaughter to facilitate sorting into product streams. As this transition occurs, in conjunction with industry expansion,opportunities will arise for investment in additional packing capacity. What is produced, not how much is produced, will play a major role in further investment in packing facilities . Key Areas : <current packing facilities are not running at capacity. <industry expansion will support the transition to servicing higher valued markets as opposedto producing \"commodity beef\". <primary industry expansion will drive any further investment, although the scale may notbe in line with current plants and/or the location may not be Alberta. Investment in Value-Added Processing Issue : Although the slaughter industry has grown in Alberta, further processing activity locally isrelatively stagnant at a time when consumer demand for processed products is increasing. In order to meet domestic and export demand,investment in byproduct and meat processing (ie. value-added products) is necessary.Beef Industry Profiles 102Opportunities : Key Areas : On the domestic front, there are opportunities <investment in smaller scale plants will likely for investment in processing firms to meetrefined and differentiated consumer preferences. Extending this in any large way to exportmarkets is largely controlled by the majorpackers. Otherwise, targeted, smaller-volumepenetration of processed beef into exportmarkets may induce investment locally intoprocessing facilities .be directed to domestic and niche export markets. <value-added processing tends to be located in close proximity to areas of higher population density (and consumption). <accessing larger export markets for value- added beef products will likely be through integration, merger, or some combination ofthe two.Beef Industry Profiles 103d) Focus on Balancing Business, Public and Consumer Needs Government walks a fine line, attempting to strike a balance in ensuring: - a business environment conducive to the long term development and growth of the beef industry, - industry acts as \"responsible stewards\" of the resource base, and - food products, when delivered to consumers, are safe. Regulation and targeted programs have historically been the primary tool of government in balancing these often competing needs. However, in an era of \"perception is reality\", facilitating consensus (ie. \"win-win\" solutions) among these groups is taking a larger role. Public Perception of Agriculture Issue : Over-arching the areas of public domain and government responsibility is the \"perception ofagriculture\". With urbanization of the population over time the linkage to, and understanding of agriculture has diminished. Subsequently, public perceptions are formed regarding the actions and motives of the industry that are not founded in fact, scienceand/or majority. These perceptions caninfluence government decisions on how theindustry should operate, or how they will becontrolled . Measures based on unfounded perceptions do not benefit the industry, theeconomy, or the public at large. Opportunities : Production technology and management systems have undergone positive, dramatic changes over time. Industry, and industry organizations havetaken a number of positive steps to set minimum stewardship standards and be \"self-policing\". Collaborative public and private sector efforts to objectively and proactively inform the publicof these developments, their implications to thepublic and the industry's sense of responsibilitywould improve the image of agriculture . constitutes a \"disaster\" at an industry level and Key Areas : Each individual can then build on this <humane animal husbandry practices knowledge, implementing the balance of the <responsible use of chemicals and other risk management measures they see as production inputs necessary. <respect for air and water resources shared with <develop and extend risk management tools, the public information and skill development <provision of safe and healthy foods opportunities. Business Needs (2 issues specified) Issue : Sources (eg. production, price, national herd health status, herd biosecurity, capital andmarket access) and impacts of business risk in agriculture are increasing. The industry requiresoptions for managing risk that respond to \"disaster\" at the industry level while maintaining opportunity for individually-driven businesssuccess and failure. Opportunities : \"Disaster\" situations can result in business failures at a broad industry level in the short runwhile longer term prospects are for viability andgrowth. Government programs designed to bridge the industry over disasters must balance between: - providing sufficient protection to maintain the industry on its long term course, and - remaining relatively production and investment neutral. The primary beef industry, and individual producers, are recognizing that they bear theresponsibility to manage the bulk of theirbusiness risk. They also realize the need to develop the knowledge, skills and information systems to deal with these risks.

Key Areas :Beef Industry Profiles 105e) Focus on Trade and Trade Relations The Alberta and Canadian beef industries are extremely export dependent. The long term success of Alberta's primary industry, similar to that of the U.S., hinges upon its success in establishing and maintaining volumes of high-valued product into growth markets. Given the U.S. is a major market for Alberta beef and, as well, is a partner in this high- valued product theme, two major elements of trade and trade relations emerge: - integration of the Canadian and American beef industries into a \"North American region\", and - resolution of global impediments to the trade in beef. Being \"first in\" with significant volumes and being responsive, throughout the production chain, to consumer demands in target markets will yield momentum and competitive advantage. As the U.S. and Canadian trade issues are highl y interrelated, they are presented as a group with discussion of opportunities and key areas undertaken jointly. An Integrated \"Can-Am\" Production and Marketing Region The Canadian and American primary production and further processing industries have grownand matured side-by-side over the past century. Economic analysis prepared for the R-Calf CVD/AD petitions reconfirmed that theCanadian and American primary beef industries share common ground and common costing. Integration into a \"North American region\" has been taking place gradually for some time. Consolidation and growth-to-scale of packingand intensive feeding businesses have quickenedthis process. However, there are still vestiges ofregulation and vested interest, based on\"nationalistic\" fears carried forward to today,that slow this process. There are a number of inter-related issues pertaining to Canadian and American cattle and beef trade and trade relations. As such, each issue will be laid outfirst, then the \"Opportunities\" and \"Key Areas\" will be expanded upon to address the issues collectively in a \"Can-Am\" context. Dependence on the U.S. Issue : Concerns regarding the dependence of theAlberta beef industry on the U.S., as an outlet for product and a supply of feeder cattle, tend to be based on fear of \"losing control of one'sdestiny\". \"Dependence\" conveys the meaning \"the glass is half empty\" whereas \"opportunity\" says \"the glass is half full\". On both sides of theborder, beef producers through to government representatives are not fully aware of \"howbusiness is done over there\", thus creating uncertainty. The trust required for free-flowingbusiness relationships has yet to fully develop. Protectionism Issue : When the economy slows down, pricing and producer margins tend to be squeezed. This typically results in grass roots lobbies to protectthe local industry from imported cattle and beef. On the U.S. side, trade petitions, the USDA inspection and grading system and (proposed)\"Country of Origin\" labeling are tools suggested or employed to \"protect the local industry\". Canadian import regulations regarding health ofanimals are perceived by Americans as protectionist tools applied here. Restricting movement of cattle and beef in either directionincreases costs to producers, the industry and consumers. It may not have the desired effect on the local industry. U.S.D.A. Inspection / Grading Issue : The \"USDA Graded / Inspected\" label has value in the American and international markets for commodity beef. A significant portion of this value is being conveyed to higher-valued beefproduct streams. The U.S. has a considerable investment in getting this \"acceptability and related preference\" into place. USDA labeledbeef receives premiums in export markets. Non- USDA labeled products are, conversely, discounted in the American market place. TheBeef Industry Profiles 106\"new\" Canadian grading system provides neighbouring areas, through a variety of vectors, comparability but does not carry the label with is high. Control and eradication is also managed the value. The inspection and grading on an area or regional basis.

If there is to be trade-offs for Canada and the U.S. regarding a \"Can-Am\" region, lead by international free r-flowing, reciprocal movement of livestock. corporate packers and processors into domesticand export markets, the grading inspection issue must be resolved. Brand Labeling Issue : The movement towards branded products, in domestic and export markets, is an attempt toassociate quality characteristics with a specific set of consumer preferences. Quality is in the \"eye of the beholder\". Customers andconsumers are not as concerned about the grass- fed vs. grain-fed issue as they are about a defined set of product characteristics that can berelied upon to be delivered consistently. Zeroing in on providing these characteristics, and attaching a brand label creates brandrecognition, brand loyalty and elicits a price premium. However, this does bring to the fore potential problems when the movement ofCanadian beef into the U.S. and other export markets is largely through international corporate businesses. Does the label \"Alberta\"or \"Canadian\" beef connote value to the target client group? Should the specification of products, customers and brand labels be left tothe corporate beef businesses? Simply put, brands relate to product characteristics which may, or may not include a notation of origin. Disease Control and \"National\" Herd Security Issue : Foot and Mouth, BSE, Blue Tongue, and Anaplasmosis are examples of diseases that can have devastating effects on the productivity ofcattle and the marketability of beef. On one hand, countries are taking seriously the responsibility to maintain the security of thehealth of their \"national\" herds. Empowered by regulation, they employ surveillance, testing and (disease-free) certification measures uponimportation. On the other hand, many of these diseases are \"regional\" in nature. If they enter and take hold, the probability of transmittal toOpportunities (across issues noted) : Efforts to improve trade relations begin withproducers and producer organizations gaining a fuller appreciation of the nature of the industry, particularly the similarities, on both sides of theborder. This begins at the grass roots level. Collaboration of producer organizations at the national level to proactively address common trade and policy issues to the benefit of the \"Can-Am Region\" will reflect leadership,commitment and direction to local, state, provincial and federal policy makers. The role of the various levels of government is twofold. Firstly, act as both a partner and facilitator in the trade relations and issuesresolution activities among producer organizations. This also offers governments the opportunity to bring into context the views ofthe balance of their constituents. Secondly, implement regulatory, program and policy changes reflecting the consensus achieved. Key Areas (across issues noted) : <increased knowledge and understanding, starting at the grass roots level, of the nature primary beef industry in a Can-Am context. <work with national agencies to attain \"grading equivalencies\", at least between the two countries, with the intention to remove product discounts derived through regulation. <collaborate with national, state and provincial authorities to develop transparent protocols for the movement of live cattle with the intentionof containing livestock diseases. <reinstating USDA grading of Canadian beef carcasses imported into the US. <removal of country of origin labeling requirements for American and Canadian products within the continental market place. <recognize that the definition of product characteristics, to be encompassed by brands or labels, is specified by consumers, notgovernment or industry. Country of origin, carcass grade, inspection, etc. may or may not play a role in product specifications.Beef Industry Profiles 107Multilateral Trade and Trade Relations Beyond NAFTA Issue : Canada has progressed beyond NAFTA to negotiating free trade agreements with Centraland South American countries (\"Free Trade of the Americas\"). The aim of these agreements is to open up market access among theparticipants. Along with improved access, however, comes increased competition from other beef producing nations. Opportunities : Negotiations may provide new and expandedmarket opportunities. As well, they will promote the ongoing industry structural evolution towards more \"globalized\" trade inbeef. Key Areas : <with increased opportunities comes increased competition (Brazil and Argentina may replace portions of products currentlyimported from Australia and New Zealand) <logical resolution of trade barriers. <maintenance of \"herd health\" status.The World Trade Stage Issue : Negotiations on the WTO agriculture agreement are in progress. The aim of these agreements, ingeneral, is to reduce subsidization and trade barriers regarding agricultural products. This brings the Canadian beef industry as one ofmany players into context with the production- trade-consumption complexes for the full array of agricultural commodities. Opportunities : Although the WTO provides opportunities toexpand markets for beef and rationalize subsidization (and dumping) activities, a number of needs and trade-offs are brought into playamong industries, nations and trading blocks. Key Areas : <sanitary and phytosanitary concerns among nations. <resolution of protectionist measures and trade barriers is a difficult, up-hill battle. <increased access to North American markets by subsidized products.Beef Industry Profiles 1087.
