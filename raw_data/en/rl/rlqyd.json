What Our Patients Are Saying The Pain Was Totally Gone After the Adjustment \"Dr. Mattingly is the best chiropractor I have ever been to in my life. I have a history of lower back pain, neck pain and a general weakness of the muscles in my back. \"The other day, I was sleeping in a chair for half an hour. When I tried to get up, I couldn't. The pain in my lower back was electrifying. I nearly collapsed in pain. The next day, as soon as I could get there, Dr. Mattingly gave me the best adjustment ever. I knew beforehand he could fix it. And he did. The pain was totally gone after the adjustment. \"I 'bow down' to you, Dr. Mattingly, because you deserve it, and because I can!\" \"I woke up one night at 2 a.m. in severe pain; I could barely walk. I went to Dr. Mattingly and he worked on me and I got instant relief. I was able to walk normally by the end of the day. I now go to him weekly and have had excellent results. He has me on nutritional supplements that have helped me greatly. He has enhanced my quality of life in so many ways. I truly enjoy the service and results I have and will obtain. I've had chiropractic care before Dr. Mattingly is the best. Thanks Dr. Mattingly and staff!\" \"For over 10 years I have lived with low back pain. I was in a car accident where my leg was broken. After getting out of the cast and when I was up and about, I went back to work doing hardwood floors and wood trim. I was bent over and on my knees a lot and the pain was about all I could bear at best. Some days I would sit stretching my leg trying to relieve some of the pain.\" \"Luckily I came into Dr. Mattingly's office, and in a few short weeks he has rid me of most of my pain. His knowledge and ability to get fast results allow me to be more productive at work and more alive when I get home to my kids. I get to roll around with them now rather than being worried about throwing out my back or having to withstand the pain of my back in order to enjoy "}
