Infection with STIs can lead to acute symptoms, chronic infection and serious delayed consequences such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy and cervical cancer. There has been an increasing trend in the overall STI incidence in Singapore for the past ten years, from 160 cases per 100,000 population in 1998 to 251 cases per 100,000 population in 2007. Genital ulcers and genital discharge are commonly seen symptoms of STIs. The incidence of genital ulcer disease is on the rise in Singapore and the two commonest causes are genital herpes and primary syphilis. In patients presenting with a urethral discharge, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis infections are the most common causes in Singapore. Primary care doctors are often the first contact point for patients with genital ulcers or discharges. According to the results of a survey on STI management practices among GPs in 2006 and 2007, it was found that the overall medical management of STI by primary care physicians was acceptable. However, there was variation in terms of medications and ordering relevant investigations for their patients. It is therefore timely to develop this first national guideline that incorporates the best available evidence from the scientific literature, to assist our doctors in the management of genital ulcers and discharge. PROFESSOR K SATKU DIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICES \u00181 Executive summary of recommendations Details of recommendations can be found in the main text at the pages indicated. Management of genital ulcers D It is recommended that the following diagnostic approach be taken in any patient with genital ulcers or discharges (pg 27): A. Patient history: 1. Lesion history : prodrome, initial presentation (especially presence of vesicles), duration of lesion, pain, symptoms of urethritis, other systemic symptoms, use of systemic or topical remedies, any history of similar symptoms in the past or partners with similar symptoms. 2. Medical history : HIV status, skin conditions, drug allergies, and medications. 3. Sexual history : gender of partners, number of partners, venue for meeting partners, commercial sex exposure, partners with symptoms or signs, partners with known HSV or recent syphilis diagnosis. 4. Travel history : geographical area where sexual intercourse has taken place. B. Physical exam: 1. Lesion : examine for appearance, distribution, number, size, induration, depth, and tenderness. 2.Genital exam : examine genital and perianal area for other lesions. 3. Lymph node(s ): note number and location of enlarged nodes, size, tenderness, presence of bubo. 4. General exam : thorough examination of oral cavity and skin of torso, palms and soles. In patients with syphilis, this would include an examination of the cardiovascular and neurological systems. Grade D, Level 4 A A diagnosis based only on the patient's medical history and physical examination frequently may be inaccurate. Ideally, all patients who have genital ulcers should be evaluated with a serologic test for syphilis and a diagnostic evaluation for genital herpes; if chancroid is suspected, the patient should be referred to a specialist for evaluation and a test for Haemophilus ducreyi (pg 29). Grade A, Level 1+ Executive summary of recommendations D A\u0018 \u00182B HIV and serologic testing for syphilis should be performed on all patients who have STIs presenting with genital ulcers, as well as tests for herpes simplex infection where appropriate. Locally, genital herpes and syphilis are the two most likely infective etiologies. Non-infective causes may need to be considered (pg 29). Grade B, Level 2++ B The clinician should treat for the diagnosis considered most likely, on the basis of clinical presentation and epidemiologic circumstances. In some instances, treatment must be initiated for additional conditions because of diagnostic uncertainty (pg 29). Grade B, Level 2++ GPP Successful management of STI-associated syndromes requires that staff are respectful of patients and are not judgmental. Examination must be done in appropriate surroundings where privacy can be ensured and confidentiality guaranteed. Patients shou ld be educated and counseled on their condition as well as safer sex (pg 29). GPP Management of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection BIn performing serology for that gG1 (HSV 1) and gG2 (HSV 2) should be used (pg 31). Grade B, Level 2++ Treatment of first episod e genital herpes (pg 32) 1.AAcyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times daily for 5 to10 days. Grade A, Level 1++ OR 2.A Acyclovir 400 mg orally tid for 5 to10 days.

Grade A, Level 1+A A AC A A A A A\u0018 \u00185Management of genital herpes in pregnancy First episode genital herpes - 1st and 2nd trimester acquisition C Management should be in line with the clinical condition with the use of either oral or intravenous acyclovir (pg 35). Grade C, Level 2+ CVaginal delivery is anticipated in women who present with first episode genital herpes in the first and second trimesters as the risk for transmission to the neonate at delivery is low (pg 35). Grade C, Level 2+ First episode genital herpes - 3rd trimester acquisition C Caesarean section should be offere d to all women presenting with first- episode genital herpes lesions at the time of delivery, or within 6 weeks of the expected date of delivery or onset of labour (pg 35). Grade C, Level 2+ Recurrent genital herp es in pregnancy CIf there are no genital lesions at the onset of labour, Caesarean section to prevent neonatal herpes is not indicated (pg 36). Grade C, Level 2+ A For women with a history of recurrent genital herpes, who would opt for caesarean delivery if HSV lesions were detected at the onset of labour, daily suppressive acyclovir given from 36 weeks of gestation until delivery may be given to reduce the likelihood of HSV lesions at term) (pg 36). Grade A, Level 1+ BCounselling for genital herpes is im portant and should include (pg 36): Information on natural history of disease, potential for recurrent attacks, role of asymptomatic shedding in sexual transmission Abstinence from sexual activity during prodromal symptoms or when lesions are present Advice to inform current and new sexual partners of genital herpes Use of condoms with new or uninfected partners, particularly in first 12 months after first attack C C C C BA\u0018 \u00186 Information on anti-viral treatment available Risk of neonatal infection: women with a history of genital herpes or whose partners have history of genital herpes should inform their obstetrician early in pregnancy Grade B, Level 2++ Management of primary syphilis Treatment of primary syphilis (pg 37) 1. B Benzathine Penicillin G 2.4 million units i/m weekly x single dose. (For primary syphilis, most authorities administer a single dose, while some might use two doses for secondary syphilis). Grade B, Level 2++ OR 2. B Aq. Procaine Penicillin G 600,000 units i/m daily x 10 days. Grade B, Level 2++ Penicillin-allergic patients (pg 38) 1.B Doxycycline 100 mg orally bid x 14 days.

Grade B, Level 1+ C For HIV-infected individuals, either the same treatment as in non-HIV infected individuals or 3 doses of Benzathine Penicillin G 2.4 million units i/m weekly are recommended (pg 38). Grade C, Level 2+ CHIV-positive individuals with primary syphilis should be referred to an appropriate expert for follow up (pg 38). Grade C, Level 2+ B Oral doxycycline is the preferred oral alternative in all patients in view of its more favourable dosing intervals and low cost (pg 38). Grade B, Level 2++ B B B B B C C B\u0018 \u00187GPP The treatment guidelines listed refer to management of primary syphilis. For late latent syphilis, syphilis of unknown duration, congenital syphilis or neurosyphilis, the treatment recommendations are different and relevant expert advice should be sought (pg 38). GPP C The same quantitative nontreponemal tests [i.e rapid plasma regain (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)] should be repeated during follow up; the DSC Clinic follows up patients for a total period of two years (tests are repeated at 3 months; 6 months; 12 months; 18 months; 24 months) (pg 38). Grade C, Level 2+ CA sustained fourfold or greater increase in RPR/VDRL titres suggests re-infection or treatment failure. Following treatment of early syphilis, RPR/VDRL should demonstrate a decrease in titre within 6 months. In particular, patients treated with non-penicillin based regimens should be followed up to look for signs of treatment failure (pg 38). Grade C, Level 2+ CSince treponemal tests remain positive for life following effective treatment, proper documentation is necessary to prevent unnecessary retreatment. Patients should be given a letter documenting their treatment (pg 39). Grade C, Level 2+ D Reinfection or relapse should be retreated preferably with supervised treatment schedules to ensure compliance, and sexual partners should be rescreened. These patients could also be referred to the relevant experts (pg 39). Grade D, Level 4 D All pregnant women should be screened for syphilis at the initial antenatal visit. Women who had documented treatment for syphilis in the past do not need retreatment during current or subsequent pregnancies if there is no clinical evidence of syphilis and the RPR/VDRL titre is negative or serofast in low titre compared to previous results (pg 39). Grade D, Level 4 CGPP C C D D\u0018 \u00188D For penicillin-allergic patients, erythromycin is given in dosage schedules as recommended for the treatment of non-pregnant patients. However, as erythromycin exhibits poor penetration across the placental barrier, the infant should be routinely treated with penicillin at birth. For these patients, retreatment with doxycycline can be considered after delivery when breastfeeding has been stopped (pg 40). Grade D, Level 4 CWomen treated for early syphilis during pregnancy should have monthly rapid plasma regain (RPR) or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) for the remainder of the current pregnancy (pg 40). Grade C, Level 2+ Management of chancroid D Locally, chancroid is uncommon. Any suspected case should be referred to a specialist for evaluation, as routine laboratory tests are not widely available (pg 40). Grade D, Level 4 Treatment of chancroid (pg 40-41) 1.A Azithromycin 1 g orally x single dose. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 2.B Ceftriaxone 250 mg i/m x single dose. Grade B, Level 2++ OR 3.B Ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid x 3 days. Grade B, Level 2++ Management of lymphogranuloma venereum D Locally, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is uncommon. Any suspected case should be referred to a specialist for evaluation, as routine laboratory tests are not widely available (pg 41). Grade D, Level 4 D C D A B B D\u0018 \u00189Treatment of lymphogr anuloma venereum (pg 41) 1.C Doxycycline 100 mg bid x 21 days. Grade C, Level 2+ OR 2.C Erythromycin 500 mg qid x 21 days. Grade C, Level 2+ Management of genital discharges B Patients presenting with genital discharges should also be screened for HIV and syphilis (pg 42). Grade B, Level 2++ GPP The following diagnostic approach is recommended (pg 42-43): A. Patient history: 1.History of discharge : onset, duration, colour, odour, association with micturition, dysuria, itch, rash, chronicity, involvement of sites (urethra, vagina, pharynx, rectum, eye), other systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, ophthalmic symptoms), use of systemic or topical remedies, any history of similar symptoms in the past or partners with similar symptoms. 2.Medical history : diabetes, HIV status, skin conditions, drug allergies, current & previous medications, menstrual history, obstetric history 3.Sexual history : gender of partners, number of partners, venue for meeting partners, commercial sex exposure, partners with symptoms or signs, partners with known genital discharge diagnosis. 4.Travel history : geographical area where sexual intercourse has taken place. B. Physical examination: 1.Lesion : appearance and character of discharge, consistency, odour. 2.Genital exam : external genitalia and peri-anal area for inflammation and other lesions. 3.Lymph node(s ): note number and location of enlarged nodes, size, tenderness. 4.General exam : thorough examination of oral cavity and eyes/joints as necessary. In males, examine the penis carefully, retract the foreskin if present, inspect the meatus for C C B GPP\u00180 \u0018\u001810inflammation, and look for urethral discharge. If there is no discharge visible, gently 'milk' the urethra towards the meatus. GPP Genital discharges in males D All patients who have confirmed or suspected urethritis should be tested for gonorrhoea and chlamydia (pg 45). Grade D, Level 4 B Because of high specificity (>99%) and sensitivity (>95%), a Gram stain of a male urethral specimen that demonstrates polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular Gram-negative diplococci is presumptive of infection with N.gonorrhoeae in symptomatic men. Thus it is recommended that urethral smears be obtained in symptomatic men to aid in diagnosis (pg 46). Grade B, Level 2++ Chlamydia and gonorrhoea in women B Microscopical examination of Gram-stained smears of endocervical discharge can be used as a point of care test to provide an immediate presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhoea (pg 4 6). Grade B, Level 2++ B Gonococcal complement fixation te st are not recommended for the diagnosis of gonorrhea. Serological tests are not recommended for the diagnosis of acute chlamydial infections (pg 47). Grade B, Level 2++ D B B B\u00180 \u0018\u001811Complications of genital discharges D Syndromic management of urethral symptoms in males (pg 48) Urethral symptoms present Presence of sexually transmitted urethral infection This is indicated if any one of the following are present: \u0083\u0003History - risk of sexually transmitted infection present (e.g. unprotected oral, vaginal, anal sex) \u0083\u0003Examination - presence of urethral discharge Gram- stained smear Diagnosis of gonorrhoea if there is - on Gram-stain microscopy If any one of the above points are present - \u0083\u0003Send urethral swab for gonococcal culture \u0083\u0003Review in 14 days If none of the above points are present - \u0083\u0003Send urethral swab for gonococcal culture \u0083\u0003Send \u0083\u0003Treat for Chlamydia trachomatis \u0083\u0003Review in days Grade D, Level 4 Treatment of gonorrhoea x\u0003Uncomplicated infection in adul ts - urethral, endocervical infection (pg 49) 1.A Ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscular single dose.

Grade B, Level 2++ DFollow-up (pg 50) - Patients should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until 7 days after therapy is initiated. After this period sexual activity can be A A B B B A A B D\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001813resumed provided their symptoms have resolved and sex partners have been screened and treated. - The test-of-cure is recommended for all sites and assessment for post- gonococcal urethritis (PGU) should be performed after 14 days. -All treatments are less effective at eradicating pharyngeal infection and test-of-cure is strongly recommended following treatment of infection at this site. - Serologic tests for syphilis and HIV should also be performed at the initial visit; if negative they should be repeated at 3 months after the last risky exposure. - Education on STIs and safer sex advice should be regularly reinforced. Grade D, Level 4 Management of sex partners B Sexual contacts in the preceding 60 days should be traced, screened and treated on epidemiologic grounds. If the last sexual exposure was > 60 days, the patient's most recent partner should be treated (pg 50).

Grade A, Level 1+ Follow up D A test-of-cure is not necessary when treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin has been completed, unless symptoms persist or re-infection is suspected. Test-of-cure is however recommended after 4 weeks for infections in pregnant women, or when erythromycin was used. Non- culture tests (e.g. NAAT) done within 4 weeks of completing treatment may yield false positive tests due to persistence of chlamydial antigens (pg 51). Grade D, Level 4 Management of sex partners D Sex partners of symptomatic male patients within the last 60 days (or the most recent sex partner if the last contact was >60 days) should be screened and treated for chlamydial infection (pg 52). Grade D, Level 4 D Sex partners of asymptomatic male patients and of females within the last 90 days (or the most recent sex partner if the last contact was >90 days) should be screened and treated for chlamydial infection (pg 52). Grade D, Level 4 A A A D D D\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001815Treatment of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) Management of sex partners D Sex partners of men with non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) within the last 60 days should be screened and treated. These partners should also be examined to exclude other associated STI (pg 52). Grade D, Level 4 Management of recurrent or chronic NGU -D Obtain objective evidence of urethritis, e.g. presence of urethral discharge or pus cells on urethral smear. If patient has no objective evidence, consider reassurance only. -Exclude drug adherence failure or re-infection from untreated partner or a new partner. -Consider referral to a specialist for further evaluation. (pg 5 3) Grade D, Level 4 Vaginal discharge BIn women of reproductive age complaining of vaginal discharge the commonest cause is physiological, but infective and other causes should be excluded (pg 53). Grade B, Level 2++ B A spontaneous complaint of abnormal vaginal discharge is most commonly due to a vaginal infection, and rarely, it may be the result of mucopurulent STI-related cervicitis. The symptom of abnormal vaginal discharge is highly indicative of vaginal infection, but poorly predictive for cervical infection. To ensure a cost-effective approach, risk assessment should therefore be done before investigations and treatment is provided (pg 54). Grade B, Level 2++ B Where resources permit, one should consider the use of laboratory tests to screen women with vaginal discharge. Such screening could be applied to all women with discharge as well as to those with a positive risk assessment (pg 55). Grade B, Level 2++ D D B B B\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001816GPP Investigation of a woman with vaginal discharge is indicated if (Table 2) (pg 55): 1.

The guidelines are not intended to be a comprehensive review of all aspects of genital ulcerative disease or discharge, or sexually transmitted diseases. 1.2 Development of guidelines These guidelines have been produced by a team comprising dermatologists, obstetricians/gynaecologists, infectious disease physicians, urologists, pathologists with an interest in laboratory diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections, as well as general practitioners. 1.3 Objectives The main objective of these guidelines is to promote evidence-based management of the common sexually transmitted causes of genital ulcers and discharges. These guidelines will assist all doctors who manage patients presenting with genital ulcers and discharges, in particular primary care physicians, as well as dermatologists, obstetricians and gynaecologists and infectious disease physicians 1.4 Review of guidelines Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are only as current as the evidence that supports them. Users must keep in mind that new evidence could supercede recommendations in these guidelines. The workgroup advises that these guidelines be scheduled for review 5 years after publication, or when new evidence appears that requires updating of the recommendations. 1 Introduction\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018262 Management of genital ulcers 2.1 Introduction The incidence of genital ulcer disease is on the rise in Singapore. This is shown by the increase in notifications of patients seen at the Department of STI Control Clinic (DSC) as well as from physicians in hospital and general practice.1 Genital ulcer disease is associated with an increased risk for HIV infection.2 The physician must also be aware that two or more infections can coexist in a patient presenting with genital ulcers, and a thorough evaluation of the possible causes should be undertaken. Counselling and contact tracing, as far as possible, should also be done. These management guidelines will cover the common sexually transmitted infections causing genital ulcer disease. 2.2 Definition Genital ulcer disease is defined as an ulcerative, erosive, pustular or vesicular genital lesion(s) with or without regional lymphadenopathy, caused by either sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or non-STI- related infections or conditions. Aetiology of genital ulcer disease A. STI-related The two commonest STIs which cause ulcerative disease are: 1. Genital herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2) which is the leading cause, and 2. Primary syphilis Other diseases such as Chancroid, (due to Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes L1, 2 or 3) are uncommon in Singapore. 2 Management of genital ulcers\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001827B. Non-STI x\u0003Basal cell carcinoma 2.3 Clinical approach to genital ulcers D It is recommended that the following diagnostic approach be taken in any patient with genital ulcers or discharges: A. Patient history4: 1. Lesion history : prodrome, initial presentation (especially presence of vesicles), duration of lesion, pain, symptoms of urethritis, other systemic symptoms, use of systemic or topical remedies, any history of similar symptoms in the past or partners with similar symptoms. 2. Medical history : HIV status, skin conditions, drug allergies, and medications. 3. Sexual history : gender of partners, number of partners, venue for meeting partners, commercial sex exposure, partners with symptoms or signs, partners with known HSV or recent syphilis diagnosis. 4. Travel history : geographical area where sexual intercourse has taken place. B. Physical exam4: 1. Lesion : examine for appearance, distribution, number, size, induration, depth, and tenderness. 2.Genital exam : examine genital and perianal area for other lesions. 3. Lymph node(s ): note number and location of enlarged nodes, size, tenderness, presence of bubo. D\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018284. General exam : thorough examination of oral cavity and skin of torso, palms and soles. In patients with syphilis, this would include an examination of the cardiovascular and neurological systems.

Laboratory testing A A diagnosis based only on the patient's medical history and physical examination frequently may be inaccurate. Ideally, all patients who have genital ulcers should be evaluated with a serologic test for syphilis and a diagnostic evaluation for genital herpes; if chancroid is suspected, the patient should be referred to a specialist for evaluation and a test for Haemophilus ducreyi .5,6,7 Grade A, Level 1+ B HIV and serologic testing for syphilis should be performed on all patients who have STIs presenting with genital ulcers8, as well as tests for herpes simplex infection where appropriate. Locally, genital herpes and syphilis are the two most likely infective etiologies. Non- infective causes may need to be considered.8,9 Grade B, Level 2++ D. Management Clinicians often have to treat patient s before test results are available because early treatment decreases the possibility of ongoing transmission and because successful treatment of genital herpes depends on prompt initiation of therapy. B The clinician should treat for the diagnosis considered most likely, on the basis of clinical presentation and epidemiologic circumstances. In some instances, treatment must be initiated for additional conditions because of diagnostic uncertainty.5 Grade B, Level 2++ GPP Successful management of STI-associated syndromes requires that staff are respectful of patients and are not judgmental. Examination must be done in appropriate surroundings where privacy can be ensured and confidentiality guaranteed. Patients should be educated and counseled on their condition as well as safer sex. GPP Even after complete diagnostic evaluation, at least 25% of patients who have genital ulcers have no laboratory-confirmed diagnosis.5A B B GPP\u00180 \u0018\u001830A syndromic approach to management of genital ulcers has proven to be cost-effective in resource poor settings; however it has not been shown to be applicable in the local context.8,9 2.4 Management of specific genital ulcer diseases 2.4.1 Management of herpes si mplex virus (HSV) infection 2.4.1.1 Clinical features Genital herpes is caused by HSV type 1 or 2. First episode genital herpes is often severe, presenting with multiple grouped vesicles, which rupture easily leaving painful erosions and ulcers. In the male, the lesions occur mainly on the prepuce and sub-preputial areas of the penis; in females on the vulva, vagina and cervix. Healing of uncomplicated lesions takes 2 to 4 weeks. Recurrent attacks are less severe than the first episode. Groups of vesicles or erosions develop on a single anatomical site and these usually heal within 10 days. The majority of persons with HSV infection have mild, often unrecognised or sub-clinical disease and are unaware of the infection. They may nevertheless shed the virus intermittently in the genital tract and thus transmit the infection to their partners unknowingly. 2.4.1.2 Laboratory investigations Viral isolation in cell culture: This is considered the 'Gold standard'. The test is both sensitive and specific, but sensitivity declines as lesions heal; viral typing is possible.10-12 The swab used for sampling the cells at the bases of ulcers should be sent in viral transport medium, which can be obtained from the laboratories performing the test. Do not use calcium alginate swabs, however cotton-, rayon-, or dacron-tipped swabs are suitable. Insert the swab into the viral transport medium, break off the stick and screw-cap the bottle securely. The sample then needs to be dispatched to the laboratory at 4oC using an ice pack. If delay is anticipated, refrigerate at 4oC, do not freeze. Time \u00180 \u0018\u001831taken for a positive result (HSV type 1 or 2) ranges from 1 to 7 days, and for a negative result 7 days. OR HSV antigen detection: By Direct Immunoflouresence techniques. The swab used for sampling the cells at the base of ulcers can be sent in a sterile container with 1 to 2 mL of sterile saline added to prevent drying of the swab. Refrigerate sample at 4oC until transfer to the laboratory, do not freeze. Results may be available in 1 to 2 days. HSV type is reported if the test is positive. OR PCR detection of viral nucleic acid: Highest sensitivity; viral typing possible11,12; but expensive and not widely available. Use only Dacron-tipped swabs and send swab in swab sheath without any media. Refrigerate sample at 4oC until transfer to the laboratory, do not freeze. Dispatch to the laboratory at 4oC using an ice pack. Results are available in 2 to 4 days. What about serology? The role of Type-specific serological tests (TSST): Many commercial tests for HSV antibodies are not type specific and are of NO value in the management of genital herpes.13-16 Accurate type-specific assays for HSV antibodies must be based on the HSV-specific glycoprotein G1 for the diagnosis of infection with HSV-1 and glycoprotein G2 for the diagnosis of HSV-2. BIn performing serology infection, assays (HSV 1) and gG2 (HSV 2) should be used. Grade B, Level 2++ The presence of specific IgG to HSV indicates previous exposure. B\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001832The use of TSST may be useful in certain specific situations, such as confirming a diagnosis of genital herpes in a person with a typical history of recurrent ulcers but negative cultures, counselling of sexual partners of infected persons, detection of unrecognized infection and for seroepidemiological studies.16 Because almost all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, type- specific HSV-2 antibody indicates anogenital infection, but the presence of HSV-1 antibody does not distinguish anogenital from orolabial infection. 2.4.1.3 Treatment Treatment of first ep isode genital herpes 1.AAcyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times daily for 5 to10 days.17 Grade A, Level 1++ OR 2.

RPR/VDRL may become negative if treatment is instituted early in the disease. However treatment of late infections often results in a persistently positive result - or a serological scar. the most widely used confirmatory tests. x\u0003The treponemal EIA test is also a specific test for syphilis, but most experts recommend performing either TPHA or TPPA as an additional confirmatory test if the EIA result is positive. x\u0003Once positive, specific tests tend to remain positive even after the syphilis has been successfully treated.

These patients could also be referred to the relevant experts.9 Grade D, Level 4 2.3.2.5 Management of sexual contacts Partner notification, or \"contact tracing\", is the process of learning from persons with STIs about their sexual partners and helping to arrange for evaluation and treatment of those partners. Many persons benefit from partner notification; thus patients with STIs should be encouraged to make partners aware of potential risk and urge them to seek diagnosis and treatment. At risk partners are those who have been exposed within the following periods - 3 months plus duration of symptoms for primary syphilis. There is clear evidence that invo lving index patients in shared responsibility for the management of sexual partners improves outcomes.62 Syphilis in pregnancy Penicillin is the drug of choice in the same dosage schedule as for non-pregnant individuals.

Rectal exposure in women or men who have sex with men might result in proctocolitis (including mucoid and/or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, and/or tenesmus). LGV is an invasive, systemic infection, and if it is not treated early, LGV proctocolitis might lead to chronic, colorectal fistulas and strictures.60 There have been recent outbreaks described among men who have sex with men in Western Europe and the United States.67,68 D Locally, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is uncommon.

Genital discharges are associated with an increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.71 Two or more infections may coexist in a patient presenting with a genital discharge, therefore a thorough evaluation of the possible causes should be undertaken. As far as possible, counselling and contact tracing should be done. There may be a need to treat the contact ep idemiologically. These management guidelines will cover the common infections causing genital discharges. B Patients presenting with genital discharges should also be screened for HIV and syphilis.8,9 Grade B, Level 2++ 3.2 Diagnostic approach GPP The following diagnostic approach is recommended: A. Patient history: 1.History of discharge : onset, duration, colour, odour, association with micturition, dysuria, itch, rash, chronicity, involvement of sites (urethra, vagina, pharynx, rectum, eye), other systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, ophthalmic symptoms), use of systemic or topical remedies, any history of similar symptoms in the past or partners with similar symptoms. 2.Medical history : diabetes, HIV status, skin conditions, drug allergies, current & previous medications, menstrual history, obstetric history 3.Sexual history : gender of partners, number of partners, venue for meeting partners, commercial sex exposure, partners with symptoms or signs, partners with known genital discharge diagnosis. 4.Travel history : geographical area where sexual intercourse has taken place. GPPB3 Management of genital discharges\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001843B. Physical examination: 1.Lesion : appearance and character of discharge, consistency, odour. 2.Genital exam : external genitalia and peri-anal area for inflammation and other lesions. 3.Lymph node(s ): note number and location of enlarged nodes, size, tenderness. 4.General exam : thorough examination of oral cavity and eyes/joints as necessary. In males, examine the penis carefully, retract the foreskin if present, inspect the meatus for inflammation, and look for urethral discharge. If there is no discharge visible, gently 'milk' the urethra towards the meatus. GPP 3.3 Genital discharges in males Urethritis is a common cause of genital discharges in males. Clinical features Symptoms of urethritis include discharge, dysuria, and intra-urethral itch/discomfort. The quantity of discharge ranges from minimal to profuse, and it may be continuous or intermittent. The colour and consistency of the discharge ranges from clear, mucoid, white, mucopurulent, to frankly purulent. The presence of a urethral discharge is almost always indicative of urethral infection. Dysuria in sexually active young to middle-aged men often indicates a urethral infection, whereas in older men a urinary tract infection is a more likely diagnosis. Nevertheless urethral infections due to sexually- transmitted pathogens may be asymptomatic. \u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001844Causes of period (2-7 days) than NGU and is characterised clinically by a profuse purulent discharge from the affected genital site (>80% in male urethritis, up to 50% in female cervicitis), often accompanied by local pain or discomfort. However asymptomatic infection occurs in 10% of urethral infection, >50% of cervical infection, >90% of pharyngeal and rectal infection. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) refers to any urethritis from which N. gonorrhoeae cannot be detected or isolated. NGU often has milder symptoms, with scant discharge, and a longer incubation period (7-21 days). Urethritis which is not caused by N.gonorrhoeae may be due to Chlamydia trachomatis (up to 50%) and other (20-30%) have no detectable organisms (non-specific urethritis). \u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001845Approach to of urethral discharges feature Gonorrhoea Non-gonococcal urethritis Nature of discharge Purulent Profuse Clear, in males: Small amounts of discharge may have been washed away if the patient has recently voided. In such cases the patient should be asked to return 4 hours after holding his urine when the laboratory tests can be performed. D All patients who have confirmed or suspected urethritis should be tested for gonorrhoea and chlamydia.9 Grade D, Level 4 Testing for chlamydia is strongly recommended because of the increased utility and availability of highly sensitive and specific testing methods and because a specific diagnosis might enhance partner notification/management and improve compliance with treatment, especially in the exposed partner.72D\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001846B Because of high specificity (>99%) and sensitivity (>95%), a Gram stain of a male urethral specimen that demonstrates polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular Gram-negative diplococci is presumptive of infection with N.gonorrhoeae in symptomatic men. Thus it is recommended that urethral smears be obtained in symptomatic men to aid in diagnosis72,73 Grade B, Level 2++ Microscopy is not suitable for pharyngeal or rectal specimens where many other bacteria are present including Gram-negative cocci belonging to other genera.73 Cultures and PCR detection for Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalium are not routinely performed. Acute NGU is diagnosed when there are 5 or more polymorphic leucocytes (PML) present per high-power field in 5 or more fields using high power (1000x) oil- immersion microscopic examination of a properly prepared Chlamydia and gonorrhoea in women Chlamydia trachomatis C.trachomatis is a common bacterial STI in women. It is usually asymptomatic (in 80% of women). However, women may present with vaginal discharge (due to cervicitis), abnormal bleeding (postcoital or intermenstrual), lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia or dysuria. Risk factors for C.trachomatis are: age <25 years, a new sexual partner or more than one partner in the last year.74-76 Neisseria gonorrhoeae N.gonorrhoeae is another common bacterial STI in women. Up to 50% of women with N.gonorrhoeae will complain of vaginal discharge. The discharge is due to cervicitis rather than vaginitis. N.gonorrhoeae may coexist with other genital tract pathogens such as Trichomonas, Candida and C.trachomatis.77 B Microscopical examination of Gram-stained smears of endocervical discharge can be used as a point of care test to provide an immediate presumptive diagnosis of gonorrhoea.73 Grade B, Level 2++ B B\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001847Microscopy of endocervical smears in women has a sensitivity of between 30-50%.73 Blood tests such as the gonococcal complement fixation test (GC- CFT) are not useful for the diagnosis of gonorrhoea. Serological tests are also not useful in the diagnosis of acute chlamydial infections because of cross-reactivity between chlamydial species, and the high prevalence of Chlamydia antibodies in high risk populations.73 B Gonococcal complement fixation test are not recommended for the diagnosis of gonorrhea. Serological tests are not recommended for the diagnosis of acute chlamydial infections. Grade B, Level 2++ 3.5 Complications of genital discharges Epididymo-orchitis due to retrograde spread of urethral infection is a relatively uncommon but well-known complication of untreated urethritis. N.gonorrhoeae and C.trachomatis are the commonest causes. Reactive arthritis or Reiter's syndrome (the classic triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis, sometimes with circinate balanitis and most frequently triggered by Chlamydia trachomatis urethritis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may occur in untreated females. As PID can cause serious sequelae such as infertility & ectopic pregnancy as a result of tubal damage, investigation AND treatment is warranted. Chronic pelvic pain may also occur. Syndromic management can be applied to urethritis in males in view of the relatively short list of pathogens, fairly specific clinical features and small number of differential diagnoses.

There is no consensus of opinion for either the diagnosis or the management of this condition. Persistent chlamydial infection is only rarely detected. There is evidence that ureaplasmas and M. genitalium may be important in the aetiology of chronic NGU. Some men with recurrent or persistent NGU are anxious, obsessional, and hypochondriacal.

The causes can be physiological or pathological. 3.9.1 Physiological vaginal discharge Pre-menopausal women may have normal physiological discharge that is cyclical in nature. The qu antity of physiological discharge will vary from minimal during parts of the cycle but profuse at other times. The causes of physiological vaginal discharge are listed in Table 1. BIn women of reproductive age complaining of vaginal discharge the commonest cause is physiological, but infective and other causes should be excluded.91,92 Grade B, Level 2++D B\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001854 Table 1 Causes of vaginal discharge 1.

When a woman presents with a complaint of vaginal discharge, her clinician should consider if and when investigations are required. B A spontaneous complaint of abnormal vaginal discharge is most commonly due to a vaginal infection, and rarely, it may be the result of mucopurulent STI-related cervicitis. The symptom of abnormal vaginal discharge is highly indicative of vaginal infection, but poorly predictive for cervical infection. To ensure a cost-effective approach, B\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001855risk assessment should therefore be done before investigations and treatment is provided.91,92 Grade B, Level 2++ B Where resources permit, one should consider the use of laboratory tests to screen women with vaginal discharge. Such screening could be applied to all women with discharge as well as to those with a positive risk assessment.91,92 Grade B, Level 2++ GPP Investigation of a woman with vaginal discharge is indicated if (Table 2): 1.

Spontaneous onset and remission of bacterial vaginosis can occur. Whilst bacteria l vaginosis is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, it is more common amongst sexually active than non-sexually active women.95 Bacterial vaginosis presents with complaints of an unpleasant fishy smelling vaginal discharge; however, it can be asymptomatic. Bacterial vaginosis is not associated with itch, soreness or irritation. A malodorous, white-grey, thin homogeneous discharge is often visible and adherent to the introitus. Diagnosis is made by the Amsel criteria or with a Gram stained vaginal smear (Hay/Ison or Nugent Criteria). Amsel Criteria96 Bacterial vaginosis is confirmed on the basis of fulfillment of three or more of the four Amsel criteria: 1. Thin, homogenous, white vaginal discharge 2. Vaginal pH >4.5 3. Clue cells on microscopy of wet mount 4. Positive amine test (addition of potassium hydroxide to a wet preparation of vaginal secretion releases a fishy odour). Hay / Ison (Normal): Lactobacillus predominate. Grade 2 (Intermediate): Mixed flora with some Lactobacilli present, but Gardnerella or Mobiluncus morphotypes also present Grade 3 (bacterial vaginosis): Predominantly Gardnerella and/or Mobiluncus morphotypes. Few or absent Lactobacilli. Nugent Criteria98 Nugent score is derived from estimating the relative proportions of bacterial morphotypes to give a score between 0 and 10. A score of < \u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018584 is normal and 4-6 is intermediate. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed if Nugent score is > 6. Note: 1. Menses, semen, cervical secretions or douching may affect the pH, a weak positive \"sniff test\" may be produced by menstrual blood or semen. 2. Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis cannot be used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis because it can be cultured from the vagina of normal women. Special groups Pregnancy In pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis is associated with late miscarriage, preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum endometritis.99-102 Three randomized controlled studies showed a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth following screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole in women with a history of prior idiopathic preterm birth or second trimester loss. Unfortunately, the studies used different treatment regimes.103-105 Some randomized controlled studies and systematic reviews showed that treatment was not beneficial or even harmful and increased the rate of preterm delivery in both low-risk as well as high-risk groups.106-108 Thus, current evidence is insufficient to evaluate the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. In asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery, studies are lacking, and evidence is therefore poor, for the benefits or harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis. Women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy (TOP) Bacterial vaginosis is associated with post-TOP endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Clindamycin vaginal creams and suppositories may be oil-based and might weaken latex condoms.117A A A A A A A\u00180 \u0018\u001861Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy A If bacterial vaginosis causes vaginal discharge in pregnancy, it should be treated as for non-pregnant women.118 Grade A, Level 1+ Recommended regimens for pregnant women:119 1.A Clindamycin cream 2% (5 g) intravaginally daily x 3 days or Clindamycin-sustained released (SR) cream 2% (5 g) intravaginally x single application . Grade A, Level 1+ OR 2.A Clindamycin 300 mg orally bid x 7 days. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 3.A Metronidazole pessary (500 mg) intravaginally bid x 7 days or daily x 14 days. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 4.A Metronidazole 400 mg orally bid x 7 days. (Avoid in first trimester*). Grade A, Level 1+ Note: 1. *Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier. Although it has been given to pregnant women without apparent complication or teratogenicity, it is advisable to withold oral or vaginal metronidazole during the first trimester of pregnancy. 2. In three trials, intravaginal clindamycin cream was administered at 16-32 weeks' gestation, and an increase in adverse events (e.g., low birth-weight and neonatal infections) was observed in newborns. Therefore, intravaginal clindamycin cream should only be used during the first half of pregnancy.99,120,121 Recurrent bacterial vaginosis Recurrence of bacterial vaginosis occurs within 3 months of treatment in 15-30% of women. There are few published studies evaluating the optimal approach to women with frequent recurrences of bacterial vaginosis.122A A A A A\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001862Suppressive regimes may be considered but evidence to support their effectiveness is limited. Suggested suppressive thera py for recurrent bacterial vaginosis:123 1.A Metronidazole gel 0.75% (5 g) twice weekly for 4-6 months. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 2.C Metronidazole 400 mg orally bid for 3 days at the start and end of menstruation. Grade C, Level 2+ Suggested maintenance regime for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: B Acetic acid vaginal gel use at the time of menstruation and following unprotected sexual intercourse to maintain acidic vaginal pH.123 Grade B, Level 2+ Follow up D Follow-up is not necessary if symptoms resolve. A test of cure is not required.9 Grade D, Level 4 Management of sex partners No clinical counterpart is recognised in males and screening and treatment has not shown to be beneficial for the male partner. Although some studies reported a high incidence of bacterial vaginosis in female partners of lesbian women with bacterial vaginosis, no studies have as yet investigated the value of treating partners of lesbian women simultaneously.124,125 (80-92%). presents with vulval itch or soreness with a curd-like vaginal discharge. Occasionally, it can be associated with superficial dyspareunia or external dysuria. Clinically, the woman may have signs of erythema and excoriation over the vulva or vagina with a curdy discharge. Satellite lesions may be seen. The risk factors include pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, antibiotics treatment, and immunosuppression. Laboratory tests include Gram-stain or wet mount (saline or 10% Potassium hydrochloride) of swabs from the vulva/vaginal wall which reveal budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae (sensitivity 60%), vaginal pH 4-4.5 and culture on Sabouraud medium. Note: 1. Isolation of Candida species in the absence of symptoms and signs does not suggest infection and is not an indication for treatment as 10-20% of women during reproductive years may be colonized with Candida species. 2. None of the above symptoms or signs is pathognomonic for vulvovaginal candidiasis. 3. The symptoms and signs are no guide to the underlying causative species.128,129 Treatment of candidiasis Treatment is indicated for symptomatic patients. D Avoid local irritants (e.g. perfumed vaginal douch), scented panty- liners and tight fitting synthetic clothing.130,131 Grade D, Level 4 Treatment for uncomplicated acute vulvovaginal candidiasis ABoth vaginal or oral antifungals (azoles) can be used in the treatment of uncomplicated acute vulvovaginal candidiasis 32 Grade A, Level 1+ Recommended regimens for uncomplicated acute vulvovaginal candidiasis:132 1.A Butoconazole1-sustained released (SR) cream site 2% (5 g) intravaginally x single application. Grade A, Level 1+D A A\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001864 OR 2.A Clotrimazole pessary 200 mg intravaginally daily x 3 days or 100 mg or 1% cream (5 g) intravaginally daily x 7 days or 500 mg x single application. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 3.A Fluconazole 150 mg orally single dose. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 4.A Isoconazole pessary 600 mg intravaginally x single application. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 5.A Itraconazole 200 mg orally bid x 1 day. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 6.A Miconazole pessary 200 mg intravaginally daily x 3 days or 100 mg or 2% cream (5 g) intravaginally daily x 7 days. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 7.A Nystatin pessary 100,000 U daily x 14 days. Grade A, Level 1+ Note: 1. All topical and oral azole therapies give a clinical and mycological cure rate of 80-90% in uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Nystatin preparations give 70-90% cure rate. 2. The treatment choice is the personal preference, availability and affordability as well as familiarity of the clinician with the treatment. 3. Topical azole creams and suppositories may be oil-based and might weaken latex condoms.117 4. Topical azole treatment may cause vulvo-vaginal irritation and this should be considered if symptoms worsen.129,133-136 Follow up GPP Follow-up is not necessary if symptoms resolve. A test of cure is not required.132 GPPA A A A A A GPP\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001865Management of sex partners There is no evidence to support the treatment of asymptomatic male sexual partners in either episodic or recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.137,138 Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis This is defined as 4 or more episodes of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis in a year. There may be partial resolution of symptoms between episodes. Positive microscopy or a moderate/heavy growth of Candida should be documented on at least two episodes. 5% of women with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis will develop recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. It is usually due to C albicans although C.glabrata and other non-albicans species are observed in 10-20% of patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.139,140 Patients must be evaluated for any predisposing factors. These include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, high oestrogen state (e.g. use of oral contraceptive pill and hormonal replacement therapy), disturbance of normal vagina flora (e.g. use of broad- spectrum antibiotics) and corticosteroid use. Treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis GPP Clinicians should be aware of psychosexual problems and depression, which can occur in women with recurrent vaginal infections. GPP The principle of therapy involves an induction regimen to ensure clinical remission, followed immediately by a maintenance regimen. Recommended regimens for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis:132,138-140 Induction regimens 1.A Fluconazole 150 mg orally every 72 hours x 3 doses. Grade A, Level 1+ OR GPP A\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u0018662.C Topical imidazole therapy x 7-14 days according to symptomatic response. Grade C, Level 2+ Maintenance regimens 1.B Clotrimazole pessary 500 mg intravaginally once a week or 200 mg intravaginally twice a week. Grade B, Level 2++ OR 2.B Fluconazole 150 mg orally once a week. Grade B, Level 2++ Note: 1.BMaintenance therapy should last 6 months. 90% of women should remain disease-free during treatment.132,139,140 Grade B, Level 2++ 2.C For women who have relapses between doses, consider twice- weekly 150 mg fluconazole or 50 mg fluconazole daily.132,139,140 Grade C, Level 2+ D Monitor the liver function test when the woman is on regular oral azole treatment.141 Grade D, Level 4 Alternative treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Probiotics/Lactobacillus There is insufficient evidence to support the use of oral or vaginal lactobacillus to prevent vulvovaginal candidiasis although there are anecdotal reports of benefit.142,143 Special groups Candidiasis in pregnancy Asymptomatic colonization with Candida species is more common (30-40%). Colonisation with Candida species is not associated with low birth weight or premature delivery. Thus, no treatment is necessary for asymptomatic colonization. C CB B B D\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001867B Symptomatic candidiasis in pregnancy should be treated with topical azole therapy only. Longer courses (seven days) are recommended. Oral azole th erapy is contraindicated.144-146 Grade B, Level 2+ Candidiasis in diabetes mellitus Glycaemic control should be op timized. There is an increased prevalence of non-albicans species, in particular C glabrata. For treatment of symptomatic women with C glabrata isolated, boric acid 600 mg intravaginal suppository once a day for 14 days is as effective as a single dose of fluconazole 150 mg, and either may be used.145-149 Candidiasis in HIV infection Vulvovaginal candidiasis occurs more frequently and with greater persistence in women with HIV infection. Treat with conventional methods.150,151 Non-albicans Candidiasis The majority of non-albicans infection is due to Candida glabrata and is susceptible to available azoles. Candida krusei non-albicans vulvovaginal candidiasis remain unknown. Non-albicans infection may require (7-14 days). Treatment CNystatin pessaries or nonfluconazole azole drug (oral or topical) are the first line treatment for non-albicans infection. Grade C, Level 2+ OR C Consider Amphotericin B vaginal suppositories 50 mg once a day for 14 days.152-154 Grade C, Level 2+ B C C\u0018\u0018 causes vaginitis in women. It infects the vagina, urethra and paraurethral glands. In adults, transmission is almost exclusively sexually transmitted. 10-50% of infected women can be asymptomatic. Predominant symptoms are yellow-green and offensive discharge, vulval itch or dysuria. On examination the vulva may be erythematous or excoriated, the vagina inflamed, and small cervical haemorrhages and ulcers can give the classical appearance of the \"strawberry cervix\" which occurs in 2% of infected patients.155-157 Laboratory tests include direct microscopy of the wet mount of vaginal secretions mixed with normal saline (sensitivity 70%). A swab taken from the posterior fornix of vagina and cultured on Feinberg- Whittington media is the most sensitive (sensitivity > 90%) and specific for trichomoniasis.158-160[0] Management of sex partners DSexual contacts in the preceding 60 days should be traced, screened and treated on epidemiologic ground s. If the last sexual exposure was >60 days, the patient's most recent partner should be treated.9 Grade D, Level 4 D Patients should be advised to avoid sexual intercourse (including oral sex) until they and their partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up.9 Grade D, Level 4 D Screening for coexisting sexually transmitted infections should be undertaken in both the patients and their partners.9 Grade D, Level 4 CWomen should be informed that T. vaginalis is a STI and partner management and treatment is recommended for all partners in the last 2 months.161 Grade C, Level 2+ D D D C\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001869Treatment of trichomoniasis Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients should be treated. Recommended regimen for trichomoniasis:161 1.A Metronidazole 2 g orally x single dose. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 2.A Metronidazole 400 mg orally bid x 7 days. Grade A, Level 1+ OR 3.A Tinidazole 2 g orally single dose. Grade A, Level 1+ Note: 1. D Metronidazole gel is not recommended because it is less efficacious (< 50%).72 Grade D, Level 4 2. The recommended metronidazole regimes have resulted in cure rates of 90-95%. Trichomoniasis in pregnancy Trichomonas infection has been associated with premature rupture of the membranes, preterm delivery and low birthweight. However, data do not suggest that metronidazole treatment results in a reduction in perinatal morbidity.162,163 D Although the use of metronidazole in pregnancy has not been shown to be teratogenic or mutagenic in all stages of pregnancy or breastfeeding, caution should be advised for use in the first trimester. Metronidazole pessaries may be used to provide symptomatic relief but have lower cure rates than the oral regimes.72 Grade D, Level 4 D Treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis relieves symptoms of vaginal discharge in pregnant women and might prevent respiratory or genital infection of the newborn and further sexual transmission. Clinicians should counsel patients regarding the potential risks and benefits of treatment.72 Grade D, Level 4 A A A D D D\u00180 \u0018\u001870A It is reasonable to delay therapy in asymptomatic pregnant women until after 37 weeks' gestation. In addition, these pregnant women should be provided careful counseling regarding condom use and the continued risk of sexual transmission.164,165 Grade A, Level 1+ Follow up A Follow-up is unnecessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients with persistent symptoms should be retreated with metronidazole 400 mg orally bid for 7 days.161 Grade A, Level 1+ A If treatment failure occurs repeatedly, the patient can be treated with high dose oral metronidazole 2 g daily for 3 days.161 Grade A, Level 1+ A A A\u00180 \u0018\u0018714 Cost-effectiveness issues GPP Doctors should consider efficacy, adverse side effects, dosing frequency, and cost to the patient when recommending treatments. For compliance issues, single dose therapies are generally recommended. GPP B Male patients complaining of urethral discharge and/or dysuria should be examined for discharge. The major pathogens causing urethral discharge are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis In the syndromic management of a patient with urethral discharge, treatment should adequately cover these two organisms and has been found to be cost-effective. Where reliable laboratory facilities are available, a distinction may be made between the two organisms.166,167 Grade B, Level 2++ 4 Cost-effectiveness issues GPP B\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001872 5 Clinical quality improvement The following clinical quality improvement parameters, based on recommendations in these guidelines, are proposed: 1. Every patient presenting with genital discharges and/or ulcers should have a sexual history taken and sexual risk assessment evaluation (pg 27). 2. All patients should be educated and counseled on their condition, and be encouraged to adopt safer sexual behaviours (pg 29). 3. Patients with gonorrhoea should be treated with the recommended antibiotics, and specifically should not be treated with quinolones (pg 49). 4. Patients with gonorrhoea should be concurrently given treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis (pg 49). 5. Patients with syphilis should be treated with parenteral penicillin unless there is a contraindication (pg 37). 6. Partner notification should be encouraged in all patients diagnosed with an STI (39). 5 Clinical quality improvement\u0018\u0018 \u0018\u001873 References 1. Sen P, Chio M, Tan HH, Chan R.
