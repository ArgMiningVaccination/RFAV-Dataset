Through an analysis linking colonization on Turtle Island, ongoing industrial development, and th e social determinants of health in an Indigenous context, this research aims to identify culturally relevant indicators that can give early signals of increased chronic conditions prevalence and reduced access to health services for the Metlakatla First Na tion. This research took place within the Metlakatla Cumulative Effect Management Program, a community -partnered resource management system for monitoring the status of Metlakatla values and responding proactively to cumulative change in Metlakatla Territo ry. To identify indicators, a thematic analysis of qualitative data gathered through three focus groups with Metlakatla members and staff (n = 6) and five interviews with health experts (n = 8) was carried out using a collaborative approach. Additionally, the Metlakatla Membership Census provided quantitative data to corroborate the indicators identified. Results suggest that the most appropriate indicators linking resource development impacts to increased chronic conditions prevalence and limited access to health services for the Metlakatla First Nation include Social and Cultural Connectedness (metric: Sense of Connectedness to Metlakatla Culture, Community, History, and Traditional Lands and Waters), Continuity of Care (metric: Presence of a Primary Care Provider), and a food -related indicator (metric: further investigation required). Our findings emphasize the importance of engagement and collaboration with Indigenous peoples to ensure cultural relevance and appropriateness of health indicators in a resou rce development context.

Introduction Chapter 1 presents the research context, study objectives, project report structure, and positionality statement. 1.1. Research Context Health is not defined by the presence of diseases or absence of symptoms but is concerned with holistic well -being (World Health Organization, 1948) . The latter encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of well -being (Aalhus et al., 2018; Kryzanowski & McIntyre, 2011) . In many Indigenous worldviews, humans are healthy when in balance between their body, mind, heart, spirit, as well as with their families, communities, Nations, and w ith nature (First Nations Health Authority, 2021; Methot, 2019) . Nature, however, is impacted by human activities. Industrial projects can damage the environment , directly affecting human health. The impact of industrial development on the environment is commonly assessed in Environmental Impact Assessments (E IA), and the impact of industrial development on health is usually analyzed through Health Impact Assessments (HIA) (Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) . Nonetheless, health impacts can also be measured through E IAs. EIAs and HIAs, although likely cr eated with the best of intentions, have significant shortcomings . There are three notable issues with impact assessments. First, m ost EIAs and HIAs focus on the impacts of a specific project rather than considering the cumulative effects of industrial activities. In this context, cumulative alludes to the \" synergistic, interactive, or unpredictable outcomes of multiple land -use practices or development projects that aggregate over time and space, and that result in significant consequences for people and th e environment \" (Johnson, 2016, p. 25) . In this report, effect refers to a change in the environment, whereas impact points to the consequence of such change (Johnson, 2016) ; in other words, effect is defined as the difference in the condition of a parameter, whereas impact refers to the estimated social value of the effect (Noble, 2015) . Second, health is rarely assessed in a holistic manner, as EIAs and HIAs often solely focus on physical dimensions (e.g., exposure to contaminants) , or conduct physical disease -based measures (e.g., cancer rates), or evaluate socio -economic impacts alone (Gregory et al., 2016; Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . Third, HIAs do not usually take local Indigenous v alues into consideration (Gregory et al., 2016; Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . 2 The Metlakatla Cumulative Effects Management (CEM) Program was created to fill these gaps. The CEM Program is a resource management system that monitors and manages the status of priority Metlakatla values and responds proactively to cumulative change in Metlakatla Territory over time. It was design ed specifically for the Metlakatla First Nation , who face s multiple industrial development project s on its Territory. It is supported by academic researchers and the Metlakatla First Nation. In 201 5, the CEM Program identified three health indicators that would help assess and mitigate adverse effects of development on the community's health. In 2020, the CEM Program decided to revisit these indicators. The process and findings of the research , detailed in this paper , emphasize the importance of engag ement and collaboration with Indigenous peoples to ensure the cultural relevance and appropriateness of health indicators in a resource development context . Another report presenting th ese findings, called the CEM Health Indicators Final Report , was prepared for the Metlakatla First Nation to inform Metlakatla leadership and managers' decisions on how to assess and monitor Metlakatla members' health status, with the possibility of implementing management actions at a later stage of the CEM Program. The project team supporting this report includes Cl\u00e9mentine Bouche (Master's Student Intern), Katerina Ph.D. candidate (Metlakatla Project Support), and Dr. Clifford Atleo (SFU Supervisor). 1.2. Research Objectives The goal of this research is to revise and identify Indigenous health indicators for the Metlakatla First Nation , whose Traditional Territory is heavily impacted by resource extraction activities . To reach this goal, three research objectives have been defined : Validate priority health values (Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services) and condition indicators for Chronic Health Conditions Identify or revise stressor indicator(s) for Chronic Health Conditions Identify or revise condition indicator(s) and barriers for Access to Health Services A background on the objectives will be provided in Chapter 3: Metlakatla First Nation Case Study. 3 1.3. Project Report Structure This project report is divided into five chapt ers. Chapter one provides the research context and preliminary information regarding the research project. Chapter two summarizes the academic and grey literature linking colonization on Turtle Island, ongoing industrial development, and the social determi nants of health in an Indigenous context. Chapter three gives an overview of the Metlakatla First Nation case study, including an introduction to the Metlakatla First Nation and the CEM Program and a summary of past work on Metlakatla's health values within the CEM Program . Chapter four provides an overview of the current CEM health research objectives and methodology. Chapter five presents the findings for Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services, including value background and validati on, indicator background and rational e for selection , and related health results from the 2020 Metlakatla Membership Census (MMC). Chapter six offers recommendations for the continuation of this health research in the CEM Program. Chapter 7 discusses the f indings from this study, including lessons learned, research implications, limitations, contextualization, and conclusion . 1.4. Positionality Statement Considering the context (Canada) and topic (Indigenous health) of this research project, its introduction wo uld not be complete without a positionality statement explaining where my perspective is situated in space and time. I am a French student working towards the completion of my master 's degree in Resource and Environmental Management in Canada. I studied on the unceded territories of the xmkwym (Musqueam), Skwxw\u00fa7mesh (Squamish), and Sl\u00edlwta (Tsleil -Waututh) Nations . I currently reside on the Tsuut'ina Nation, \u00cey\u00e2rhe Nakoda , Piikani (Scabby Tribe), and Siksika Nations, and the M\u00e9tis People of Alberta Region 3. I have come to this land to learn and to s ettle. I identify as a white settler in this country and recognize that these lands were inhabited by people long before my ancestors arrived. These people have been called the 'Native, ' 'Indigenous ,' or 'Aboriginal' peoples of Canada as they carry ancestr al ties to the land that go beyond times we can define. The terms mentioned above convey the idea of oppression, a structure and attitude that my ancestors have unfairly benefited from and that I continue to benefit from today. I am an uninvited guest on t hese lands as, although I intend to come in the gentlest and most open state of my being, I do not know if the host nations are willing to accept me. 4 This acknowledgment connects me to the histories and present of the lands I stand on, of the people aroun d me, and explains how I have come to be here. I was raised and born in a social world crafted in my image, and after which my image is crafted. Through this work, I intend to deconstruct the worldview that shapes my thinking by analyzing my roots and social position: I am a white, privileged, able -bodied, cis -gendered, university -educated woman raised in a wealthy, catholic -minded, non -diverse environment. Yet, this acknowledgment brings no pride. On these unceded lands, I fe el ashamed of my ancestors' detrimental actions and frustrated by my inability to change the past. I hope to have some ability to heal the wounds created by history; yet, how can I present myself to Indigenous peoples? I am not an invited guest on these la nds and will never be. I am hoping that these uncomfortable feelings, accompanied by reflection and action, guided by respect and desire to learn, and redirected by Indigenous peoples, could be transformative for me and the society I live in. My positiona lity statement must also mention my perspectives as a researcher, student, and individual regarding this specific study. First, a s a researcher, I come as an outsider to the Indigenous community I work with. This position may allow me to begin with few emo tional ties and consequent biases to the conversations I enter. However, I lack the 'insider knowledge' of living in the community; thus, I may lack the necessary social and cultural knowledge to understand the sayings and assumptions of the members I work with. Yet, although I am a foreigner, stranger, and outsider to the Metlakatla community, I immensely benefit from the lasting relationships of trust and respect built with members through the CEM Program. Second, a s a graduate student in Resource and Env ironmental Management, I have little background and knowledge of health and well-being. The knowledge presented here is the result of this sole research project. My work intends to be as holistic as possible, linking understanding s and experiences from man y fields. Nonetheless, the findings of this research and subsequent conclusions are limited to the knowledge accessible to me and bound by the objectives of the CEM Program , which frame the research. Third, a s an individual, I seek to achieve 'empathetic n eutrality ,' a process through w hich I aim to be as objective as possible by letting go of the socially constructed biases that shape my reasoning. However, any work will always be affected by various human epistemological subjectivities. 5 Chapter 2. Literature Review In this literature review , I offer a background on the social determinants of health to better understand the diverse elements affecting one's health, with a focus on Indigenous peoples' health. I also introduce the impacts of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous peoples' wellbeing , which is necessary to comprehend Indigenous perspectives on wellbeing in Canada today . 2.1. Social Determinants of Indigenous Health The social determinants of health can be used as a lens to understand the numerous and intricate pathways affecting the overall health of Indigenous peoples. The social determinants of health are the bro ad social, physical, and economic aspects of an individual's life (Auger, 2016; Loppie Reading . They inf luence all health variables through direct and indirect pathways, encouraging or inhibiting health maintenance during an individual's lifetime (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009; Nelson & Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . The social determinants of health can be classified int o three dimensions: the proximal, intermediate, and distal determinants of health (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . Figure 1 illustrates the various dimensions of the social determinants of health. 6 Figure 1: The social determinants of health framework. Adapted from the work of Loppie Reading and Wien (2009). 2.1.1. Distal Determinants The distal determinants of health represent the dominant social, economic, and political contexts in which the intermediate and proximal determinants are constructed (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . They comprise colonialism, racism and social exclusion, and self -determination (Aalhus et al., 2018; Loppie Reading & Wein, impact of distal determinants, although indirect, af fects individuals in all aspects of their lives and during all life phases. For example, in an Indigenous context, the legacy of colonialism , including government policies and the residential school system , impacts Indigenous peoples' mental, emotional, sp iritual, and physical health at the individual, familial, and community levels (Hackett et al., 2016; Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009; Marrone, 2007) . This collective emotional and psychological harm inflicted over centuries to Indigenous communities is characterized as intergenerational trauma or historical trauma (Mitchell et al., 2019 ). In addition, ongoing colonialism leads to an unfair distribution of resources, power, freedom, and control (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) , hindering Indigenous peoples' ability to 7 recover from past traumas. Links between colonization and health will be detailed in section 2.2. Colonization . 2.1.2. Interme diate Determinants The intermediate determinants represent the social and physical contexts in which individuals grow. They are embedded in the distal determinants and are the origins of the proximal determinants (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . The intermediate determinants of health include health care system s, educational systems, community infrastructure, resources, and capacities, as well as environmental stewardship and cultural continuity (Aalhus et al., 2018; Jokinen, 2018) . Cult ural continuity can be defined as the maintenance and transmission of cultural and social cohesion within a community (Auger, 2016; Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . The impact of the intermediate determinants is often indirect and only visible in the long term (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . For example, a lack o f community infrastructure and resources limits the number of programs that could encourage social cohesion, emotional support, and healthy behaviours (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . Likewise, low cultural continuity leads to negative emotional responses such as low self -esteem, pride, sense of belonging , sense of purpose, empowerment, a fragile identity, and a low capacity to cope with stress, grief, and loss (Auger, 2016; Oster et al., 2014) . Ultimately, these emotional responses affect physical health (Auger, 2016; Methot, 2019; Oster et al., 2014; Pressman et al., 2013) . Some of the pathways between the intermediate determinants and Indigenous peoples' health w ill be expanded on in section 2.3 Resource Extraction . 2.1.3. Proximal Determinants The proximal determinants of health are the conditions that directly impact mental, emotional, and physical well -being (Government of Ca nada, 2015; Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . They encompass health behaviours (i.e., tobacco, drugs, and alcohol consumption, diet, physical activity, sleep, and sexual behaviour), physical environments (e.g., housing), employment and income, education lev el, and food security (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . By way of illustration, health behaviours can be explicitly linked to physical well -being; an unhealthy behaviour such as smoking is unequivocally associated with cancer. Similarly, other proximal determinants can directly affect emotional well -being; for example, a low income reduces access to material resources such as safe housing and is tied to social exclusion, which in turn leads to insecurity, low self-esteem, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness. The result is increased psychosocial stress \u2014a 8 form of stress that emerges in social situations that are emotionally and psychologically demanding for the individual, such as social evaluation or exclusion (Kogler et al., 2015) . This psychoso cial stress may prevent an individual from seeking social support, health care services, education, employment , and lead to poor health behaviours. These consequences may aggravate that person's health (Kogler et al., 2015) and strengthen the social trap in which individuals find themselves (Monteiro, 1973) . 2.2. Colonization 2.2.1. Colonization in Canada Apprehending colonization and its legacy is essential to understanding the h ealth of contemporary Indigenous peoples in Canada. Canada's history is a long chronicle of genocide. Before the arrival of Europeans around 1500, there were an estimated 100 million Indigenous people s in what are now called North and South America (Denevan, 1992) . During the first two hundred and fifty years, approximately ninety percent succumbed to epidemic diseases, slavery, war, famines, and mass extermination processes (Union of BC Indian Chiefs, 2005) . Many survivors were then forced into assi milation, a procedure further breaking the social, economic, cultural, and political structures that shaped Indigenous lives and communities. To describe the impact of assimilation, Methot (2019) states that \"the trauma inflicted on survivors is almost unimaginable; the genocide unprecedented\" (p. 10) . 2.2.2. Colonialism and Dis-ease Indigenous peoples \"are stuck in the disruption and disharmony created by colonialism. This has resulted in dis -ease that will continue to affect contemporary Indigenous peoples until it is addressed\" (Methot, 2019, p. 17) . Methot's st atement means that Indigenous peoples have not yet recovered from the loss of their people and the changes due to colonialism ; current statistics of high chronic diseases rates, depression rates, and crime rates tell the same story (Methot, 2019) . Methot writes 'dis -ease' instead of disease, there by emphasi zing the root and meaning of the word. The prefix 'dis' means apart or away in Latin. 'Ease' means freedom from pain. Having a 'dis - ease' means being out of balance; out of balance with one -self, others, and the world. This out -of- balance state l eads people to feel troubled and in pain, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically. This 'dis -ease' results from the ongoing trauma of colonization (Methot, 2019) . 9 2.2.3. Trauma The trauma experienced by First Nations in Canada is intergenerational, complex, continuous, and chronic. (Methot, 2019; Mitchell et al., 2019) . The trauma is intergenerational because it is bequeathed from one generation to the next. Methot (2019) explains how trauma is transferred: According to Kellerman, trauma can be transmitted across generations by four distinct but sometimes overlapping means: psychodynamic processes, sociocultural processes, the family system, and biological processes. When trauma is transmitted through psychodynamic processes, the anger, fear, and repressed grief of parents is externalized and proj ected onto their children, leading subsequent generations to engage in behaviours without insight or awareness as to the unconscious processes behind those behaviours. When intergenerational trauma is transmitted through socio -cultural processes, the young er generation is socialized through behaviours modelled by the older generation and comes to believe things about themselves and the world around them via their parents' parenting style. When the family system is the vehicle of transmission, children becom e enmeshed in the emotional issues of their parents; this lack of boundaries encourages children to ignore their own emotional needs in favour of meeting the parent's needs, resulting in problems with the child's development as an individual. Biological pr ocesses describe the physiological and genetic means by which trauma is transmitted across generations. (p. 19) The trauma is complex because it harms people mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically and affect s Indigenous communities at the indiv idual, familial, community, and national levels (Mitchell et al., 2019) . The trauma is continuous as it was prolonged after the first few decades of direct extermination (through d isease, land theft, and starvation) via the use of policies that rendered cultural, spiritual, and social practices illegal (Mitchell et al., 2019) . Historical processes and ongoing systems of control perpetuate the trauma in contemporary society. Those include but are not limited to: forced relocation into remote reserves, often on unknown and non -viable land; mandatory assimilation via residential schooling (where children suffered physical, sexual, and emotional abuse or neglect) and the Sixties Scoop (process though which Indigenous children were coercively taken to white families); interference with Indigenous governance, via the imposition of the band council system; use of cont rol systems such as the prison and health care systems, which often ignore Indigenous values and healing methods (Mitchell et al., 2019) ; and ongoing appropriation and exploitation of the land (Hackett et al., 2018; Methot, 2019) . 10 The trauma is also chronic as it can constitute single traumatic incidents, like the racism individu als face daily or the loss of a community member due to suicide (Methot, 2019) . Chronic trauma stems from both the original experience and the inherited outcomes of that experience, such as the loss of self -esteem and hope due to racism or the appearance of chronic health issues in adulthood due to maltreatment in childhood (Methot, 2019) . 2.2.4. The Contemporary Impact of Trauma A salient impact of colonization is disconnection (Methot, 2019) . Methot (2019) emphasizes that \"People who experience trauma within the context of control [i.e. colonization] are left with an altered sense of identity and self -perception, a lack of personal agency, and a lack of faith in the value and meaning of their own lives\" (p. 43) . Therefore, colonial trauma leads individuals to be disconnected from themselves, their families, communities, culture, spirituality, and the natural wor ld (Methot, 2019) . This disconnection leads to feelings of hopelessness, powerl essness, and voicelessness (passive acceptance of powerlessness), low self -esteem, feeling of inferiority or aversion towards white people, fear of change and healing, unresolved grief and loss, chronic widespread anger and rage, dysfunctional relationship s and conflict at the familial and community level, unhealthy copying mechanisms (e.g., isolation, substance use), patterns of neglect and abuse (physically, sexually, psychologically, and emotionally), and finally, mental and physical chronic illnesses (Methot, 2019) . 2.3. Resource Extraction Most r esource extraction and industrial development today continue to exacerbate colonial relations and trauma in Indigenous peoples' territories. Harming the land is harming Indigenous peoples as their relationship with the land is the foundation of their economic, social, cultural, and spiritual practices, and as such, the foundation of their identity. However, in a world dominated by market capitalism, the land is considered a commodity (Methot, 2019) . By fragmenting the land, depleting and contaminating resources, and sometimes expelling and di spossessing Nations from their territories, industrial development and resource extraction can impede First Nation self - determination, thereby contributing to the systematic oppression of Indigenous peoples and generating negative health impacts at the mac ro and micro levels (Schrecker et al., 2018) . Some of the preeminent impacts of industrial development on Indigenous communities' health are detailed below. 11 2.3.1. Environmental Alteration Resource extraction projects often lead to fragmentation, contamination, and loss of land and marine areas in Indigenous territories. Contamination can expose individuals to chemical pollutants through food, water, and air, which leads to development issues and chronic diseases such as can cers (Schrecker et al., 2018; Westwood & Orenstein, 2016). For instance, toxic by -products from mining and oil extraction, such as hydrocarbons and heavy metals (e.g., cadmium, copper, lead, chromium, mercury, etc.) , can be improperly disposed of and seep into the soil, watersheds, and reservoirs (Schrecker et al., 2018). Pollutants accumulate in the food web (i.e., bioaccumulation), becoming more prominent across each trophic level (i.e., biomagnification) (Das et al., 2014). Therefore, humans, who are at the top of the food chain, absorb large quantities of pollutants through food, water, and air, and as such, may suffer from a wide array of health issues (Das et al., 2014). Food and water insecurity increases as industrial activities damage the land and w ater, often impacting community members' ability to hunt, fish, and harvest (Aalhus et al., 2018; Amnesty International, 2016; Schrecker et al., 2018; Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) . Perceived pollution can also lead to increased stress and anxiety , and as a result, avoidance of traditional foods (Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) . The latter may erode well-being and heighten reliance on store - bought foods (Westwood & Orenstein, 2016), which often provide less nutritious items tha n traditionally gathered foods (Aalhus et al., 2018) . These processes are also exacerbated by increased living costs and full -time employment in these industries, which prevents people from spending ti me on the land. Changes in the visual landscape affect mental wellbeing as the local population experiences a loss, grief, and distress because of environmental change, a process called \"solastalgia\" (Harder, 2016). Additionally, aesthetic devastation can diminish the potential for economic diversification \u2014 like tourism \u2014in some areas (Schrecker et al., 2018) . 2.3.2. Social Changes The arrival of transient resource sector workers often has a significant impact on communities. 12 Economic disparity increases as high wages from resource extraction sectors create sharp inequalities by driving up housing, food, and services costs for the local community (Aalhus et al., 2018; Gamu et 2018; Westwo od & Orenstein, 2016) ; those who cannot benefit from the resource sectors' wages, such as women or people with disabilities, suffer from increased economic precariousness (Amnesty International, 2016) . Social cohesion at the family and community level s is often impaired as new faces enter the region . The arrival of a typically young, single, male, usually misogynist and racist workforce is associated with an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence, intentional harm (e.g., assaults) and unintenti onal injuries (e.g., road accidents) (Aalhus et al., 2018; International, 2016; G. R. Halseth, 2016; Parkes, 2016) . Particularly vulnerable to this influence is the teenage population; generally, men might be pulled out of high school early to work , while women might become the primary victims of physical abuse and sex trade (The Firelight Group, 2017) . Cultural continuity becomes fragmented as employment takes time away from community gathering and traditional practices (Aalhus et al., 2018) . The fragmentation and loss of land and marine areas also impede traditional practices and activities as areas of cultural significance are transformed, thus reducing opportunities for education, recreation, exercise, and social connections (The Firelight Group, 2017; Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) . Concurrently, conflicting values and lifestyle s reduce social well -being at the individual and community levels (Aalhus et al., 2018) . For instance, workers often find themselves in a double -bind situation where financial welfare comes at the expense of their land and culture and, thence, expression and continuation of the ir identity as Indigenous peoples. 2.3.3. Pressure on the Health Care System Industrial activities can add pressure to the local health care systems because of a rapid population increase, a higher risk of acute injuries due to the nature of the work, rising contaminant exposure leading to chronic health issues, heightened food ins ecurity, and greater mental and emotional health needs due to the changing social landscape (Aalhus et al., 2018; Schrecker et al., 2018; Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) . 13 2.4. Literature Review Summary Indigeno us peoples' health is affected by the legacy of colonial trauma and the resulting systems of oppression that persist today. Resource extraction that is often led and controlled by non-Indigenous peoples is one of the main practice s that continue to impede Indigenous peoples' ability to heal by limiting their sovereignty on their territories. A first step towards healing is to assess and manage Indigenous peoples' wellbeing through community -based indicators . The case study introduced in the following chapte rs uses the knowledge presented above to meet the study's objectives: finding Indigenous -based health indicators for a community heavily impacted by resource extraction activities in its territory . 14 Chapter 3. Metlakatla First Nation Case Study In this chapter, I offer an introduction to the Metlakatla First Nation, provides context to the study by detailing current industrial development in Metlakatla Territory, and gives an overview of the CEM Program, which is the foundation of this research p roject. 3.1. The Metlakatla First Nation The Metlakatla First Nation is a progressive community living in Northwest British Columbia (B .C.), Canada (Metlakatla Stewardship Society, 2019) . Metlakatla Territory is a diverse area of approximate ly 20,000 square kilometres in the Great Bear Rainforest, B .C., with about 2,575 km of shoreline (Figure 2). It has been occupied and used for over 8,000 years for subsistence, economic, cultural, social, spiritual, and ceremonial purposes. The major city in the Territory is Prince Rupert. Metlakatla Village, home to approximately 110 members, is a boat -accessed community located five kilometres northwest of Prince Rupert. The Metlakatla First Nation has about 1,000 members and is one of seven Tsimshian com munities in the North Coast region of B .C. Figure 2: Metlakatla First Nation Territory in the Northwest Region of British Columbia (Source: Metlakatla First Nation). 15 3.2. Development in Metlakatla Territory According to the British Columbia Major Projects Inventory , there are currently fifty -nine major projects on the North Coast as of June 30th, 2021 (B.C. Ministry of Ad vanced Education and Skills Training, 2021) . The Major Projects Inventory comprises projects valued at $15 million (Can.) or more, with status es identified as: 'proposed, ' 'under construction, ' 'completed, ' or 'on hold. ' Project information is gathered from public and private information sources. The Inventory counts neither the numerous projects estimated at a lower value nor th ose whose details are not published for confidentiality reasons. Out of the fifty -nine projects, valued at a total of $166.4 billion, approximately sixteen are located on Metlakatla Territory, and around twenty -eight are situated just outside of Metlakatla Territory. These projects include oil and gas extraction , mining , energy, transportation , and other projects , as shown in Table 1. While it allows the area to develop economically, development has irreversible impacts on the ecosystem and affects local communities' ability to live healthily in the region . Long-term repercussions need to be carefully evaluated (G. R. Halseth, 2016) . Table 1: Number of maj or projects, per sector, in and near Metlakatla Traditional Territory .

Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training, 2021) The large number of proposed industrial projects prompted Metlakatla leadership to ponder the full ext ent of benefits and impacts on its lands and people. Therefore, Metlakatla leadership decided to assess and mitigate cumulative effects, a mandate that began in 2014 and is supported by the Metlakatla Stewardship Society. 16 3.3. The Metlakatla Cumulative Effect Management Program 3.3.1. CEM Program Overview In 2014, the Metlakatla First Nation initiated the CEM Program through a research partnership with the School of Resource and Environmental Management at Simon Fraser University. The Metlakatla CEM Program is a res ource management system designed to inform and support Metlakatla decisions on assessing, monitoring, and managing the status of priority Metlakatla values and responding proactively to cumulative change in Metlakatla Territory over time; it was proposed i n response to multiple industrial development projects in Metlakatla Territory . Its goal is to improve the condition of priority Metlakatla values. The CEM Program focuses on five pillars: Environmental, Economic Prosperity, Social/Health, Cultural Identit y, and Governance. Each pillar includes one or several priority values, which are aspects of the human and natural environment that Metlakatla cares about. The status of each value is monitored using indicators. The information gathered through the CEM Pro gram then informs and supports Metlakatla's decision -making at multiple levels. Figure 3 illustrates the Metlakatla CEM Program 's process. Figure 3: Metlakatla CEM Program Overview (Source: Metlakatla Stewardship Society, 2019) 17 The CEM Program framework uses a four -phase approach (Figure 4) to connect monitoring information to decision -making by outlining mitigation, monitoring , and management strategies. This research revisited the work done in 2015 during Phase 1. Figure 4: Phases in the Metlakatla Cumulative Effects Management Program. Adapted from the work of the Metlakatla Stewardship Society (2019) 3.3.2. Previous Metlakatla CEM Health Research Overview In 2015 , the Metlakatla First Nation identified Chronic Health Conditions (i.e., health conditions that persist in time or are recurring) and Access to Health Services (i.e., the timely, high - quality, and appropriate delivery of health care) as priority values under the health pillar in the Metlakatla CEM Program. The rationale for selecting the priority health values is shown in Table 2. 18 Table 2: Selection rationale for health values in the Metlakatla CEM Program PRIORITY HEALTH VALUE RATIONALE FOR SELECTION Chronic Health Conditions Important for understanding Metlakatla's physical, mental, and spiritual health outcomes Chronic health conditions can have far -reaching consequences beyond the illness themselves Access to Health Services Important factor for reducing health impacts from chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and mental health Concerns about effects of growing population on primary health care services in Prince Rupert Major projects contribute to pressures on primary health care services Diabetes and hypertension prevalence were identified as two condition indicators for the Chronic Health Conditions value. ACSC was chosen as the condition indicator for the Access to Health Services value. The indicators, their unit, and description and rationale are detailed in Tables 3 and 4. The Metlakatla First Nation then developed and administered thre e iterations of the MMC (Metlakatla Membership Census) in 2015, 2016, and 2017 to collect consistent socio -economic data on Metlakatla members aged 15 and older living in the traditional territory. All iterations of the MMC asked questions related to gener al health (physical, mental, and emotional health), diabetes prevalence, hypertension prevalence, health concerns, and barriers to accessing health services. The 2015 MMC also attempted to collect baseline data for the ACSC indicator but determined that th is information would be more accurate if collected from administrative health data. Table 3: 2015 Chronic Health Conditions indicators CONDITION INDICATORS UNIT DESCRIPTION / RATIONALE Diabetes (Type 2) Prevalence Percentage of members with Type 2 diabetes Prevalence is the percentage of the population at a given time that has diabetes. Incidence is the number of new cases of diabetes, typically in a year. Both are important indicators to track the efficacy of healt h initiatives and the allocation of health resources. Hypertension Prevalence Percentage of members with hypertension As above, except with regards to hypertension. This indicator does not include individuals diagnosed with hypertension during pregnancy. 19 Diabetes and hypertension prevalence have been determined as good overall condition indicators for physical health; however, these indicators tend to be 'lag' indicators . Through initial data collection efforts for these indicators, the CEM Program identified the need for 'lead' indicators that are more responsive to current and future change. 'Lag' indicators (condition indicators) inform about the condition of a value, whereas lead indicators (stressor indicators) inform about the drivers o f the condition (Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . In other words, condition indicators help trac k the overall status of a value, whereas stressor indicators measure the underlying factors that exert pressure on the condition of a value (i.e., they capture the effect of specific activities on a value) (Metlakatla Stewardship Society, 2019) . For example, diabetes prevalence can be considered a condition indicator as it informs about a person's health condition, and diet can be considered a stressor indicator as it can lead to or prevent diabetes to some extent. Stressor indicators ar e necessary to identify action areas that can be addressed early to avert chronic health conditions from developing (Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . Both types of indicators are essential to the CEM Program as they provide an overview of the community's health landscape (Metlakatla Stewardship Society, 2019) . Table 4: 2015 Access to Health Services indicator CONDITION INDICATOR UNIT DESCRIPTION / RATIONALE Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) ACSC per 100,000 in Prince Rupert younger than 75 years old ACSC is a measure of the degree to which chronic and reoccurring medical conditions are treated through traditional and/or primary care, thereby preventing the need for treatment within a hospital. Chronic and reoccurring medical conditions include Grand mal status and other epileptic convulsions , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart failure and pulmonary edema, hypertension and angina, and diabetes. A low rate can be interpreted as people's primary health care needs being adequately addressed, and a higher rate is presumed to refl ect problems in accessing primary healthcare. The indicator selected as a condition indicator for Access to Health Services in 2015 was ACSC. The indicator measures the extent to which chronic illnesses are being treated in emergency care instead of bein g treated in primary care services (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015a) . However, as previously determined by the CEM Program and confirmed through this research, using ACSC as a condition indicator for Access to Health Services is not recommend ed 20 because this indicator presents many limitations. For instance, ACSC data is limited to Health Service Delivery Areas (HSDA), in this case to the Northwest HSDA (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015a) . In an HSDA, ACSC values are not reported by ethnicity, making it difficult to determine if the ACSC values for the Northwest HSDA are representative of the ACSC values for Prince Rupert and, more specifically, the Metlakatla population (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015a) . Consequently, regional data is used to represent the community and fails to describe the specific pathways and impacts affecting Metlakatla and other local communities that are each facing particular challenges (Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . ACSC also presents clerical limitations; the code assigned to the visit may not be representative of the health issue (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015a) . In addition, accessing data for this indicator is challenging as it must be obtained through the HS DA rather than through self -reported survey data, such as through the MMC. Detailed information about previous health research conducted through the CEM Program can be found in the Access to Health Services Indicator Guide Sheet (Compa ss Resource Management Ltd., 2015a) and the Diabetes and Hypertension Prevalence Indicator Guide Sheet (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015b) . 21 Chapter 4. Research Methodology In 2020, the CEM health research project team bega n revising and developing indicators for the Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services values of the CEM Program. The research objectives and research steps are detailed below. 4.1. Current CEM Health Research Objectives The objectives of the CEM health indicators research project are to: Validate priority health values (Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services) and condition indicators for Chronic Health Conditions Identify or revise stressor indicator(s) for Chronic Health Conditions Identify or revise condition indicator(s) and barriers for Access to Health Services 4.2. Research Process The research steps included reviewing relevant academic literature, health reports , and CEM Program findings , as well as conducting focus groups with Metlakatla staff and member s, and engaging with subject -matter experts through interviews . The f indings were used to refine the health influence diagram , identify and confirm health values and indicators, and design s urvey questions for the 2020 MMC. The research steps are illustrated in Figure 5 and summarized below. Figure 5: Research steps taken in the 2020 health indicators research project 22 4.2.1. Step 1: Literature Review and Exploratory Interviews The first step in identifying indicators was to conduct a literature review and exploratory interviews with key informant s in June and July 2020. The research was grounded in a review of previous reports and findings from the Metlakat la CEM Program. Literature on health impact assessments, Indigenous health, and community -based health research was also examined , with a focus on the advers e health effects of development . The literature review identified key health challenges faced by In digenous peoples and best practices for health indicator identification, selection, and use. Exploratory interviews with health experts from the Yukon Government and B.C. Northern Health Authority also provided context and information used in the developme nt of indicators. Information from the literature review, past health -related work from the CEM Program, and key informants was used to revise the Health Influence Diagram. The latter and its description can be found in Appendix A. 4.2.2. Step 2: Indicator Identification After completing the literature review, a list of potential health indicators was compiled in August 2020. Hundreds of indicators are available to measure health; however, this list focused on indicators that best fit the needs of the Metlakatla First Nation in the context of the Metlakatla CEM Program. The CEM Program has outlined four criteria to identify and select indicators, which were adapted from the B .C. Environmental Assessment Office's (2013) Guidelines for the Selection of Valued Components and Assessment of Potential Effect (Metlakatla Stewardship Society, 2019) . The criteria are: Accuracy : the indicator accurately reflects changes in the value and is appropriate to the spatial scale of the value. Practicality : the indicator is feasible to monitor and unambiguous for users. Sensitivit y: the indicator is sensitive to development and possible mitigation efforts. Relevance : the indicator can inform the work of Metlakatla Departments. As previously mentioned, the CEM Program has selected diabetes and hypertension prevalence as condition in dicators for the Chronic Health Conditions value. Thus, stressor indicators should reflect changes in these condition indicators. As for Access to Health Services, the selected condition indicator should reflect changes in the value itself. An additional c riterion to consider during the health indicator selection process is the data collection method. It can be 23 difficult to obtain data specific to the Metlakatla First Nation from Health Authorities, so some health data to date has been gathered through the MMC. The CEM Program aims to collect most , if not all , of its socioeconomic data through the MMC. Thus, data compatibility with survey data collection methods is an important criterion for evaluating candidate health indicators. In the list of potential indicators, indicators were categorized into themes and sub -themes (Appendix B). Themes include physical health, behavioural health, mental, emotional, and spiritual health, and access to health services. From a list of approximate ly sixty indicators, a shortlist of twenty indicators (roughly one for each sub -theme) was created (Appendix C). Approximately ten indicators were drawn from this shortlist and discussed during focus groups and interviews , and used to initiate discussion a round health indicators for Metlakatla (Appendix C - see indicators highlighted in blue). 4.2.3. Step 3: Focus Groups with Metlakatla Staff and Members Focus groups are open -ended small -group discussions guided by a facilitator and sometimes a moderator. Three fo cus groups were conducted between September and October 2020. Focus Group 1 was conducted with Metlakatla staff, Focus Group 2 with Metlakatla members (non - staff), and Focus Group 3 with Metlakatla staff and members who had participated in the previous two focus groups. The goals of the focus groups were to elicit information on health issues encountered by Metlakatla staff and members, as well as identify and select indicators for each health priority value. More details about the focus group methodology c an be found in the Summary Report of Health Focus Groups (2021) . 4.2.4. Step 4: Interviews with Health Experts Group and individual interview s were conducted with health experts from B .C. Northern Health Authority in October 2020 to revise the methodology for col lecting data on health indicators, discuss the indicators identified with Metlakatla members and staff and explore metrics for the selected indicators. More details about the interview methodology can be found in the Summary Report of Health Interviews (2021). 24 4.2.5. Step 5: Designing MMC Questions Next, MMC questions were designed based on findings from the literature review, focus groups, and interviews. The MMC project team reviewed the proposed census questions before incorporat ing them into the census. The 2020 MMC included questions on general health in addition to questions related to the selected indicators ( see Appendix D for the 2020 MMC health questions ). 4.2.6. Step 6: 2020 MMC Data Collection and Analysis The 2020 MMC was administered from November 9 to December 7, 2020. The target population f or the MMC was a reported 321 members understood to be living in Metlakatla Territory aged 15 years and older, primarily in Metlakatla Village or Prince Rupert. The response rate for the 2020 MMC was 61.2%. After survey responses were collected, responses were entered, anonymized, and cleaned. The main data results from the health section of the MMC were provided to the health indicator research project team for interpretation and to support the findings in this report. Relevant results are presented in thi s report. 4.2.7. Step 7: Key Findings Analysis from Focus Groups and Interviews The key findings from the focus group and interview transcriptions were analyz ed in January and February 2021. After transcribing the recordings, general themes from the discussion were identified through a reflexive thematic analysis using a deductive approach . Those included: Nutrition/Food; Cultural, Social, Historical, Land and Water Connectedness; Access to Health Services and Traditional Medicines; Chronic Conditions and Mental Health; Trauma; Research and Communication with Metlakatla (i.e., health influence diagram and holistic thinking); Research Methods and Metrics; and Other Relevant Topics. Sections that were relevant to the research objectives were retained and summarized in this paper . More information regarding other findings can be found in the Summary Report of Health Focus Groups (2021) and Summary Report of Health Interviews (2021) . 4.2.8. Step 8: Report Writing Results and recommendations from this research project were summarized in the CEM Health Indicators Final Report and introduced to the CEM Advisory Committee in Fall 2021 . 25 4.2.9. Step 9: Presentation to Metlakatla Governing Council The findings from this research will be presented to the Metlakatla Governing Council for approval in the CEM Program in 2022 . 26 Chapter 5. Research Findings Chapter 5 presents the CEM health research finding s intended to validate priority health values and identify or revise condition and stres sor indicators for each value. The findings are divided into two main sections: Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services. 5.1. Chronic Health Conditions The Chronic Health Conditions findings section offers a brief background on chronic health conditions and then discusses results specific to two types of indicators: condition indicators and stressor indicators. The following information is presented for each section on indicators : stressor/condition i ndicator background, indicator validation/identification, indicator limitations, and census results regarding the indicator . However, Metlakatla Membership Census data is confidential to the Metlakatla First Nation. Therefore , census results have been desc ribed qualitatively in this report. 5.1.1. Background on Chronic Health Conditions Chronic health conditions are health conditions that persist in time or are recurring. Chronic conditions cannot be prevented by vaccines or cured by medication and are major caus es of admissions to hospitals, lifelong disabilities, and pre -mature death in Indigenous communities (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015b) . The distal, intermediate, and proximal social determinants of health influence one's risk of de veloping chronic health conditions. Industrial activities, which affect the intermediate and proximal determinants, are intrinsically tied to the risk of developing chronic conditions (Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) . This risk is affected by the duration and strength of each determinant (e.g., earning low income for many years will have a higher impact on one's health than receiving a medium income for sever al months) (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2 014). As a result of the numerous interactions between health determinants over time , chronic conditions are more likely to develop in later adulthood (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014) . Much research has been conducted on the relative contributions of health determinants on health outcome s. Understanding determinants' contributions can help inform decision -making regarding which health determinants should be targeted during health interventions or management actions. Research suggests that socioeconomic factors (e.g., housing, income, educ ation, food security, etc.) contribute to 25 -50% of health outcomes. Health behaviours (e.g., diet, exercise, etc.) 27 contribute to approximately 30% of health outcomes. Medical care (e.g., accessibility and quality) contributes to 10 -25%, genetics to 15 -20%, and the physical environmental (e.g., clean environment, well -designed cities, etc.) to 5 -10% (Choi & Sonin, 2017; Park et al., 2015; PwC, 2018) . In light of these findings, researchers emphasize the importance of looking at both upstream interventions (i.e., interventions targeting socioeconomic factors, medical access, and the physical environments) and downstream interventions (i.e., behavioural changes) simultaneously to improve an individual's and community's health in the long term and reduce health ineq uities. However, some researchers suggest that downstream interventions , like behavioural health promotion strategies , are inadequate for disadvantaged groups (Baum & Fisher, 2014; Kelly & Barker, 2016) . These groups typically face a wide array of risk factors because their numerous life constraints (e.g., lack of social and economic resources) make it difficult for them to change their behaviours (Baum & Fisher, 2014) . These findin gs informed the choice of indicators for Chronic Health Conditions. Value Validation The first objective of the CEM health indicators research project included validat ing priority health values. Chronic Health Conditions was confirmed by focus group parti cipants and health experts as an important health value to assess and manage in the CEM Program . 5.1.2. Condition Indicators Background on Condition Indicators Chronic health conditions include diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular and respirato ry diseases (including asthma), and arthritis, among others (Government of Canada, 2019) . Chronic conditions are usually diagnosed by general practitioners or health specialis ts. Diabetes is an important indicator of individual health because it has far -reaching consequences beyond diabetes. Complications include heart disease and stroke, hypertension, vision problems, kidney failure, nerve damage (Compass Resource Ma nagement Ltd., 2015b) and cognitive complications (Ryan et al., 2016) . Like diabetes, hypertension has numerous implications, including diabetes, cardiovascular issues, metab olic issues (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015b) , and cancers (Government of Canada, 2015) . Thus, diabetes and hypertension prevalence a re essential to track because they are high -order indicators; managing these conditions may prevent the rise of other serious conditions. Diabetes and hypertension were 28 chosen for the CEM Program because of their estimated high prevalence among Metlakatla members (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015b) . Condition Indicator s Validation Part of the first objective of the CEM health indicators research project was to approve Chronic Health Conditions indicators. Diabetes and hypertension prevalence were validated by focus group participants as important physical health conditions to assess and manage in the community (Table 5). Cancer was suggested by focus group participants and health experts as the next most imp ortant chronic health condition to track over time. Table 5: Chronic Health Conditions - Confirmed condition indicators, unit, description, and rationale INDICATOR / UNIT DESCRIPTION RATIONALE Diabetes (Type 2) Prevalence - Percent age of members with Type 2 diabetes Prevalence is the percentage of the population at a given time that has diabetes. Incidence is the number of new cases of diabetes, typically in a year. COMMUNITY AND EXPERT INPUT Metlakatla members' feedback : Diabetes and hypertension are important health conditions to track for Metlakatla members. Health experts' feedback : Diabetes and hypertension are important to track. Literature findings : Indigenous peoples experience a disproportionate risk of developing diabetes and hypertension than other populations in Canada, making it an important issue to monitor (Harris et al., 2013; Rosella et al., 2020). Hypertension Prevalence - Percentage of members with hypertension As above, except with regards to hypertension. This indicator does not include individuals diagnosed with hypertension during pregnancy. CEM PROGRAM INDICATOR CRITERIA Accura te: Yes, captures the overall status of chronic health conditions and is appropriate to the population scale of the value. Practical : Yes, can be tracked through self - reported data in the MMC. Sensitiv e: No, not sensitive to development or mitigation efforts because diabetes and hypertension prevalence are influenced by numerous social determinants (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014) ; symptoms d evelop slowly (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2015) ; and they are irreversible health conditions. They should be tracked alongside stressor indicators. Relevan t: Yes, type 2 diabetes and hypertension continue to be priorities f or Metlakatla health department; important for tracking the efficacy of health initiatives and the allocation of health resources. 29 Condition Indicators Limitations As mentioned earlier, diabetes and hypertension are irreversible conditions (i.e., they cannot be cured). Thus, assessing diabetes and hypertension prevalence may help track the impact of industrial activities on Metlakatla members and the effectiveness of health interventions in the long term, but it cannot provide information on member s' overall health in the short term. Additionally, diabetes and hypertension prevalence data represents diagnosed diabetes and hypertension; there may be undiagnosed cases o f diabetes and hypertension because of limited healthcare capacity (Compass Resource Management Ltd., 2015b) . Condition Indicators Results In the 2020 MMC, participants were asked, \" Do you have type 2 diabetes?\" with yes or no as possible answers. The sub -question was \"If yes, did you find out from a doctor last year (i.e., in 2019)?\" with yes or no as possible answers. With regard to hypertension, participants were asked, \"Do you have hypertension (also known as high blood pressure)?\" with yes or no as possible answers. Sub -questions included \"If yes, did you find out from a doctor last year (i.e., in 2019)?\" and \"If yes, was the high blood pressure related to pregnancy?\" with yes or no as possible answers. When comparing MMC census result s from 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2020, diabetes and hypertension prevalence among Metlakatla members are slowly increasing over the years. Metlakatla diabetes prevalence is slightly higher than the 2015 diabetes prevalence in Prince Rupert's local health area (BC Provincial Health Services Authority, 2021) . When comparing at a larger scale, Metlakatla 2020 type 2 diabetes preva lence is similar to the 2021 Canadian average of type 2 and type 1 diabetes prevalence combined (Diabetes Canada, 2021) , in which type 2 diabetes represents 90 -95% of the cases (Halseth, 2019) . Metlakatla hypertension prevalence is considerably lower than the 2015 hypertension prevalence in Prince Rupert's local health area (BC Provincial Health Services Authority, 2021) . Metlakatla 2020 hypertension prevalence is slightly lower than the 2016 Canad ian national average (Canada Hypertension, 2016) . 30 5.1.3. Stressor Indic ators Background on Stressor Indicators Stressors indicators for chronic health conditions regularly focus on emotional health and behavioural health. Emotional health indicators can include current life satisfaction, sense of self - esteem, community cohesi on, etc. (Auger, 2016; Bu se et al., 2018) . Behavioural health indicators can include diet, food security, physical exercise, sleep, sexual behaviour, as well as tobacco, alcohol , and drug consumption (Anderson et al., 2006; Buse et al., 2018) . Targeting emotional health in health assessment and interventions is as important as targeting behavioural health (Aalhus et al., 2018) . The indicator list created in September 2020 (Appendix B) includes the potential emotional and behavioural health indicators under con sideration by the focus groups. Information on measuring and collecting qualitative data for emotional and behavioural health indicators is limited. One possible way to obtain such data is through self -reported ratings (e.g., low/medium/high; poor/good/exc ellent, etc.) (Hartley, 2014) . However, t he data collected could be inaccurate depending on participants' trust in the research, as participants may not be willing to disclose personal information (Shandro & Jokinen, 2018) . The accuracy of the data is also contingent on participants' self -awareness; yet assessments of what constitutes poor/good/excellent are often left to the participant's perception (Street & Epstein, 2008) . Perceptions of feelings and emotions are also related to life phases (i.e., feelings vary according to age, employment situation, family situation, etc.) (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . Stressor Indicator Identification: Mental, Emotional, and Spiritual Health Four potential stressor indicators were presented for mental, emotional, and spiritual health during the focus group s with Metlakatla members and staff . Those included Sense of Empowerment (i.e., how much control people feel they have over their life), Social and Cultural Connectedness (i.e., how connected people feel to their community and culture), Life Satisfaction (i.e., how happy people are about their life and life forecast), and Community Cohesion (i.e., how the community values have changed). Participants highlighted that all st ressor indicators were essential and interconnected. Social and Cultural Connectedness is the indicator that most resonated with Metlakatla members and staff. According to focus group participants, culture has the potential to serve as a healing tool and eliminate many health issues. Bringing back culture can restore balance among spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical health for members, as cultural connections influence 31 how people socialize , exercise, eat, and conduct their daily lives. It also bring s a sense of identity, which is fundamental to a healthy life for Metlakatla members. These findings were confirmed by the literature, which emphasized that cultural continuity is a protective factor for health and brings balance to all aspects of health , including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health (Auger, 2016; Oster et al., 2014) . Additionally, social connection s promote health equity through support systems (Peterson et al., 2020) and is a commonly used indicator in Indigenous health assessments (Blanchard & Emery, 2016; Reid et al., 2016; Reilly et al., 2008; Rountree & Smith, 2008) . Participants suggested adding 'His tory,' 'Traditional Lands ,' and 'Traditional Waters' to the Social and Cultural Connectedness indicator . During the group interview, health experts agreed that the indicator Social and Cultural Connectedness would provide essential information about Metlakatla members' health. The stressor indicator selected for mental, emotional, and spiritual health is Social and Cultural Connectedness, which considers members' connectedness to Metlakatla culture, community, history, and traditional lands and waters (Table 6). Table 6: Chronic Health Conditions - Confirmed stressor indicator, unit, description, and rationale INDICATOR / UNITS DESCRIPTION RATIONALE Social and Cultural Connectedness - Percentage of members who are modera tely or very connected to Metlakatla Culture (including language and cultural traditions, practices, and activities) Community (all Metlakatla members *) A high rate for this indicator can be interpreted as members having their mental, emotional, and spiritual health needs met, whereas a low rate is presumed to reflect issues in building cultural, social, historical, and territorial connections, with advers e effects on mental, emotional, and spiritual health and overall well -being. COMMUNITY AND EXPERT INPUT Metlakatla members' feedback : This indicator is critical for members' mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Being strongly connected to their culture gives members a sense of identity, belonging, empowerment, and self - esteem. Bringing back culture can restore balance among spiritual, emotional, mental, and physi cal health for members, as cultural connections influence how people socialize , exercise, eat, and conduct their daily lives. Health experts' feedback : This indicator would provide essential information about Metlakatla members' health. 32 INDICATOR / UNITS DESCRIPTION RATIONALE History (including Tsimshian and Metlakatla identity, history, and knowledge) Traditional Lands and Waters Literature findings : Cultural continuity is a protective factor for health (Auger, 2016; Oster et al., 2014). Community connection promote s health equity through support systems (Peterson et al., 2020) and is a commonly used indicator in Indigenous health assessments (Blanchard & Emery, 2016; Reid et al., 2016; Reilly et al., 2008; Rountree & Smith, 2008) . CEM PROGRAM INDICATOR CRITERIA Accura te: No, does not capture the overall status of chronic health conditions and should be tracked alongside condition indicators. Practical : Yes, can be tracked through self-reported data in the MMC. Sensitiv e: Yes . Development and other activities bring changes to the biophysical, socio -economic, and cultural environments of Indigenous communities (Hackett et al., 2018; Schrecker et al., 2018; Westwood & Orenstein, 2016) , which can affect members' sense of social and cultural connectedness. Actions can be identified and implemented to improve members' sense of connectedness; the indicator is sensitive to m itigation efforts as it is based on members' regular reporting through the MMC. Relevan t: Yes, it is an essential indicator for members; it was identified as a priority for the Metlakatla First Nation . *Including members living in Alaska, and elsewhere in Canada and the United States 33 Stressor Indicator Limitations The indicator Social and Cultural Connectedness is complex and nuanced. The qualitative data collected may not accurately represent individual health in some cases, as interpretations of the words 'connected,' 'culture,' and 'community' and understandings of the relationship between each element might v ary among Metlakatla members. Focus group participants warned the research team that, although \"How connected do you feel to Metlakatla culture, community, history and traditional lands and waters?\" is an essential question to ask, it would be a difficult one for members to answer. Inquiring about 'What is missing? ' might reopen wounds among Metlakatla members. They will need to feel safe in the process. Researchers will need to gain people's trust to obtain honest answers. In addition, renewing and strengt hening cultural continuity is a lengthy process whose effect on overall health and chronic conditions will only be perceived in the long term. As suggested by a participant, members should be informed that healing \"will be a long haul.\" Hence, there may be a considerable time lag between assessing the indicator , building management actions , and seeing the results of management actions. Finally, all four elements (culture, community, history, and traditional lands and waters) are for now equally weighted, ba sed on feedback from the focus groups. However, weights attributed to each element may vary over time. The CEM Program has yet to decide if the four units should be kept separate or weighted and summed into one number. Stressor Indicator Results In the 202 0 MMC, four questions were asked regarding Social and Cultural Connectedness , they were : \"Do you feel connected to your [element] ?\" Each question focused on one element of cultural and social connectedness, including: Culture (including language and cultural traditions, practices, and activities) Community (all Metlakatla members) History (including Tsimshian and Metlakatla identity, history, and knowledge) Traditional Lands and Waters Participants could rate their answer on a scale of 0 to 4, where: 0 = Not relevant to my well -being 1 = Not at all connected 2 = Somewhat connected 34 3 = Moderately connected 4 = Very connected Most respondents felt somewhat connected to Metlakatla culture , Metlakatla community , Metlakatla history , and lands and waters . The Cultural and Social Connectedness element that Metlakatla members felt most connected to was Traditional Lands and Waters. The 2020 MMC results show that most members feel somewhat connected to all aspects of Metlakatla culture, where as few members feel moderately and very connected to aspects of Metlakatla culture. Additionally, youth and adult respondents appear to feel less connected to aspects of Metlakatla culture than Elder respondents. Stressor Indicator Identification: Behavio ural Health During focus groups with Metlakatla members and staff, three potential stressor indicators for behavioural health were presented : nutrition/food, physical activity, and substance use. Participants said that all were connected to their health. Although a lack of physical activity and alcoholism were identified as significant issues within the community, participants agreed that foods, especially traditional foods, were the most important aspect of behavioural health. The literature confirm ed the clear connection between food and Indigenous well-being (First Nations Health Authority et al., 2013) . One participant summarized that \"nutrition is huge on our health , and traditional foods, and healthy, organic foods affect our health a lot.\" In 2015, members had already mentioned that the biggest concern for their children was \"eating healthy and proper nutrition\" (CEM Program, 2015, p. 13) . Participants pointed out the difficulty of accessing traditional and other healthy foods due to a lack of financial means, transportation, and awareness about healthy eating, which are barriers listed here by importance. During interviews, health experts mentioned several factors related to food and diet that could be considered in the CEM Program, including food, nutrition, eating competence, attitudes about food and eating, food acceptance skills, internal regulation skills (e.g., recognizing appetite and hunger), contextual food skills (e.g., ensuring there is food i n storage space), food security, and food systems. Given that many other social determinants influence the development of chronic conditions , like diabetes, experts recommended that the focus be on food affordability rather than food intake because it is a higher -level indicator (i.e., looking at upstream causes of the problem). Diabetes cannot be linked to a single food ; looking at the barriers, supporters, or solutions to obtaining food seems more relevant. Furthermore, evaluating the number of healthy me als per week 35 (our primary metric suggestion) is difficult \u2014because healthy eating is a pattern, it is not defined by one meal \u2014and requires a definition of healthy; yet what healthy foods mean may differ for each individual, culture, and Nation. Experts sugg ested inquir ing about food security , which includes food affordability. A common question used by the Northern Health Authority is: 'Do you worry about running out of food before you have enough money to buy more? ' Stressor Indicator Limitations and Sugges tions for Future Assessment Food/ nutrition/ diet is a complex indicator, and there are countless metrics to assess it. Food intake is one avenue to collect data on food. However, food intake measures are challenging to conduct due to time and resources cons traints and potential recall inaccuracies. Food recalls may be under - or over -estimated, and even when correctly estimated, recalls may present an inaccurate picture of the nutritional value of the foods eaten (B.C. Centre for Disease Control, 2019; P\u00e9rez - Escamilla & Segall -Corr\u00eaa, 2008) . In addition, there seems to be little consensus on the most appropriate food intake metrics for an Indigenous community. For instance, re search points out that diabetes -inducing foods in western diets include processed foods, very sweet and salty foods, and red meat (Schulze et al., 2003; Srour et al., 2020; Vang et al., 2008) . Other work s show t hat in Indigenous diets, high -carbohydrates might be the leading risk factor for diabetes (Feinman et al., 2015; Mark et al., 2016) . Many researchers suggest investigating the overall diet rather than specific food items (Liese et al., 2009) . Anothe r way to collect data on food is through food security indicators. There are numerous food security indicators, which consider food availability (i.e., production and distribution), food access (i.e., affordability, allocation, and cultural acceptability), food utilization (i.e., nutritional value, dietary diversity, food safety, food preparation and consumption), and the stability of all three variables (Aborisade & Bach, 2014; FAO, 2008) . However, food security indicators do not always account for the frequency and duration of the insecurity experienced and do not systematically consider the use of traditional foods in Indigenous contexts (B.C. Centre for Disease Control, 2019) . A high number of measurements for nutrition/ food/diet are available , and the choice of the most accurate, practical, sensitive , and relevant indicator for the CEM Program is a complicated decision. To guide the selection of a food security indicator, Figure 6 provides a conceptual representation of food security dimensions over time as wel l as food security barriers and promoters. However, this framework simplifies complex relationships. Notably, the importance of each food security dimension may vary in time for each community (e.g., 'cultural acceptability ' 36 might be more important than th e 'safe to consume' factor in an Indigenous context ). The CEM Program will need to investigate these elements before selecting metrics that meet Metlakatla's needs and the CEM Program's purposes. Three key questions to consider are: What component(s) of fo od security do we intend to measure (e.g., food availability, food access, food utilization, or food stability)? At what point in the causal pathway (see Figure 6) does the measurement fall? At what scale do we need to measure food security (community, hou sehold (HH) , individual)? These recommended questions were extracted from the work of Jones et al. (2013) . Figure 6: Conceptual framework of food security dimensions and food security barriers and promoters (Jones et al. , 2013) . Another option to collect data on food would be to look at the barriers to food access rather than a single indicator, in the same way that the CEM Program collect s data on barriers to health services. Last, food sovereignty indicators have not been explored during this project but could provide a lens through which food can be assessed. Food sovereignty embodies \"the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and thei r right to define their own food and agriculture systems\" (Forum for Food Sovereignty, 2007) . Examples of i ndicators include one's Ability to hunt (Noreen et al., 2018) and one's Capacity to cultivate edible plants at home (Garc\u00eda -Sempere et al., 2019) , etc. Stressor Indicator Results The census question initially suggested to focus group participants regarding food was \"How many healthy meals do you eat per week?\" which was adapted from the 2015 census question: \"On average, how often do you eat healthy foods?\" Participants noted that not all members know what healthy is. It was also suggested that the number of strictly traditional meals be asked in a separate survey question. Some questions raised during the third focus group in clude: Are we really going to get to the baseline of what people are eating with such a question? 37 Would it be relevant to ask about specific foods eaten (i.e., determining food intake patterns)? How truthful will answers be? The accuracy of responses is hi ghly dependent on the participant's knowledge of healthy eating. How could we include an education piece? We were not able to reach a consensus on a census question for food during focus groups. Recommendations for a Food Indicator A clear link exists bet ween food and well -being. Assessing and mitigating development impacts on food security and food -related factors may reduce the development of chronic health conditions like diabetes. There are many ways to look at food and evaluate and improve members' food resources. However, this topic has not sufficiently been explored to determine which avenues the CEM Program should take and which food indicator is best for Metlakatla. Future work on Metlakatla's health values to explore food -related issues and interventions is recommended . 5.2. Access to Health Services The findings section on Access to Health Services starts with a brief background on the Access to Health Services value , completed by a recapitulation of the value validation and co ndition indicator rejection process es, a summary on barriers identification , and census results on barriers . Then, th e Access to Health Services section discusses results specific to the selected condition indicator , Continuity of Care , and is organized as follows: indicator background, indicator identification, indicator limitations, and census results on the indicator . 5.2.1. Background on Access to Health Services Access to health services can be defined as the timely, high -quality, and appropriate delivery of health care (Cameron et al., 2014; Institute of Medicine, 1993) . Access to health services results from complex and interconnected relationships dependent on economic, physical, and social resources. Indigenous peoples in Canada face more barriers to health care than their non -Indigenous counterparts (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009; Peiris et al., 2008; Wardman et al., 2005) . The barriers to access health services are often structural. There can be a limited number of doctors, specialists, and nu rses, which leads to a considerable lag between ambulatory care appointments (i.e., care administered without the need for an overnight stay in a medical facility) . 38 Patients may receive fragmented and disconnected care (lack of continuity of care), which leads to inconsistencies in the advice and services provided. Health services' geographical location may limit patient access as there is little to no transportatio n to reach them, preventing a timely use of health services (Matthew s, 2017; Wardman et al., 2005) . People may have limited coverage, and health services' financial cost is a common impediment to accessing health (Wardman et al., 2005) . Barriers also include the difficulty in understanding the health care system's mechanisms and identifying all the services available (Peiris et al., 2008; Wardman et al., 2005) . One of the most significant barriers to health services faced by Indigenous peoples in Canada is the lack of cultural safety. Culturally safe care takes into consideration Indigenous peoples ' history and culture s and re mains free of racism. A lack of cultural safety can be linked to poor communication, either due to language barriers or differing frames of reference that impede sharing and understanding of health information (Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009; Peiris et al., 2008) . In addition, epistemic racism, the rejection of knowledge from a specific culture, contributes to the invisibility of Indigenous methods of h ealing in the health system by preventing traditional healers from practising their profession and dictating allocation of health resources (e.g., resources are directed to technology upgrades rather than sweat lodges) (Matthews, 2017) . The absence of culturally safe care may lead people to avoid health services (Cameron et al., 2014; Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009; Peiris et al., 2008) . As a result of the se numerous impediments, the perceived benefits of seeking and receiving health care might be lower than the perceived barriers to using the services (Champion & Skinner, 2008) . Consequently, individuals may avoid seeking care or may not receive the sought care on time. Thus, general access to health care services for Indigenous peoples is often limited, and the multiple facets of the issue make it difficult to assess and monitor accurately. Value Validation As previously mentioned, t he first objective of the CEM health indicators research project was to validate priority health values. Focus group participants and health experts confirmed Access to Health Service s as an important health value to assess and manage in the CEM Program. Condition Indicator Rejection Objective three of the research focused on revising the Access to Health Services condition indicator (ACSC) and revising barriers to health care access . The research team decided not to move forward with the ACSC condition indicator because the data can only be obtained through 39 health administrative data , and the indicator may not accurately represent Metlakatla members' access to health . Consequently, the research focused on understand ing barriers to access to health care for Metlakatla members , in order to identify a new condition indicator . Barriers Identification Barriers are elements that the CEM Program tr acks but does not build management actions on. Barriers may become stressor or condition indicators in the future, which means that the CEM Program would then commit to building management actions that mitigate the impact of industrial development on the v alue assessed by the indicator . Barriers were identified through the literature review (see section 5.2.1 Background on Access to Health Services ) as well as focus groups with Metlakatla staff and members , and interviews with health experts. Focus group pa rticipants mentioned that very few services are available in Metlakatla Village and several important services are unavailable in Prince Rupert. There has been a consolidation of provincial services in regional centers; thus, many essential health services are moving away from Prince Rupert. Access to traditional medicines and healing (e.g., plants, safe cultural spaces, Elders, community gatherings, knowledge, etc.) is nonexistent or very limited. Both community members and health providers often overlook the importance of traditional medicine . Access to alternative medicine like massage therapists and chiropractors is difficult in Prince Rupert. There is a lack of information regarding health services; people do not know what services they may need, and which ones are available. Racialized discrimination (lack of cultural safety) highly discourages Metlakatla members from using the Prince Rupert Emergency Services. Transportation issues (lack of ferries) were mentioned several times during focus groups as t he main barrier to health services, particularly for members living in Metlakatla Village. During the group interview, health experts emphasized the importance of collecting data around the patient experience in health services. For example, e xperts suggested including an indicator or question concerning cultural safety. Health experts also recommended inquiring about emergency care in addition to routine and ongoing care. Barriers Results In the 2020 MMC, participants were asked , \"In the past 12 months, did you ever experience any difficulties getting routine or ongoing care?\" followed by \"If yes, what type of difficulties did you experience?\". Participants could identify barriers from the following list . Options added to the 40 2020 MMC (based on insights from focus groups and health experts and the literature review) are bolded: Do not have a personal/family doctor Wait times are too long Service or appointments unavailable Transportation problems Cost Racialized discrimination when using health services Unaware of available services and where to find them Unable to leave the house because of a health problem No access to traditional medicine (including herbal remedies, spiritual therapies, assistance from Elders or healers, or other practices sp ecific to Metlakatla) Other (please specify): _____________________ The census question regarding barriers mainly assesses barriers to primary care. However, access to traditional medicine should not be regarded as primary care but as complementary care. If the CEM Program decides to focus on access to primary care, the 'a ccess to traditional medicine' option should be removed from the census questions on barriers. Nonetheless, traditional medicine may be an essential component of health for Metlakatla members and could be investigated as a separate indicator or value. Nearly a fifth of 2020 MMC respondents reported experiencing difficulties receiving routine or ongoing care in the past 12 months. This result is a slight increase from 2016 . Approximately 10% of respondents in 2020 reported 'not applicable .' The top 3 barriers for receiving routine or ongoing care as reported by 2020 MMC respondents were: 1. Wait times are too long 2. Service or appointments unavailable 3. Transportation problems The top 3 barriers mentioned in 2020 were the same as in 2015 and 2016 . 41 5.2.2. Condition Indicator Background on Continuity of Care Continuity of care ensures that patients receive appropriate and ongoing care that allows for the prevention and early treatment of health issues. Some essential attributes of continuity of care inclu de receiving ongoing and lasting care, developing a relationship between an individual patient and a care team, implementing a swift and complete information transfer and care team coordination, and meeting patients' changing needs (Hu et al., 2020) . The literature suggests that improving continuity of care ameliorates health outcomes and patient satisfaction (Cheng et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2020; Van Walraven et al., 2010) , notably among patients with chronic health conditions (Health Quality Ontario, 2013) . The presence of a primary care provider or family doctor (i .e., patients having a main general practitioner to refer to) as an indicator of health care access is commonly used in health assessments (Anderson et al., 2006; Buse et al., 2018; First Natio ns Centre, 2007; Loppie Reading & Wein, 2009) . Condition Indicator Identification The identification of a condition indicator for Access to Health Services was based on findings from the literature and interviews with health experts . This indicator was not explored in depth with Metlakatla members and staff during focus groups. Health experts recommended investigating continuity of primary care as health care patients can experience fragmented or inconsistent care. A question could be 'Do y ou have a primary care provider?' (technical language) or 'Are you seeing only one doctor?' (common language). Experts suggested inquiring about the role or position of members' primary care provider s. The person overseeing patients' primary care is usuall y the most responsible clinician, like a doctor or a nurse practitioner, or someone of that rank within the health care system. It is sometimes considered to be anybody in a patient's health circle, such as a social worker or pharmacist, so it may be worth exploring who typically fills the primary care provider role for Metlakatla members. Continuity of Care as measured by the presence of a primary care provider was selected as a potential condition indicator for the Access to Health Services value because having a primary care provider prevents patients from suffering from a fragmented or inconsistent service (Table 7). 42 Table 7: Access to Health Services - Confirmed condition indicator, unit, description, and rationale INDICATOR / UNIT DESCRIPTION RATIONALE Continuity of Care - Percentage of members who have a primary care provider A high rate for this indicator can be interpreted as members receiving consistent care, hence having their primary health care needs adequat ely addressed. A low rate is presumed to reflect problems in obtaining access to primary health care. COMMUNITY AND EXPERT INPUT Metlakatla members' feedback: This indicator was not discussed in detail during focus groups with staff and members. We recommend reviewing this indicator with leadership as part of the value and indicator selection process. Health experts' feedback : Having a primary care provider pre vents patients from suffering from a fragmented or inconsistent service. It is presumed to improve health outcomes and patient satisfaction. The person overseeing patients' primary care should be a doctor, nurse practitioner, or nurse Literature findings : Continuity of care is an essential component of quality of care (Alazri et al., 2007; Pollack et al., 2016). Improving continuity of care ameliorates health outcomes and patient satisfaction (Cheng et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2020; Van Walraven et al., 2010), notably among patients with chronic health conditions (Health Quality Ontario, 2013). CEM PROGRAM INDICATOR CRITERIA Accura te: Yes, captures the overall status of members' access to health services and is appropriate to the population scale of the value. Practical : Yes, can be tracked through self - reported data in the MMC. Sensitiv e: No, not sensitive to development or mitigation efforts as the availability of primary care providers depends on health care programming. However, the obtainability and use of care providers (see Appendix A for interpretation ) may change due to development or mitigation efforts. Relevan t: To be confirmed with Metlakatla members and decision -makers. 43 Condition Indicator Limitations Continuity of care is an essential component of quality of care (Alazri et al., 2007; Pollack et al., 2016) but presents challenges that may not be represented in the presence of a primary care provider metric. For instance, continuity of care is influenced by demographic factors (e.g., geographical location, mobility, etc.), factors related to patients and healthcare professionals (i.e., patient preferences), patient -healthcare professional relationship (i.e., trust), inter -professional factors (i.e., communication and coordination within the health organization), and other organizational factors (Alazri et al., 2007) . Thus, having a primary care provider does not ensure flawless dis ease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment (Alazri et al., 2007; Pollack et al., 2016) . Additionally, socioeconomic disparities endure even with equal continuity of care (Begley et al., 2011; Menec et al., 2005; Newacheck et al., 2003) , which points to the importance of targeting populations and individuals with lower socioeconomic statuses for preventive care (Menec et al., 2005) . Condition Indicator Results The question regarding members' continuity of care that was included in the census was: 1. Do you have a primary care provider, someone on your health team that is responsible for ensuring that you receive continuous care? Continuous care is concerned with the q uality of care over time provided by health care professionals. It means that you are receiving the care that you need by accounting for patient satisfaction, interpersonal aspects of care and coordination of care. a. If yes, what is the role of that person o n your health team? Family doctor Nurse or nurse practitioner Social worker Pharmacist Traditional healer Community health worker Other (please specify): _____________________ 44 Less than half of 2020 MMC respondents reported having a primary care provider, approximately one third reported not having a primary care provider, and approximately one third reported 'not applicable.' Further investigation may be needed to understand why respondents reported 'not applicable.' In a follow -up question, the census qu estionnaire asked about the role of the primary care provider on their health team. In our current understanding of the role of a primary care provider, that person should be a doctor, nurse practitioner, or nurse. Census results confirm that 92% of these providers are doctors, nurse practitioners, or nurses among participants who have a primary care provider . Therefore, primary care providers' status may not need to be explored in the next iterations of the census. 5.3. Research Findings Summary The findings achieved the three research goals. Regarding the first objective, both priority values (Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services) were validated , and condition indicators for Chronic Health Conditions were approved (diabetes and hypertension prevalence) . With respect to the second objective, two new stressor indicators were identified (Social and Cultural Connectedness and a food -related indicator) . Regarding the third objective, the Access to Health Services condition indicator was invalidat ed (ACSC) , a new condition indicator was identified (continuity of care ), and barriers were refined. 45 Chapter 6. Recommendation s The report presents s even recommendations for the Health Pillar of the CEM Program. They are based on the literature review, the analysis of findings from focus groups with Metlakatla staff and members and interviews with health experts, and the analysis of the results from the 2020 MMC. The findings and recommendations are provided for Metlak atla decision -makers to address health issues in the Metlakatla community . They will be presented to Chief and Council in 2022 and approval will be requested to move forward with data collection and setting of management triggers for these values and indic ators. Additionally, many of the recommendations presented in the Access to Health Services Indicator Guide Sheet (2015a) and the Diabetes and Hypertension Prevalence Indicator Guide Sheet (2015b) under Potential Management Strategies (p.9 and p.10, respectively) , prepared by Compass Resource Management Ltd . for the CEM Program in 2015 , are still valid today. 6.1. Recommendations for the CEM Program 6.1.1. Diabetes and hypertension prevalence should be kept as condition indicators for the Chronic Health Condition value of the CEM Progra m Diabetes and hypertension are still considered important chronic conditions for the Metlakatla community. T herefore, t he Metlakatla CEM Program should keep diabetes and hypertension prevalence as condition indicators for the Chronic Health Condition valu e and continue to track these indicators among Metlakatla members through the MMC every five years. These condition indicators should be tracked alongside key stressor indicators that may respond more quickly to changes in Metlakatla Territory and mitigati on efforts. 6.1.2. Social and Cultural Connectedness should be added as a stressor indicator for the Chronic Health Conditions value of the CEM Program Social and Cultural Connectedness, which considers members' connectedness to Metlakatla Culture (including lang uage and cultural traditions, practices, and activities), Community (all Metlakatla members), History (including Tsimshian and Metlakatla identity, history, and knowledge), and Traditional Lands and Waters was chosen by Metlakatla focus group 46 participants as an important stressor indicator for the Chronic Health Conditions value. Social, cultural, and land connectedness are also highly recognized in the literature as essenti al health indicators for Indigenou s Nations (Blanchard & Emery, 2016; Buse et al., 2018; Reid et al., 2016; Reilly et al., 2008; Rountree & Smith, 2008). It is recommend ed that Social and Cultural Connectedness be used as a stressor indicator for the Chronic Health Conditions Value of the CEM Program and be assessed through the MMC every two years. The Social and Cultural Connectedness has four units of measurements (Culture, Community, History, Traditional Lands and Waters ), which are equally weighted. Further investigation may be needed t o verify if these elements should remain equally weighted and if they should be summed or kept separate. 6.1.3. A food -related indicator should be added as a stressor indicator for the Chronic Health Conditions value of the CEM Program A clear link exists betwee n food and well -being (First Nations Health Authority et al., 2013). Foods, healthy foods, and traditional foods were selected by Metlakatla focus group participants as one of the most critical aspects of their health. Assessing and mitigating impacts on foods may reduce the development of chronic health conditions such as diabetes. No specific food - related metric has yet been determined for the CEM Program. There are many ways to look at food and assess and improve member s' food resources. However, the res earch team has not sufficiently explored this topic to determine which avenues the CEM Program should take and which food - related indicator is best for Metlakatla. Future work is recommended on health values to explore food-related issues and interventions and further investigate food indicators and metrics. 6.1.4. Remove Ambulatory Care Sensitive Condition as a condition indicator for Access to Health Services, but continue to track the barriers to health services as part of the Access to Health Services value Access to health services is the timely, high -quality, and appropriate delivery of health care (Cameron et al., 2014; Institute of Medicine, 1993). Using ACSC as an indicator is inappropriate for the CEM Program as data to measure this indicator is difficult to obtain and may not accurately represent Metlakatla members' access to health. However, tracking the barriers to health services helps identify the cause of the difficulties met when seeking health care. Census results suggest that access to routine and ongoing health care was difficult for nearly a fifth of 2020 MMC respondents . The top three barriers were long wait times, service appointments unavailable, and transportations 47 problems. The CEM Program should continue to track the difficulty of accessing health services and related barriers through the MMC every two years. 6.1.5. Continuity of Care should be added as a condition indicator for the Access to Health Services value The CEM Program could consider using Continuity of Care \u2014measured through the presence of a primary care provider , who can be a doctor, nurse practitioner, or nurse \u2014as a condition indicator for the Access to Health Services value. This indicator could be assessed every five years. If individuals have a primary care provider, they have someo ne on their health team responsible for ensuring that they receive continuous care. Thus, the presence of a primary care provider is an indicator of continuous care and ensures high -quality service. 2020 MMC results suggest that less than half of Metlakatla respondents have a primary care provider. The primary care provider is a family doctor for over 90% of these respondents. 6.1.6. Consider investigating the importance of traditional medicine and members ' access to traditional medicine Traditional medicine (including herbal remedies, spiritual therapies, assistance from Elders or healers, or other practices specific to Metlakatla) is complementary to primary care. If the CEM Program decides to focus solely on access to primary care , the 'access to t raditional medicine' option should be removed from the census question on barriers to health services. Nonetheless, access to traditional medicine is an important component of health for Metlakatla members and could be investigated as a separate indicator or value. As a focus group participant mentioned, \"Our traditional medicines have a huge impact on our physical, mental, and emotional condition. It's often overlooked [...]. I tried to find someone to help with more traditional medicines , and that was impos sible to find.\" 6.1.7. Intergenerational trauma should be incorporated into the CEM Program Colonization and its legacy have weakened Indigenous peoples' ties to their culture, community, history, environment, values, and identities (Methot, 2019). Intergeneratio nal colonial trauma affects all aspects of health, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health (Methot, 2019). When assessing and managing chronic conditions, health behaviours, and other health agents, we are treating the symptoms of a Nat ion's illness. When assessing and managing 48 healing from historical trauma, we are treating the root of the issue (Methot, 2019). The influence of intergenerational trauma on Metlakatla members' health and the community's health was mentioned by Metlakatla members and staff in several instances during focus groups. Participants indicated that trauma is the biggest issue affecting the community, impacting every individual. Metlakatla members and staff also discussed the lack of healing support and capacity. Intergenerational trauma and its impacts should be incorporated into the CEM Program. As an overarching issue, intergenerational trauma could be considered and addressed through each pillar of the Program, or it could be an area for specific management act ions under the Health Pillar. Focus group participants suggested some actions for community healing: building a longhouse, which would serve as a safe cultural space for all Metlakatla members (a space where people can gather with their family, bond with t heir ancestors, connect to their spirituality, and practice their culture ); increasing access to traditional healers; creating space for cultural activities such as dancing or regalia making; and creating some form of programming around trauma (e.g., couns elling, workshops, support groups, etc.) to raise the issue and begin the recovery process as a community. It was important to participants that such counselling be open to all in the community, potentially with different approaches for different age group s. Particular attention should be given to young people (under 24 years old). Members mentioned that therapists, counsellors, or Elders could lead this programming. 6.2. Indicators Recommendations Summary Table s Tables 8 and 9 summarize findings on indicators c onsidered for the Chronic Health Conditions and Access to Health Services values of the health pillar for the CEM Program. The tables include information about the indicator type, unit, description, rationale, limitations, and recommended action. indicator s that should be continued or added are colo ur-coded in blue, indicators that have been considered or need further investigation are colo ur-coded in yellow, and indicators that should be discontinued are colo ur-coded in red. The final health values and indicators recommended for the Metlakatla CEM Program are: Chronic Health Conditions o Diabetes (Type 2) Prevalence o Hypertension Prevalence o Social and Cultural Connectedness 49 o Food -related indicator ( metric to be determined through future work) Access to Health Services o Continuity of Care 50 Table 8: Chronic Health Conditions - Condition and stressor indicators, unit, description, rationale, limitations, and action INDIC ATOR / UNIT DESCRIPTION RATIONALE LIMITATIONS ACTION CONDITION INDICATORS Diabetes (Type 2) Prevalence - Percentage of members with Type 2 diabetes Prevalence is the percentage of the population at a given time that has diabetes. COMMUNITY AND EXPERT INPUT 1. Metlakatla members' feedback : Diabetes is an important health condition to track for Metlakatla members. 2. Health experts' feedback : Diabetes is important to track. 3. Literature findings : Indigenous peoples experience a disproportionate risk of developing diabetes than other populations in Canada (Harris et al., 2013; Rosella et al., 2020), making it an important issue to monitor.

Continue STRESSOR INDICATORS Food - More research needed To be determined Healthy foods, especially traditional foods, have been identified as a key element of members' mental, emotional, and spiritual health. There are multiple metrics possible to look at food. Food indicator(s) for Metlakatla could belong to any of the four fo od security dimensions: food availability (i.e., production and distribution), food access (i.e., affordability, allocation, and cultural acceptability), food utilization (i.e., nutritional value, dietary diversity, food safety, food preparation and consum ption), and food stability (stability of all three variables). See report recommendations on food indicator selection. Each metrics presents its own limitations. Further investigation is needed to determine the best food indicator for Chronic Health Conditions. Add - more research needed 51 INDIC ATOR / UNIT DESCRIPTION RATIONALE LIMITATIONS ACTION *Physical Activity - See the Indicators List for possible metrics (Appendix B) Not applicable Physical activity (e.g., walking, dancing, harvesting, etc.) is one of the health behaviours that may help prevent chronic health conditions. More research needed Considered *Substance Use - See the Indicators List for possible metrics (Appendix B) Not applicable Limiting substance use is one of the health behaviours that may help prevent chronic health conditions. More research needed Considered Social and Cultural Connectedness - Percentage of members who are moderately or very connected to Metlakatla 1. Culture (including language and cultural traditions, practices, and activities) 2. Community (all Metlakatla members) 3. History (including Tsimshian and Metlakatla identity, history, and knowledge) 4. Traditional Lands and Waters A high rate for this indicator can be interpreted as members having their mental, emotional, and spiritual health needs met, whereas a low rate is presumed to reflect issues in building cultural, social, historical, and territorial connections, with adverse effects on mental, emotional, and spiritual health and overall well -being. COMMUNITY AND EXPERT INPUT 1. Metlakatla members' feedback : Social and Cultural Connectedness is a key element of members' mental, emotional, and spiritual health. Being strongly connected to their culture gives members a sense of identity, belonging, empowerment, and self -esteem. Bringing back culture can restore balance among spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical health for members, as cultural connections influence how people eat, exercise, and conduct their daily lives. 2. Health experts' feedback : Social and Cultural Connectedness would provide essential information about Metlakatla members' health. 3. Literature findings : Cultural continuity is a protective factor for health (Auger, 2016; Oster et al., 2014). Community connections promote health equity through support systems (Peterson et al., 2020) and is a commonly used indicator in Indigenous health assessments (Blanchard & Emery, 2016; Reid et al., 2016; Reilly et al., 2008; Rountree & Smith, 2008) .

ACSC measures the degree to which chronic and reoccurring medical conditions are treated through traditional and/or primary care, thereby preventing the need for treatment within a hospital. Chronic and reoccurring medic al conditions include grand mal status and other epileptic convulsions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart failure and pulmonary edema, angina, hypertension, and diabetes. ACSC data in the Northwest HSDA may not be representative of the ACSC values. ACSC presents clerical limitations. Data collection is difficult and reliant on administrative health data. Discontinue 53 INDICATOR / UNIT DESCRIPTION RATIONALE LIMITATIONS ACTION Continuity of Care - Percentage of members who have a primary care provider A high rate for this indicator can be interpreted as members receiving consistent care, hence having their primary health care needs adequately addressed. A low rate is presumed to reflect problems in obtaining access to primary health care. COMMUNITY AND EXPERT INPUT 1. Metlakat la members' feedback : This indicator was not discussed in detail during focus groups with staff and members. We recommend reviewing this indicator with leadership as part of the value and indicator selection process. 2. Health experts' feedback : Having a prim ary care provider prevents patients from suffering from a fragmented or inconsistent service. It is presumed to improve health outcomes and patient satisfaction. The person overseeing patients' primary care should be a doctor, nurse practitioner, or nurse. 3. Literature findings : Continuity of care is an essential component of quality of care (Alazri et al., 2007; Pollack et al., 2016). Improving continuity of care ameliorates health outcomes and patient satisfaction (Cheng et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2020; Van Walraven et al., 2010), notably among patients with chronic health conditions (Health Quality Ontario, 2013). CEM PROGRAM INDICATOR CRITERIA 1. Accurate: Yes 2. Practical: Yes 3. Sensitive: No 4. Relevant: To be confirmed Continuity of care is influenced by a myriad of factors, and, as such, having a primary care provider does not ensure flawless disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Add 54 Chapter 7. Discussion , Limitations, and Conclusion Chapter 7 provides a discussion of the study, including thoughts on Indigenous versus non - Indigenous visions of health, lessons from the research process, and implication s of the research. I also discuss the limitations of the study , contextualiz e the work, and offe r a conclusion on the research conducted. 7.1. Discussion 7.1.1. Indigenous Versus Non-Indigenous Visions of Health There are important difference s between Indigenous and Western visions of health. Many Indigenous peoples in Canada view health in a holistic way , where h ealth is related to everything, and wellbeing stands at the intersection of the emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual aspects of one's life (Buse et al., 2018 ; First Nations Health Authority, 2021; Kryzanowski & McIntyre, 2011; Methot, 2019) . In many First Nations' views, everything is one , meaning that everything is connected (Atleo, 2005; Methot, 2019) . On the contrary, non -Indigenous peoples view individuals' aspects of life and health as disconnected (Methot, 2019) . This perspective can lead non -Indigenous people to treat the symptoms of an illness rather than the root of the imbalance. I believe that Western people could learn from Indigenous peoples' holistic vision of life and health. It would allow us, non -Indigenous peoples, to understand that every action we take in any area of life (e.g., politic s, economic s, environmental, social, cultural) will, in the end, affect us. Any action we take will impact our wellbeing and that of others around us. Furthermore, I consider that accepting and acknowl edging the possible truths in various human perspectives, cultural values, and sources of knowledge would make our societies healthier . Western health science is quite advanced, but so is Indigenous health knowledge \u2014a wisdom that has yet to be recognized. As phrased by Atleo (2005), \"These visitors have made their gifts of science and technology evident and recognizable to all, while our gifts of relationality and isaak (respect for all life forms ) have only now begun to emerge. Hopefully, in an increasingly fragmented world, these gifts can help us all to tloo-qua-nah\" (p. 134 ). A simple interpretation of tloo-qua-nah is \"to remember reality \" (Atleo, 2005, p. 40) . This statement leads me to conclude that, by understanding and remembering that everything is connected, non -Indigenous peoples and Indigenous peoples together could create much healthier societies. 55 7.1.2. Suggested Changes to the Research Methodology If I were to conduct this research again, woul d I change the approach used? The simple answer is no. The process of, one, understanding the context via the literature; second, gathering First Nation members' thoughts, ideas, and insights for indicator selection; third, validating our theories through discussions with experts; and last, confirming our findings using many members' inputs via the census is one of the most collaborative approaches that could have been chosen for this research. The selected methodology meets the criteria outlined by Milne a nd Oberle (2005) on rigour in qualitative descriptive studies, encompassing authenticity (attention to the voices of participants and accurate portrayal of their thoughts), credibility (focus on capturing the emic perspective of participants), criticality (reflection on the decisions made during the research process), and integrity (reflection on the researchers' biases and probity). Although there might be ways to further reconcile the study process and findings with Indigenous practices, the CEM research team has made every effort possible \u2014with the available resources \u2014to gather Metlakatla members' knowledge and insights on their community's health in order to contribute to indicators developed by the community, for t he community. However, when reflecting on my project and potential missing elements, a few recommendations for the CEM Program come to mind. First, in future projects within the CEM Program, I highly encourage in -person engagement, which would not only al low researchers to build stronger connections with members sharing their knowledge but would also provide them with a deeper understanding of where participants' perspectives are situated in space and time. Considering the context in which our research too k place (i.e., in the midst of the COVID -19 pandemic), virtual engagement was the most appropriate method of gathering input at this point in time. Second, I would recommend the CEM Program foster collaboration between the researchers working within differ ent pillars of the Program. Notably, students working under the health and cultural pillars could find synergies to build indicators that meet objectives for Health values and F ood, Social, and Ceremonial activity values . The Program should also encourage collaboration with other Metlakatla departments to build a strong body of knowledge for Metlakatla and avoid potential research duplications. For instance, CEM health research ers could work closely with the Metlakatla's Health Department , Aquatic Resources Department , and Culture, Language and Heritage Department , which are working on food -related issues . 56 Third, the Program should ensure that, as recommended by the health experts interviewed, researchers follow a strengt h-based and resilience approach , one in which the study focus es on the assets of the community rather than the deficits (Gan & Ballantyne, 2016) . For instance, in the health pillar, a community asset could be 'the number of traditional healers,' whereas a deficit would be 'the prevalence of cancers.' A strength -based approach would enable the CEM Program to build on resources, competencies, and solutions existing in the community . Fourth, the CEM Program should take the time to reflect on the research tools it utilizes. For instance, in the first focus group (with Metlakatla staff), participants highlighted that the health influence diagram presented \u2014the main visual tool for the discussion \u2014was linear and atomistic. They suggested using a more circular, holistic, and cyclical concept to engage with Metlakatla members. Following these insights, we used the medicine wheel as the key communication aid during the second focus group (with Metlakatla members). Although the medicine wheel remains a Western conceptualization a ppropriating an Indigenous concept, participants engaged easily with it, connected with the topic at hand, and provided meaningful insights stemming from the medicine wheel. Therefore, I recommend the CEM Program to continuously evaluate its method s and tools and discuss possible changes with Metlakatla members. Reflective questions may include: c an non- Indigenous peoples reconcile the tools through which they gather Traditional Knowledge with Indigenous values? Are there less colonial technique s to collect qualitative data? Are there Indigenous methods to gather quantitative information about an entire community? Are there visuals instruments that would promote a better understanding of the research among community members and encourage more meaningf ul connections between participants and researchers? Those are reflections that I have not explored in depth but recommend the CEM Program to consider. With regards to the health pillar, if future researchers are to employ the medicine wheel again, one stu dy participant suggested using the medicine wheel concept developed by the University of Victoria and Indigenous researchers, which is based on the Haida model and might be more culturally relevant to Metlakatla members than the commonly used black, yellow , red, and white medicine wheel. Other visual instruments should also be examined. To summarize, research tools and visuals must be carefully selected to increase engagement from participants, and foster meaningful relationships between participants and re searchers. Fifth, the CEM Program could use a backcasting approach when building management actions for the health pillar . Following such an approach, researchers would inquire about Metlakatla members ' vision for their community and consequently build act ions ensuring that this desired future becomes a reality. The CEM Program may already be applying this approach when 57 building management actions for each priority value ; I would encourage also utilizing it at the 'pillar level .' This suggestion implies focusing on what a healthy community would resembl e rather than concentrating on what a community with few chronic conditions and good access to health care would look like . More context and details regarding potential changes to th e health research approach can be found in the Summary Report of Health Focus Groups (2021) . 7.1.3. Implications All three research objectives were met; the CEM Program can now continue to expand the work completed under the health pillar. This section elaborates on the implications of the research findings for the CEM Program, the larger body of literature, and health practitioners. Implications f or the CEM Program - Elaborating on the Findings This research advanced the work of the CEM Program within the health pillar. Developing indicators will allow the Program to track and assess the conditions of the priority health values before creating management actions that will help mitigate the impact of industrial development on the conditions of the values (measured through conditions indicators) and the underlying factors affecting the conditions of the values (measured through stressor indicators). This research also identified potential future indicators (i.e., the new barriers to Access to Health Services could become indicator s) and future areas of work (i.e., In tergenerational trauma and healing). Implications for the Larger Body of Literature - Replicating the Process The essential part of this study is the process followed to develop Indigenous -based indicators. I hope that it could be replicated by any Indigenous Nation across Canada who wishes to identify appropriate indicators for their members . Other researchers may also employ this proces s to build community -based indicators in collaboration with Indigenous peoples. Implicat ions for Health Practitioners and Health Assessments - Adopting the Findings The findings of this work (the condition and stressor indicators developed) could be employed today by other Indigenous Nations. For instance, if a Nation wishes to use Indigenous - based indicators but lacks the means to create indicators using the research process that we followed, that Nation could adopt the indicators identified . Therefore, if appropriate, the indi cators developed with Metlakatla could be used to benefit other Indigenous peoples. 58 Additionally, the indicators identified could be used in health assessments in non - Indigenous contexts. This suggestion stems from the idea that most humans have a connecti on to their community, culture, history, and geographical location ; consequently, the Social and Cultural Connectedness indicator could give insights into people's wellbeing in non -Indigenous context s. Notably, this indicator offers a different (non -Wester n) perspective on health, one that is holistic and may be applicable in various locations. Likewise, the importance of foods and traditional foods, or cultural foods, may be relevant to diverse communities and cultures worldwide . However, I acknowledge tha t my findings are context -based (specific to that Nation and culture and shaped by the structural health challenges faced by the Metlakatla community) and place -based (relevant to that location). Therefore , the wider replicability suggested above is a hope I have rather than a statement I am making. 7.2. Limitations The work in this paper represents an initial exploration of Metlakatla members' health concerns and priorities. The indicator preferences may not be definitive or representative of all members' values and priorities. Community health concerns and priorities may change as demographics, experiences, and context change. Participants' indicator preferences could be based on their initial instincts on what should be measured and kept track of . Indicator preferences could evolve with more information provided to participants on how development projects may potentially affect their health. Therefore, these results should only be used to initiate and facilitate discussion around health indicators for the Metlakatla community. The context in which the focus groups took place was specific to the CEM Program; hence, the findings should not be extrapolated or misinterpreted in other contexts. Finally, health is unique and can take different meanings f or different individuals. The focus groups covered personal topics, and individuals spoke of their own experiences and knowledge and discussed their personal views on health. Thus, when applying these results, caution should be taken not to generalize abou t Metlakatla membership. Finally, this research was conducted during the COVID -19 pandemic, and the COVID -19 events may have influenced Metlakatla members' views on health. 7.3. Contextualization and Conclusion The research took place in a changing context, one moving from a time during which Indigenous peoples were denigrated, denied, and annihilated , to one in which Indigenous 59 perspectives are valued on an equal footing with Western values and Indigenous rights are being respected \u2014to some extent. Federal and p rovincial governments are making efforts to repair the harm done to Indigenous peoples and promote equal, healthy, and mutually beneficial relationships between Indigenous and non -Indigenous peoples. As a conclusion and opening for discussion, the followin g paragraphs link this work on Indigenous health to the broader context, including Canadian rec onciliation and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) . Nation -wide efforts to answer the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Calls to Action are also highlighted. 7.3.1. Reconciliation The Truth and and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2015) defines Canadian reconciliation as: To the Commission, reconciliation is about establishing and maintaining a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal peoples in this country. In order for that to happen, there has to be awareness of the past, acknowledgement of the harm that has been inflicted, atonement for the causes, and action to change behaviour . (p. 6) The study contributes to reconciliation in three ways. First, the work acknowledges the harm inflicted on Indigenous peoples by explicitly linking colonization to Indigenous peoples' health and expressing the impacts of intergenerational trauma. Second, the resea rch process intends to maintain a mutually respectful relationship between Aboriginal and non -Aboriginal peoples by encouraging collaboration between university academics and a First Nation and placing Indigenous perspectives at the center of the work. Thi rd, this work is a first step to creat ing action to change behaviour, as the data collected from the indicators will serve to build management actions for the Metlakatla community. 7.3.2. UNDRIP The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ( UNDRIP) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2007 ; the UNDRIP Act ( Bill C -15) came into force in Canada in 2021. The Act states that Canada will take all measures necessary to ensure the laws of this country are consistent with the Declara tion, which presents forty -six articles detailing the rights of Indigenous peoples . My research contributes to answering three of the UNDRIP articles at the level of the Metlakatla First Nation . 60 Article 23 states that \" Indigenous peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and determining health [...] and social pro grammes affecting them and, as far as possible, to administer such programmes through their own institutions\" (United Nations, 2007, p. 18). Article 24 mentions that \" Indigenous peoples have the right to their tra ditional medicines and to maintain their health practices [...] and also have the right to access, without any discrimination, to all social and health services. Indigenous individuals have an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable stan dard of physical and mental health\" (United Nations, 2007, p. 18) . Article 29 highlights that \" States shall also take effective measures to en sure, as needed, that programmes for moni toring, maintaining and restor ing the health of indigenous peoples, as developed and imple - mented by the peoples affected by such mate rials, are duly implemented\" (United Nations, 2007, p. 21) . The research responds to these articles by involving Indigenous Peoples in developing and determining health (Article 23) , by bringing up issues regarding Indigenous peoples ' difficult ies in accessing traditional medicine, quality care, and non -discriminatory services (Article 24) , and by building actions or programs that seek to restore the health of Indigenous peoples, programs that will be implemented jointly by the CEM Program and the Metlakatla First Nation (Article 29) . 7.3.3. Calls to Action In 2015, the Truth and Reciliation Commission (2015) presented ninety -four Calls to Action aiming to advance Canadian reconciliation. Call 22 declares that : We call upon those who can effect change within the Canadian health -care system to recognize the value of Aboriginal healing practices and use them in the treatment of Aboriginal patients in collabor ation with Aboriginal leaders and Elders, where requested by Aboriginal patients . (p. 3) Work has been done to answer this Call : the Federal Government has provided funding to improve Indigenous health and access to health; Indigenous Healing practices are incrementally being addressed in Provinces and Territories; numerous preeminent medical organizations have made commitments to ensure and protect Indigenous Health and Healing; the Institute of Indigenous People's health created an Indigenous Peoples' Hea lth Strategic Plan and started to implement diverse initiatives promoting Indigenous health and wellness (CBC News, 2022; Indigenous Watchdog, 2022) . 61 7.3.4. Conclusion: Final Thoughts on Indigenous Health and Healing With regards to the above -mentioned milestones at various levels of government in Canada, I am tempted to conclude that there is hope . Today, there is hope that Indigenous peoples will recover from intergenerational trauma. There is hope that Indigenous peoples will receive quality and culturally -sensitive care everywhere in Canada. There is hope that Indigenous peoples will regain power over their health and wellness practices. There is hope that Traditional Knowledge on healing and wellbeing will become available to all Indigenous peoples. There is hope that, in a few generations, Indigenous peoples will feel connected to their communities, culture, history, and traditional lands and water for the improvement of their wellbeing. Ther e is hope that all Indigenous peoples will be in balance with their emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual health. There is hope that Indigenous individuals, families, communities, and Nations will soon be thriving on Turtle Island. 62 References Aalhus, M., Oke, B., & Fumerton, R. (2018).

Health Influence Diagram Health Influence Diagram Introduction In order to understand how Metlakatla's health is affected by the social determinants of health and industrial activities in Metlakatla Territory, the CEM Program created a Health Influence Diagram (see Figure A.1 below) during Phase 1 work (see Figure 4: Phases in the Metlakatla Cumulative Effects Management Program) . An influence diagram is a tool to visualize and isolate the pathways through which the Metlakatla health priority values are affected by cumulative industrial development. The Health Influenc e Diagram links the activities that occur in Metlakatla Territory (left side, pink) to the Metlakatla priority health values (right side, green). The Program's pillars , which also represent some of the intermediate and proximal social determinants of healt h, are coloured in purple. The boxes with blue diamonds and blue circles contain the indicators considered during this research project. The Heath Influence Diagram below is a streamlined version of the diagram presented in the CEM Health Indicators Final Report prepared for the Metlakatla First Nation . Health Influence Diagram Purpose The Health Influence Diagram is a simplified representation of the numerous factors that affect health. All determinants are connected through a myriad of complex pathways. S ome determinants may be more influential than others in an individual's health outcome; for example, one's education may be more influential than one's genes (Braveman & Gottlieb, 2014) . However, the purpose of the influence diagram in the CEM Program is not to capture each cause -and-effect pathway between activities in Metlakatla Territory and priority values. It is primarily a communication tool for mapping potential interactions to facilitate a discussion among Metlakatla staff and community members on value s and indicator s selection. 72 Figure A.1: Revised Health Influence Diagram. Revised from Compass Resource Management Ltd. (2015a, 2015b) . Development Related Activities and Social Determinants of Health Development -related activities, proponent mitigation measures, and Metlakatla activities affect the intermediate and proximal social determinants of health through several pathways. The most relevant pathways are highlighted in the diagram. They are linked to the pillars of the CEM Program: Governance, Environment, Economic Prosperity, Cultural Identity, and Social/Health (health is placed at the end of the causal pathway, rather than wi th the other pillars of the Program, as the diagrams identifies the components of health) . For instance, project operations (see diagram) , because of their extractive nature, directly impact the environment. By creating employment opportunities, industrial activities can bring more income to the region, which can lead to increased incomes but can also create income inequalities, thereby impacting the economic prosperity of Metlakatla First Nation and its members. The influx of temporary workers (in -migrant workforce) leads to population increase, which will likely affect the cultural identity of Metlakatla Village and Prince Rupert, as well as local housing and safety conditions. 73 As mentioned in the literature review , the intermediate and proximal social de terminants of health (in purple) are affected by the distal determinants of health, represented here as the historical factors , in pink (factor is used as a synonym of determinant ). These include colonialism, government policies that impact Indigenous peoples' self -determination, and the legacy of residential schools, which resulted in intergenerational trauma. Changes in the condition of these intermediate and proximal social dete rminants of health lead to high psychosocial stress (i.e., stress that emanates from social situations that are emotionally and psychologically demanding) for Metlakatla members. Chronic Health Conditions The added psychosocial stress, with time, may modif y a person's health and well -being. On the diagram, the boxes marked with blue diamonds represent potential health indicators, which have been divided into two categories: the indicators linked to mental, emotional, and spiritual health and the indicators linked to behavioural health (mentioned in the literature review as 'health behaviours'). Someone who is emotionally healthy is able to assess, understand, and manage their own emotions and that of others in ways that help one understand social interaction s and build social connections (Coleman, 2007 ). Someone who practices healthy behaviours can respond to the needs and desires of their bodies in ways that improve rather than deteriorate their physical, mental, and emotional status in the long run. Behavioural choices are the outcome s of interacti ons between automatic responses to the environment, conscious decision -making, and habits (K\u00f6ster, 2009) . They are influenced by the la rger social, cultural, physical, economic, and political context (Baum & Fisher, 2014; Kelly & Barker, 2016) . More information on the selected indicators is provided in Chapter 4 . These indicators report on the status of the Chronic Health Conditions priority value in the Metlakatla CEM Program. The health diagram also highlights th e hereditary factors (genetics) that impact chronic health conditions. However, we recognize that genetics and epigenetics (the alteration of the genetic code during one's lifetime) are also connected to the social determinants of health through direct and indirect pathways. Access to Health Services Development -related activities also alter Metlakatla's access to health services. As represented in the diagram, the social determinants of health influence peoples' obtainability of health services, which is t he ease with which people access health care. In addition, a large 74 population increase due to the influx of temporary workers may augment the use of health services. The latter may place a burden on health services available to all Metlakatla members. Last ly, the regional health care programming commands the availability of health services (i.e., the quantity, quality, and variety of services offered in Prince Rupert and Metlakatla Village). More information on the selected indicators is provided in Chapter 4. These indicators report on the Access to Health Services priority value status in the Metlakatla CEM Program. 75 Appendix B. Indicators List - September 202 0 This indicators list is a comprehensive inventory of potential indicators that coul d be considered in this project. The list was finalized in September 2020 before focus groups and interviews. Indicators colored in l ight blue were shown in the Health Influence Diagram and presented during focus groups.
