Introduction Due to different reasons, in the past decades, the stress potentialforhealthcareprofessionalsincreased[ 1-3].Struc- turalchanges in thehealthcare system (i.e., implementation of the health-related-diagnosis-groups system) led to a riseof pressure to reduce health care costs and hospital stays, work intensification, increasing administrative tasks, and increasingheteronomy.Infact,healthcareprofessionalshaveto deal \"with the most emotionally distressing of situations- illness, dying, suffering in every form\" [ 4]. Humphries et al. [5]summarizedfurtherfactorslikeheavyworkloads,staffing shortages, or high staff turnover rates, which contribute tohigherstresslevels.Health care professionals are exposed to a large psycho- logical burden, too [ 6-8]. Their increasing work burden is mostly associated with poor psychological wellbeing, emo-tional exhaustion, reduced life satisfaction, dissatisfactionwith the job and their own quality of work, and so forth oreven with their decision to quit the job [ 9-12]. Several of these symptoms are characterized as \"burnout\" as describedby Maslach et al. [ 13], that is, emotional exhaustion, deper- sonalisation,andreducedpersonalaccomplishment. It is obvious that health care professionals have to face the implications of work stress and to find strategies toadapt and to stay \"functional\" while doing their job. Usingthe term \"cool down reactions,\" we will summarize (andmeasure)experiencesofemotionalexhaustionandemotional Hindawi Publishing Corporation Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2015, Article ID 754814, 9 pages http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/7548142 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine distancingfromthepatientstokeep\"functionality\"inthejob. Differentstrategiesmightbechosentocopewiththeadverseworking conditions and to protect oneself from burnoutsyndrome. Common strategies are an emotional distancefrom the suffering person or cynic reactions [ 14,15]w h i c h can be categorized as \"depersonalization\" [ 15]. Interestingly, McManusetal.[ 14]foundthatdoctors'cynicalreactionsmay reducetheirstress. Although it is not a desired reaction with respect to an adequate health care and support of patients, this \"deper-sonalization\" might nevertheless be an adaptive strategyfor health care professionals. Emotional distance from thepatients is implicitly regarded by most health professionalsas a common reaction of self-protection. This \"professionalneutrality\" is kept even when facing difficult medical situ-ations and appalling fate of patients, to protect their own\"functionality\" in the job. While it is evident that for patients their spirituality is a resource to cope with chronic diseases (summarized in[16,17]), there are accumulating data that spirituality can be also a resource to cope for physicians. According to theresultsofZwackandSchweitzer[ 18]basedondataofGerman physicians, spirituality is one of several resilience strategiesto deal with job-related stress factors. Also, Anandarajahand Roseman [ 19] stated that \"spiritual self-care [ ...]c o u l d contribute to improved compassionate patient care and help\"immunize\"physiciansagainstburnout.\"Doolittleetal.[ 20] concluded that they \"identified [ ...] spiritual coping strate- gies that may have protective benefit\" for physicians. Theysaid that \"along with other coping techniques, spirituality m a yb ea ni m p o r t a n tf a c t o ri nm i t i g a t i n gt h ee ff e c t so f burnout.\" In a large sample of US physicians, half of them stated that they \"try hard\" to carry their religious beliefs overinto all their \"other dealings in life\" and that they \"lookto God for strength, support, and guidance\" [ 21]. Among paediatric oncologists from the US, half of them assumedthattheirspiritual/religiousbeliefsinfluencetheinteractionswith patients and colleagues [ 22]. A smaller study enrolling 53USsurgeonsfoundthattheir\"religiousbeliefsplayapart\"in their clinical practice, that they feel \"guided by a higherpowerthanmyownabilities\"intheirpractice,andthattheirreligious beliefs were helpful to deal with their \"inabilityto heal patients with poor prognoses\" [ 23]. In a sample of German psychiatrists, 54% stated that \"Religious beliefsinfluencewholeapproachtolife,\"37%ofthemtriedto\"carryreligion into other aspects of also 36% \"experienceGod's presence\" [ 24]. Thus, physicians' spirituality seems to be of importance for their own life and might be a resourcetocopewithdifficultsituations,too. Because health care professionals deal with increasing adverseworkingconditions,whichmayaffecttheirempathicencounter with patients and their life satisfaction, we aimedto analyse whether spirituality is a resource for health care professionalstocopewithincreasingstressandworkburden, s p e c i fi c a l l yw i t hr e s p e c tt o\" c o o ld o w nr e a c t i o n s \"w h i c hdescribe an emotional distancing and development of cynicreactions towards patients and/or reduced engagement as astrategy to protect their own functionality. For this analysis,we focussed on health care professionals with an anthro- posophic background because of their unique approach todistinctformsofspirituality. Anthroposophy(anempiricalformof\" spiritualscience \") is a humanistically oriented spiritual philosophy developed by the Austrian Philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). It is based on a holistic anthropology according to which the human being cannot solely be explained by the moleculesof the physical body and their interactions, but more com- prehensivelybyholisticallyorganizedinteractionsofphysical and nonphysical or \"spiritual\" factors: body, life, soul, and spirit [25]. In the anthroposophic theory of medicine and the practice of health care, this has led to an extension ofconventionalcareandtointegrativemedicalconcepts,using a multimodal treatment approach, in the attempt to account forphysicalaswellasspiritualfactorsintheunderstandingof healthanddiseaseandtreatmentofpatients[ 26].Apartfrom spiritualfactorsinhumansandnature,anthroposophypostu-latestheexistenceofanobjectivespiritualworld,potentially accessibletospecificallytraineddirectexperience,thatis,by perceptive imagination, inspiration, and intuition [ 27]. The specifictrainingconsistsofsystematicenhancementofinner awareness by meditation and cultivating one's capacity of thinking, feeling, and moralconduct [ 28,29].This\"spiritual path\"intendstoleadtorefinedperception,insight,judgment, and decision.

Methods 2.1. Participants. All individuals of this anonymously con- ducted cross-sectional study were invited by the head of the Medical Section of the Goetheanum, Dr. Michaela Gl \u00a8ockler, via email using the respective network of associated pro- fessional associations. The Medical Section of the School of Spiritual Science at the Goetheanum coordinates andsupports research and is the head organization of anthro- posophic medicine. For this project, the Medical Section contacted associated health care professionals to fill the questionnaire. Participants received the respective German language questionnaire anonymously either as a hard copyvia surface mail or as an electronic document via email. To account for the fact that any analysis enrolling persons with a wide spectrum of different professions has to deal with differences in specific world view and specific views relatedt ot h er e s p e c t i v ep r o f e s s i o n ,w ec h o s et of o c u so nh e a l t hprofessions within the field of anthroposophic medicinewhich(should)shareasimilarphilosophicalbackground. For this analysis, we only enrolled persons with health related professions (=489; i.e., medical doctors, nurses, therapists, etc.), while all other respondents or those withunclear professions were excluded from the sample ( = 105). Sociodemographic data and occupational tasks of respondentsweregivenin Table 1.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 Table1:Characteristicsof489healthprofessionals.

We intended to operationalize and measuretheaforementioned\"cooldownreactions\"asphasesof emotional exhaustion and distancing from the patients toprotect the own \"functionality,\" using the 9-item cool downindex(CDI),designedbyArndtB \u00a8ussing(Table caring for the patients (i.e., CDI 3\u2014their personal problemsandworriesoftensimplybecometoomuchforme;CDI8\u2014Imyselfincreasinglygoshort;CDI6\u2014Iincreasinglythinkhowniceitwouldbetopackitallin;CDI7\u2014someofthemsimplyannoy me), subsequent reactions of emotional withdrawal ( C D I2 \u2014 Ih a v et ow i t h d r a ww i t hi n c r e a s i n gf r e q u e n c yt o protectmyself;CDI1\u2014Isimplymuststoplettingeverythinggettometosuchanextent;CDI4\u2014Ioftennolongerhavethepatience to listen to them; CDI 5\u2014I largely don't care whatthey think of me), and \"working to rule\" as a strategy (CDI9 \u2014 Ii n c r e a s i n g l y\" w o r kt or u l e \" ) .A l li t e m sw e r ei n t r o d u c e db yt h es e n t e n c e\" I nd e a l i n gw i t ht h ep e o p l eIl o o ka ft e r(therapeutically),Inoticethat....\" Respondents have to judge how often they perceive the respective feelings (1\u2014a few times a year or less; 2\u2014oncea month or less; 3\u2014a few times a week;5\u2014a few times a week; 6\u2014every day) and the strength ofthese feelings and perceptions with scores ranging from 1(weak) to 6 (very strong). The sum of both scores indicatesthesignificanceoftherespectivefeelingonasingleitemlevel (scores may range from 2 to 12), while the sum of all 9 items constitutestheCDImeanscore. These\"cooldownreactions\"can,butmustnotnecessarily, beassociatedwithclinicallyrelevantburnoutsymptoms.First findingswiththeCDIamongasampleofnursesfromAustriafound a strong 3.2.WorkEngagement. TheUtrechtWorkEngagementScale (UWES) measures \"a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption\"[ 35].Forthisstudy,weusedthe9-itemshortened version(UWES-9;alpharangingbetween.85and.92)which hassimilarpsychometricpropertiestothelongversion.Ithas been shown that work engagement is negatively associated with burnout [ 36] and positively related to work and life satisfactionandself-ratedhealth[ 35]. n dsof o rth .Th ei t e m sa r esc o r edo na7 - po i n t Likertscale,rangingfrom\"never\"to\"always/everyday.\" The UWES differentiates work engagement with three subdimensions,thatis,vigor,dedication,andabsorption. 3.3. Life Satisfaction. Life satisfaction was measured using the Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale (BMLSS;a l p h a=. 8 7 )[ 37]. The items address intrinsic (myself and life in general), social (friendships and family life), external(worksituationandwhereIlive),andprospectivedimensions(financial situation and future prospects) of life satisfactionand also satisfaction with the abilities to manage daily life concernsandsatisfactionwiththehealthsituation. Each of these 10 items was introduced by the phrase \"I would describe my level of satisfaction as ...,\" and on4 100% level (\"delighted\"). Scores >50%indicate higher life satisfaction, while scores <50% indicate dissatis- faction. 3.4. Self-Perceived Work Burden. Current work burden was measuredwithavisualanaloguescale(VAS)rangingfrom0(noworkburden)to100(unbearableworkburden). 3.5. Aspects of Spirituality. To quantify cognitive, emotional, intentional, and concrete activities of theism/belief, panthe-ism/transcendence, existentialism, and humanism, we usedthe ASP (aspects of spirituality) questionnaire [ 38]. The 25-item instrument has a very good internal consistency(Cronbach's alpha = .94) and differentiates 4 main factorswhichwouldexplain65%ofvariance[ 3\u2014applies quite abit; 4\u2014applies very much).

Results 4.1.Participants. Amongthe489enrolledhealthcareprofes- sionals with a mean age of53\u00b110years, 66% were women and 34% men ( Table 1). Most were living with a partner andwereaffiliatedtotheChristianCommunity('Christenge-meinschaft'). Within the sample, 41% were physicians, 14% burden was moderatelyhigh(meanscores 53.0\u00b122.8 ),whiletheirgeneral life satisfaction was high, too (mean scores 76.3\u00b112.5 ). All aspects of spirituality scored high to very high, particularlytranscendenceconviction (Table 1). Allfurtherdetailsarepresentedin Table 1. 4.2. Cool Down Reactions. As shown in Table 2,t h e9i t e m s of the CDI showed a good internal consistency (Cronbach'salpha = .840) in this sample. Here, the mean CDI scorewas36.3\u00b114.2 . Although work engagement and perceived work burden differed significantly with respect to gender,age,educationallevel,andprofession,thesevariableshadnosignificantinfluenceonCDI( Table SD 13.97 .96 23.57 12.37 value .0 6.0 5.8 3.6 value n.s. .015 .016 .059 Age 31-40yearsMean 11.89 value 2.0 5.1 2.4 3.4 value n.s. .002 .018 Profession 7.9 8.2 .1 value n.s. .005 .004 n.s.

The followingvariableswereincludedintherespectivepredictionmodels: gender, age, high school education, living with orwithout a partner, physicians versus other professionals,durationofyearsworkingontherespectiveprofession,workengagement, perceived work burden, alcohol consumption,andaspectsofspirituality. As shown in Table 5, \"cool down reactions\" can be explained best by perceived work burden, with furthern e g a t i v ei n fl u e n c e so ft h ew o r kv i g o rc o m p o n e n ta n dl i f esatisfaction and positive influences of alcohol consumptionandreligious orientation . These variables explain 20% of variance.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 In contrast, health care professionals' life satisfaction was explained best by vigor, with further positive influencesof being physicians, conscious interactions ,a n dl i v i n gw i t h a partner on one hand and negative influences of \"cooldown reactions,\" perceived work burden, and, however,transcendence convictions ontheotherhand( Table 5). These variables explain 35% of variance. All aspects of spirituality explainonly6%ofvarianceinlifesatisfaction,with conscious interactions beingtheonlysignificantvariable(beta=.21; = 3.9;<.0001 ). 5. Discussion The aim of the study was to investigate whether spiritu- ality is a resource for health care professionals with ananthroposophic background to cope with increasing stressand work burden, specifically with respect to \"cool downreactions.\"Duetotheirspecificanduniquephilosophicalandspiritual convictions (encouraging personality developmenta n da ni n n e rs p i r i t u a lp a t hw h i c hm a ya l s oh a v ei n fl u e n c eonempathicsupportofpatients[ 27-33]),theenrolledhealth careprofessionalsscoredhightoveryhighonallscalesofthe ASP questionnaire, particularly on transcendence conviction andsearch for insight/wisdom .A l s o ,i nap r e v i o u ss t u d y ,w e have found that physicians with a specialisation in com-plementary and/or alternative medicine or anthroposophicmedicine had significant higher scores on these aspectsof spirituality when compared to \"conventional\" physicianslacking such specialisations [ 40]. We can thus confirm that specific aspects of spirituality are in fact of strong (self-assessed) importance to anthroposophic health care profes-sionals. Yet it is unclear whether or not these aspects ofspirituality are related to their work burden, \"cool downreactions,\"andfinallylifesatisfaction. We found that with respect to their perceived work burden, the scores were moderately high, while their lifesatisfactionwashigh.Inlinewiththis,theyscoredmoderateto low on the CDI. The mean score of the CDI of the wholesample was 36.3 (SD = 14.2) and that of physicians was37.6 (SFD = 15.2), thus, lower than the score of a referencesample of 467 hospital physicians (mean CDI = 47.8; SD =18.10)(Recchia,Falkenbergetal.inpreparation).Thismightindicatethateitherhealthcareprofessionals(andspecificallyphysicians,too)withananthroposophicbackground(anditsspecific implications for their daily life activities) may haveaccess to strategies (i.e., specific spiritual practices) helpful to cope with stressful working conditions and thus avoiding cool down reactions. Alternatively it might be that theirworkingconditionsarenotasstressfulashospitalphysicians.Although we have no specific data to verify this, we wouldassumethatalargefractionoftheenrolledphysiciansofthissample are working as practitioners rather than as hospitaldoctors, and thus the stress conditions might be different.Moreover, studies with other health care professionals (i.e.,nurses and psychotherapist) are currently underway. So far,we do not assume that our data can be easily transferredto health care professionals in general, because the specificcontext of anthroposophy might be crucial. Further studiesareneeded.Nevertheless, our results show that the influence of spirituality on \"cool down reactions\" is much smaller than expected,becausethedifferentaspectsofspiritualitywerenotindicated as significant predictors of \"cool down reactions,\" and there was only a marginal negative correlation for conscious interactions . Instead, the potential of spirituality for physicians, nurses, and other health care professionals dealing with stressful working conditions can be possiblyseen in positive correlation on their work engagement. In thisstudy,allspecificaspectsofspiritualitycorrelatedweakly to moderately positively with the work engagement and weakly with life satisfaction (which are both moderately interconnected). This can be seen in line with findings ofZwack and Schweitzer [ 18]t h a ts p i r i t u a l i t yi so n eo fs e v e r a l resilience strategies to deal with job-related stress factors or thatspirituality\"couldcontributetoimprovedcompassionate patientcare\"[ 19]andmightbebeneficialfactortoameliorate or prevent burnout symptoms [ 19,20]. Using qualitative interviews,AnandarajahandRoseman[ 19]substantiatedthat the interviewed physicians, \"despite diversity of personalspiritual beliefs,\" felt that compassion, as one aspect ofspirituality, was \"essential for a physician.\" In our study,t h ev a r i a b l ec o m p a s s i o ni sp a r to ft h e conscious interactions subscale, which is weakly associated with work engagementand life satisfactionand the onlyaspect of spiritualitywhichis related to lower cool down scores at all. Among residentphysicians, Doolittle et al. [ 20] found that physicians \"who place a high priority on healthful relationships, engage inan active spiritual life, and practice humility [ sic]m a yh a v e important personality traits that protect against burnout.\"All these aspects refer to relational aspects of spirituality,which are part of the \"spiritual path\" of persons with ananthroposophicbackground,too. Although our results give a weak hint that particularly therelationalformsofspirituality(i.e., consciousinteractions ) might be a resource to cope with stress in working life, the study design does not allow causal conclusions. Further studies with other samples of health care professionals are required, because one cannot exclude the possibility of too positivelyassessedaspectsofspirituality(intermsofdesiredor even realized attitudes and behaviours) in this unique sampleofpersonswithananthroposophicworldview. In conclusion, health care professionals with an anthro- posophic background scored very high on all aspects of spirituality and relatively low on the CDI scores (whichwould indicate relatively low emotional exhaustion and low distancing from their patients). Their spirituality does not necessarily contribute to their general life satisfaction butmightbeabufferagainstalossofvigoranddedicationintheir work.
