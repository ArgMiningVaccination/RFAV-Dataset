Approximately 120 patients, stratified as to the presence or absence of tophi, will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to Baseline to receive treatment with one of two dose levels of SEL-212 or placebo every 28 days for approximately 6 months in each trial (SEL-212/301 and SEL-212/302). Analysis of efficacy will be performed at Day 28 of Treatment Period 6. Safety will be monitored throughout the study. | Accepts Healthy Volunteers | Healthy volunteers are participants who do not have a disease or condition, or related conditions or symptoms |No| | Study Type | An interventional clinical study is where participants are assigned to receive one or more interventions (or no intervention) so that researchers can evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or health-related outcomes. An observational clinical study is where participants identified as belonging to study groups are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes. Searching Both is inclusive of interventional and observational studies. |Interventional| |Eligible Ages||19 Years - 80 Years| |Gender||All| | Trial ID: | This trial id was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov, a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, providing information on publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants with locations in all 50 States and in 196 countries. | | Phase 1: Studies that emphasize safety and how the drug is metabolized and excreted in humans. Phase 2: Studies that gather preliminary data on effectiveness (whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and additional safety data. Phase 3: Studies that gather more information about safety and effectiveness by studying different populations and different dosages and by using the drug in combination with other drugs. Phase 4: Studies occurring after FDA has approved a drug for marketing, efficacy, or optimal use. The sponsor is the organization or person who oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyzing the study data. The person who is responsible for the scientific and technical direction of the entire clinical study. Category of organization(s) involved as sponsor (and collaborator) supporting the trial. The disease, disorder, syndrome, illness, or injury that is being studied. This is one of two replicate randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trials to determine the safety and efficacy of two different dose levels of SEL-212 compared to placebo. Approximately 120 patients, stratified as to the presence or absence of tophi, will be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio prior to Baseline to receive treatment with one of two dose levels of SEL-212 or placebo every 28 days for approximately 6 months in each trial (SEL-212/301 and SEL-212/302). The SEL-212 doses will differ as to the SEL-110.36 component. Participants will receive SEL-037 administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg via intravenous (IV) infusion immediately after receiving SEL-110.36 at a dose of either 0.1 mg/kg (SEL-212A) or 0.15 mg/kg (SEL-212B) via IV infusion. The placebo will consist of normal saline. Placebo subjects who complete the study will be offered enrollment in an open-label extension study for treatment with SEL-212 (SEL-212/303). Efficacy assessments will be conducted at intervals that are appropriate to determine treatment effect with samples for the primary endpoint drawn during Treatment Period 6. Safety will be monitored throughout the study with an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Experimental: SEL-212A IV infusion of SEL-212A every 28 days for a total of up to 12 infusions Experimental: SEL-212B IV infusion of SEL-212B every 28 days for a total of up to 12 infusions Placebo Comparator: Placebo IV infusion of Normal Saline every 28 days for a total of up to 12 infusions Placebo Normal saline If you are interested in learning more about this trial, find the trial site nearest to your location and contact the site coordinator via email or phone.
