This guidance included a list of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) based on the findings of previously conducted reviews . Given that SARS -CoV-2 is a novel pathogen, the evidence base regarding AGPs is still evolving, and the extan t AGP list was determined when COVID -19 was classified as an HCID (High consequence infectious disease ), a review of the extant AGP list was deemed necessary in support of NHS remobilisation needs across the UK. Purpose A rapid review was conducted that sought to assess the available evidence identified for each procedure included on the current UK AGP list and to identify risks specific to SARS -CoV-2 in the current context (epidemiology and vaccination inclusive). The research question of the review was purposefully focused . Specifically, the review sought to answer the following research question: What is the available evidence to support the removal of any procedures currently included on the UK AGP list? Data Source Iterative specifi c and sensitive search strategies, informed in part by the previously conducted AGP reviews, were developed and used to search the Medline (OVID), Cinahl (EBSCOHost), and PubMed bio-medical databases . Study Selection The population, intervention, outcome and study designs eligible for inclusion in this review were: Population: Adults and children with or without clinically suspected or confirmed COVID -19 or other respiratory infection (SARS, MERS, or influenza) or a simulated exposure model (for example, using human volunteers, cadavers, etc.). Intervention: Procedures currently included on the UK (Tracheal intubation and extubation; manual ventilation; tracheostomy; bronchoscopy; dental 3 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) procedures using high speed devices ; non-invasive ventilation (NIV), bi -level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP); high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO); high -intestinal endoscopy; tract ). Comparison: As reported in eligible studies. Outcome: Aerosol generation (size and number of particles), rate /risk of SARS - CoV-2 transmission, or environmental contamination as reported in eligible studies. Study design: Case -reports, case -series, case -control, cohort studies, outbreak reports, intervention studies (all designs, including empirica l studies) were eligible for inclusion in the review. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer. Two reviewers screened 20% of the titles and abstracts returned via the literature search, to ensure consistency of approach. Conflicts in assess ment were resolved via consensus. The remaining titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. Full text screening of results was undertaken using a standardised screening form and was performed by a single reviewer and screening of excluded stud ies was undertaken by another reviewer. Data Extraction Data from eligible full text studies were extracted to a standardised form using Microsoft Excel, which included the main PICOS elements of the review. Specifically, study design, country, location/setting, population, procedure (as per the extant AGP list), exposure/intervention, outcome measure, outcome definition/ascertainment, quantitative outcomes (both absolute and relative), limitations, and any other important comments were extracted . Evidence synthesis A total of 37 studies met the eligibility criteria of th e review. Fourteen of the studies reported on two or more of the procedures included on the current UK AGP list. Methodological and clinical heterogeneity was observed across the included studies and outcome, ascertainment, definition, and reporting also varied meaning the studies were subject to limitations and uncertainty. Three studies examined tracheal intubation and extubation . All patients included were anaesthetised and paralysed and underwent urgent, emergency or elective procedures . It was reported that aerosol levels were significantly lower compared 4 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) with natural respiratory activities. Therefore, consideration should be given to amending the list to reflect the identi fied evidence in anaesthetised and paralysed patients by removing intubation a nd extubation from the UK AGP list. Three studies assessed manual facemask ventilation and based on the limited volume of evidence identified by th e review it appears that consideration should be given to removing manual facemask ventilation from the extant UK AGP list. Two studies each assessed a single case of tracheostomy insertion and there were limitations and uncertainties in the reported result s. Both studies reported low levels of aerosol generated but provide insufficient evidence to support the removal of tracheostomy insertion from the extant UK AGP list. Two studies examined bronchoscopy which were subject to limitations and uncertainties . Thus, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the removal of bronchoscopy in awake patients from the extant UK AGP list. Six studies examined dental procedures . It is particularly difficult to distinguish between device -derived and patient -derived aerosols in this setting but there is consensus that dental procedures should remain on the UK AGP list. Seven studies assessed non -invasive ventilation (NIV) and are consistent in suggesting that NIV is not associated with increased aerosol generation and aerosol concentrations were lower than that associated with natural respiratory activities. Therefore, consideration should be given to removing NIV from the extant UK AGP list. Nine studies examined high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) . Most of th ese studies reported that HFNO was either associated with a decrease in aerosol levels or that the aerosol levels were not significantly differen t to either baseline levels or those generated by coughing. Therefore, consideration should be given to removin g HFNO from the extant UK AGP list . Eight studies assessed ear, nose, and throat (ENT) airways procedures , and available evidence suggest s that such procedures should remain on the UK AGP list. Three studies assessed upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy . The a vailable evidence included in this review indicates that upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy in awake patients should remain on the UK AGP list. Five studies examined surgical procedures in the respiratory tract or sinuses and the evidence included in this review suggests that these procedures should remain on the extant UK AGP list. 5 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) No studies were included in the review that examined high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), induction of sputum suctioning , or post -mortem procedures. Three studies that examined the relationship between clinicians, AGPs, and COVID -19 infection met the inclusion criteria of this review . The included evidence that examined the risk to clinicians of COVID -19 infection associated with AGPs is insufficient to enable any definitive conclusions to be drawn. Limitations of included studies Included studies were subject to potential bias and co nfounding. The studies were both methodologically and clinically heterogeneous and there was variation in outcome measures and outcome assessment. Not all of the studies may be generalisable to the UK population and clinical practice. The majority of studies did not include patients with respiratory infection , and m ost were unable to quantify risk or identify specific risk factors for transmission of respiratory infection associa ted with the interventions examined. Limitations of the review Rapid review methodology was employed, and formal quality assessment of the included studies could not be performed. This was due to h eterogeneity in outcome measures and therefore outcome reporting precluded pooling of studies for estimation of effect . Conclusions The review identified evidence which suggests that consideration should be given to removing some of the procedures currently included on the UK AGP list. However, the evi dence assessed was subject to a number of limitations and uncertainties that should be considered before amending the UK AGP list. 6 | A rapid revie w of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Introduction In response to the SARS -CoV-2 pandemic, infection prevention and control (IPC) guidance was developed for health and care services across the four nations of the UK. This guidance included a list of aerosol generating procedures (AGP) . The AGP list was informed in part by transmissi on based guidance developed as part of the National Infection Prevention and Control Manual (NIPCM), Scotland, derived from World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations .1 The NIPCM AGP review was published in 2017 and included an AGP list that was br oader than that of the World Health Organization ( WHO ). In addition, a review2 was undertaken by the Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infection (ARHAI) Scotland group based on AGP enquires received in relation to COVID -19. This review included additional procedures based on the HCID (High consequence infectious disease ) classification at the beginning of the pandemic and perceived level of risk based on expert opinion . The recommendations of this review were agreed in collaboration with experts from New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) and Public Health England (PHE). A further systematic review3 was undertaken on behalf of the Independent High Risk AGP Panel, to review specific cough -related procedures tha t had not been considered in previous reviews and were the subject of enquiries. The panel noted in their advice that there is an absence of evidence for these procedures, and the challenges of the eviden ce base more generally for AGP s, indicating the urgent need for more research. Given that SARS -CoV-2 is a novel pathogen with disease dynamics that differ markedly from the viruses responsible for SARS and MERS , the evidence base regarding AGPs is still ev olving, and the extant AGP list was determined when COVID -19 was classified as an HCID, a review of the extant AGP list was deemed necessary in support of NHS remobilisation needs across the UK . Objective The review sought to assess the available evidence identified for each procedure included on the current UK AGP list and to identify risks specific to SARS -CoV-2 in the current context (epidemiology and vaccination inclusive). Therefore, the research question was purposefully focused . Specifically, the review sought to answer the following re search question: What is the available evidence to support the removal of procedures currently included on the UK AGP list? 7 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Methods A formal protocol was not generated or registered on the Interna tional Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) , or equivalents, for the rapid review . The current review does not meet the PROSPERO eligibility criteria as a systematic review methodology was not employed due to time constraints (the service required clarification quickly) and the necessary processes, governance, and responsibilities were not established to conduct a full review. However, an SBAR was developed which summarised the situation and the proposed methodology for conducting th is review. Therefore, the rapid review was conducted and reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA )4, Cochrane guidance5, 6, and Synthesis without meta -analysis (SWiM) in systematic reviews guidance7 where possible and appropriate . Stakeholders (clinical consultation group) In lieu of a multi -disciplinary review group (recommended when undertaking systematic reviews5) a Clinical consultation group was formed to advise during the review process based on the Cochrane recommendations regarding stakeholder involvement and roles in rapi d reviews.6 Specifically, the group provided clinica l advice and input to the review by assessing: the search strategies and identifying any omitted terms or acronyms. the appropriateness of the eligibility criteria developed. the studies identified for full text review to identify any incorrectly included studies and any additional studies not identified or erroneously excluded. The Clinical consultation group were involved in the eligibility assessment, but were not involved directly in data extraction, appraisal, or in the initial drafting of the review. However, post assessment the group were consulted to seek their clinical opinion and comments regarding the results and conclusions of the completed draft review before production of the final draft . Eligibility criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the review were developed in accordance with PICOS (Population; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome; Study design) and are shown in table 1 below. 8 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Table 1: Eligibility criteria applied during the review process Eligibility criteria Population Adults and children with or without suspected clinically suspected or confirmed COVID -19 or other respiratory infection (SARS, MERS, or influenza) or a simulated exposure model (for example, using human volunteers, cadavers, etc.). Exposure / Intervention Procedures currently included on the UK AGP list : tracheal intubation and extubation; manual ventilation; tracheostomy; bronchoscopy; dental procedures using high speed devices ; non -invasive ventilation (NIV), bi -level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP); high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO); high frequency using nebulis ed saline; respiratory tract suctioning; upper ENT (ear, nose, and throat) airway procedures; upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy; surgery/post - mortem if in the respiratory tract or sinuses. Comparison As reported in eligible studies. Outcome Aerosol generation ( number concentration , mass concentration and size distribution of particles), rate of transmission, risk of transmission, or environmental contamination as reported in eligible studies. Study design Case-reports, case -series, case -control, c ohort studies, outbreak reports, intervention studies (all designs, including empirical studies ). Exclusion criteria Procedures not currently included on the UK AGP list. Studies examining the efficacy or effectiveness of mitigation measures used during AGP. Studies conducted in environments/settings or using interventions/therapeutics that are not generalisable to the UK health and/or social care setting. Clinical and/or consensus guidelines, editorials, opinion/news studies, predictive modelling studies, in -vitro, vaccine studies , systematic reviews, and meta -analyses . Grey literature Pre-print (not peer reviewed) studies Date range 2019 to present (cut off as per the latest DB update or day search was run). Language English only Information sources The extant UK AGP list was determined in part via the recommendations/findings of three prior reviews.1-3 Following an assessment of the sources that were used by these r eviews, Medline (OVID), Cinahl (EBSCOHost) , and PubMed were identified 9 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) as the most appropriate sources to inform the current review. Registries and grey literature sources were not searched as part of the current review; nor were pre - print databases or pla tforms . No handsearching or snowball searching was performed . However, as part of the review process the Clinical consultation group were a sked to suggest any additional studies , they were aware of , that were not identified via the literature searches. Literature searches Search strategies were developed iteratively for each database using a combination of subject headings (controlled vocabulary) and free text terms appropriate for each platform . The strategies were informed by the approaches taken in the ARHAI2 and Independent High Risk AGP Panel3 reviews. Therefore, specific strategies (based on the ARHAI approach) and sensitive strategies (based on the Panel approach) were developed. The search strategies u sed are shown in appendix 3 (specific strategies) and appendix 4 (sensitive strategies) for each database searched to inform the review . Study selection The screening of titles and abstracts of results yielded via the literature searches was conducted by a single reviewer. Abstract assessment was conducted using a standardised title and abstract form that was developed and used to screen the titles and abs tracts of the literature search results. Two reviewers screened 20% of the titles and abstracts returned via the literature search, to ensure consistency of approach. Conflicts in assessment were resolved via consensus . The remaining titles and abstracts w ere screened by a single reviewer. Full text screening of results was undertaken using a standardised screening form and was performed by a single reviewer and screening of excluded studies was undertaken by another reviewer . Data collection and data items Data from eligible full text studies were extracted to a standardised form using Microsoft Excel, which included the main PICOS elements of the r eview. Specifically, study design, country, location/ setting, population , procedure (as per the extant AGP list), exposure/intervention, outcome measure, outcome definition/ascertainment, quantitative outcomes (both absolute and relative) , limitations, and any other important comments were extracted . 10 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs ) Outcomes Outcomes of intere st for the review were a erosol generation (including the number concentration , mass concentration and size distribution of particle s, where reported ), rate of transmission, risk of transmission, or environmental contamination in relation to any of the procedures included on the UK AGP list as reported in the included studies. Due to the anticipated limited volume of evidence, the standard metrics used in the review were as reported in the eligible studies. It was anticipated t hat these would include measures of absolute effect, such as means as well as particle diameter and that relative effects may also have been reported, such as mean relative difference (proportion), odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR), relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), and relative risk reduction (RRR). Quality assessment (risk of bias) Due to the different study designs and methodologies employed across the included studies, quality assessment was anticipated to be complex . Difficulties in assessing the quality of health protection and infection control studies have been well documented.8 No published quality asses sment tools were deemed appropriate for a formal assessment of the risk of bias in the eligible studies due to the nature of their design . Therefore, assessment using a standardised assessment tool was not undertaken. However, limitations and potential unc ertainties of included studies were included in the extraction process and recorded in the evidence table that informed this review. Synthesis of results In accordance with SwIM guidance7, the method of evidence synthesis was assessed prior to conducting th is rapid review. Following this assessment, e vidence synthesis was conducted based on grouping of the outcomes ( and standard metrics if possible ) as reported for each intervention (i.e., each AGP included on the current UK list). Given that the extant UK AGP list is comprised of intervention s performed across as range of different specialties it was anticipated that synthesis should be performed for specialties / intervention as this would be clinically appropriate and of most use to the service. It was also anticipated that a lack of data would preclude meta -analysis or quantitative synthesis of estimate d effect . Furthermore, it was expected that the results reported in the eligible studies would be heterogeneous in terms of outcome measure. Thus, it was determined a priori that \"vote counting \" was likely to be the most appropriate method of synthesising the effect reported in the studies for each AGP (that is, if there is evidence of a consistent direct ion of effect but not magnitude of effect). 11 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Results Search results A total of 13,165 results were returned via the sensitive and specific literature search es. Following the removal of duplicates and the exclusion of records based on the screening of titles and abstracts, a total of 80 records underwent full text assessment. After assessment, a total of 53 records were excluded from the review for the following reasons: population (n= and not available in full text (n= 5). Therefore, 27 records were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review . Full details of the search and screening process are outlined in the PRISMA flow diagram, shown in appendix 1. (A list of the 53 excluded studies , by PICOS, is provided in appendix 2 ). Upon review of the 80 article s eligible for full text review, the Clinical consultation group sug gested an additional 18 studies as being potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. Following full text assessment, 8 studies were excluded from the review (intervention n=5 and study n=3). Therefore, an additional 10 studies were deemed eligible fo r inclusion in the review. Full details are shown in the PRISMA flow diagram , appendix 1 , and a list of excluded studies is shown in appendix 2 . Thus , a total of 37 articles overall were adjudged to be eligible for inclusion in this review. Characteristics of included studies Fifteen of the included studies9-23 were conducted in the US; 11 studies24-33 were conducted in the UK; five studies34-38 were conducted in Australia; one was conducted in Canada39, China40, Japan41, and New Zealand42, respectively ; two of the included studies43, 44 were international studies. Seventeen of the se studies11, 12, 14, 15, 23, 27, 29 -35, 37, 39 -41 were conducted using patient populations . The majority of the included studies used an empirical design, specifically: four studies9, 19, 21, 22 were cadaveric studies; 16 studies14, 15, 27, 29, 32, 39, 41 11, 12, 23, 31, 33 -35, 37, 40 used environmental monitoring / sampling; seven studies10, 13, 16, 17, 36, 38, 42 were conducted with healthy volunteers; one study30 used both healthy volunteers and COVID -19 positive patients (as a reference group) ; six studies20, 24 -26, 28, 45 were conducted using a manikin; two were case control studies18, 44; and one was a prospective cohort study.43 Of the studies eligible for inclusion in the review : 12 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) three studies examined tracheal study20) studies assessed manual ventilation (n=3 environmental monitoring / sampling27, 32, 34) two studies assessed tracheostomy (n=2 environmental monitoring / sampling31, 37) two studies examined bronchoscopy (environmental monitoring /sampling23, 39) six studies examined dental procedures ( n=1 environmental monitoring / sampling12; n=5 manikin studies24-26, 28, 45) seven studies assessed non -invasive ventilation (NIV) (n=1 environmental monitoring / sampling33; n=5 healthy volunteers10, 13, 16, 36, 38; n=1 healthy volunteers and COVID -19 patients as a reference group30) nine studies examined high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) (n=2 environmental monitoring / sampling11, volunteers10, 13, 16, 36, 38, 42; n=1 healthy volunteers and COVID -19 patients as a reference group30) eight studies assessed ENT procedures (n=3 environmental monitoring 15, 23; n=1 healthy volunteers17; n=4 cadaveric gastro -intestinal endoscopy (n=3 environmental monitoring / sampling29, 40, 41) five studies examined surg ical procedures veric studies19, 22) Fifteen of the eligible studies10, 13, 16, 19, 21 -23, 27, 33, 34, 36, 38 reported on two or more procedures included on the current UK AGP list. No studies were included in the review that examined high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), induction of sputum, respiratory tract suctioning , or post-mortem procedures . Further details regarding the location of studies, populations, and interventions by specific AGP is provided in the next section. In this review the term \"awake\" include s patients who are sedat ed and exclud es anaesthetised patients with secured airway s. Results of Individual stud ies Tracheal intubation and extubation Three studies20, 27, 35 were included in the review that examined tracheal intubation and extubation and the associat ion with aerosol generation. One study27 was conducted in an ultraclean (highly ventilated and high efficiency particulate air [HEPA ] filtered) operating theatre environment , one in a \"standard \" operating theatre35, and Weber20 in an unspecified room or \"chamber \". In two of these studies 13 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) the population was comprised of COVID -19 negative patients who were anaesthetised for urgent and emergency orthopaedic trauma and n eurosurgical procedures27 and elective endonasal pituitary surgery .35 Weber20 used a training manikin with simulated body fluid (including f luorescein ) added to the lungs and stomach. During the intervention a researcher \"squeezed\" the manikin to imitate cough ing and vomit ing. In Brown27 environmental sampling was performed across all phases of the procedure (pre-oxygenation, induction of anaesthesia and neuromuscular blockade with manual facemask ventilation, laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation) by means of an optical particle sizer, sampling 0.5m from patients ' head s (directly above for most but also some observation behind patients ' head s). This study reported on aerosol detected during intubation (n=19 patients) and extubation procedures (n=14 patients) ; for three patients, multiple attempts at intubation were included in the analysis and were considered in each case as belonging to a single continuous intubation sequence . Environmental sampling was undertaken in the Dhillon35 study , which included three elective patients, by means of air sampling with spectrometry with observations made 0.5m superior and 0.5m caudal to the patient's nasal used particle image velocimetry . Weber20 employed air sampling at a stationary location ( ~1m above the floor and from the procedure ) and in the \"personal breathing zone\" of clinicians and surface sampling at seven locations across the room. The reported outcome in Brown27 was airborne particle size, distribution, and particle number concentration associated with the procedure. Aerosol associated with background and volitional coughs (n=38 coughs; n=1 healthy volunteer) were used for comparison in this study. In Dhillon35 the outcome was reported as count, size, duration , and direction of any aerosol produced during the procedure. Weber20 reported f luorescein concentration in air particles and surface contamination associated with the procedure. Tracheal intubation: Brown27 reported that volitional coughs were associated with a rapid and transient spike. Mean peak aerosol concentration 2 seconds after the cough was observed as 1,310 particles/L (\u00b1905). Most of these particles were <1 micrometre in diameter . The mean number of particles detected in a 5 minute period during anaesthetic induction and intubation was 7 particles (\u00b16), compared with background (empty theatre) ~2 particles per 5 minute period. The mean concentration of particles recorded during the intubation perio d was 1.4 particles/L (\u00b11.4), which was reported as 500 -fold lower than the mean 14 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) concentration recorded during volitional coughs of 732 particles/L (\u00b1418) (p<0.0001). The maximum concentration recorded during intubation, averaged across events, was 77 part icles/L (\u00b149), which was reported as 22 - fold lower than the peak concentration during volitional coughs 1,688 particles/L (\u00b1872) (p<0.0001). Dhillon35 reported m ean particle concentrations during tracheal intubation were 12 times greater than baseline (p<0.001). The study reported an increase in aerosol during facemask ventilation, rather than intubation . Clarification was subsequently provided in another study34 by the same authors and in the same p atients (refer to section below) . Weber20 reported median particles observed at the stationary position during intubation of 3.13 nanograms/m3 (IQR: not detectable to 6.53 nanograms/m3) (50% of sample below detection limit). Median pa rticles from observations made within the personal breathing zone were reported as not detectable (IQR: not detectable to 15.1 nanograms/m3). (70% of samples below detection limit). Aerosol levels observed during tracheal intubation were lower compared wit h other activities assessed in the study . Extubation : Brow n27 reported the mean concentration observed was 21 particles/L (\u00b118), which was reported as 35 -fold lower than observed during a volitional cough (p<0.0001) but 15 -fold greater than during intubation (p=0.0004). The maximum concentration during extubation ave raged across events was reported as 432 particles/L (\u00b1209) and this was associated with evoked coughing , which was still significantly lower than volitional coughs 1,688 particles/L (\u00b1872) (p<0.0001). Manual facemask ventilation 32, 34 examining manual facemask ventilation and aerosol generation met the eligibility criteria of th is review. The study by Brow n27 assessed manual facemask ventilation as part of the intubation sequence (details are outlined in the section above ). Two studies were conducted in ultraclean operating theatres located a t a single institution in the UK .27, 32 The other study was conducted in a \"standard \" operating theatre with conven tional ventilation in Australia .34 All studies included COVID -19 negative patients undergoing either elective surgery32, 34 or urgent and emergency orthopaedic trauma and neurosurgical procedures .27 The intervention in Shrimpton32 and Dhillon34 was facemask ventilation; Shrimpton32 paralysed patients , Dhillon34 three anaesthetised and paralysed patient s. Outcome ass essment was via p article image velocimetry 15 | A rapid review of aerosol generating pr ocedures (AGPs) (n=3 locations ) sampling with in one study.34 Shrimpton32 used an optical particle sizer with observation s made 20cm directly above the mouth of the patient. The reported outcome in Shrimpton32 was p article size and number concentration associated with the procedure ; tidal breathing and v olitional cough were also assessed . In Dhillon34 the outcome was reported as c ount, size, duration, and direction of any aerosol produced. The study by Shrimpton32 was a collaboration of the Brown27 and Dhillon35 intubation groups conducted to investigate the results reported by Dhillon regarding aerosol generation and facemask ventilation. Using a jointly agreed protocol the study examined the relationship between facemask ventilation and aerosol generation, and it was agreed between the groups that the level of aerosol observed was less than observed for tidal breathing. It was reported that facemask ventilation produced mostly small particles <5 micrometres in concentrations 30 to 300 times greater than background (p<0.001) in Dhillon .34 (Clarification of the results reported in Dhillon35). Shrimpton32 reported a median particle concentration of 191 particles/L (IQR [interquartile range] : 77 to 486 [range: 4 to 1 ,313]) for tidal breathing, which was consistently detected compared to background levels and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.002). In comparison, v olitional coughs were observed to have a peak median aerosol conce ntration of 1 ,260 particles/L (IQR: 800 to 3 ,242 [range: 100 to 3 ,682]). Most particles (86.5%) measured <1 micrometre. Median particle concentration during 60 seconds of facemask ventilation without a leak was 3 particles/L (IQR: 0 to 9 [range: 0 to 43]) , which was no t significantly different compared with background level (p=0.43) and significantly lower than during tidal breathing (p=0.001). Particle concentration during facemask ventilation with a leak was 11 particles/L (IQR: 7 to 26 [range: 1 to 62]) , approximately five -fold higher than background (p=0.019) but lower (17 -fold) than that during tidal breathing (p=0.002). Median peak particle concentration during the periods of facemask ventilation without a leak was 60 particles/L (IQR: 0 to 60 [range: 0 to 120]) compared with 120 particles/L (IQR: 60 to 180 [range: 60 to 480]) when there was a leak, which is 20 -fold (p=0.002) and 10 -fold (p=0.001) lower, respectively, than particle count detected during a volitional cough. Brown27 reported the mean number of particles detected in a 5 minute period during anaesthetic induction with a period of manual facemask ventilation and intubation was 7 particles (\u00b16), compared with background (empty theatre) ~2 particles per 5 minute period. The mean concentration of particles recorded during the intubation period was 1.4 particles/L (\u00b11.4), 16 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which was reported as 500 -fold lower than the mean concentration recorded during volitional coughs of 732 particles/L (\u00b1418) (p<0.0001). The maximum concentra tion recorded during intubation, averaged across events, was 77 particles/L (\u00b149), which was reported as 22 -fold lower than the peak concentration during volitional coughs 1,688 particles/L (\u00b1872) (p<0.0001). Tracheostomy The eligible studies31, 37 that examined tracheostomy procedures both used environmental monitoring / sampling to determine aerosol generation during a single procedure performed on a single patient. There was clinical heterogeneity across both studies. The procedure was reported as being \" semi -elective \" and the patient was COV ID-19 positive in McGain37; in Ramesh31 the COVID -19 status of the patient was unclear. Furthermore, surgical tracheostomy was performed in McGain37 and percutaneous tracheostomy in Ramesh .31 However, the procedur es in both studies were performed on anaesthetised and paralysed patients . Ramesh31 was performed in an ultraclean operating theatre , McGain37 was performed in a standard operating theatre . In both studies a technique was used that aimed to minimise aerosol generation ; this included paralysis of muscle activity, passing the tracheal tube beyond the su rgical site before opening the trachea and pausing lung ventilation during the open tracheal phases of surgery. The studies were also methodological ly heterogeneous. An aerodynamic particle sizer and a combined optical and electric al particle sizer were used in McGain37; an optical particle sizer was used in Ramesh31 to assess aerosol generation. In both studies the observations were made at approximatel y 30cm from the patient airway and surgical site. Both studies reported that aerosol measurement was performed during all phases of the procedure , although there was variation in the timings of measurements . Ramesh31 separated the procedure into distinct phases and reported corresponding aerosol levels (per cm3). McGain37 reported aerosol level as a fold increase compared to baseline for specific phases of the procedure. Therefore, there was also variation in the reporting of the results. However, both studies31, 37 reported that aerosol levels observed during the procedures were generally \"low\". Bronchoscopy (awake) Two studies23, 39 that assessed aerosol generation associated with bronchos copy were eligible for inclusion in th is review. There was methodological and clinical heterogeneity between the studies. Environmental sampling was used in Doggett39 and Zheng23 and both studies assessed aerosol generation by means of an optical particle counter . However , there was some variation in the positioning of the devices in both studies. In Doggett39 observations were made 75cm from the patients' head (towards their feet); in the Zheng23 observations were made 60cm 17 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) from the patient 's oral cavity (positioned to the left of the clinician). Doggett39 included 39 patients (per protocol population) undergoing bronchoscop y in two negative pressure endoscopy suites at two tertiary care centres. Zheng23 reported aerosol levels observed while conducting several endoscopic procedures in an \"standard\" operating theatre at a single centre , including one bronchoscopy. The reporting of aerosol levels in the studies also differe d. While both studies reported aerosol level as change from baseline, Doggett39 reported the change in relation to specific aerosol diameter whereas Zheng23 reported a cumulative difference in aeros ol level. In Doggett39 observations indicated a fall in aerosol with the median difference compared with baseline was reported as: 0.3 micrometres: -2.2) p<0.001. In Zheng23, no significant difference compared with baseline was reported in particles 0.3 to 1.0 micrometres but a significant reduction in particles sizes 1.0 to 25 micrometres was reported . Dental p rocedures using high speed devices In total six studies12, 24 -26, 28, 45 that assessed dental procedures , using high speed devices , met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in this review. Aerosol generation was assessed in five of these studies24-26, 28, 45 by conducting dental procedures on a dental manikin and environmental monitoring / sampling was used in Meethil .12 There was variation in the setting in which the manikin studies were conducted . Two studies24, 25 (both by Allison) were conducted in a simulation unit located within the same UK dental school laboratory with one study25 being conducted in an open plan clinic and a dental surgery and the other study24 in a \"room\" with a \"standard hospital ventilation system\". Another of the included manikin studies26 (also by Allison) was conducted in an open plan clinic located at the same UK institution. The remaining two manikin studies28, 45 were both conducted in a dental surgery located at two different UK institutions . The Meethil study12 was conducted at a single US institution and included 28 patients , 19 of whom were reported as being COVID -19 positive . The intervention in four of the manikin studie s24-26, 45 was crown preparation, although Vernon45 also assessed root canal preparation. In Ehtezazi28 six different procedures were performed, including cavity preparation (n=3 locations), use of a three in one syringe, and an ultrasonic scaler (n=2 locations). The duration of the procedures varied across the included studies, for example, whether procedures were performed in sequence , the length of time prior to the interventions when aerosol assessment was performed, and the length of time performing the procedure . There was heterogeneity in the equipment used to carry out the procedures, with the studies reporting the use of air turbines24, 25, 28, 45, electric contra angle handpiece s28, ultrasonic scalers24, 25, 28, electric speed controlled handpiece45, and three in one s yringes.28 Furthermore, one of the studies26 18 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) assessed aerosol generation associated with a novel electric micro -motor handpiece. One study12 assessed aerosol generation associated with dental implants and \"restorative procedures\" using \" high-speed handpieces \" and ultrasoni c scalers. The assessment of aerosol generation was also heterogeneous across the included studies. An optical particle sizer (0.5m from the manikin oral cavity and 2m from the dental chair) , surface (s pectrofluorometric analysis) and air sampling were employed in one study.25 An optical particle sizer ( 0.5m, 1.5m, and 1.7m from the dental chair ) surface (s pectrofluorometric analysis) and air sampling were used in another study.26 In Ehtezazi28 a cascade impactor (at n=6 locations across the dental surgery ) was used . Photographic image analysis and spectrofluorometric analysis were employed in another study.24 In Vernon45 artificial saliva infected with 6 bacteriophage , at approximately 108 plaque forming units per mL, was used and two particle counters and s ampling (passive and active) on settle and air sampling plates were employed. Surface contamination was utilised in the Meethil12 environmental monitoring / sampling study. Furthermo re, in three studies24-26 (all by Allison) assessment was undertaken using f luorescein . There was variation in the outcomes assessed in the eligible studies. While all of the studies sought to assess particle concentration or dispersal, one study26 sought to assess the efficacy of a novel handpiece; Meethil12 sought to determine the origin of microbiota in aerosols generated during dental procedures; one study24 aimed to determine aerosol concentration and level associated with the procedures ; Vernon45 aimed to assess particle distribution associated with the use of different mitigation methods , however reported results included the use of no mitigations as a reference measure . The effect of ventilation on aerosol levels and distribution was examined in another study25; and Ehtezazi28 sought to characterise aerosol generation and mitigation measures . Therefore, the reported outcomes also varied . Two studies24, 25 reported that aerosol was detected during all procedures performed and that contamination reduced with increasing distance from the dental chair. Another study26 reported that the novel handpiece was associated with increased aerosol level, especially at 0.5m w here aerosol level was elevated throughout the procedures. Ehtez azi28 reported >99.9% particles sampled proximal to patient were <0.3 micrometres and that the h ighest level of aerosol generated was by air turbine and electric contra angle handpiece. Peak aerosol concentrations were reported as occurr ing between particle diameters 0.013 to 0.022 micrometres at 9 to 12 minutes. 19 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Meethil12 reported that microbiota from to (range: 2.5% to 100%) of the microbiota in condensate detected, irrespective of the procedure performed. Saliva was reported to have contributed to a median 0% (range: 0% to 82%). A median of 20% of the microbiota could not be attributed to either source (range: 0% to 90%). COVID -19 was reported as being undetectable in the condensate on the clinicians , patient, or environment in any of the interventions. Vernon45 reported that b ioaerosol was detected at all sampling points for all procedures conducted using an air turbine and no mitigation . Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) / Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) In this review non-invasive ventilation (NIV) means ventilation or pressure support via a tightfitting facemask (or other device -patient interface s such as a nasal mask or helmet) . It can be subdivided into constant pressure (Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) and alternating pressure (non -invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) / bi -level non -invasive positive pressure (BiPAP) these latter two terms being interchangeable) . This review uses the term NIPPV f or two leve l pressure NIV and CPAP for constant pressure NIV. Seven of the identified studies10, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38 eligible for inclusion in th is review examined NIV. The population in six of these studies10, 13, 16, 36, 38 was reported as being healthy volunteers, the population in Winslow33 was exclusively COVID -19 positive patients (n=30). There was variation in the re ported settings of the studies. The Wilson38 study of healthy volunteers was performed in an ultraclean sampling chamber. The remaining healthy volunteer studies were conducted in clinical set tings, however the settings varied. Two studies were reported as being undertaken in clean36 or ultraclean30 clinical environments. Gaeckle10 reported being performed in a negative pressure environment and Pearce16 in a positive pressure environment. The remaining study13 conducted in healthy volunteers reported being carried out in an intensive care unit room that was set to \"standard pressure\". The environmental sampling study33 conducted in COVID -19 positive patients was reported as being multi -centre and be ing conducted in both \"cohorted\" wards as well as single rooms. The studies by Gaeckle10, Hamilton30, McGain36, and Wilson38 were all conducted in settings wi th ultraclean backgrounds. There was also clinical and methodological heterogeneity across the included studies. Specifically, several different oxygen modalities /delivery methods were assessed across the studies including: alternating pressure modes (NIPPV )10, 13, 38 and CPAP .16, 30, 33, 36 Five of the studies also included natural respiratory activities: normal , tidal , or quiet breathing via the nose or mouth10, 30, 38; talking, in which 20 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) literature was provided to read at a normal volume10, or speaking30; reciting the alphabet at a loud v olume38; repeating a short sentence as loud as c ould be sustained38; deep breathing10; coughing13, 30, 38; and exercise with a pedal exerciser .38 Forced expiratory volume (FEV) was also included in the study by Wilson .38 In three of these s tudies13, 30, 38 the in terventions were performed with and without a surgical facemask. There was also heterogeneity in the duration and order in which the interventions were conducted across the eligible studies. Outcome ascertainment varied across the studies: an aerodynamic p article spectrometer was used in two studies10, 36; an aerodynamic particle spectrometer and optical particle sizer were used in Hamilton30; a scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer was also used in McGain36; a particle counter was used in Miller13; a laser aerosol spectrometer was used Pearce16; an optical particle counter was used Wilson38; and air and surface sampling was used in the Winslow33 but no aerosol was measured . There was therefore also variation in observations (method, distance, and number of locations) in the different studies and in the corresponding outcomes assessed . NIPPV : It was reported in Gaeckle10 that NIPPV was not associated with increased aerosol generation compared with baseline and that coughing was the only activity associated with increased particle number. No significant difference in particle size or diameter was ob served for coughing w ith or without NIPPV. Similarly, Miller13 reported that n o statistically significant difference observed between any of aerosol levels associated with NIPPV and low flow nasal canula (p=0.79). Analysis of variance suggested significant differences between the distances (sampling locations) and participants but not in comparison to low flow nasal can nula. Wilson38 reported that in compar ison with exercise alone , exercise plus NIPPV significantly reduce d observed particle counts ( p=0.002). This study also reported modest increases in total particle counts for NIPPV associated with increasing pressures (generally <5 -fold). However , when NIPPV was applied during exercise NIPPV decrease d aerosol generation . BiPAP was observed to have generated \"moderate aerosols (29.7 particles/mL) in McGain.36 Mask CPAP : Pearce16 reported that CPAP was associated with a maximum 15% reduction in smaller particles (p<0.0001; larger particles showed no significant change from baseline). It was reported in Hamilton30 that CPAP was associated with reduced aerosol generation compared with all other interventions assessed . Even with a large, induced air leak (>50L/min), the aerosol emission measured over that leak during coughing was reported as lower than in participant s not receiving CPAP 0.029 vs 1.40 particles/cm3; p<0.001). The size distribution of aerosol particles in patients with COVID -19 was very similar to healthy volunteers. Wilson38 included CPAP in their 21 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) NIPPV series with the same results as those indicated above. Winslow33 reported that in COVID -19 positive patients, four patients had a positive or suspected -positive sample in both an air and surface sample s. CPAP use or coughing was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination compared to baseline. High flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) Nine studies10, 11, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38, 42 that examined high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and aerosol generation were eligible for inclusion in th is review. Seven of the studies described10, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38 also ass essed NIV. Two additional studies assessed HFNO . Gall11 examined HFNO , performed in a single centre , in infants (aged 4 weeks to 24 months) who required HFNO but were otherwise healthy or who had a respiratory illness but were COVID -19 negative. The study by Jermy42 included healthy volunteers (n=10) who received HFNO at a single centre. As shown in the NIV section above, the eligibl e studies10, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38 were both clinically and methodologically heterogeneous. There was also variation in the Gall11 and Jermy42 studies. Aerosol generation associated with HFNO was determined in Gall11 by optical particle sizer and scanning mobility particle sizer . In Jermy42, observations were made using h igh speed camera imaging assessment and use of a chemical marker. This study examined q uiet breathing; voluntary snort (mouth closed, expel air through nose with maximum effort); voluntary cough (mouth open); voluntary sneeze (allow mouth to open) with and with out HFNO . The reported outcome in Gall11 was near -field aerosol levels and the association with HFNO flow rate. In Jermy42 the outcome was reported as particle generation observed during the interventions. Therefore , there was variation in observations (method, distance, and number of locations) in the included studies and in the corresponding outcomes assessed. Gaeckle10 reported that the observed n umber and size of particles measured from the respiratory tract during HFNO did not significantly ch ange compared with baseline levels and that coughing was the only activity associated with increased particle number . No significant difference in particle size or diameter was observed for coughing with or without HFNO. The study by Gall11 reported n o association between HFNO use, at any flow rate, and near -field particle counts . Hamilton30 reported that HFNO was associated with increased aerosol concentrations compared to baseline measures (p<0.001 for 30L/min vs baseline, p<0.001 for 60L/min vs baseline for all comparisons). Higher flow rates (60L/min) were associated with hig her reported aerosol concentrations 22 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) than lower flow rates (30L/min) for speaking (0.29 particles/cm3, p<0.001), (3.70 vs particles/cm3, with a (0.73 vs 0.34 particles/cm3, p=0.08). However, the aerosol was generated regardless of whether the machine was attached to a patient in a sub -study of HFNO machines (n=4) . Therefore, t he study states , this aerosol is generated by the mach ines and is not of clinical relevance and does not pose a risk of infection. HFNO generated particles were reported as small (<1 micrometre). The size distribution of aerosol particles in patients with COVID -19 was reported to be very similar to healthy vo lunteers. Jermy42 reported that d uring quiet breathing with no therapy and with 30L/min HFNO, no particles were detected . Particles were d etected during quiet breathing with 60L/min HFNO . The results of the chemical marker analysis showed no significant differences due to HFNO , nor between types of vigorous breathing, nor due to distance (quiet only), nor due to HFNO order, and there were no two-way interactions between these factors . The McGain36 study reported a low inc rease in aerosols was observed for HFNO at 60L/min (0.24 particles/mL). Miller13 reported that a significant difference was observed between measurement at the 0.6m and 1.8m (p<0.0001) for HFNO 10 micrometres/m3. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) suggested the difference was not significant for particles 5 to 10 micrometres. No stati stically significant difference s related to flow rate (p=0.08) or interaction between flow rate and distance (p=0.2) were observed. No statistically significant difference was observed between any aerosol levels during HFNO compared to during low flow nasa l oxygen (p=0.79). In the Pearce16 study, HFNO was reported as being associated with a flow - dependent increase in particle s at 60L/minute . HFNO increased generation of small particles 150 to 300 nanometres (55% increase) and large particles 0.5 to 2 micrometres (70% increase) compared to 15L/minute. Wilson38 reported that p article counts decreased when HFNO was used during respiratory activities more exertional than quiet breathing , and significantly du ring coughing where aerosols emissions were halved (p=0.028). During exercise, HFNO reduced particle counts but the difference was not statistically significant. 23 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Winslow33 reported that in COVID -19 positive patients (n=4) , HFNO use or coughing was not a ssociated with significantly more environmental contamination compared to baseline . ENT airway procedures In total, eight studies9, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21 -23 were included in th is review that examined upper ENT airway procedures and aerosol generation. The populations included in the studies varied. Four of these studies9, 19, 21, 22 were conducted using a cadaver; three included patients undergoing nasal endoscopy (n=11)15, nasal and skull based surgery (n=5)14, and (n=10)23; and one study17 included healthy volunteers (n=2) . There was also variation in the settings where studies were performed. Two studies14 were performed in a \"standard\" operating theatre/room; the Sharma19 and Workman22 studies were conducted in surgical laboratories; one study15 was conducted in a single outpatient setting; the Rameau17 study was conducted in two laryngology clinic rooms ; another study21 was carried out in a clinical examination room and surgical laboratory ; and the reaming study9 was conducted at a single centre but the setting of this study was unclear. There was also clinical and methodological heterogeneity acros s the included studies. The reported interventions included in the studies varied. Rigid nasal endoscopy, flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy, and rigid nasal suctionin g endoscopic sinus surgery Boorgu9 assessed fluorescent tracer concentration via a cascade impactor to examine near-field contamination. Both studies but Murr14, 15 sought to quantify aerosol generation associated with the inter ventions, however in one study14 this related to the increase in aerosol generation. Rameau17 sought to quantify aerosol and droplet generation associated with the procedure and Sharma19 examined the number of aerosol concentrations observed during the intervention . All four studies14, 15 , 17, 19 reported using an optical particle sizer located at different positions and distances . In one of the studies by Workman21, the reported outcome was a erosol generation (size and distribution) during procedures and in the other Workman22 study , the reported outcome was a erosol generation in the 1 to 10 micrometres range . An optical particle sizer was used to make observations in both studies . Zheng23 measured a irborne particles 0.3 to 25 micrometres associated with the intervention by means of an optical particle counter . Therefore, there was 24 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) variation in observations (method, distance, and number of locations) in the included studies and in the corresponding outcomes assessed. The Boorgu9 study reported m inimal to no field (surface) contamination was observed. Particles 14.1 micrometres were not detected during rigid nasal endoscopy, flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy, and rigid nasal suction. However the study states an overarching gener alisation to endoscopy and suctioning could not be made . Murr14 reported 99% of all measured airborne particles were size 1.0 micrometre with 70.3% of total particulate measured to be 0.3 micrometres and 24.2% as 0.5 micrometres. Murr15 reported 99.2% of measured airborne particles were 1 micrometres, with 72.9% me asured at 0.3 micrometres, 22.4% at 0.5 micrometres, and 4.0% at 1.0 micrometres. Mean particle concentration during diagnostic endoscopy was 6 ,021 p/ft3 with a nonsignificant mean 173 p/ft3 p=0.698) concentrations . The study by Rameau17 reported that none of the laryngoscopy interventions produced aeroso ls above breathing and phonation (the only interventions with a statistically significant increase in aerosol compared with baseline ). Sharma19 reported statistically significant inc reases in concentrations of to 10 micrometres during rhinologic procedures (p<0.05) . Workman22 reported statistically significant particulate generation of 1 to 10 micrometres dur ing the intervention when there was no mitigation (p<0.001) . Workman21 reported that the interventions were associated with significant airborne partic le generation in the range of 1 to 10 micrometres. Zheng23 reported that during direct laryngoscopies in anaesthetised intubated patients (n=7) a mean 6.7% increase in cumulative particles, primarily 0.3 to 1.0 micrometre particles (p<0.0001) was observed compared with baseline . Particles of diameter 1.0 to 25 micrometre significantly decreased (p<0.001) in comparison with baseline . During direct laryngoscopies with jet ventilation (n=3) there was no statistically significant change in cumulative particles compared with baseline , but a significant mean 42.4% increase in pa rticles 1.0 to 25 micrometres compared with baseline (p=0.002). 25 | A rapid rev iew of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy (awake) Three studies29, 40, 41 examined aerosol generation associated with upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy met the eligibility criteria of th is review. The methodology used in the studies va ried and there were also clinical differences . All three studies29, 40, 41 employed environmental monitoring / sampling however , there was heterogeneity in the aerosol assessment across the studies. Chan40 used a particle counter placed \"directly in front of patients ' mouths\"; Gregson29 used an optical particle sizer with observation made 20cm from patients ' mouths; and Sagami41 used an optical particle sizer positioned inside a novel barrier used during the study. The locations of the procedures also differed. While all of the studies reported bei ng conducted at a single institution, in Chan40 procedures were conducted in a endoscopy suite, in an ultraclean operating theatres in Gregson29, and in a \"positive pressure room\" in Sagami .41 The outcomes of the studies also varied with two of the studies29, 40 assessing aerosol generation during the procedure and Sagami41 assessing the effectiveness of a novel barrier used during the procedure. Furthermore, in two studies29, 40 aerosol generation was assessed by examining changes in aeros ol concentration compared with baseline. In the Sagami41, the comparison used in the assessment was also against baseline aerosol levels however a cohort of healthy controls was also included and used for comparison against patients undergoing the procedure. Gregson29 assessed aerosol concentrations associated with three reference activities (t idal breathing, via the mouth ; nasal breathing; and volitional cough ) and reported aerosol levels observed from burps and coughs observed during the procedure. All three studies reported using a sample of patients drawn from institutional lists. With studies including 93 patients40, 15 patients29, and 103 patients and 90 controls (healthy volunteers) .41 Chan40 and Gregson 29 included a mixture of sedated and unsedated patients . Sagami41 included exclusively sedated patients. In two of the studies40, 41 the COVID -19 status of patients was not reported, while patients included in Gregson29 were reported as being COVID -19 negative. There was also heterogeneity in the reporting of re sults across the studies , while all studies reported aerosol concentrations the unit of measure differed . In Chan40 aerosol concentrations were reported as particle counts/cubic foot (dcF) , in Gregson29 as mean aerosol concentration per litre, and in Sagami41 as particle counts per cubic metre . Chan40 reported that aerosol concentrations were higher, compared with baseline, during the procedure and that th e observed increase was statistically significant ( p<0.001 to p=0.02 ). In addition, the study also reported that sedation was not observed to influence the amount of aerosol . 26 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Gregson29 reported mean particle concentration for voluntary coughs of 2,330 particles/L (\u00b12,120) and an average total number of particles detected per cough of 192 particle/L (\u00b1183) . The mea n aerosol particle concentration observed during endoscopy was 595 particles/L (\u00b11,110), which was reported as not being significantly greater than tidal breathing via the mouth (p=0.17). The study also reported that during the procedure, coughs were frequ ently evoked and that burps were induced in approximately a third of procedures. Procedure -associated c oughs ha d a mean peak concentration of 11 ,710 particles/L (\u00b113,700) and the total number of particles detected per cough was 780 particles/L (\u00b11,010). Procedure -associated c oughs were associated with more aerosol than volitional coughs from the same patients (p=0.008). The mean peak concentration of particles observed for procedur e-associated burps was 3,060 particles/L (\u00b13830) and the detected per burp was 205 particles/L (\u00b1280) , which were not significantly different compared with volitional coughs. In Sagami41, increased aerosol levels were observed during the procedure compared with prior to the procedure in 81% of patients and 22% of controls (p<0.001 ). Mean increased aerosol levels (106/m3) were reported as 5.0 (\u00b14.5) for patients versus 1.9 (\u00b13.6) for controls ( p=0.006 ). Increased aerosol levels after the procedure compared with before the procedure were observed in 74% of patients and 2 2% of control s (p<0.001 ). Mean increased aerosol levels (106/m3) were reported as 4.4 (\u00b14.4) for patie (\u00b14.1) for controls ( p=0.227 ). respiratory tract or sinuses Surg ical procedures in the respiratory tract or sinuses and aerosol generation were assessed by five studies14, 15, 19, 22, 34 included in this review. Four of the se studies14, 15, 19, 22 also assessed ENT airways procedures a nd details regarding their methodologies and populations are outlined in the ENT section above. A fifth study by Dhillon34 that assessed surgical procedures was eligible for inclusion in this review. This study was conducted using patients (n=3) in an operating theatre located at a single centre. The reported outcome measure was p article size, concentration, airborne duration and spread . Observations were made using a particle sizer spectrometer and . Particle image velocimetry was also employed in this study . In addition to the differences ide ntified across these studies (refer to ENT section) there was also variation in the surgical procedures caried out in the studies. Patients in Dhillon34 underwent e pituitary surgery . In Murr15 nasal endoscopies with debridement were performed on 19 patients. Surgery for skull base tumours (n=3), orbital abscess (n=1), and functional endoscopic sinus 27 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) surgery (n=1) were carried out in Murr.14 In the study by Sharma19 several endoscopic and surgical procedures of the sinuses were conducted. The Workman22 study assessed a nterior and posterior endonasal drilling and cautery . Dhillon34 reported that m ean particle concentrations during endon asal access were up to 4.5 times greater than baseline (p=0.01). Turbinectomy and sphenoidotomy using a microdebrider was the only procedural step of endonasal access associated with a mean particle concentration above baseline (18 times greater, p=0.005). Mostly large particles >75 micrometres were observed. High speed drilling of the sphenoid keel, sphenoid septum or sella fap; and scissors did not produce mean aerosol greater than background values. Mean particle concentrations during pituitary tumour resection were less than baseline values but this difference was not significant (p=0.18). Use of a curved spatula, curettes, or suction within the sella were not associated with increases in aerosol above baseline . The study by Murr14 a mean change in particle concentrations compared to pre-instrumentation lev els for cold instrumentation with suction were an increase of 716 particles /ft3 at the surgeon position (p=0.34), a decrease of 112 particles /ft3 at the circulator workstation position (p=0.99), and a decrease of 398 particles /ft3 at the anaesthesia provider position (p=0.76). Mean change in particle concentration following microdebrider use demonstrated an increase of 1 ,825 particles /ft3 at the su rgeon position (p=0.001), an increase of 40 particles /ft3 at the circulator workstation position (p=0.99), and a decrease of 935 particles /ft3 at the anaesthesia provider position (p=0.16). Mean changes in particle concentration after drill use demonstrate d an increase of 2 ,418 particle /ft3 at the surgeon position (p=0.001), a decrease of 34 particles /ft3 at the circulator workstation position (p>0.99), and a decrease of 1 ,690 particles /ft3 at the anaesthesia provider position (p=0.13). Aerosol concentratio microdebrider use (1 ,825 particles /ft3 (95% CI: 508 to 3 ,141) and drill use (2 ,445 particles /ft3 (95% CI: 595 to 4 ,294) did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p=0.59). Murr15 reported that m ean particle concentration during cold instrumentation was observed at 8,002 particles /ft3, with a significant mean increase of 2,462 particles /ft3 (95% CI : 837 to 4,088; p=0.005) from pre -procedure. Mean particle concentration during suction use was observed at 8,514f particle /ft3 with a significant mean increase /ft3 use prior to tissue manipulation during endoscopies with debridement was associated with a mean particle concentration of 7,169 particles /ft3 and a nonsignificant mean 28 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) increase of 1,629 particles /ft3 (95% CI: 96 to 3,354; p=0.063) from pre - procedure. The Sharma19 study reported statistically significant difference s in total aerosol concentrations generated among several surgical procedures: cold functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS ), microdebrider FESS, powered drilling, needle tip electrocautery, and use of an ultrasonic aspirator (p<0.001) without mitigation . Powered drilling produced a mean total aerosol concentration of 11.4 particles/cm3 which was significantly higher than cold FESS (1.29 particles/cm3; p<0.001), mic rodebrider FESS electrocautery (1.58 particles/cm3; p<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between powered drilling and the ultrasonic aspirator (4.41 particles/cm3; p>0.99). Workman22 reported that without mitigation, significant particulate generation in the 1 to 10 micrometre range was observed during powered high -speed drilling of both the sphenoid rostrum (p<0.001) septum / anterior medial maxillary wall (p<0.001). Significant airborne particulate generation in the 1 to 10 micrometre range was also observed in the 60 second period following cautery without mitigation (p<0.001), compared to matched -condition baseline background levels . Risk of transmission to healthcare workers performing AGPs Three studies were identified that examined the risk associated with AGP s, two case control18, 44 and one prospective cohort study.43 The cohort study43 and one of the case control studies44 were international multicentre studies and the remaining case control study18 was an outbreak report conducted at a single centre. The prospective cohort study43 included 1,718 clinicians who had performed tracheal intubation (n=5,148) of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID -19. The reported composite outcome in this study was the i ncidence of laboratory - confirmed COVID -19 diagnosis or new symptoms requiring self -isolation or hospitalisation after a tracheal intubation episode. There was no comparator group included in th is study. Lentz44 recruited 1,130 clinicians , with 244 reported as c ases (COVID -19 positive laboratory confirmed) and 886 as controls (COVID -19 negative ). This study assessed the a ssociation between exposures within and outside the medical workplace with clinician SARS -CoV-2 infection. The study by Rosser18 examined e xposure to a known index case (including conducting AGP) by clinicians and COVID -19 infection in seven cases and 93 controls linked to the index case. 29 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AG Ps) In the El-Boghdadly study43 the incidence of the composite endpoint was reported as 10.7% over a median (IQR [range]) follow -up of 32 (18 -48 [0 - 116]) days) . The study reported that the r isk of the composite endpoint varied by country; was higher in females; and not associated with other factors assessed in the analysis (age, HCW role, setting, personal protective equipment ( PPE), procedures). Approximately, 1 in 10 clinicians involved in tracheal intubation of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID -19 subsequently met th e composite outcome definition . The study by Lentz44 reported that r espirator use during AGPs (adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, presence of a baseline comorbidity, healthcare role, and world region ) was associated with lower odds of clinicia n infection [odds ratio] OR=0.4 (95% CI: 0.2 to 0.8; p=0.005), as was exposure by clinicians to intensive care and dedicated COVID units, negative pressure rooms, and the appropriate use of PPE (adjusted OR range, 0.4 to 0.7). Rosser18 reported that c ompared with controls, infected individuals reported significantly more patient contact time. Infected individuals were also significantly more likely to have performed airway procedures on the index patient, particularly placing the patient on HFNO , CPAP, or BiPAP (OR=11.6; 95% CI: 1.7 to 132.1). Evidence synthesis No eligible studies were identified that examined high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), induction of sputum suctioning , or post -mortem procedures. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of these procedures from the extant UK AGP list. Evidence was identified that examined the other procedures currently include on the extant UK AGP list and a brief synthesis of the evidence by procedure is provided below. Tracheal intubation and extubation Three studies20, 27, 35 that examined tracheal intubation and extubation met th e eligibility criteria of this review. However, there were differences in the reporting of results and disagreement regarding the reporting and interpretation of results across the studies . Dhillon35 argued initially that the ir results demonstrate that intuba tion is an AGP and that specific activities or phases of the procedure are associated with greater levels (peaks) of aerosol generation . Dhillon35 did not include any measure of aerosol generation d uring normal respiration against which to benchmark procedural aerosol generation , therefore the results are difficult to interpret. Furthermore, in a subsequent report of the same patient s by Dhillon34 30 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) aerosol generation was attributed to manual facemask ventilation rather than intubation. In the studies by Brown27 and Weber20 the interpretation of the results differed. In Brown27 the results also included comparison s against aerosol s observed for volitional coughs as a reference measure . Intubation and extubation were reported to generate considerably less aerosol than a volitional cough. Furthermore, this study reported that the aerosol concentration was greater for extubation (due to some patients coughing) compared with intubation , which produced negligible aerosol . Weber20 reported that while aerosol was observed during intubation and extubation the levels observed were lower compared with other activities assessed in the study. Both Brown and Weber argue that the \"definition \" of AGPs may need to be revised. There is some uncert ainty in the results reported in the eligible studies . The studies all had small sample size (number of interventions) . In addition, both the Dhillon35 and Brown27 studies used populations drawn from a single institution , albeit one was located in the UK27, which may restrict generalisability. The study by Weber20 was conducted using a manikin , therefore the study could not simulate natural respiratory activities / behaviours that may b e observed in a live patient. Furthermore, aerosol concentration was not reported in this study, and it is unclear if multiplicity was accounted for in the analysis. There was also clinical heterogeneity across the studies. In Brown27 and Dhillon35 the procedures were conducted in accordance with lo cal institutional protocols . There was methodological heterogeneity in the ascertainment and reporting of data across the studies. Furthermore, in the study by Dhillon35 aerosol measurement included very small particles (<0.01 micrometres) which may have introduce d artefact into the results. This study was conducted in an environment with high background aerosol levels which is a source of additional uncertainty. The studies by Dhillon35 and Brown27 were conducted in COVID -19 negative patients . Thus , aerosol generation in COVID -19 positive patients is unknown. However, based on the evidence included in this review tracheal intubation and extubation in anaesthetised patients should be removed from the extant UK AGP . Manual facemask ventilation Limited evidence that assessed manual facemask ventilation was identified by this review. The study by Brow n27 assessed manual facemask ventilation as part of the intubation sequence (details are outlined in the section above). Shrimpton32 included a small sample size . Both of these studies were conducted in an ultraclean environment meaning that the results are likely to have a higher degree of precision. In addition, the study by Shrimpton32 also assessed both tidal breathing and volitional cough for comparison and reported results when there was a l eak. Moreover, this study was a collaboration of the Brown27 and Dhillon35 intubation groups and was conducted to investigate the results reported by Dhillon regarding 31 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) aerosol generation and facemask ventilation using a jointly agreed protocol. The study reported no significant difference in aerosol generation during facemask ventilation without a leak and the median aerosol level was reported as being significantly lower th an tidal breathing. Facemask ventilation with a leak was also significantly lower than tidal breathing. No statistically significant difference in aerosol concentrations was reported between facemask ventilation with and without a leak , and both were repor ted to be significantly lower than the aerosol concentration observed for volitional coughing. There is uncertainty regarding the reported results in Dhillon34 because it included three patient s and therefore was underpowered. Furthermore, the study was not conducted in an ultraclean environment and measured aerosols <0.01 micrometre in diameter which introduc es uncertainty into the results. All studies were conducted in COVID -19 negative patients who were anaesthetised and paralysed. Therefore, aerosol generation in COVID -19 positive patients is unknown. However, b ased on the evidence identified by this review consideration should be given to removing manual facemask ventilation from the extant UK AGP list. Tracheostomy insertion The limited volume of evidence (n=2 studies31, 37) examining tracheostomy insertion was consistent in reporting that the procedure was associated with \"low\" levels of aerosol generation. However, the studies were both methodologically and clinically heter ogeneous. Outcome reporting varied across the studies, which makes inference difficult. The sample size was limited to a single patient in both studies meaning that both studies were underpowered; although McGain37 was performed on a COVID -19 positive patient. The studies were also each performed at a single centre, albeit one was located in the UK31, which may limit generalisability. Both studies included anaesthetised patie nts undergoing elective procedures meaning that natural respiratory activities were inhibited during outcome assessment. Due to these limitations and uncertainties, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the removal of tracheostomy insertion from the extant UK AGP list. Bronchoscopy (awake) Both eligible studies23, 39 that examined aerosol levels associated with bronchoscopy reported a decrease in large particle levels an d a statistically non - significant difference in smaller particle levels compared with baseline. However, there was both methodological and clinical heterogeneity across the studies. The sample sizes in both studies were small meaning that they were underpo wered. Both studies also used samples, drawn from procedural lists, therefore the populations may not be representative of the UK patient population. Furthermore, while Doggett39 was a multicentre study it was reported that there was variation across both sites , with a high number of protocol viola tions reported at one site. 32 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) There is also some uncertainty regarding aerosol level assessment in Zheng23, as the optical particle sizer may not have u sed a cone / funnel. Therefore , results may not be specific to the patient but to changes in aerosol s within the room. Patients included in b oth studies were COVID -19 negative and patients were sedated as per the institutional protocol, which may not be generalisable to current UK practice. Thus, natural respiratory activities were inhibited during outcome assessment. Due to these limitations and uncertainties, there is currently insufficient evi dence to support the removal of bronchoscopy from the extant UK AGP list. Discussions with the Clinical consultation group suggested that awake tracheal intubation, should be included under this AGP heading (rather than tracheal intubation) until further evidence is available. Dental procedures using high speed devices There is consensus in the eligible studies12, 24 -26, 28, 45 that aerosol was observed during the dental procedures performed. However, there was b oth clinical and methodological heterogeneity across the included studies. In most studies there was either no attempt or it was not possible to distinguish non -biological aerosols generated from the device used for the procedure and bioaerosols generated by the patient . Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the magnitude of aerosols associated with dental procedures , nor the origin of the aerosols be it the procedural equipment or the patient . Furthermore, five of the studies24-26, 28, 45 were performed using dental manikins. Thus, natural respiratory activities and patient behaviours could not be simulated in these s tudies; in all of these studies a proxy for blood and bone fragments was not included and only Vernon45 included a proxy for saliva. Thus, observed aerosol in these studies related predominately to the intervention (irrigant or coolant) and not the patient, which introduces uncertainty into the reported results. There is also a risk that these studies were performed in an unclean environment, which may have impacted on the precision of results reported. Moreover, these studies included a relatively small number of interventions and it is unclear if these studies accounted for multiplicity. In addition, in mo st of the manikin studies the interventions were conducted in simulated clinical environments which may not be representative of dental settings across the UK. Meethil12 included patients undergoing dental procedures in a real -world setting , although the procedures were not clearly defined. However, the study used a conv enience sample meaning that the population may not be representative of the UK population. In addition, while Meethil12 included COVID -19 positive patients and reported that virus was not detected in observed microbiota , the sample size was small, and it is likely that the study was underpowered. It is also unclear if there was a clear distinction between droplet and aerosols in the outcome assessment in this study . The generation of aerosol during dental procedures is further complicated by the impact of mitigation measures that can be employed and an assess ment of the effectiveness of such measures is out with the scope of this review. Therefore, 33 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) there is a lack o f available evidence from which to draw conclusions and dental procedures using high speed devices should remain on the extant UK AGP list. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) / Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) There was consensus in the eligible studies that examined NIV that the procedures (NIPPV; CPAP; BiPAP ) were not associated with aerosol levels that were above baseline / background level s or compared with natural respiratory activities. However, the eligible studies had small sample sizes meaning that they may have lacked power . In addition, most of the studies10, 13, 16, 36, 38 were conducted in healthy volunteers meaning that there may be uncertainty in the generalisability of results to patients. Furthermore, individual variation was observed among participants included in five of the included studies10, 13, 16, 30, 38 and it is unclear if multiplicity was adjusted for in all studies, thus introduc ing uncertainty into the results. However , the results reported in Winslow33, which was conducted in COVID -19 positive patient s, suggest that NIV was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination compared with baseline in this population. McGain36 sought to examine the efficacy of a novel mitigation intervention, which may affect the generalisability of results to UK clinical practice. Heterogeneity in the ascertainment (sampling method, number, and frequency of observations) reporting of aerosol levels (different units of measurement) and interventions (including flow rate) across the included studies means that it is not possible to determine the magnitude of effect associated with the procedures. However, the evidence included in this review is consistent in suggesting that NIV was not associated with aerosol levels that were greater than natural respiratory activities. Therefore, consideration should be given to removing NIV from the extant UK AGP list. High flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) The reported results of the nine studies10, 11, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38, 42 that examined HFNO included in this review are n ot consistent. There was both clinical and methodological heterogeneity across the studies , which had small sample sizes meaning they may be underpowered . Most of the studies were conducted in adults , predominately healthy volunteers10, 13, 16, 36, 38, 42 , meaning that there may be uncertainty in the generalisability of results to patients. Individual variation was observed among participants included in six of these studies10, 13, 16, 30, 38, 42 and it is unclear if multiplicity was adjusted for in all studies, which introduces uncertainty into the results. McGain36 sought to examine the efficacy of a novel mitigation intervention, which may affect the generalisability o f results to UK clinical practice. The study by Gall11 was the only study that included an infant population and reported no association between HFNO use, at any flow rate, and near -field particle counts was observed. The study by Jermy42 was partially funded by Fisher & 34 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Paykel Healthcare Ltd ., a device manufacturer, which may have introduced potential bias into the re ported results of this study . Heterogeneity in the ascertainment (sampling method, number, and frequency of observations) reporting of aerosol levels (different units of measurement) and interventions (including flow rate) across the included studies means that it is not possible to determine the magnitude of effect associated with the procedures. Wilson38 reported that p article counts decreased when HFNO was used during respiratory activities, and significantly during coughing where aerosols (emissions) were halved (p=0.028). Gaeckle10 reported that HFNO did not result in a statistically significant difference in the number and size of particles observed compared to baseline. Similarly, Winslow33 reported that HFNO in COVID -19 positive patients was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination compared to baseline. Miller13 reported no statistically significant difference between any aerosol levels produced during HFNO compared with low flow nasal canula. Hamilton30 reported that HFNO was associated with statistical ly significant increased aerosol concentrations compared to baseline measures at a flow rate of 30L/min and 60L/min but that rates were lower than those observed for coughing alone . However, the study also reported that most of the aerosol observed was fro m the HFNO machine and not the patient. The study by Hamilton30 also reported that higher flow rates (60L/min) wer e associated with higher reported aerosol concentrations than lower flow rates (30L/min) in comparison to the natural respiratory activities observed, except coughing , which was observed to generate the large st concentration of aerosol . However, aerosols w ere observed to be from the machine and not the patient. The McGain36 study reported a low inc rease in aerosols was observed for HFNO at 60L/min (0.24 particles/mL). Similarly, Wilson38 reported slight increases in total particle counts for HFNO at higher flow rates. Jermy42 reported that during quiet breathing with no therapy and with 30L/min HFNO, no particles were detected, however, particl es were detected during quiet breathing with 60L/min HFNO . In the Pear ce16 study, HFNO was reported as being associated with a flow -dependent increase in particle at 60 L/minute. Most of the studies reported that HFNO was either associated with a decrease in aerosol levels or that any difference in levels was not significantly differen t compared with either baseline levels or those observed for coughing. While more 35 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) aeroso ls were reported by some studies at 60 L/min flow rate compared with 30L/min , the addition of HFNO reduce d aerosol compared to its absence in exertional respiratory activit ies. Therefore, consideration should be given to amending the extant UK AGP list. ENT airways procedures Seven of the studies14, 15, 17, 19, 21 -23 included in this review were consistent in reporting upper ENT airways procedures were associated with a statistically significant increase in aerosol levels , without mitigation . The study by Boorgu9 reported that the procedures observed did not appear to pose an additional risk, but the result could not be extrapolated to endoscopy. The interpretation of the results of this study and the other studies is subject to uncertainty. Four of the stu dies9, 19, 21, 22 (including Boorgu9) were cond ucted using a cadaver. Therefore, natural respiratory activities and patient behaviours / responses could not be simulated in these studies. The population in the study by Rameau17 was comprised of healthy volunteers, meaning that the results may no t be generalisable to patients. The three studies14, 15, 23 that included patients used a convenience sample, which may reduce their generalisability to the UK population. In addition, a ll of the included studies had a small sample size meaning that they were likely underpowered. It is unclear if studies involving multiple measurement, of the same population, accounted for multiplicity. All of the studies were conducted at a single centre and different ENT interventions were assessed. Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to UK clinical practice. The studies also reported different outcomes and made observations using different devices positioned at different locations. There is also a risk that some of the studies were performed in an unclean environment, which may have impacted on the precision of reported results. The generation of aerosol during some upper ENT airways procedures is further complicated by the impact of mitigation measures that can be employed. An assessment of the effectiveness of such measures is out with the scope of this review. Therefore, there is insufficient available evidence to support the removal of these procedures which should remain on the U K AGP list . Upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy (awake) There is consensus in the included studies29, 40, 41 that u pper gastro -intestinal endoscopy was associated with an increase in aerosol concentrations . Gregson29 reported that the procedure evoked coughing and burping and that both were associated with an increase in aerosol concentration above baseline respiratory activities and volitional coughs measured in the same patients . The stud ies by Chan40 and Gregson29 included a mixture of un-sedated and sedat ed patients ; while Sagami41 included exclusively sedated patients. Each of the three studies was performed at a single centre which may further limit generalisability , albeit one 36 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) was located in the UK29. In addition, the COVID -19 status of patients was unreported in two studies40, 41 and patients were reported as being COVID -19 negative in Gregson.29 However, there was clinical and methodological heterogeneity across the eligible studies. Outcome reporting varied across the studies, which makes inference regarding the magnitude of aerosol generation difficult to determine. The measurement of aerosol levels was also heterogeneous. Furthermore, the s tudies were comprised of patients drawn from institutional lists and the population sizes were relatively small meaning that the results may not be representative of the UK patient population . Therefore, while it is not possible to determine the magnitude of effect associated with the procedure. Available evidence identified by this review suggests that upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy should remain on the extant UK AGP list. Surg ical procedur es in the respiratory tract or sinuses The results of the five included studies14, 15, 19, 22, 34 that assessed surg ical interventions were consistent in reporting that increased aerosol levels were observed during the interventions performed . There was clinical and methodological heterogeneity across the included studies. Two of the studies19, 22 were conducted using cadavers. Therefore, natural respiratory activities and patient behaviours / responses could not be simulated in these studies. The remaining three included studies14, 15, 34 were conducted using a convenience sample of patients and therefore may not be representative of the UK population. Furthermore, all of the studies had small sample sizes (observations) and thus may be underpowered. It is unclear if multiplicity was adjusted for in studies involving multiple measurement of the same population. All of the studies were conducted at a single centre and different surgical interventions were examined. Consequently, the results may not be generalisable to UK clinical practice and potentially cannot be extrapolated to surgical procedures not assessed. The studies also reported different outcomes and made observations using different devices positioned in different locatio ns. Some of the studies were conducted in potentially unclean environments which may influence the precision of the reported outcomes. The generation of aerosol during some surgical interventions is further complicated by the impact of mitigation measures that can be employed , which is out with the scope of this review. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the magnitude of effect associated with the procedures . However, evidence included in this review suggests that surg ical procedures in the respiratory tract or sinuses should remain on the extant UK AGP list. Risk of transmission to healthcare workers performing AGPs Interpretation of the results of the studies18, 43, 44 included in this review that examined risk is difficult. The studies examined different factors and their 37 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) association with COVID -19 infection and the reported outcome also varied . Furthermore, there were differences in the analyses undertaken in the studies ( that is, adjustment for potential confounders and effe ct modifiers). In addition, the study by El-Boghdadly43 included a composite endpoint and the lack of a comparison group further restricts interpretation of the result s. There are also uncertainties in the repo rted results of the studies. All of the studies18, 43, 44 used self -reported data and therefore there is a risk of potential recall bias. The studies18, 43, 44 also all reported that they r ecruited volunteers which may have introduced further bias. The studies by El-Boghdadly43 and Lentz44 were multicentre, international studies meaning that there may have been clinical heterogeneity. The specific AGP assessed in the st udies was only reported in El-Boghdadly43 and were not clearly specified in Lentz44 or Rosser.18 The populations included in the studies may also not have been representative of UK clinicians . Therefore, the included evidence that examined risk to clinicians associated with AGPs is insuffi cient to enable any conclusions to be drawn. Discussion This rapid review included 37 studies that assessed the association between aerosol generation and procedures currently included on the UK AGP list. Seventeen of these studies11, 12, 14, 15, 23, 27, 29 -35, 37, 39 -41 were conducted using patient populations. The number of eligible studies identified for procedures on the AGP list were as follows: three studies20, 27, 35 examined tracheal intubation and extubation three studies27, 32, 34 assessed manual ventilation two studies31, 37 assessed tracheostomy two studies23, 39 examined bronchoscopy six studies12, 24 -26, 28, 45 examined dental procedures seven studies10, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38 assessed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) nine studies10, 11, 13, 16, 30, 33, 36, 38, 42 examined high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) eight studies9, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21 -23 assessed upper ENT airways procedures three studies29, 40, 41 assessed upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy five studies14, 15, 19, 22, 34 examined surg ical procedures in the respiratory tract or sinuses Fifteen of these studies10, 13, 16, 19, 21 -23, 27, 33, 34, 36, 38 reported on aerosol generation across two procedures (NIV and HF NO; ENT and surgical procedures) included on the c urrent UK AGP list. 38 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) No studies were included in th is review that examined high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), induction of sputum, respiratory tract suctioning , or post -mortem procedures involving the respiratory tract or sinuses . An assessment of included studies suggests that tracheostomy insertion , awake bronchoscopy , dental procedures using high speed devices , ENT airways procedures , awake upper gastro -intestinal endoscopy , and surgical procedures in the respiratory tract or sinuses should remain on the extant UK AGP list . Patients included in the eligible tracheal intubation and extubation studies were anaesthetised and paralysed . It was reported that observed aerosol levels during the procedures were lower compared with natural respiratory activities . Therefore , consideration should be given to remov ing intubation and extubation of anaesthetised patients from the UK AGP list . Awake intubation is akin to bronchoscopy and should be included as an A GP. Based on the limited volume of evidence identified by th e review that examined manual facemask ventilation consideration should be given to removing manual ventilation from the extant UK AGP list. The studies that assessed non -invasive ventilation (NIV) are consistent in suggesting that NIV is not associated with aerosol levels that are greater than background or natural respiratory activities. Rather NIV may reduce aerosol production when applied to exertional respiratory activity , whic h also applies to mask CPAP which can be regarded as subset of NIV. Therefore, consideration should be given to removing NIV from the UK AGP list. Most of the studies that examined HFN O reported that the procedure was either associated with a decrease in aerosol levels or that any difference in concentrations was not significantly differen t compared with either baseline levels or those observed f rom coughing. Some studies reported an increase in aerosol at 60L/min flow rate compared with 30L/min, however, the addition of HFNO reduced aerosol compared to its absence in exertional respiratory activities . Therefore, consideration should be given to amending the extant UK AGP list. Three studies met the inclu sion criteria of this review that examined the relationship between clinicians, AGPs, and COVID -19 infection. T he included evidence that examined risk to clinicians associated with AGPs is insufficient to enable any conclusions to be drawn. The included st udies also illustrate that some of the procedures included on the UK AGP list may not currently be adequately defined . Eligible studies of NIV examined a number of different oxygen modalities , including CPAP which can be delivered in 39 | A rapid review of aeros ol generating procedures (AGPs) via different methods ( such as, facemask, helmet, or t racheal tube ). A further consideration is that the risk of a given procedure is intrinsically linked to the risk of respiratory aerosol generation by the patient and so the same procedure may be considered a high ris k AGP in an awake patient (bronchoscopy, endoscopy, awake tracheal intubation) but would not be aerosol generating in an anaesthetised patient whose respiratory reflexes are obtunded and who may be paralysed (tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, endoscopy). Clarification of additional procedures While conducting the review, clarification was re quested from the C hief Medical Officer and PHAGE (Public Health Advice, Guidance and Expertise team) to clarify if additional procedures could be reviewed. Specifically , the request related to supraglottic airways (SGA) , pleural procedures, and spirometry . These procedures are out with the scope of the review (they are not included on the extant UK AGP list), however four studies that examined these interventions were identified in the excluded studies of this review . Shrimpton46 examined SGA insertion and removal (n=12) and aerosol generation conducted in an ultraclean operating theatre environment. The observation methods were as per those used in the Brown27 study. Shrimpton46 reported that there was no statistically significant difference between SGA insertion and removal compared with tidal breathing. The study also reported SGA insertion and removal produced significantly less aerosol compared with breathing or volitional cough (p<0.001) . Two of the studies47, 48 assessed s pirometry and aerosol generation and both reported that in comparison w ith a cough, spirometry was associated with less aerosol. Furthermore, in one study48 the use o f a viral filter during the procedure reduced aerosol level further. The final study49 assessed pleural procedures and aerosol generation and reported that percutaneous pleural procedures were no t aerosol generating . Therefore, limited available evidence suggests these procedures should continue to be excluded from the UK AGP list and cons ideration should be given to adding additional clarification to reflect this. Contextual Risk assessment In the process of conducting the review it became apparent that the major change in the evidence base around AGPs during the pandemic has come from important advances in the ability to detect aerosol produced during medical procedures 40 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) (either within hospitals or in simulated models with varying degrees of fidelity). This clinical aerosol science has enabled a quantitative assessment of aerosol generation that can be useful to inform the relative risk association with these activities. In particular , volitional coughing from study participants has been operationalised as a reference for risk , such that aerosol generated from volitional coughs can be used as a n appropriate relative risk comparator for aerosol generating procedures. The volitional cough has the advantage that it can be detected a bove baseline aerosol levels (if in a clean environment) and is a discrete, transient event. There is considerable variation between both individuals and between studies reflecting individual respiratory (patho)physiology, measurement techniques and experi mental conditions. Nonetheless using within -subject comparisons has demonstrated that several AGPs on the extant list produce much less aerosol than a cough and so by this measure can be considered as not being high risk for aerosol generation. Importantly , there is an increasing evidence base of aerosol measurements during normal respiratory activities such as tidal breathing, breathing during exercise, talking, shouting and singing.10, 27, 30, 32, 36, 38, 39, 46 -48, 50 Each of these activities generates measurable aerosol in a graded and proportionate way and importantly this physiological respiratory aerosol has been demonstrated to contain SARS - CoV-2 in patients with COVID -19.51, 52 For many of the reviewed procedures, the aerosol generated by natural respiratory activities exceed ed that produced by the actual procedure, often by more than an order of magnitude. It is further apparent that the source of the detected aerosol in several of the AGPs that do generate increased aerosol (such as , upper gastro -intenstinal endoscopy) is predominantly from the patient's own respiratory activities (i .e., coughing) rather than from the actual procedure.29 This review examined medical procedures included on the UK AGP list and the relationship with aerosol generati on or increased risk of respiratory transmission from an infected patient / individual to those present / undertaking the procedure s. This review d id not examine the additional standard and transmission based precautions required when treating patients with respiratory infectious agents , which is contained in UK IPC COVID -19 guidance and the National Infection Prevention and Control Manual (NIPCM) for NHS England. In particular the individual patient placement / assessment for infection risk this shoul d be undertaken based on an individuals ' infectious status, the level of interaction and the anticipated level of exposure to the infectious agent. This assessment will determine the required transmission base d precautions required including PPE / RPE (respiratory protective equipment) . It is worth again emphasising that airborne precautions (PPE / RPE) are not required for AGPs on patients / individuals that are not suspected / confirmed to be suffering from a respiratory infectious agent . 41 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) Note : This assessment differs from the requirement for organisation / employers to undertake risk assessments based on the 'hierarchy of controls' or workplace risk assessments f or employees as per Health and Safety legislation / regulations. Limitations and uncertainties of included evidence The evidence eligible for inclusion in this review was subject to a number of limitations and uncertainties. Many of these limitations and u ncertainties are similar to those identified in previous reviews of AGPs , for example, t he systematic review by Tran53 that was used to inform the original WHO AGP recommendations . The Tran53 systematic review acknowledged that studies included in that review were deemed to be of \"very low quality\" . Predominately this was attributed to the use of observational methodologies in the included studies; therefore, the studies were acknowledged to be subject to potential residual confounding and bias. The majority of the studies included in the current review employed an empirical approach. Therefore, there is a risk that these studies were subject to systematic error, for example, sampling bias associated with the use of convenience samples and observe r bias as they did not employ blinding or randomisation. The reported sample sizes (or number of procedures performed) were generally small meaning that some studies included in this review may have lacked statistical power . All of the included studies ma y not also be representative of UK clinical practice or of the eligible UK patient population. Exclusion criteria of the review were intended to increase generalisability, but it cannot be guaranteed . However, some of the included studies (n=11) were condu cted in the UK which increases certainty . The review by Tran53 also reported that most of the studies included in that review were performed at a single centre this was identified as potentially restricting generalisability. Furthermore, the review53 also reported that many of the studies included a small number of events and that the \"sample size of the studies could potentially bias estimates of effects and limit statistical power.\" The reported o utcome and definition varied across the included studies. All of the studies examined the relationship between aerosols or particles and an intervention currently included on the UK AGP list. However, aerosols / particle s were reported variously as observed quantity, aerosol size or as a range of sizes, as concentrations (for example, per litre, millilitre, and cubic foot), and spread or dispersal. Therefore, heterogeneity of reporting prevented an assessment of the magni tude of effect and thus assessment was restricted to direction of effect. There was heterogeneity in the methods and devices used to measure aerosols in the included studies. An assessment of these methods and devices was out with 42 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) the scope of this review. Therefore, such variation is a source of potential uncertainty in the results reported across the included studies . Descriptive statistics were used in the studies as the primary analysis , with most reporting an absolute effect. However, there was variation in the reference measures used across the studies. This included background aerosol level of the setting before the intervention and natural respiratory activities such as breathing and talking. Heterogeneit y of reference measure adds further uncertainty to the results and their interpretation. Baselines that include natural respiratory activity , particularly cough ing or breathing , are likely the most appropriate as these are the benchmarks against which AGPs have been defined. Conversely, using an increase against a background level is an entirely arbitrary measure dependant on the cleanliness of the experimental setting and provides little insight into the extent of aerosol generation or its absence. The exc lusion of studies where background level was the reference measure may have increased the precision of the review . However, the on -going pandemic , limited date range of the literature searches, and use of a rapid review methodology restricted the number of eligible studies included in this review . The exclusion of studies using background reference measures would have further restricted the number of eligible studies. The evidence base examining AGPs is still evolving and the review is intended to inform service need. Furthermore, synthesis and assessment in this review were via evidence of a consistent direction of effect (but not magnitude of effect ). Therefore, the inclusion of these studies was deemed appropriate. Many of the included studies reported taking multiple measurement of the same population and it is unclear if adjustment was made for multiplicity. It is also unclear if all of the studies controlled for potential confoundin g (for example, temperature, humidity, air changes per hour) of results. The number of interventions that were included for ENT airways procedures and surgery in the respiratory tract or sinuses was small and may not encompass all procedures in these speci alties that might be associated with aerosol generat ion. There is also some uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of mitigations that can be employed during these procedures , and in dental procedures, as this was out with the scope of this review. In add ition, a number of studies were conducted using simulated interventions which may not be reflective of real procedures. The review by Tran53 also acknowledged that \"with the exception of tr acheal intubation, there were a limited number of studies identified for each procedure, which limits the confidence for an individual observation.\" In a number of the included studies the population was comprised of exclusively anaesthetised and paralyse d or conscious patients undergoing procedures. Therefore, the reported effect may be limited to this group of patients and may not 43 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) be generalisable to other groups. Given the results of the studies in anaesth etised patients, it is logical for the AGP list to specify whether procedures included apply to patients who are awake or anaesthetised or both. The generalisability of the included studies is restricted because the majority of patients in the included studies did not have a respiratory infection, with only a limited volume of evidence included for COVID -19 positive patients. However , those studies that did include patients with SARS -CoV-2 (which itself has a very wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes) did not identify major differences in aerosol generation between infected and non -infected participants. In addition, a number of studies were conducted in manikins o r cadavers . Such studies cannot replicate the natural respiratory activities and behaviours associated with live patients undergoing the intervention . However, the inclusion of such studies should be balanced against the service need which the review is intended to address. Strengths and Limitations of the review This review was subject to several limitation s. A full systematic review methodology was not employed, and a rapid review was carried out in accordance with best practice where possible. However, rapid review methodology may not be as robust as that of a systematic review. The review employed both s ensitive and specific search strategies , however, no assessment of the precision and recall of the strategies was conducted . Literature search results were not updated following completion of the search process and studies not published in English were excluded. Grey literature and preprint repositories were not searched as part of this review. Therefore, some studies that reported on procedures included on the extant UK AGP list may not have been identified. Fu rthermore, no assessment of publication bias was performed. However, the search strategies and eligibility criteria employed by the review were informed by reviews that were undertaken previously to specifically inform the AGP list. In addition, t he search strategies and eligibility criteria were both subject to review by the IPC Cell and the Clinical consultation group and deemed to be both appropriate and suitabl y robust. The risk of bias was not formally assessed, using a standardised and validated instrument, was not undertaken as part of the review. It was determined that there was not a formalised, validated, and published quality 44 | A rapid r eview of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) assessment tool suitable for assessment of most of the included studies. While a quality assessment tool could have bee n developed specifically for this review, it was felt t hat such an instrument would be of limited use because it would not be formally tested or validated. Furthermore, the urgency of the review precluded the development of such a tool. However , as part of the review process details regarding limitations and uncertainties of the included studies were included in the extraction process , evidence table , and the evidence synthesis of this review . A formal check of heterogeneity was not conducted; however, clinical and methodological heterogeneity were qualitatively assessed. Evidence synthesis was conducted using a \"vote counting \" approach, meaning that only the reported direction of effect was assessed. Furthermore, limitations of the included data reported in the studies meant that meta -analysis or quantitative synthesis of estimated effect could not be conducted. Therefore, this review lacks precision in the reporting of (estima ted) effect . Future r esearch Methodological heterogeneity was observed across the studies included in this review. Outcome definition, reporting, and reference measure were not consistent and different observation and sampling methods were employed across the studies. Furthermore, the studies were conducted in a number of different environments and it is unclear if confounding (for example, temperature, humidity, and ventilation) was accounted for in all studies. Most of the included studies were unable to quantify risk or identify risk factors for transmission of respiratory infection associated with the interventions examined. No appropriately designed epidemiological studies intended to measure observed risk of transmission associated wit h the procedures were identified by the review . Such issues introduce potential uncertainty and restrict assessment of the wider AGP evidence base ; a limitation which is equally appli cable to the evidence on which the current AGP list was based . As highlight ed in the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) AGP research prioritisation report54 there is a need for future research to address these issues. Conclusion This review identified evidence which supports the removal of the following procedures currently included on the UK AGP lis t: tracheal intubation and extubation (in anaesthetised patients) manual facemask ventilation non-invasive ventilation (NIV) including CPAP high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) 45 | A rapid review of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) The evidence assessed was subject to a number of limitations and uncertainties that shoul d be considered before amending the extant UK AGP list. It is also suggested that consideration is given to clarifying the wording of procedures currently included on the UK AGP list. Specifically : Removing HFOV as it is a ventilation mode rather than a specific procedure. Including awake tracheal intubation under the category of bronchoscopy. Specifying that bronchosc opy and endoscopy apply to awake patents and intubation to an anaesthetised patie nt. NIV should include CPAP. Sputum induction need not mention saline. References 1.
