KP/BQ. Orthomolecular Compounds and Medicinal MushroomsNaturopathic Nutrition Year 1Learning Outcomes 2In this lecture, you will learn about: The dietary sources, bioavailability and interactions of orthomolecular compounds and medicinal mushrooms. The therapeutic uses and safety considerations. Appropriate dosage levels and preferred forms for orthomolecular compounds and medicinal mushrooms. \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ. Orthomolecular \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition KP/BQ.(Nobel Prize winner, Linus Pauling, 1968)Linus Pauling coined the term 'orthomolecular' in the 1960s to mean \"the right molecules in the right amounts\" (ortho -in Greek implies 'correct'). Orthomolecular compounds are highly beneficial for health, and although they are naturally synthesised by the body , additional amounts can be sourced from the dietor from supplementation . These compounds do not fit into the category of other nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. Examples of orthomolecular compounds include: CoQ10, alpha -lipoic acid, 4 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Orthomolecular medicine describes the practice of preventing and treating disease by providing the body with optimal amounts of substances which it also produces. The focus of orthomolecular medicine is prevention. It aligns well with the core naturopathic philosophy that \"prevention is preferable to cure\" . The concept builds on the idea that creating an optimal nutritional environment in the body will reduce disease. Emphasis is on restoration and maintenance of health through the use of nutrients that are normally present in the body. Orthomolecular Compounds 5 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.For example: The ageing process is typically accelerated as a result of free radical exposure, chronic inflammation and toxic exposure . Reversing or slowing it down is one goal of orthomolecular therapy. This might involve using CoQ10, ALA or antioxidants. Be sure to address an individual's overall diet and lifestyle with the guidance of core naturopathic nutrition principles. Supplements alone will not single -handedly support healthy ageing. What dietary and lifestyle factors might accelerate the ageing process?6 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year electrons oxidised (CoQ10) is present in each cell's mitochondria and plays a key role in ATP production. CoQ10 is also known as ubiquinone. It exists in the body in an oxidised form (ubiquinone) and a reduced form (ubiquinol) and the two forms interconvert. It is usually synthesised in the body in sufficient amounts to meet physiological requirements. CoQ10 is reduced by: Ageing, drugs (e.g. statins), smoking and certain diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease). 7 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Approx. 14%32% of CoQ 10is lost if foods are fried.Dietary intake contributes around 3 to6 mg per day. Food sources: Plant sources: Nuts (e.g. peanuts, pistachios ), sesame seeds, olive oil, fruit and vegetables including oranges, strawberries , avocado, broccoli, Therapeutic uses: Energy productionCoQ10 is needed for the electron transport chain (for complex 2 of 4 in this process) \u2014review biochemistry 2.This supports mitochondrial function and energy production. The highest quantities are found in muscle cells (including skeletal and cardiac muscle) due to the high ATP demand for muscle contraction.Fatigue. Fibromyalgia: Daily use (300 mg in divided doses; i.e. 3 x 100 mg per day). Coenzyme Q10 Exercise: What other nutrients could you use to support an individual's cellular ATP production? How do they work? 9 \u00a9 Orthomolecular Compounds. CoQ10 is a potent fat -soluble antioxidant that inhibits the peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. It neutralises free radicals produced by mitochondria. CoQ10 naturally decreases with age ; the ageing process involves ROS and impaired mitochondrial function. Depletion of CoQ10 can result in mitochondrial dysfunction , which is associated with conditions including fibromyalgia, Type 2 diabetes, CVD, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.Healthy ageing: 100-200 mg per day. Preventative measures or for directly addressing mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. fibromyalgia etc.)Coenzyme Q10peroxidation = oxidation ROS = Reactive Oxygen Species 10 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Functions: Therapeutic uses: Periodontal healthDiseased gum tissues have significantly lower levels of CoQ10 in comparison with healthy gum tissue. This is thought to be a result of the lipopolysaccharides from the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis , triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.Periodontitis. Daily 50 -80 mg Combine with periodontal care routine. Male and female fertility CoQ10 protects sperm from oxidative stress (to which they are vulnerable). Impaired mitochondrial performance (low CoQ10) can drive age -associated oocyte (egg cell) deficits infertility.200-300 mg for 6 months increases sperm health. 100-600 mg for ovarian health.Coenzyme Q10 (\u00d6zcan KP/BQ.Functions: Therapeutic uses: Cardiovascular healthCrucial for cardiac muscle function. Protects against endothelial dysfunction and hence atherosclerosis. CoQ10 reduces LDL oxidation . It inhibits the NF -kB activation that is secondary to ROS. Increases superoxide dismutase activity (an anti -oxidant) which is known to preserve the activity of nitric oxide (NO) as a potent vasodilator.Hypertension, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, post dosage: 60-300 mg / day.Coenzyme Q10NF-B= controls 2015; Eleawa .et Coenzyme Q10 Statins and CoQ10: Statins are drugs used to reduce cholesterol synthesis but they also reduce CoQ10 because both compounds are synthesised via the same pathway. Cholesterol and CoQ10 have vital functions in the body and their loss contributes to the adverse effects caused by statins. Low CoQ10 levels increase the risk of various illnesses including cardiovascular disease, myopathy and depression. 90-300 mg / day of CoQ10 greatly reduces this risk. (Littlefield et al.2014)13 metabolic pathway for the production of cholesterol and CoQ10 \u2014two crucial molecules for health. Statins act on this pathway as seen on the image. Recap: What are the functions of cholesterol? STATIN mevalonate = an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol and other compounds14 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.It is suggested that ubiquinol is a better supplemental form forCoQ10 status enhancement than ubiquinone. However: Results are mixed with very little research supporting this claim. Bioavailability is influenced more by the composition of the raw material, which for supplemental purposes is generally synthesised using a yeast -fermentation method. This produces a crystalline form which is difficult to digest. The crystals needs to be dissociated into individual CoQ10 molecules and remain in the shelf -life of the product. Thus solubilised products appear to have the greatest bioavailability. Coenzyme Q10 (Bank et Safety: CoQ10 has a remarkable safety profile. There have been no reports of significant adverse side effects of oral CoQ10 supplementation at doses as high as 1200 mg / day for up to 16 months. There have been no safety studies in pregnant and lactating women. Mild adverse effects: GIT symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea, appetite suppression, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort have been reported. These may be minimised if daily doses higher than 100 mg are divided into two or three doses. Interactions: CoQ10 may decrease the effects of warfarin. Exercise: \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Review the following case study: Jane, a 39 -year old woman has come to see you for fertility support. After unsuccessful attempts to conceive over the last 12 months she has decided to work on improving her health before trying again. Jane has mildly elevated blood pressure and also feels quite fatigued following exercise. 1.Outline THREE functions of CoQ10 that could be of benefit to Jane. 2.What are the dosage ranges suggested for each function / clinical application?17 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Alpha Lipoic Acid Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an organosulphur compound that is synthesised by plants and animals, including humans. ALA is a naturally -occurring, short -chain fatty acid. ALA is also known as '-lipoic acid ' or'lipoic acid' (LA). There are two forms of ALA: R-form (natural) and S -form (synthetic). The R-ALA variant is nearly 10 x more potent. It is thought that humans generally synthesise enough to meet basic needs. However, additional ALA in the form of supplementation has clear therapeutic benefits in certain health conditions . organosulphur = an organic (carbon) compound that contains sulphur 18 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Food sources: Found in a wide variety Plant sources: Brassicas (e.g. broccoli, Brussel sprouts ), tomatoes, peas, brewer's yeast. Animal sources: Red meat (lamb, beef) and organ meats.Alpha Lipoic Acid Functions: Therapeutic uses: Energy productionALA is one of the key coenzymes required to convert dietary carbohydrates into energy in mitochondria in the Krebs cycle. Fuels cells such as spermatozoa.Fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome, mitochondrial support, sperm health. 19 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Functions: Therapeutic uses: Antioxidant ALA is a potent fat -soluble and water - soluble antioxidant. Exogenous forms scavenge free radicals intra -and extra -cellularly. It is anti -inflammatory. It can regenerate other antioxidants such as vitamin E, C, glutathione and CoQ10. It also up -regulates the expression of glutathione. Improves the motility of spermatozoa and provides antioxidant protection. Infertility (600 mg daily) Diabetes, diabetic neuropathy Alzheimer's disease \u2014slows the cognitive decline (600 mg daily for one+ year). Multiple sclerosis. . Healthy ageing.Alpha Lipoic Acid exogenous = originating externally from the body (Hager et al. 2007; Agathos et al. 2018)20 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition KP/BQ.Functions: Insulin - sensitisingALA supplementation improves insulin sensitivity , insulin resistance, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c which are all markers of diabetes severity.Diabetes mellitus: 300-1200 mg per day. Metal - chelatingALA can mercury, copper, lead andzinc.Infertility. Alzheimer's. Peripheral neuropathy.Alpha Lipoic AcidHbA1c = blood marker of glucose levels in the last 3 months Exercise: Pick another health condition that is linked to insulin resistance. Research if this condition shows improvement with supplementation of ALA. (Kamenova, 2006; Dong et al. myelin sheath . ALA improves neuropathic sensory symptoms including pain, burning, numbness, prickling of the feet and legs. Dosage: 600 mg per day. Weight lossALA is thought to promote weight loss via various mechanisms: Reducing the oxidative stress that promotes fat storage. Suppressing appetite and hence food intake through its influence on the enzyme 'AMPK' (AMP -activated protein kinase) in the hypothalamus (where appetite is regulated). Increasing energy expenditure and reducing fat synthesis. Dosage: 1800 mg daily.Alpha Lipoic Acid (Koh et Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Alpha Lipoic Acid Supplementation: Supplements should be taken on an empty stomach to optimise bioavailability, i.e. one hour before, or two hours after food. Rare adverse effects: Allergic reactions affecting the skin (rashes, hives) and GI symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhoea). Interactions: -Biotin and ALA may compete for transport across cell membranes due to similar chemical structures. Be mindful of biotin deficiency when using high doses of ALA. -Increased risk of hypoglycaemia in medicated diabetic patients due to additive effect. Monitor blood glucose closely. Exercise: Case Study 23 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Review the following case study: Bill, 59 -year old male. Recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and wants to avoid medications. He was diagnosed after mentioning some unexplained tingling sensations in his feet. He mentions that his HbA1c result was '8%'. He is currently fairly inactive and eats mostly convenience foods. 1.Research his HbA1c result. What does this indicate? 2.What basic dietary suggestions might you give Bill? 3.Recommend ONE lifestyle change and TWO supplements with doses. Provide a rationale for your choice of supplements. 4.Explain how ALA might be beneficial for the tingling sensations. 24 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Glucosamine Glucosamine is an aminosugar naturally present in most body tissues, with high concentrations in joints and cartilage. Glucosamine is required for the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), also known as mucopolysaccharides. These compounds are an important structural component of tendons, ligaments, cartilage, synovial fluid, mucous membranes and structures in the eye, blood vessels and heart valves.aminosugar = sugar molecule with a nitrogenglyco -= sugar amino -= protein -glycan = CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Glucosamine Glucosamine can be supplemented in two different forms. All supplemental forms are highly bioavailable. Glucosamine -6-Phosphate (G6P) and N-Acetyl -Glucosamine (NAG) are naturally present within the human body. -NAG is converted to hyaluronic acid (HLA) as needed. HLA is an important component of synovial fluid. Glucosamine sulphate is sourced from marine exoskeletons (so not suitable for vegetarians, vegans and those with seafood allergies). It appears to be absorbed better and hence result in higher tissue concentrations. Sulphate is found in synovial fluid and is required for GAG synthesis. Glucosamine hydrochloride is created synthetically from corn. Exoskeleton \u2014external skeleton that supports and protects the body of certain animals . 26 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. Osteoarthritis metabolism of chondrocytes in the articular cartilage and synovial cells in the synovial tissue. This slows joint degeneration and prevents joint space narrowing. Decreases inflammation by inhibiting the formation of cytokines such as interleukin -1. Pain reduction is comparable to NSAIDS. NSAIDS provide relief after two weeks compared to four to eight weeks for glucosamine sulphate. Less effective for severe, long -standing osteoarthritis. More effective combined with chondroitin and MSM. Dosage: 1500 mg daily or in three divided doses.Glucosaminechondrocyte = cell that produces cartilage (Lubis et al. 2017)27 CNM: Nutrition KP/BQ.Therapeutic uses: IBD and intestinal permeability NAG supports the GI epithelial barrier byenhancing mucin functionality, which is dramatically altered in those with IBD. Mucins are a group of proteins found in mucus that form a barrier and prevent microbial overgrowth. NAG also reduces biofilm formation associated with IBD. NAG can be also used in intestinal permeability . Dosage: 3-6 g daily for children; 6 g daily for adults in three divided doses. Administered orally or rectally.Glucosamine Exercise: What other nutrients and food sources can be used in cases of intestinal permeability? IBD = Inflammatory bowel disease (Brasky et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2015; Sicard et al. 2018) 28 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Glucosamine Supplementation: Caution: Glucosamine supplements can be synthesised in the laboratory, however most are produced from the shells of crustaceans \u2014so can be problematic for those with a seafood allergy. Mild adverse effects: GIT symptoms such as nausea, heartburn, diarrhoea, constipation as well as drowsiness, skin reactions and headaches. Interactions: Potential increase in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, leading to increased risk of bleeding and bruising. (Knudsen & Sokol, 2008)29 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Chondroitin Sulphate Chondroitin sulphate is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). It is a major component of the extracellular matrix of many connective tissues. Most notably, this includes cartilage and joint connective tissue . Chondroitin provides resistance to compression, partially by thickening synovial fluid. 30 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. uses: from degradative enzymes. -Decreasing inflammation \u2014reduces inflammatory intermediates such as COX -2. This is also seen by reductions in the inflammatory marker 'CRP'. -Increasing hyaluronic acid synthesis \u2014enhancing joint lubrication. Dosage: two to three times a day or1000 -1200 mg daily as a single dose.Chondroitin Sulphate Exercise: Write down any other nutrients that support cartilage health. (Sawitzke et al. 2010)31 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Chondroitin Sulphate Supplementation: Supplemental chondroitin is usually well tolerated. Studies show that people absorb only 8 -18% of orally -administered chondroitin. Safety: There is some concern that chondroitin might exacerbate asthma. Patients with asthma tend to have higher concentrations of chondroitin antibodies in the airway compared to people without asthma. Interactions: Potential increase in the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, leading to increased risk of bleeding and bruising. (Lauder, 2009)32 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition sulfonylmethane (MSM) is a source of sulphur used by plants to create the amino acids, cysteine and methionine. These amino acids are a dietary source of sulphur. Plant food sources: Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa sprouts, algae, fruits , vegetables , and grains . Animal sources: Milk (cows). \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Therapeutic uses: Osteoarthritis Alone or in combination with glucosamine / chondroitin, it can reduce pain and swelling and improve joint function. General anti -inflammatory properties by inhibiting the secretion of cytokines (IL -6 and TNF -) and COX -2. Sulphur is a component of cartilage and so exerts a protective effect on cartilage. Dosage: 500 mg three times a day. Cardiovascular healthMSM reduces homocysteine levels (by donating methyl groups) and reduces lipid peroxidation. This protects the vascular endothelium from damage. Dosage: 3 g per day (benefits observed at 28 days).Methyl Sulfonylmethane (MSM) 34 \u00a9 uses: Tissue repairDecreases oxidative stress and inflammation which helps to repair GI mucosal injury and chronic GI inflammation. Supports tissue healing after an injury (including the skin). Can be applied topically to affected skin. Dosage: 2 g two to three times daily. Immune modulatorThe immune -regulating and antioxidant properties of MSM make it useful for seasonal allergies and inflammation. Studies show that MSM inhibits NF -B activity , downregulating inflammatory 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Supplementation: Generally recognised as very safe. Well tolerated up to 4 g per day in most patients. Mild adverse effects: GIT symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and bloating. Other symptoms include headache, difficulty concentrating and insomnia.

Omega -3 fish oils: 3000 mg per day. 39 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Betaine / chemical form of betaine is trimethyl glycine (TMG) and it occurs naturally in the body. TMG can be formed from choline (tetramethyl glycine). TMG serves as a methyl donor, facilitating the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Elevated homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease , so betaine can be used therapeutically to support vascular endothelial health and prevent atherosclerosis.tri = three tetra homocysteine =a non-protein amino 40 Compounds. KP/BQ.Betaine / TMG Homocysteine: A biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk, and an indicator of how well an individual is methylating. Optimal blood levels are below 9 \u00b5mol / L, excess of 14 \u00b5mol / L is linked to a high risk of health concerns. Betaine food sources: Plant sources: Beets (1-2 cups per day i.e. 250 -500 ml per day) , wheat bran, quinoa, spinach, sweet potato. Animal sources: Seafood, turkey.41 \u00a9 CNM: Year 1: disease (i.e. atherosclerosis). Alzheimer's. Dosage: 6 g daily (3 g twice per day). For best results pair with 1 mg of folate daily.Betaine / TMG Exercise: Research different supplements that would support methylation. 42 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Therapeutic uses: Skeletal muscle performanceReduces fat mass and increases muscle mass . Improves muscle endurance , body composition, arm size and bench -press work capacity. Dosage: 2.5 g daily. Fatty liver diseaseBetaine has shown that it can improve liver function in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . This has been shown by a reduction in liver enzymes, liver size and abdominal pain. Dosage: 3g twice daily.Betaine / TMG (Hoffman et al. 2009; Cholewa et al. 2013) 43 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Dimethyl is trimethyl glycine (betaine) after it has donated one methyl group during the methylation of homocysteine and only exists for seconds at a time. Therapeutic uses: Autism In 50% of cases, DMG improves behaviour, eye contact, frustration tolerance and speech . Reduces seizures. Preschool age: 65 mg daily with breakfast. Older children: 125 mg daily. Gradually increase dose to 500 mg for a child and 250 - 1000 mg for an adult. Initial increase in hyperactivity is possible \u2014dose. DMG is better tolerated than TMG for autistic patients. 44 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Phosphatidylserine Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant fat -soluble phospholipid in the human brain. It is important in neuronal membrane functions such as maintenance of the cell's internal environment , secretory vesicle release , cell-to-cell communication , and cell growth regulation . Although the body is able to synthesise phosphatidylserine, it requires substantial energy expenditure. Food sources: White beans, whole grain barley, carrots, mackerel, herring, organ meats.serine =an amino norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. Has been found to preserve glucose metabolism during Alzheimer's disease, and also reduce acetylcholinesterase activity and hippocampal inflammation. Increases cognitive function (including non - Alzheimer's related cognitive decline) and memory. More effective in patients with less severe symptoms. Dosage: 300 mg daily or 100 mg three times a day.Phosphatidylserinehippocampus = part of the brain affected by Alzheimer's (Scholey et al. 2011)46 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Therapeutic uses: Depression Improves mood through its effects on cortisol regulation. Dosage: 100 mg three times a day. More effective when combined with fish oil. ADHD Promotes attention and reduce symptoms of ADHD , and increases short -term memory. Dosage: 200 mg daily. Stress and insomniaPS dampens the effects of prolonged cortisol secretion on brain function \u2014allowing for better quality sleep and decreased anxiety. Dosage: 400 mg before bed for insomnia. Dosage: 200 mg daily for stress.Phosphatidylserine47 \u00a9 CNM: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Phosphatidylserine Supplementation: Safety: Generally recognised as safe. Has been safely used in studies for up to six months. Interactions: Possible additive effects when combined with cholinergic drugs which also increase acetylcholine. May decrease effectiveness of anticholinergic drugs. 48 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ. Phosphatidylcholine Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is a major structural component of cell membranes, maintaining their integrity and fluidity. It is synthesised from dietary choline or through the methylation of another phospholipid \u2014phosphatidylethanolamine. While the body can synthesise a small amount of choline, dietary intake is essential to meet body demands \u2014about 95% of body tissue stores of choline are found in PC. PC food sources: Plant sources: Nuts, peanuts, wheatgerm, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, spinach, peas. Animal sources : Eggs, fish, beef, chicken, pork, liver .49 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.

KP/BQ.Mycotherapy The kingdom Fungi is one of the seven kingdoms of living organisms. About 20,000 of fungal species are mushrooms, with around 1000 of them considered medicinal. Mycotherapy is the use of mushrooms and their compounds as medicines or health -promoting agents. Fungi are believed to have survived the meteor hits that extinguished many other species, and helped to renew the planet. Fungi create a mycelial (root-like) network that releases enzymes and acids to externally digest dead organisms . They move the nutrients back into the life cycle (i.e. into soil). Fungi compensate for their inability to move by growing quickly and branching their filaments and threads in any direction.myco -=fungus (mushrooms)56 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Medicinal mushroom compounds: Medicinal mushrooms produce compounds that can be harnessed therapeutically. The most useful medicinal compounds are: Beta -glucans: Beta-glucans are polysaccharides that sometimes contain protein. 1,3 and 1,6 beta -glucans are the most common forms. Their most important action on the body is on the immune system, where they can support optimal immune function , promote immunomodulation and exert anti-tumour activity. They are captured by various cells in the lymphatic tissue of the intestines and stimulate macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and dendritic KP/BQ.Mycotherapy Triterpenes : Mushrooms such as reishi are composed of over 120 different triterpenes which have various medicinal properties , e.g. hepato -protective, anti -tumour. Sterols: Mushrooms contain sterols such as ergosterol (a precursor of vitamin D ). Studies have shown that these mushroom -derived sterols can have anti -cancer properties. Lectins: Those in certain medicinal mushrooms agglutinate tumour cells , preventing their proliferation. They are / terpenes =hydrocarbon oftheformula -binding proteinsagglutinate = stick together 58 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Mycotherapy Medicinal mushrooms and drug interactions. Research has explored the possible interactions of the most common medicinal mushroom strains with drugs that are metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. The results have highlighted that the mushrooms demonstrate no appreciable inhibition , and so the possibility of a drug interaction by inhibition of CYP450 is extremely unlikely. This means that unless there is an interaction via another mechanism, the medicinal mushrooms covered can be used alongside other drug treatments . 59 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular lucidum) is referred to as \"the mushroom of eternal youth\" and has been used for over 2000 years in the traditional medical systems of China, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries for its health -promoting effects. It is considered a 'tonic' in Chinese medicine, or an 'adaptogen' in Western medicine. Important constituents include primarily polysaccharides (e.g. beta -glucans) and triterpenes ( ganoderic acids), but also lectins, sterols and B vitamins. adaptogens = help increase the body's resistance to stress60 uses: Immune - boostingIncreases the number and activity of numerous immune cells including T -lymphocytes, macrophages and NK cells. Anti- viralThe triterpenes inhibit the of the Epstein -Barr and hepatitis B viruses . They also inhibit reverse transcriptase in HIV. Anti-cancer It induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells) and inhibits angiogenesis. Evidence suggests it can inhibit tumour metastases by limiting attachment to endothelial cells. The beta glucans strengthen the immune system contributing to its anti -cancer properties. (Fujita et al. 2005; Li et al. reduces the activity of NF -kB) and anti-histamine action. The anti - inflammatory and antioxidant properties of reishi are thought to provide it with its healthy ageing properties. Anti- coagulant Ganoderic acids inhibit platelet aggregation , the blood. Supportive in cardiovascular disease. Benign prostatic hyperplasiaIt is a 5-reductase inhibitor meaning that it blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), preventing abnormal prostate growth. Stress and sleepTriterpenes have a sedative action and calm nervous system activity, supporting sleep and relaxation. (Hifasda Terra, 2020)62 \u00a9 CNM: Blood -sugar regulating Ganoderic acids increase insulin secretion and decrease cellular resistance to insulin. Useful in cases of insulin resistance such as Type 2 diabetes and PCOS . Reishi dosage range: 3-9 g / day (doses of up to 15 g / day are used in some circumstances). Start at the lower of the dosage range and gradually increase with tolerance. Use as a powder in food, tea or capsules for higher dosages. It is a bitter, woody -tasting mushroom that is considered non -edible. Reishi interactions: Combining high dose reishi with anticoagulant drugs may increase the risk of bleeding. (Hifasda Terra, 2020)63 \u00a9 edodes) Shiitake is a common edible mushroom. Its Japanese name comes from the words ' shii'(species of chestnut) and 'take' (mushroom), since it grows on chestnut wood. Important constituents include the beta -glucan Lentinan , choline, zinc, provitamin D, iron, B vitamins and unsaturated fatty acids. Large -scale clinical trials have confirmed significant anti -cancer activity from Lentinan. Lentinan (injected) is a licensed pharmaceutical in Japan and is the third most widely prescribed anti -cancer 'drug' in the world today. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), shiitake is used to replenish Qi and nourish the blood . (HIFAS da Terra, and NK cells. Increases interferon synthesis (anti -viral proteins). These properties are useful for general immune support , immune support in cancer patients and HIV. Shiitake is also a good anti-candida agent. Has antibacterial activity on bacteria resident in the oral cavity that cause gingivitis and periodontitis . Also prevents dental plaque formation. Cardiovascular diseasesShown to lower LDL by increasing faecal excretion, and increase HDL levels. Inhibits platelet aggregation and is anti-thrombotic. (Dai et al. 2015) 65 Nutrition and anti -angiogenic. Studies have demonstrated life -prolonging effects of Lentinan in those with gastric, pancreatic, colorectal and liver cancer receiving chemotherapy. Gout Has an alkalising effect and lowers uric acid levels . Note: The deposition of uric acid crystals in joints such as the big toe is a key feature of gout. Benign prostatic hyperplasiaThe high zinc levels act to block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), preventing prostate growth. (Del Buono et al. 2016) 66 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Shiitake dosage range: 1.5-10 g / day (up to 16 g / day used in some circumstances). Safety: Taking a high dose long term can lead to rare side effects such as abdominal discomfort, shiitake dermatitis, photosensitivity and Lentinula edodes) Exercise: Create a tasty recipe that include 5 -10 g of shiitake mushroom per portion that you could suggest to a client that wanted to boost his / her immune system. 67 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition -flesh, edible fungus, noted for its lobster -like flavour. Important constituents include beta -glucans, erinacines, high protein, selenium and zinc. Therapeutic uses: GI disorders Promotes regeneration of the gastric and intestinal mucosa. As a result, it is especially therapeutic in cases of: Increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcers, gastritis andGORD. It also acts as a prebiotic to support the intestinal flora and can be used in cases of dysbiosis. (Wang et al. 2015)68 \u00a9 Lion's mane has a stimulatory effect on the production of nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein required in order to regenerate and repair nerve tissue. Powerful anti -oxidant effects. Use in cases of Alzheimer's, concussion recovery, multiple sclerosis , Parkinson's disease, peripheral neuropathies (e.g. diabetic) and general cognitive decline. Nerve injuries heal progressively and often slowly over time. Longer -term supplementation (months to years depending on the extent of disease) may be necessary. Lion's mane dosage range: 1-6 g / day. (Lai et al. 2013)69 \u00a9 Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Turkey Tail (Coriolus Versicolor) Turkey tail is a mushroom that is found in most parts ofthe world and tends to grow on dead logs. The English name of the species is derived from its coloured patterns, which look similar to the tail of a turkey. Turkey tail is probably the most -studied medicinal mushroom and its extracts are commonly used in Japan as part of official cancer treatment protocols. Two polysaccharide extracts from turkey tail \u2014polysaccharide K (PSK) and polysaccharide - peptide (PSP) were approved as drugs in cancer patients. In 1990, PSK accounted for 25% of drugs in cancer treatment in Japan. (Hifasde terra ,2020)70 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition uses: Cancer Anti-proliferative, -metastatic and anti -angiogenic properties. It can induce apoptosis of cancer cells. The anti -cancer properties are due to the action of PSK and PSP. Improves survival in some cancer cases when combined with conventional therapies and minimises side effects. It protects against mutations caused by radiotherapy. It is especially indicated in hormonally -driven cancers such as breast, prostate and ovarian, although it has also been used in a number of other cancer types such as oesophageal, gastric, lung, hepatic and colorectal. (Wang et al. 2012)71 Therapeutic uses: Immune the activity of macrophages, T -lymphocytes and NK cells. Has an anti -viral action against viruses such as HIV, EBV, HPV and the hepatitis B virus. Normalises an overactive immune system, which is especially useful in autoimmunity . Studies have shown that whilst it can upregulate the immune response in immunocompromised individuals, it has no effect in those considered 'healthy'. Turkey tail dosage range: 1-9 g / day. Turkey tail side effects : Nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhoea. 72 \u00a9 CNM: Nutrition Year 1: Orthomolecular Compounds. KP/BQ.Case Example Kelly, 30 -years old, presents with ulcerative colitis which was diagnosed two years ago.
