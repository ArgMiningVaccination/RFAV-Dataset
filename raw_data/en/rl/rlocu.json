Uses Side Effects Risks Interactions Dosage Frequently Asked Questions What Is Burdock? Burdock is a plant in the Asteraceae family. It's used in traditional Chinese medicine as a diuretic and fever reducer. Burdock has anti-inflammatory effects and may benefit conditions like coughs, colds, gout, or hepatitis. It has also been used as a homeopathic treatment for skin conditions like acne or eczema and detoxification. Usually, the root is made into a tea, but burdock fruit and seeds may also be used medicinally. This article discusses the possible uses of burdock, along with some precautions and interactions to keep in mind if you decide to try it. Dietary supplements are not regulated like drugs in the United States, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve them for safety and effectiveness before products are marketed. Choose a supplement tested by a trusted third party, such as the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab.com, or NSF.org, when possible.However, even if supplements are third-party tested, they are not necessarily safe for all or effective in general. Therefore, talk to your healthcare provider about any supplements you plan to take and ask about potential interactions with other supplements or medications. Supplement Facts Active States)Suggested Dose: Dosage may vary based on condition. 1.5 grams of tea three times a day has been studied for diverticulitis.Safety Considerations: Not recommended during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or for children due to a lack of safety data. Burdock may also interact with prescription medications for diabetes and cancer. What Are Burdock's Uses? Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease. Despite many traditional uses, few scientific studies have explored burdock's health effects in humans. Much burdock research has been done on animals. Here's a rundown of what is known about burdock's potential uses. High Cholesterol A small study of older females found that burdock helped lower cholesterol levels when taken before performing water aerobics. The following cholesterol levels decreased after starting burdock or burdock plus exercise: Total cholesterol Triglycerides High-density lipoprotein Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol It's unclear how much of an effect adding burdock had vs. exercise alone, so more research is needed. Acne One small study that used a homeopathic preparation of burdock found improvements in the number and types of pimples and quality of life scores. This was an observational study, meaning there was no control group to compare results. Because only 32 people were in the study, results may not be generalized to a larger population. Diverticulitis A clinical trial investigated the effects of burdock on the recurrence (happening repeatedly) of acute diverticulitis (inflamed pouches in the intestines). People with recent cases of acute diverticulitis who drank burdock tea three times a day were less likely to develop diverticulitis again than those who didn't. Ten percent of burdock tea drinkers had a recurrence of diverticulitis within five years vs. 31% of people who did not use burdock. The people who drank burdock tea also had a longer time between bouts of diverticulitis. This study only enrolled 70 people, so larger studies are needed. Knee Osteoarthritis According to a clinical trial, burdock root tea lowered the following inflammatory markers in patients with knee osteoarthritis: Interleukin-6 C-reactive protein Burdock may also decrease oxidative stress, which can cause damage to the body. But because this was a small study of only 36 people, more data is needed to determine burdock's role in osteoarthritis. Cancer While some preliminary animal studies suggest burdock may benefit people with cancer, there is very little human data. One small safety study has been conducted on 15 people with advanced pancreatic cancer who had failed therapy with a prescription medicine called gemcitabine. The study determined that 4 grams a day of an extract from burdock fruit was an optimal dose in terms of safety. However, more robust trials are needed to determine if it is effective. Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is characterized by: High blood pressure High blood sugar and cholesterol levels Increased abdominal fat A small study of older females with metabolic syndrome found that burdock root tea increased levels of the following: Estradiol DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) These hormonal changes could improve body composition. Again, due to the study's small size, more research is certainly warranted. Additional Uses In addition to the above uses, burdock has been researched in animals or test tube studies for the following conditions: Ulcerative colitis Type 2 diabetes Obesity Alzheimer's disease Viruses like flu and adenovirus Keep in mind that these studies are only preliminary. Even promising research in animals is no substitute for human trials. Burdock may or may not have benefits for any of the above uses. Verywell / Anastasia Tretiak What Are Burdock's Side Effects? Even though it's a natural product, consuming an herb like burdock may have potential side effects. These side effects may be mild or severe. Mild Side Effects Burdock is generally regarded as safe for healthy adults. However, the following mild side effects have been reported: Contact dermatitis (a skin rash) Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) Increased levels of bilirubin, which can cause jaundice (yellowing of the skin) Severe Side Effects Serious burdock side effects seem rare and are mostly limited to case reports. One case report from Japan reported that a male developed shortness of breath and hives after eating burdock root. A female who drank a detox tea containing burdock root and other herbal ingredients for one month developed acute liver injury and stomach pain. It's unknown which ingredient was responsible for the liver damage. However, it's essential to be mindful that herbal supplements do not have to be proven safe in the United States. And there's a risk of adverse reactions when they're used. Consult a healthcare provider or pharmacist if you experience side effects while taking burdock. Should you experience difficulty breathing, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. What Are the Risks of Taking Burdock? Do keep the following precautions in mind when using burdock: Severe allergic reaction: Avoid burdock if you have a known allergy to it or its ingredients. Ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for a complete list of the ingredients if you're unsure. Discontinue use and see your healthcare provider if you suspect an allergic reaction.Pregnancy: Due to a lack of safety data in this population, burdock is not recommended during pregnancy.Breastfeeding: Due to a lack of safety data in this population, burdock is not recommended during breastfeeding.Children: Due to a lack of safety data in this population, burdock is not recommended for children. Interactions Burdock may interact with some medications, such as: Blood sugar-lowering medicines: Burdock lowers blood sugar and the need for insulin in animal models. While data is limited, people who use blood sugar-lowering medicines for diabetes or other conditions should discuss using burdock with a healthcare provider before taking it. The combination may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Diuretics (water pills): Burdock is a natural diuretic that can increase urine output. Taking burdock with other diuretics, such as Lasix (furosemide), may cause dehydration. Cancer medicines cisplatin, quercetin, and tamoxifen: Arctigenin, a part of burdock, may enhance the effects of these medicines. Dosage Always speak with a healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs. There is limited clinical evidence to guide burdock dosing. The following doses have been studied in clinical trials: 1.5 grams of burdock tea three times a day for diverticulitis2 grams of burdock root tea three times a day for knee osteoarthritis4 grams of burdock fruit extract daily for pancreatic cancer Summary Despite a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine, there's limited evidence that burdock is beneficial. There have been small studies in humans for conditions like: DiverticulitisHigh cholesterolOsteoarthritis However, there's not enough data to recommend burdock for these or any other uses yet. If you decide to try burdock, remember that it may interact with other medications, including some used for the following conditions: DiabetesCancerBlood pressure Also, the safety of burdock during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and in children has not been established. Supplements usually haven't been tested for safety, and dietary supplements are largely unregulated in the United States. In some cases, the product may deliver doses that differ from the specified amount for each herb or may be contaminated with other substances, such as metals. It's a good idea to keep an open line of communication with your healthcare providers about the supplements you take. This will help optimize your health goals and minimize things like interactions. Frequently Asked Questions What is burdock good for? Burdock has traditionally been used for detox and inflammation, but research on its effects in humans is lacking. It's possible that burdock could benefit conditions such as high cholesterol, acne, diverticulitis, knee osteoarthritis, or cancer. However, more data is needed before it can be recommended. Who should not drink burdock root? Burdock root tea is not recommended for children or during pregnancy or breastfeeding because there is not enough safety data. What does burdock root do to hormones? One small study in older females with metabolic syndrome found that burdock root increased the levels of several hormones, including sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estradiol, and DHEA-S. More data is needed to confirm this effect. 15 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
