Each person's constitution is controlled by one or two of the three doshas. Doshas are not only the determinants of our constitutions but also of the type of disease to which we will succumb and they also determine the features that make us unique. The co-ordinated balance of these three systems is essential for health. - The Healer Within & The Restoration of Harmony: Neither Ayurvedic Medicine nor Aromatherapy consider the primary cause of disease to result from an onslaught of germs that invade the body. Both disciplines advocate and prefer to create an environment where the 'germs' cannot happily habituate. - The Power of the Wind, Fire & Cohesion: Classical Ayurvedic texts describe man as standing on the earth and being subjected to the wind, sun and the moon. - Five Basic 'Building Blocks: Earth, Water, Fire, Air & Ether: Ayurveda believes that everything in the Universe is made of 5 elements or building blocks. Their properties are important in understanding balance and imbalance in the human body. - Body-analysis using Ayurvedic Principles of Prakriti finding 'Body-Types': 'Vata', 'Pitta', 'Kapha': Each individual is born with a pre-determined basic pattern and the Tridoshas and character-type are part of this pattern. The balance is finely tuned and the equilibrium is easily disturbed. The imbalanced or overbalanced condition of these systems, in any part of the body, causes ill-health which manifests as the symptoms of disease. - Introduction to Pulse-Reading to determine health: The Ayurvedic Practitioners of India do not diagnose disease or imbalance 'from a void'. They are fully aware of the inter-cellular level of communications within the body. At the tissue-level, inter-cellular messages are communicated to the heart, via the blood-stream, in a comprehensive and precise, bio-chemical language. - Aromatherapy, & Ayurveda Compatibilities: Dr Badmajieff, the last of a line of Doctors who were both Lamas and Occidental Practitioners and lived strictly according to Lamic principles, died in 1923 at the age of 123 having said: \"If it is possible to influence an individual from outside to the point of modifying his behaviour, it must be done by means of aromatic substances - and through the skin\". - Ayurvedic Essential - Common Essential Oils for the different Doshas - Carrier Oils & Herbal Medicated Oils - Plants, Tastes & Diet: Ayurveda prescribes six different flavours for the daily diet - the commonly acknowledged sweet, sour, salty and bitter tastes and two additional ones - pungent and astringent. In general, a well-chosen, balanced diet containing all six tastes is recommended. - Teas for the different Doshas - Ayurvedic Hand Massage: including Ubtans, Scrubs, Masks - Garshan: Silk Glove Massage: traditional Ayurvedic dry massage with a special silk glove that can be done as an alternative to an oil massage.
