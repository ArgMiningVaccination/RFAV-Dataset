[Certificate Program information:](/graduate-studies/kumc/#certificatestext) No student may work toward a graduate certificate without being accepted as a graduate certificate student in a specific graduate certificate program. Graduate certificates are not granted retroactively. An individual who is not currently a degree-seeking graduate student at KU must apply and may be admitted directly to a graduate certificate program. The graduate certificate program is not a means of entry into a graduate degree program. If students admitted to a graduate certificate program are later admitted to a graduate degree program as degree-seeking, applicable courses taken for the graduate certificate program may, upon recommendation of the department and within general guidelines, be approved by the Office of Graduate Studies to be counted toward the degree. While the courses comprising a graduate certificate may be used as evidence in support of a student's application for admission to a graduate degree program, the certificate itself is not considered to be a prerequisite and does not guarantee admission into any graduate degree program. The certificate program is not intended to serve as a default system for students in a degree program who find that they are not able to complete the degree for academic or other reasons. Should a student drop out of a degree program and seek admission to a certificate program, all certificate admission requirements must be followed for admission and conferral.
